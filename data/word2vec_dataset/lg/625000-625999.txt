 2 use in diving at higher @-@ than @-@ sea @-@ level pressures is usually limited to rebreather , decompression , or emergency treatment use at relatively shallow depths ( ~ 6 meters depth , or less ) . Deeper diving requires significant dilution of O 
 2 with other gases , such as nitrogen or helium , to prevent oxygen toxicity . 
 People who climb mountains or fly in non @-@ pressurized fixed @-@ wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental O 
 2 supplies . Pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of O 
 2 automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization . Sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat , causing oxygen masks to drop . Pulling on the masks " to start the flow of oxygen " as cabin safety instructions dictate , forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister . A steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction . 
 Oxygen , as a supposed mild euphoric , has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports . Oxygen bars are establishments found in Japan , California , and Las Vegas , Nevada since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal O 
 2 exposure for a fee . Professional athletes , especially in American football , sometimes go off @-@ field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance . The pharmacological effect is doubted ; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation . Available studies support a performance boost from enriched O 
 2 mixtures only if it is breathed during aerobic exercise . 
 Other recreational uses that do not involve breathing include pyrotechnic applications , such as George Goble 's five @-@ second ignition of barbecue grills .

 Smelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55 % of commercially produced oxygen . In this process , O 
 2 is injected through a high @-@ pressure lance into molten iron , which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides , SO 
 2 and CO 
 2 . The reactions are exothermic , so the temperature increases to 1 @,@ 700 ° C. 
 Another 25 % of commercially produced oxygen is used by the chemical industry . Ethylene is reacted with O 
 2 to create ethylene oxide , which , in turn , is converted into ethylene glycol ; the primary feeder material used to manufacture a host of products , including antifreeze and polyester polymers ( the precursors of many plastics and fabrics ) . 
 Most of the remaining 20 % of commercially produced oxygen is used in medical applications , metal cutting and welding , as an oxidizer in rocket fuel , and in water treatment . Oxygen is used in oxyacetylene welding burning acetylene with O 
 2 to produce a very hot flame . In this process , metal up to 60 cm ( 24 in ) thick is first heated with a small oxy @-@ acetylene flame and then quickly cut by a large stream of O 
 2 .

 The oxidation state of oxygen is − 2 in almost all known compounds of oxygen . The oxidation state − 1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides . Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon : − 1 / 2 ( superoxides ) , − 1 / 3 ( ozonides ) , 0 ( elemental , <unk> acid ) , + 1 / 2 ( dioxygenyl ) , + 1 ( dioxygen difluoride ) , and + 2 ( oxygen difluoride ) .

 Water ( H 
 2O ) is an oxide of hydrogen and the most familiar oxygen compound . Hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction ( about 23 @.@ 3 kJ · mol − 1 per hydrogen atom ) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule . These hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15 % closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der Waals forces . 
 Due to its electronegativity , oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides . The surface of most metals , such as aluminium and titanium , are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that <unk> the metal and slows further corrosion . Many oxides of the transition metals are non @-@ stoichiometric compounds , with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show . For example , the mineral FeO ( <unk> ) is written as Fe 
 1 − <unk> , where x is usually around 0 @.@ 05 . 
 Oxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide ( CO 
 2 ) . The Earth 's crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon ( silica SiO 
 2 , as found in granite and quartz ) , aluminium ( aluminium oxide Al 
 2O 
 3 , in bauxite and corundum ) , iron ( iron ( III ) oxide Fe 
 2O 
 3 , in hematite and rust ) , and calcium carbonate ( in limestone ) . The rest of the Earth 's crust is also made of oxygen compounds , in particular various complex silicates ( in silicate minerals ) . The Earth 's mantle , of much larger mass than the crust , is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron . 
 Water @-@ soluble silicates in the form of Na 
 <unk>

 2O

 Oxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals , forming transition metal dioxygen complexes , which feature metal – O 
 2 . This class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin . An exotic and unusual reaction occurs with <unk> 
 6 , which oxidizes oxygen to give O2 + PtF6 − .

 Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are ( where " R " is an organic group ) : alcohols ( R @-@ OH ) ; ethers ( R @-@ O @-@ R ) ; ketones ( R @-@ CO @-@ R ) ; aldehydes ( R @-@ CO @-@ H ) ; carboxylic acids ( R @-@ COOH ) ; esters ( R @-@ COO @-@ R ) ; acid anhydrides ( R @-@ CO @-@ O @-@ CO @-@ R ) ; and amides ( R @-@ C ( O ) <unk> 
 2 ) . There are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen , including : acetone , methanol , ethanol , <unk> , furan , THF , diethyl ether , <unk> , ethyl acetate , <unk> , DMSO , acetic acid , and formic acid . <unk> ( ( CH 
 3 ) 
 2CO ) and phenol ( C 
 6H 
 <unk> ) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances . Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are : glycerol , formaldehyde , <unk> , citric acid , acetic anhydride , and acetamide . <unk> are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms . 
 Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation . Most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of O 
 2 . Organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and <unk> acid . 
 The element is found in almost all biomolecules that are important to ( or generated by ) life . Only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen . Of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen . All fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen ( due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues ) . Oxygen also occurs in phosphate ( PO3 − 
 4 ) groups in the biologically important energy @-@ carrying molecules ATP and ADP , in the backbone and the purines ( except adenine ) and pyrimidines of RNA and DNA , and in bones as calcium phosphate and <unk> . 
 = = Safety and precautions = = 
 The NFPA 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as <unk> to health , nonflammable and nonreactive , but an oxidizer . Refrigerated liquid oxygen ( LOX ) is given a health hazard rating of 3 ( for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors , and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite ) , and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form . 
 = = = Toxicity = = = 
 Oxygen gas ( O 
 2 ) can be toxic at elevated partial pressures , leading to convulsions and other health problems . Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals ( kPa ) , equal to about 50 % oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2 @.@ 5 times the normal sea @-@ level O 
 2 partial pressure of about 21 kPa . This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators , since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30 % – 50 % O 
 2 by volume ( about 30 kPa at standard pressure ) . ( although this figure also is subject to wide variation , depending on type of mask ) . 
 At one time , premature babies were placed in incubators containing O 
 2 @-@ rich air , but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high . 
 Breathing pure O 
 2 in space applications , such as in some modern space suits , or in early spacecraft such as Apollo , causes no damage due to the low total pressures used . In the case of spacesuits , the O 
 2 partial pressure in the breathing gas is , in general , about 30 kPa ( 1 @.@ 4 times normal ) , and the resulting O 
 2 partial pressure in the astronaut 's arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea @-@ level O 
 2 partial pressure ( for more information on this , see space suit and arterial blood gas ) . 
 Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving . Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O 
 2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis . Exposure to a O 
 2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa ( about 1 @.@ 6 atm ) may lead to convulsions ( normally fatal for divers ) . Acute oxygen toxicity ( causing seizures , its most feared effect for divers ) can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 % O 
 2 at 66 m ( 217 ft ) or more of depth ; the same thing can occur by breathing 100 % O 
 2 at only 6 m ( 20 ft ) . 
 = = = Combustion and other hazards = = = 
 Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion . Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity ; an ignition event , such as heat or a spark , is needed to trigger combustion . Oxygen is the oxidant , not the fuel , but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion . Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential , such as peroxides , <unk> , nitrates , perchlorates , and <unk> because they can donate oxygen to a fire . 
 Concentrated O 
 2 will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically . Steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel ; and therefore the design and manufacture of O 
 2 systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized . The fire that killed the Apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure O 
 2 but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure , instead of the 1 ⁄ 3 normal pressure that would be used in a mission . 
 Liquid oxygen spills , if allowed to soak into organic matter , such as wood , petrochemicals , and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact . As with other cryogenic liquids , on contact with the human body it can cause <unk> to the skin and the eyes .

 Gagak Item ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Vernacular Malay for Black Raven , also known by the Dutch title De Zwarte <unk> ) is a 1939 bandit film from the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) directed by Joshua and Othniel Wong for Tan 's Film . Starring Rd Mochtar , Roekiah , and Eddy T. Effendi , it follows a masked man known only as " Gagak Item " ( " Black Raven " ) . The black @-@ and @-@ white film , which featured the cast and crew from the 1937 hit Terang Boelan ( Full Moon ) , was a commercial success and received positive reviews upon release . It is likely lost . 
 = = Production = = 
 Gagak Item was directed by brothers Joshua and Othniel Wong ; filming the work in black @-@ and @-@ white , they also handled sound editing . It was produced by Tan Khoen Yauw of Tan 's Film and starred Rd Mochtar , Roekiah , Eddy T. Effendi , and Kartolo . The Wongs and cast had first worked together on Albert Balink 's 1937 blockbuster Terang Boelan ( Full Moon ) , before joining Tan 's Film in 1938 for the highly successful Fatima ; Gagak Item was their second production with the company , which hoped to mirror Terang Boelan 's success . Through these prior films Mochtar and Roekiah had become an established screen couple . 
 Saeroen , a journalist @-@ turned @-@ screenwriter for Terang Boelan and Fatima , returned to write the script to Gagak Item . The film , a love story , followed a girl and a masked man known as " Gagak Item " ( " Black Raven " ) and was set in rural Buitenzorg ( now Bogor ) . The titular bandit was similar to Zorro , a character popular in the Indies at the time ; such figures had been a staple of travelling theatre troupes beginning in the early 1930s . When writing the script Saeroen continued the formula he had used in Terang Boelan , including action , music , beautiful vistas and physical comedy . The film had six songs performed by Hugo Dumas ' musical troupe Lief Java ; the troupe was known for its keroncong performances , mixing traditional music with Portuguese influences . Gagak Item featured vocals by kroncong singer Annie Landouw . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Gagak Item was released in late 1939 and was screened in Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , the capital of the Indies ; Medan , North Sumatra ; and Surabaya , eastern Java . Some screenings of the film , also advertised under the Dutch title De Zwarte <unk> , had Dutch @-@ language subtitles . A novelisation of the film , published by the Yogyakarta @-@ based Kolff @-@ Buning , soon followed . Gagak Item was one of four domestic productions released in 1939 ; the film industry had undergone a significant downturn following the onset of the Great Depression , during which time cinemas mainly showed Hollywood productions , and had only begun recovering following the release of Terang Boelan . 
 Gagak Item was a commercial and critical success , although not as much as Tan 's earlier production . An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised the film , especially its music . The reviewer opined that the film would be a great success and that the film industry in the Indies was showing promising developments . Another review in the same paper found that , although " one may shake one 's head over the cultural value of indigenous films " , the film was a step forward for the industry . The review praised Roekiah 's " demure " acting . 
 Following the success of Gagak Item the Wongs , Saeroen , Roekiah , and Mochtar continued to work with Tan 's Film . Their next production , Siti Akbari ( 1940 ) , was similarly successful , although again not as profitable as Terang Boelan or Fatima . Saeroen , Joshua Wong , and Mochtar left the company in 1940 : Wong and Mochtar after payment disputes , and Saeroen to return to journalism . Through 1941 Tan 's Film produced fewer movies than its competitors , and was ultimately shut down following the Japanese occupation in early 1942 . 
 Gagak Item was screened as late as January 1951 . The film is likely lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , JB Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 Frederik Reesen Magle ( Danish pronunciation : [ <unk> ̊ <unk> ̝ ʊ ̯ lə ] ; born 17 April 1977 ) is a Danish composer , concert organist , and pianist . He writes contemporary classical music as well as fusion of classical music and other genres . His compositions include orchestral works , cantatas , chamber music , and solo works ( mainly for organ ) , including several compositions commissioned by the Danish Royal Family . Magle has gained a reputation as an organ virtuoso , and as a composer and performing artist who does not refrain from venturing into more experimental projects – often with improvisation – bordering jazz , electronica , and other non @-@ classical genres . 
 His best @-@ known works include his concerto for organ and orchestra The Infinite Second , his brass quintet piece Lys på din vej ( Light on your path ) , composed for the christening of Prince Nikolai , The Hope for brass band and choir , his symphonic suite Cantabile , and a collection of improvisations for organ titled Like a Flame . 
 = = Life = = 
 Frederik Magle was born in <unk> , the son of actress and writer Mimi Heinrich and organist , painter and sculptor Christian Reesen Magle ( 1925 – 96 ) . He is the great @-@ nephew of the composer Emil Reesen ( his grandmother 's brother ) . Recognized early as a child prodigy , he appeared on television and in the news media at the age of 9 . 
 Magle was educated as a private student of Leif <unk> ( composition and music theory ) , and Ib Bindel ( organ ) . He was taught piano , score reading , and music theory from the age of six . At the age of 16 , he was admitted to the Royal Danish Academy of Music , where he was taught music theory by Yngve Jan <unk> , but after one and a half years he decided to leave the music academy , explaining that he " could not both study at the conservatory and work independently as a composer at the same time . " He later stated that the decision " was difficult , and there was a lot to think through , " but that he did not regret it . 
 He received the scholarship of countess Erna Hamilton in 1993 . In 1994 , as an organ soloist , he won the Danish qualification rounds and national final of the Eurovision Young Musicians competition . He was one of eight winners of the 24 national competitions that year to be selected for the European final , held at the Philharmonic Concert Hall in Warsaw , Poland on 14 June 1994 . He performed Francis Poulenc 's Organ Concerto , but was not placed in the top 3 . The Polish organizers originally planned the qualifying round to be held elsewhere , but moved it to the Philharmonic Hall ( which contains a pipe organ ) to accommodate Magle 's participation . 
 Magle 's father died in 1996 , shortly before the first performance of Frederik Magle 's Christmas cantata A newborn child , before eternity , God ! , which is dedicated to him . Magle was awarded the Freemason 's Arts Prize in 2001 . In 2006 he took ownership of the classical music internet forum " Talk Classical " . 
 He has said that he often gets his ideas in dreams and always have a notebook next to him when he sleeps , in case he gets an idea for a " musical phrase or an orchestral build @-@ up " during the night .

 The first public performance of one of Frederik Magle 's compositions took place on Easter morning 7 April 1985 , in <unk> church , where a children 's choir performed an Easter hymn he had composed . Two years later , in 1987 , six of his hymns with texts by his mother Mimi Heinrich were performed by actress and singer Annie Birgit Garde at a concert in Lyngby church , and the same year he played on television for the first time . In 1988 , two of his larger works , the cantata We are afraid , and the " mini @-@ musical " A Christmas Child , were premiered in Grundtvig 's Church in Copenhagen before an audience of 2 @,@ 000 people . He began a collaboration with the violinist Nikolaj <unk> in 1990 , and they performed a series of concerts together . Later , <unk> gave the first performance of Magle 's variations for violin and piano in the Concertgebouw , Amsterdam , with the pianist Daniel <unk> : Journey in time describes a " kind of scenes or musical images " with the use of sharp dissonances , complicated rhythms and dramatic transitions and thematic formations . 
 In 1993 Magle composed music for the experimental theatre performance Der Die Das by the theatrical group Hotel Pro Forma , directed by Kirsten <unk> , which was performed at the 4th international Dance Festival in Munich , Germany . Other artists involved were the architect Thomas Wiesner , sculptors Anders Krüger and Frans Jacobi , painter Tomas <unk> , and the costume designer Annette Meyer ; it was presented as a contemporary " Gesamtkunstwerk " comprising architecture , art , music , and performance . 
 Magle 's concerto for organ and orchestra The Infinite Second was given its first performance and recorded in 1994 at the 3rd international music festival in Riga Cathedral , Latvia by the Latvian Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra , conducted by <unk> <unk> , with Frederik Magle himself as organ soloist . The reviewer of Berlingske Tidende , Steen Chr . <unk> , described the organ concerto as " a long process from darkness to light " tonally " founded in the French school of organ music " . It was released on CD in 1996 along with his second symphony for organ Let there be light which had been premiered in Riga Cathedral in 1993 . The culture journalist Jakob <unk> wrote of Magle 's method of structuring the two works : 
 ... while his music appears quite conventional in terms of the traditional musical parameters , such as a preference for arch forms and a relatively conservative use of free tonality in terms of melody and harmony , what could be labelled the dramatic characters of his music are very definitely developed from the specific possibilities of the church organ itself . That goes for the often occurring contrast between very bright and very dark timbres , between clearly defined melodic lines and closely woven fields of sound , between huge pillars of chords and energetically moving patterns of rhythm . And it goes for his two dominating ways of structuring his music as well ( ... ) the gradual building of dynamic tensions through adding more and more layers of sound , the abrupt changes between light and dark , force and calm , clear and veiled . Including the courage to extend some of the parameters into the extremes – such as when a rhythmic pattern becomes so dense as to almost blurring the contours of the figurations involved , and only the outline of movement remains ... 
 The Christmas cantata A newborn child , before eternity , God ! was given its first performance in 1996 , commissioned by <unk> 96 – the European Capital of Culture 1996 . In 1997 it was released on CD , in a recording made in <unk> in <unk> by the soloists Ingibjörg <unk> , soprano , Elisabeth Halling , alto , Gert Henning @-@ Jensen , tenor , Christian Christiansen , bass , two mixed choirs , two children 's choirs , brass band , organ and percussion , conducted by Steen Lindholm . The cantata was described by the reviewer of Jyllands @-@ Posten as hard to classify , with a " religiously narrative robustness " . The work sets text from a <unk> by the 6th century <unk> Romanos the Melodist , translated into Danish by the theology professor Christian <unk> , and edited by the priest Kristian <unk> . 
 In 1995 @-@ 96 Magle composed a symphonic Lego Fantasia in three movements for piano and symphony orchestra , commissioned by the Lego Group . It was premiered on 24 August 1997 at a concert in St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by David Parry , with Magle himself on piano . In 1998 the same performers recorded the work for a CD released by the Lego Group . Also in 1998 he was commissioned to write a work for Amnesty International : he composed Flammer for <unk> ( Flames for Freedom ) for solo piano . The piece was printed in a book of the same title containing essays by 24 Danes ( including then prime minister Poul <unk> Rasmussen , former prime minister Poul Schlüter , <unk> <unk> , Ghita Nørby , and others ) . Edited by Monica <unk> , the book was published on the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . On 22 November 1998 Magle 's Cantata to Saint Cecilia for soloists , choir , children 's choir , and chamber orchestra was given its first performance at the Ny Carlsberg <unk> in Copenhagen . The following year it was recorded and released on the album <unk> ( Music for Saint Cecilia ) by the Danish <unk> ( The Cecilia Choir ) conducted by Gunnar Svensson with the soloists Birgitte <unk> ( soprano ) , Tuva <unk> ( alto ) , and Jørgen <unk> ( bass ) . The cantata 's text is by the author Iben <unk> ; based on the story of Saint Cecilia , who died in a gruesome way for her Christian faith , it has been described as " moderate modernism " with a special " Danish tone " and a transparent chamber musical instrumentation .

 In 2001 his work , The Hope , for brass band , choir , organ and percussion , was given its first performance during the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Copenhagen . The composition was commissioned by the Admiral Danish Fleet in cooperation with the Reformed Church in Copenhagen , where the premiere performance took place on 1 April . The Hope was subsequently recorded and released by the Royal Danish Navy on the album <unk> <unk> God <unk> ( The Royal Danish Navy Wishes Godspeed ) in 2005 . 
 The Danish organ builders Frobenius commissioned a new work by Magle for their centennial jubilee in 2009 . Magle premiered the work , his Rhapsody for organ Viva Voce , at two gala concerts on 12 – 14 May 2009 in Aarhus Cathedral and <unk> church , in collaboration with Dame Gillian Weir . 
 In October that same year , a new pipe organ was inaugurated in <unk> church . Magle created its specifications and tonal design , after the old organ had perished in a fire five years earlier while in storage ; he gave the instrument 's inauguration concert on 8 November . In 2010 he released a double album of free improvisations on the <unk> @-@ organ , Like a Flame . Reviews of the album were predominantly favorable , described in <unk> International as " highly creative , sometimes visionary , [ and ] surprisingly <unk> " , but a scathing review in the Danish organ magazine <unk> argued for traditional fugal and choral forms instead of free improvisation . One critic complained about the length of the album , finding it too long at more than two hours . The organist , jazz @-@ pianist , and composer Henrik Sørensen defended Magle 's free improvisational form in an article in Danish organ @-@ magazine <unk> . 
 In 2011 Magle composed an <unk> ( All Hallows Mass ) , intended to be performed at the All Hallows service on the first Sunday of November , where people are invited to remember relatives who have died in the past year . Its text is by the hymn @-@ writer Iben <unk> and the pastor Morten <unk> . Funded by the Danish Ministry Ecclesiastical Affairs , the Mass was made freely available online . After a performance in St Nicolas ' Church , Rønne , a music critic described the music as " intimate " and with " finish " .

 Magle played the organ at the christening of Prince Nikolai at Fredensborg Castle in 1999 and gave the first performance of his composition Lys på din vej ( Light on your path ) for organ and brass quintet , with the Brass Ensemble of the Royal Danish Guards , as postlude . Lys på din vej was released on an album with the same title the following year , which received mixed reviews , being criticized especially by the newspaper Politiken for consisting of " endless repetitions of the same melodic material without development " . The piece was re @-@ recorded in 2013 by the Brass Ensemble of the Royal Danish Guards in a new version on their album Nordisk Musik ( Nordic Music ) . At the christening of Prince Felix in <unk> church in 2002 another work by Frederik Magle was also premiered as postlude . 
 Magle composed a symphonic suite Cantabile , based on poems by Prince Henrik of Denmark ( the Prince Consort ) of which the first movement " <unk> le vent " was first performed in 2004 , and the remaining two movements " Cortège & Danse Macabre " and " Carillon " , in June 2009 in the Koncerthuset ( Copenhagen ) , on both occasions by the Danish National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Thomas <unk> .

 Magle 's first CD , <unk> er et eventyr – <unk> over H.C. <unk> eventyr ( The song is a fairytale – Songs based on fairytales by Hans Christian Andersen ) , of 1994 was recorded with the jazz double bassist Niels @-@ Henning Ørsted Pedersen , the jazz @-@ pianist Niels Lan <unk> , the percussionist Alex Riel , Trio Rococo , and vocalist Thomas <unk> . He also participated on the 2005 avant garde album Hymn to Sophia by the jazz saxophonist John Tchicai , where he improvised on pipe organ with Tchicai and the percussionist Peter Ole Jørgensen . 
 In 2011 Magle composed symphonic music for the album Elektra by the Danish hip hop group Suspekt . Emil Simonsen from Suspekt characterised Magle 's contribution as " essential for the development of the new album " , and described Frederik Magle as " one of the greatest musical sources of inspiration " the group had worked with . The collaboration received positive reviews in the Danish press , with Jyllands @-@ Posten calling the track " <unk> Pas " from Elektra " glowing orchestral hip hop with mature ambitions " , and the music magazine Gaffa describing the contrasts between Frederik Magle 's classical compositions and Suspekt 's hip hop as " extreme opposites that helped to make the evening special " in their review of the release concert in Koncerthuset , September 2011 . The orchestral music was recorded by the Czech Film Orchestra in the <unk> Concert Hall , Prague . 
 Magle 's fusion @-@ work Polyphony , which combines rock music with contemporary classical music , was published in the Australian music textbook In Tune With Music , written by Ian <unk> and Bernice Allan in 2013 .

 = New York State Route 12D = 
 New York State Route 12D ( NY 12D ) is a north – south state highway located in the northern part of New York in the United States . The southern terminus of the route is in the Oneida County village of Boonville , where it intersects NY 12 . The northern terminus is at a junction with NY 12 in the Lewis County village of Lyons Falls . NY 46 and NY 294 are also present in the immediate area of the route 's southern terminus . 
 NY 12D was originally assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to most of what is now NY 12 between Boonville and Lowville . The alignments of both routes between the two locations were swapped c . 1939 , placing NY 12D on its current alignment from Boonville to Potters Corners ( in the Town of West Turin ) and on NY 26 between Potters Corners and Lowville . The overlap between NY 12D and NY 26 remained in place until the 1970s when NY 12D was realigned onto its current routing between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls , replacing then @-@ New York State Route 337 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 12D begins at an intersection with NY 12 at the southeastern edge of the village of Boonville in northern Oneida County . While NY 12 bypasses the village to the east , NY 12D heads northwest into the village on Main Street . At Schuyler Street , NY 12D bears west for one block to Post Street , where it intersects the northern terminus of NY 46 . The eastern terminus of NY 294 is located one block to the south at the junction of Post and Ford Streets . NY 12D , meanwhile , turns north at Post Street and follows the street out of the village and through the town of Boonville to the Lewis County town of Leyden . 
 Within Leyden , NY 12D passes through largely rural terrain with the exception of a pair of roadside communities : the hamlet of <unk> on the Sugar River , a tributary of the nearby Black River , and the community of Locust Grove at the intersection of NY 12D and Locust Grove Road . The route crosses into West Turin roughly 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) later , where it intersects NY 26 at Potters Corners . NY 26 turns north here to follow the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 12D ; however , NY 12D turns northeast onto the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 26 toward Lyons Falls . Near the western edge of the village , NY 12D passes over NY 12 with no access between the two . The connection is made a short distance to the southeast via McAlpine and Cherry Streets , which NY 12D follows to terminate at NY 12 . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 27 , an unsigned legislative route that initially extended from Forestport to Alexandria Bay via Boonville , Lowville , and Watertown . From Boonville to Lowville , Route 27 utilized what is now NY 12D and NY 26 . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the segment of legislative Route 27 between Boonville and Lowville via Potters Corners was designated as part of NY 12 . An alternate route of NY 12 between Potters Corners and Lowville via Lyons Falls was assigned NY 12D as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . By the following year , NY 12D was rerouted south of Lyons Falls to follow a routing similar to modern NY 12 to Boonville . The former routing of NY 12D between Potters Corners and Lyons Falls was redesignated as NY 337 c . 1935 . The routings of NY 12 and NY 12D between Boonville and Lowville were swapped c . 1939 . 
 Originally , NY 12 entered Lyons Falls on Franklin Street and followed Center and McAlpine Streets through the village before leaving the area on Cherry Street . NY 12 was rerouted onto its current alignment around the western edge of Lyons Falls in the late 1940s ; however , NY 337 was not truncated nor rerouted to meet the new path of NY 12 . Instead , NY 337 was initially extended eastward along the former alignment of NY 12 on McAlpine Street to a new terminus at Center Street . It was rerouted east of Cherry Street to follow Cherry south to NY 12 c . 1970 . The former routing of NY 337 along McAlpine Street from Cherry Street to a grade crossing with the Mohawk , Adirondack and Northern Railroad , a distance of 0 @.@ 03 miles ( 48 m ) , is now designated as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . The overlap between NY 12D and NY 26 north of Potters Corners was eliminated c . 1972 when NY 12D was rerouted to follow NY 337 to Lyons Falls , placing NY 12D on its current alignment .

 = Scott Carson = 
 Scott Paul Carson ( born 3 September 1985 ) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Championship club Derby County . 
 Carson joined the Leeds United football academy in 2002 , making his full first @-@ team debut for Leeds against Manchester United in February 2004 . He made his first appearance for the England under @-@ 21 team in the same month and later set a record of 29 caps for the under @-@ 21 side . 
 In January 2005 , he moved to Liverpool for a £ 750 @,@ 000 fee and was called up for the England senior team later that year . He made nine appearances for Liverpool , including the UEFA Champions League quarter @-@ final victory over Juventus in April 2005 , before going on loan to Sheffield Wednesday , Charlton Athletic and Aston Villa in successive seasons to gain experience . 
 Following the 2007 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Championship , Carson made his full debut for the England senior team against Austria in November 2007 . After his return to Liverpool from his loan spell at Aston Villa at the end of the 2007 – 08 season , he joined West Bromwich Albion for a £ 3 @.@ 25 million fee in July 2008 . In 2011 he moved to Bursaspor of Turkey . After two years in Turkey , he moved back to England with Wigan Athletic , where he remained until 2015 when he signed for Derby County .

 Born in Whitehaven , Cumbria , Carson grew up in Cleator Moor , where he attended <unk> School . Although a promising rugby league player as a youth , he instead chose to concentrate on football , playing in goal for his school team from the age of " about 11 or 12 " . He quickly rose through the youth teams at local side Cleator Moor Celtic to play for the men 's team when he was 15 . He joined the Leeds United football academy in July 2002 after impressing former Leeds defender Peter Hampton while playing for non @-@ league Workington in the FA Youth Cup . He spent less than a year in the academy and half a season with the reserves before making his first @-@ team debut in January 2004 , coming on as a late substitute after Paul Robinson was sent off against Middlesbrough . Two weeks later , he made his full debut , starting against Manchester United in a 1 – 1 draw at Old Trafford , and made one further appearance in the 2003 – 04 season against Chelsea in May 2004 . Robinson left Leeds in May 2004 and Leeds signed Scottish international goalkeeper Neil Sullivan two months later to compete with Carson for a first @-@ team place , and to help Carson develop and improve . Carson 's contract was due to expire at the end of the 2004 – 05 season but Leeds were keen to retain him and in December 2004 offered him a new long @-@ term contract . However , he chose to join Liverpool , who paid Leeds a £ 750 @,@ 000 fee for him , in January 2005 . 
 = = = Liverpool = = = 
 Carson joined Liverpool on a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract and was to provide competition for Jerzy Dudek for a first @-@ team place . He made his first team debut for Liverpool in March 2005 in a defeat to Newcastle United , and made three consecutive appearances in April , including the home leg of the UEFA Champions League quarter @-@ final victory over Juventus . He was an unused substitute when Liverpool were victorious in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final and 2005 UEFA Super Cup . 
 = = = = Sheffield Wednesday ( loan ) = = = = 
 Carson made only four appearances in the 2005 – 06 season , all in cup competitions , and in March 2006 , was allowed to move to Sheffield Wednesday on loan . Wednesday sought his services to help solve their goalkeeping crisis , while Carson was looking to gain more first team experience and to challenge for a place in the England 2006 FIFA World Cup squad . He kept five clean sheets in nine games for Wednesday , whose assistant manager Kevin Summerfield hailed his contribution as a key factor in helping the club escape relegation . He returned to Liverpool at the end of the season and in July 2006 , extended his contract with Liverpool until 2011 . 
 = = = = Charlton Athletic ( loan ) = = = = 
 In August 2006 , Carson joined Charlton Athletic on loan for the 2006 – 07 season , after Charlton failed in a bid for Norwich City goalkeeper Robert Green . Carson explained that " Liverpool want me to get some experience and then hopefully I can go back next season and be challenging Pepe [ Reina ] for the number one spot . There were a couple of Championship clubs interested but I need to be playing Premiership football because Robert Green , Ben Foster and Chris Kirkland are going to be playing week in , week out so I need to be performing . " He played in 36 of 38 Premier League games , missing only the two matches against Liverpool due to the terms of his loan deal . Although he was unable to prevent Charlton from being relegated at the end of 2006 – 07 , his outstanding form led him to be named as the Charlton Athletic Player of the Year , the first loan player ever to receive the award .

 Carson returned to Liverpool at the end of the season and in June 2007 , Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez confirmed that he would be part of the first @-@ team squad for the 2007 – 08 season , saying “ He must fight with Pepe Reina now for a starting place . ” Carson remained second choice to Reina , however , and faced further competition following the signing of Charles <unk> in August 2007 ; as a result , Carson was loaned out again , this time to Aston Villa at a cost to Villa of £ 2 million . Benitez said of the deal , " We do not want to sell him , we are very happy with Scott . But he needs to play to keep up his England place . " Aston Villa manager Martin O 'Neill preferred Carson to Thomas Sørensen and Stuart Taylor , and Carson played in all but three of Villa 's 38 league matches , missing the two games against Liverpool as he was ineligible to play , and kept 11 clean sheets during the 2007 – 08 season . He received the first red card of his career when he fouled Carlos Tevez in Villa 's 4 – 1 Premier League defeat to Manchester United .

Carson , who had played for five different clubs since making his debut for Leeds in 2004 , explained that he wanted to get settled at one club , saying " I 've been like a nomad for three or four years . It 'll be good to get some roots and hopefully settle . I can see myself here for four or five years , even longer . " He made his debut in a 1 – 0 defeat to Arsenal in the opening game of the 2008 – 09 Premier League season . Despite relegation to the Championship Carson kept his first team place and after the departure of captain Jonathan Greening he was given the captaincy . West Bromwich Albion won promotion back to the Premier League , finishing second , 12 points clear of third place Nottingham Forest with Carson keeping 15 clean sheets out of 43 games . He had been playing regular football for the Midlands side , but in the 2010 – 11 season , his form seemed to dip and in January 2011 , Carson was briefly dropped to the bench for Welsh goalkeeper Boaz Myhill . After the appointment of Roy Hodgson as West Bromwich Albion head coach , he swiftly found himself back in favour at The Hawthorns .

 Carson was first called up to the England under @-@ 21 squad in October 2003 , a month after his 18th birthday , for the 2004 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Championship qualifier against Turkey . At the time he was yet to make his competitive debut for Leeds United 's first team , and had previously played only four games for England at other levels . He made his under @-@ 21 debut in a 3 – 2 win for England against the Netherlands in February 2004 . He was selected in the squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Championship , and in the third game against Serbia , he earned his 28th under @-@ 21 cap , eclipsing the record held by Gareth Barry and Jamie Carragher . His 29th and final cap came against the hosts , the Netherlands , in the semi @-@ final , which finished level at 1 – 1 after extra @-@ time . In the resultant penalty shoot @-@ out , he saved one of the 16 penalties he faced and also scored one himself , but England lost 13 – 12 . Carson has since been overtaken by James Milner as the England Under @-@ 21 team 's most @-@ capped player . 
 In May 2005 , while still a member of the under @-@ 21 side , Carson was called up to the England senior team squad for the team 's tour of the United States later that month . A year later , he came on as substitute for Robert Green , who had suffered a serious injury , in the England B international friendly against Belarus in May 2006 . The injury to Green , who had been named in the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup , led to Carson , who was on standby , being promoted to the England squad for the tournament , although he did not make any appearances . Carson continued to be selected for the England senior team squad , and in May 2007 , made his second appearance for the England B team in a 3 – 1 win over Albania . Following the 2007 UEFA Under @-@ 21 Championships , he made his full England debut in a friendly against Austria in November 2007 when he kept a clean sheet . A week later , he made his competitive debut in a crucial match against Croatia , which England lost 3 – 2 , resulting in their failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 2008 . Carson was held particularly culpable for the first goal , when Niko Kranjčar 's speculative shot from 30 yards dipped and bounced in front of him , with Carson only succeeding in parrying the ball into the net . England coach Steve McClaren was sacked the next day , as commentators criticised McClaren for selecting an inexperienced goalkeeper for the match . 
 New manager Fabio Capello named Carson in his first England squad for the friendly match against Switzerland in February 2008 , but the goalkeeper did not make the final squad for the match against France the following month due to injury . After failing to make Capello 's squads for the next five internationals , Carson was recalled to the England squad in October 2008 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Belarus . He won his third England cap in November 2008 , in a friendly against Germany in Berlin when he came on for the second half . In doing so he became the first West Bromwich Albion player to play for England for 24 years . He won his fourth cap as a second @-@ half substitute against Sweden on 15 November 2011 .

 = Bam Thwok = 
 " Bam Thwok " is a 2004 download @-@ only single by the American alternative rock band the Pixies . Written and sung by bassist Kim Deal , the song was released exclusively through the iTunes Store on June 15 , 2004 . Upon its release , " Bam Thwok " was a commercial success , debuting at number one on the very first release of the UK Download Chart . The song was the band 's first recording since 1991 's Trompe le Monde . 
 Originally composed for the film Shrek 2 , " Bam Thwok " was not selected for the final soundtrack . The song 's lyrics display a surrealistic and nonsensical nature typical of the band ; Deal 's inspiration was a discarded child 's art book she found on a New York City street . " Bam Thwok " ' s major theme is " showing goodwill to everyone . " 
 = = Background = = 
 Following their 2004 reunion , the Pixies felt that recording a new song would " break the ice " between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993 . As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour , DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2 . The band agreed , and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children . Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while , and since her band The Breeders were then inactive , she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies . 
 The Pixies chose Deal 's riff , as it was a " poppier , more kid @-@ friendly thing , " and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song ; significantly , Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track . Francis ' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two — in the previous two Pixies studio albums , 1990 's Bossanova and 1991 's Trompe le Monde , Francis , the band 's principal songwriter , had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals . This became one of the reasons for the Pixies ' 1993 split . However , the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences : Francis praised " Bam Thwok , " as " a really good song . " despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album . However , Deal eventually left the band in June 2013 , before the release of the band 's next album , Indie Cindy . 
 = = Recording and release = = 
 The band arranged and rehearsed the song in lead guitarist Joey Santiago 's Pro Tools home studio , which he had built for his husband @-@ and @-@ wife band The Martinis . After in the words of Deal , " working it up a bit in Joe 's [ Santiago ] Pro Tools thing , " " Bam Thwok " was recorded in a DreamWorks @-@ funded demo session . The band travelled to Stagg Street Studios , a studio in Los Angeles , California , to record the song with engineer Ben Mumphrey . Francis later said the recording session " was very relaxed , a nice way to break the ice , " and admitted that " it didn 't feel like twelve years had passed . " The song was mixed by Mumphrey at Sound City Studios in late March . 
 " Bam Thwok " was released on the iTunes Store at midnight on June 15 , 2004 . The Pixies chose to release in that fashion as they were not signed to a major record label ; their earlier albums had been released on 4AD and Elektra Records . At the time of " Bam Thwok " ' s release , the Pixies ' management gave no indication as to whether future releases would be limited to the iTunes Music Store . Additionally , DreamWorks rejected the recording and the song never appeared on the Shrek 2 soundtrack . 
 = = Lyrics and melody = = 
 The theme of " Bam Thwok " is , according to Deal , " about loving everyone , showing goodwill to everyone " . The lyrics are typically surreal and offbeat ; Deal 's main inspiration for the song and its title was a discarded art book she found on a New York City street while on tour in the late 1990s . She later described the book : " From the handwriting , you could tell that this book must have belonged to a little kid . This kid had written a short story , a paragraph really , about a party that took place in another universe , about people and monsters that were partying together . That 's what provided the inspiration for the lyrics . " 
 The song is structured around a four @-@ beat guitar melody that incorporates major chords throughout . It begins with full instrumentation , over which Santiago layers a short guitar solo . During the first verse , the guitars and bass " drop down " , and do not re @-@ emerge until the chorus , which is repeated several times . A fifteen @-@ second " carousel @-@ esque " organ solo appears approximately midway through the song . The actual sound clip was performed and recorded by Santiago 's father @-@ in @-@ law " many years ago " while he was a missionary in the Philippines . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Bam Thwok " debuted at number one on an early version of the UK Download Chart , although one report said that the fact that the Pixies were in first place despite releasing the single halfway through the period surveyed and only through iTunes " suggests there could be problems to iron out ... [ unless ] all iTunes owners are big fans of the Pixies . " In a press release from Apple , Pixies manager Ken Goes said : " By distributing our first song in 13 years exclusively on iTunes , we were able to quickly and inexpensively make it available to millions of fans in the US and Europe . One week after its release , we are thrilled at the response from iTunes users that have helped to make " Bam Thwok " a top seller across four countries . " 
 Hannah Harper of BBC Music remarked that the song was " not the greatest thing they 've ever done . " Band members noticed the change in output ; David Lovering , the Pixies ' drummer , commented that " it 's very unlike us . It 's a Pixies song but it 's still unlike a Pixies song " . 
 = Potato Sack = 
 The Potato Sack is the name of an alternate reality game ( ARG ) created by the Valve Corporation and the developers of thirteen independent video games to promote the release of Valve 's title , Portal 2 , in April 2011 . Valve president Gabe Newell envisioned the game as a " Cross Game Design Event " in December 2010 , and allowed the developers a free rein to design the game using Valve 's Portal intellectual property . The game , requiring players to find and solve a number of puzzles hidden within updates of the thirteen games , ultimately led to the opportunity for players to release Portal 2 about 10 hours earlier than its planned release by playing games under the pretense of powering up GLaDOS , the sentient computer antagonist from Portal 2 . The ARG 's theme of potatoes is based on plot elements within Portal 2 , specifically that for part of the game , GLaDOS 's personality module is run off a potato battery . 
 Large numbers of people participated in solving the puzzles within the ARG . Reaction from players and journalists was mixed ; some saw the ARG as a show of strong support and commitment by Valve for independent game development , while others thought the ultimate conclusion was of limited benefit to justify buying the games to begin with .

 = = = The Potato Sack Bundle = = = 
 The ARG began without announcement with the release of the " Potato Sack Bundle " on Steam on April 1 , 2011 , which offered the included games at 75 % off their normal price . The games included in the Potato Sack are listed below with their developer and release year . 
 = = = The first update = = = 
 On the release date of the Potato Sack bundle , players found the games within it had recently received updates . Most provided an immediate cosmetic change by replacing or adding assets that referred to potatoes . When players started looking deeper into these new assets , they discovered a series of glyphs that referred to other games associated with specific letters , as well as nonsense sentences that lead to specific cyphers . Other hints were less direct , using online services such as Twitter and YouTube to embed clues . In the case of Toki Tori , sections of new levels included braille code that referred to latitude and longitude coordinates of Two Tribes ' headquarters . One player , " Jake _ R " , traveled to Two Tribes , where he discovered the glyphs and cyphers posted outside their headquarters . Several of Two Tribes ' developers , upon learning of his presence , began filming him from a barbershop across the street . They would later use this footage of him climbing a pole to find these clues as part of another clue during the second phase . 
 = = = The second update = = = 
 On April 7 , each of the games in the Potato Sack received a second major update . Players found that by completing certain tasks in the game , they would be presented with login screens for the fictional Aperture Science corporation within the Steam interface . Other tasks and clues led to passwords that could be used to log in to these Aperture Science screens . These provided players with compressed archives of pictures that consisted of Portal 2 artwork , including photographs from around Seattle ( where Valve is based ) embedded in their alpha channels . Each archive included a portion of a larger archive that was password @-@ protected ; the password was unveiled using the glyphs , cyphers , and letters from the first update . The larger archive gave further photographs of the Seattle area . When the locations of these points were mapped and connected per the puzzle 's instructions , the map showed the word " prelude " . Furthermore , players that reached and logged into these screens received a potato icon for each accessed screen on their Steam profile . 
 = = = The third update = = = 
 On April 12 , another update for each game was released . These updates were all Portal themed , such as levels based on Aperture Science in The Ball and Killing Floor . Again , players found that by completing specific tasks in the new content , they would be presented with an Aperture Science screen , though this time the screens provided a cryptic audio clue . These clues were found to be two @-@ part clues relating to the previously @-@ identified locations around Seattle . By mapping these points , using locations commonly shared by one clue , players were led to the name of a Steam group that contained a single member by the name of " dinosaur " , a reference to an earlier ARG used for Portal 2 's announcement . Screenshots within this user 's profile gave a QR Code that pointed to a website with a countdown time set to expire on the morning of April 15 , 2011 . Players who discovered these audio clues would be awarded another potato on their Steam profile . A total of 36 possible potatoes were found : 35 within the games and the referenced Steam group , and a 36th earned by obtaining all 35 of the other potatoes . 
 Concurrent with these changes , Portal 2 became available for pre @-@ loading on the Steam client . At this point , several journalists and players suspected that Portal 2 may have been unlocked early at the end of the countdown timer . This correlated with a separate puzzle embedded in messages sent by Newell to a number of gaming sites ; the message suggested the " early release " of material and " thirteen offsite chambers " , seemingly referring to the independent games , as well as a message " 4 / 19 / 2011 7 AM = = 4 / 15 / 2011 9 AM " , again referencing the planned Portal 2 release date and the countdown timer . As April 15 drew near , about nine heavily involved players from the ARG appeared to disengage from the various chat rooms , leaving with the message " There 's a hole in the sky through which I can fly " — a line used in early advertisements for Portal ; when contacted by other players , these individuals remained coy and cryptic about their actions , appearing to have been " infected " by GLaDOS . It was later revealed that these players , contacted by Valve a few days prior , were invited to Valve 's headquarters to be the first to play Portal 2 . 
 = = = GLaDOS @ Home = = = 
 At the end of the countdown timer , the countdown website redirected to a new page on the fictional Aperture Science website , calling itself " GLaDOS @ Home " . <unk> other distributed computing efforts like Folding @ home , the site stated that if players generated enough CPU cycles by playing the thirteen games in the Potato Sack , GLaDOS would be rebooted earlier , effectively suggesting an earlier release of Portal 2 before the originally scheduled time of 7 : 00 AM PDT on April 19 , 2011 . The number of potatoes found would also serve to help to " boost " the effort . Only one game , Killing Floor , saw an update in this phase , where a special chamber in their Portal @-@ themed map would be opened for players to complete for an in @-@ game achievement . The players organized a schedule of games to be played to maximize the rate of progression , and eventually , ended up unlocking Portal 2 on Steam about ten hours before this scheduled time . The approximately 1800 players that had successfully earned all 36 potatoes by the time of Portal 2 's launch were given the Valve complete pack , including Portal 2 , which they could gift to other players . Players who had found at least thirteen potatoes or played each of the Potato Sack games for a minimum amount of time received Portal 2 @-@ themed items within Team Fortress 2 .

 On June 13 , 2012 , the Potato Sack bundle briefly returned to Steam under the name " Potato Sack - June 2012 " . 
 = = Development = = 
 Valve had previously performed an ARG in the week prior to the announcement of Portal 2 , at the start of March 2010 . The ARG was initiated by a new patch to Portal that led to a sequence of puzzles , which were ultimately solved within hours of the patch 's release . 
 The idea of the Potato Sack ARG came from Valve president Gabe Newell sometime around December 2010 . Following on the success of the first ARG , he saw a way to promote both the highly anticipated Portal 2 release along with several independent games through a " Cross Game Design Event " . <unk> Games ' Leo Jaitley believed that Valve targeted developers that had proven track records of working with other developers , and not necessarily for the sales or popularity of the specific games . Valve invited the twenty independent developers to their headquarters on December 16 , though did not explain the rationale for the visit . Only there did Valve explain the promotion , with the ultimate goal being the early release of Portal 2 at the conclusion of the ARG , according to <unk> Games ' CEO Alex Neuse . According to Rob Jagnow of Lazy 8 Studios , Valve assured the developers of an open relationship , stating that they had " No constraints . No <unk> . " and that the project was " built on trust and mutual respect " . Jaitley commented " most studios got involved knowing that there was likely to be some payoff , but without anything upfront or any promises of riches " . 
 To help with the ARG , Valve gave the developers a free rein over the game 's structure , and full access to Portal intellectual property to include within their games . Such assets included further voice work from Ellen McLain , the voice actress for GLaDOS , who recorded additional lines for the developers of the games to taunt the players with . Furthermore , the developers were given the opportunity to play what had existed of Portal 2 to build ideas for the ARG . Valve and the indie developers worked together over the next few days to design the ARG , creating the three phases , the timing between phases to allow for the puzzles to be solved , and the general fiction of the game . The developers decided to design the fiction of the ARG around the return of GLaDOS , who had been apparently destroyed at the end of Portal , leaving clues to her revival in the various games . The potato theme was based on Portal 2 's fiction , in which , during a portion of the game , GLaDOS ' personality is placed into a potato battery . To help promote the ARG , Valve and the developers arranged for the Potato Sack sale as to " make it easier for hard @-@ core fans to participate in every aspect of the ARG " . 
 Between the December meeting and second gathering in March 2011 , prior to the ARG 's launch , there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers . Instead , the independent developers spent time , using a shared wiki provided by Valve , to plan out and coordinate the game . They also had to develop the new content for their games , which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking . Others had to go back to older programming code and re @-@ acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG . Valve 's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort . The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm the plans for the launch of the ARG . 
 The first update was tied with April Fools ' Day , with the addition of potatoes and gibberish sentences being in line with the pranks one normally sees on that day . Throughout the ARG , the players were monitored by the developers through the Internet Relay Chat , forums , and web sites that were being used to coordinate the solving effort . This allowed , for example , Two Tribes to prepare for Jake _ R 's visit , and the integration of a screenshot of the chat log in to one of the puzzles . In another example , another chat room user , following a red herring , visited a physical location near the California studio for Team Meat ; Edmund McMillen was able to arrange to meet the user and give him a signed copy of Super Meat Boy . Monitoring of the players enabled the developers to provide hints and clues for puzzles that players were struggling with as to allow the ARG to progress in a timely manner . While many puzzles of the ARG included cross @-@ game clues — such as finding the password for one of the Aperture Science login screens from another game — Neuse felt they could have increased the cross @-@ game complexity of the puzzles if they had more time to plan it out . The developers were aided by the agility of Valve in its participation . During the second phase , one of the developers asked if Newell would become involved in the ARG . Newell then fed the image with the encrypted message to media outlets . Valve also placed hidden messages in promotional videos for Portal 2 which helped to point the ARG players in specific directions , including calling some of the players out by name . 
 There were points during the ARG that players used unexpected means to solve a puzzle , but the developers and the player community worked around these issues . In some cases , players attempted to download beta versions of the patches to the games , but Valve was able to respond , usually in minutes , to block access to these . Valve also quickly responded to a web site that used Steam credentials to award players the potatoes without having to complete the target achievements ; only about 1 % of the potatoes were earned this way , and Valve later revoked them , though let players earn them again though legitimate means . Other players examined the files and binary code of the patched games to try to find password strings or other identifiers that would normally be seen only while playing the game . In at least one case , where this action served to reveal the solution to the puzzle before it was truly solved , the ARG players discouraged this behavior and apologized to Valve for these actions . When possible , the developers laid red herrings for those that tried to hack the ARG , including the use of Rickrolling . 
 Jagnow commented on several changes the developers would have made in hindsight after the completion of the ARG . One aspect he considered was the weak part of the fiction of the ARG , something he believed they would have integrated more in the game from the start . The release of the Potato Sack on April 1 may have been a bad decision according to Jagnow , as they did not get the press exposure they thought they would in conjunction with the other April Fool 's events occurring that day , with some media outlets hesitant to report on potential pranks for fear of having to retract these later . In the third phase , where certain players were " taken over " by GLaDOS , Jagnow felt they extracted these players from the game too early as they were influential in coordinating the chat rooms and wiki , leaving the remaining players confused . Instead , Jagnow suggested they should have found a way to allow these players to continue participating until near the end . Jagnow considered the push of the crescendo of the ARG , the " appearance " of GLaDOS @ Home , to have been the biggest failing . Originally scheduled for April 16 or 17 , it was pushed to April 15 to allow more players , including international ones , to participate in the effort to release Portal 2 early , and to gain media attention . Instead , the developers found that existing players of the ARG were frustrated with no new puzzles to solves , while new players brought to the site by the media were skeptical and saw the event as " a cheap media ploy to get players to buy the Potato Sack in the hope of an early Portal 2 release " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Overall , the alternate reality game received mixed response from gamers , some praising it as outstanding marketing between Portal 2 and the indie gamers , others considering it a way to force players to buy games they do not want to gain access to Portal 2 earlier . Pete Davison of GamePro considered it a " risky marketing move " that relied on Valve 's long @-@ standing reputation with the community to build on their trust , as well as a " hugely positive sign of support for indie games " from the company . David Ewalt of Forbes considered the tactic a huge benefit for the indie developers , whose games led Steam sales charts in the weeks leading to Portal 2 's release . Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica noted that it was entirely possible to ignore the alternate reality game without any negative effects or losing any potential benefits . Luke Plunkett of Kotaku was more critical , commenting that for most players in North America , having the release only ten hours earlier — occurring overnight for many — would be " business as usual " in that they would not be able to play until the next day ; thus , players that purchased and spent time in the Potato Sack games may have simply wasted their money for something they didn 't want to gain almost nothing back . Leigh Alexander of Gamasutra also criticized the ARG for not providing an idea of the expectation of reward when it was successfully completed , comparing the ten @-@ hour gain to a vignette in the movie A Christmas Story , where the main character after saving up money and waiting weeks for a secret decoder ring to decipher a message from a radio program , finds that the coded message is only an advertising blurb . Alexander suggested that instead , ARGs should give players an idea of the type of reward that may be offered , and then can exceed player 's expectations when it is completed . Retailers in countries where the disc @-@ based version of the game would have lagged a few days behind the Steam release opted to break their street date to avoid losing sales to the digital downloads . 
 Though direct sales from Steam are unknown , the Potato Sack ARG helped to boost sales of the independent games . The whole Potato Sack promotion was the second @-@ highest selling compilation on Steam in the week prior to Portal 2 's release , following Portal 2 itself and ahead of the Potato Sack / Portal 2 bundle . Dylan <unk> , programmer for Audiosurf , noted that during the promotion , more than 6000 people were playing his game at a time , compared to 300 players before the event . <unk> also saw an opportunity to create a new game based upon the ARG @-@ themed addition to Audiosurf . Ichiro Lambe of <unk> Games was also pleased with the sales increased ; while not a windfall , it helped him to continue to live comfortably . Thomas Grip of <unk> Games claimed that the boost of sales for Amnesia within the first two days of the Potato Sack sale completely covered the development costs for the added " Justine " content they had developed for the ARG . John Gibson of <unk> Interactive believed that similar ARGs could be run in the future without the presence of a major title like Portal 2 as long as there is a significant payoff for the players . 
 Journalists noted that many of the user reviews for Portal 2 on Metacritic evoked negative opinion of the game , believed to be tied to the minimal impact on Portal 2 's release time . These users cited complaints about the game being too short ( with some saying it is only four hours long ) , the existence of paid downloadable content at launch for some versions , and supposed evidence that the game on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X were ports of the console version . Journalists have defended Valve in these claims , countering that the game 's length depends on the amount of immersion the player puts into the game , that the downloadable content is only cosmetic additions for the co @-@ op mode , and that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac version do not suggest a simple console port . 
 = Neville Southall = 
 Neville Southall MBE ( born 16 September 1958 ) is a Welsh former international footballer . He has been described as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation and won the FWA Footballer of the Year award in 1985 . 
 He joined Bury from Winsford United for a £ 6 @,@ 000 fee in 1980 , and turned professional in his early 20s after a number of years as a semi @-@ professional and amateur player . During his teenage years he worked as a binman , waiter and hod carrier . He moved on to Everton for £ 150 @,@ 000 in 1981 and established himself as the club 's first @-@ choice goalkeeper by the 1983 – 84 season . He went on to make a club record 578 appearances in the Football League and Premier League ( 750 in all competitions ) ; his honours with the club include a European Cup Winners ' Cup medal in 1985 , a First Division championship medal in 1984 – 85 and 1986 – 87 , an FA Cup winners medal in 1984 and 1995 , and an FA Charity Shield winners medal in 1984 , 1985 , 1986 , and 1995 . He also played in the 1985 and 1989 FA Cup finals , the League Cup final in 1984 , and helped Everton to a second place in the league in 1985 – 86 . After leaving Everton in 1998 , he became Torquay United 's regular goalkeeper for two years . He also made a handful of appearances for numerous other clubs . 
 He played internationally for Wales , winning a record 92 caps between 1982 and 1998 , though he did not feature in any major international competitions . As an individual , he was named on the PFA Team of the Year four consecutive times , and was listed as one of the world 's top ten goalkeepers by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics on four occasions . He is a member of the Gwladys Street 's Hall of Fame . He has been named as one of the 100 ' Greatest Players of the 20th Century ' by World Soccer magazine . In 1995 he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) for his services to football . 
 Since his retirement as a player , Southall has briefly managed Dover Athletic , Hastings United and Margate , and has coached at numerous clubs as well as the Welsh national youth teams . He has also worked extensively with disadvantaged children , and set up his own educational consultancy . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Born and raised in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall , he was the middle child of three boys . Southall played youth football for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts , where he played alongside Joey Jones . He was educated at Ysgol John Bright , though left without any qualifications at age 16 . At age 14 he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered a chance to play for the youth team of Bundesliga outfit Fortuna Düsseldorf , but decided against the move to Germany . The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily , though the near constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot @-@ stopping skills . 
 As a teenager , Southall had unsuccessful trials at Wrexham , Crewe Alexandra and Bolton Wanderers . He aspired to be a postman , and never believed that he would make a living playing football . He then worked as a binman , waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late . He played for Llandudno Town at age 15 , before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on £ 10 a week as a semi @-@ professional the following year . Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall . Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial , but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place . With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club , and Southall left Bangor and went on to accept an offer of £ 3 a week to play for Conwy United . He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20 . The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980 , and Southall was voted the club 's Player of the Year . 
 = = = Bury = = = 
 Southall 's performances attracted the attention of Bury and Wigan Athletic , and he was convinced to sign with Bury after he was personally approached by manager Dave Connor . Bury paid Winsford £ 6 @,@ 000 and would later pay another £ 25 @,@ 000 after he was sold on . However he never played for Connor as he was replaced by Jim <unk> before the start of the 1980 – 81 season ; despite this managerial change he was still seen as the future replacement to club stalwart John Forrest . He received specialist goalkeeping coaching from Wilf McGuinness . He made his first team debut against Wigan Athletic on 20 September , in a 2 – 1 victory . The " Shakers " had an indifferent league campaign in the Fourth Division , though they managed to reach the Third Round of the FA Cup and beat Newcastle United in the League Cup . Southall kept 15 clean sheets after conceding 50 goals in his 44 domestic appearances , and was named as Bury 's Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year . 
 = = = Everton = = = 
 Southall was bought by Everton manager Howard Kendall for £ 150 @,@ 000 in the summer of 1981 . To win a first team place he had to compete with Jim McDonagh ( a Gordon Lee signing who would soon leave the club ) , Jim Arnold ( also a new signing ) , and Martin Hodge ( who was injured throughout his time at Everton ) . He made his debut in a 2 – 1 win over Ipswich Town in October , after Arnold picked up an injury . He returned to the first team in December , and he kept a clean sheet against Aston Villa and remained an ever @-@ present throughout the rest of the 1981 – 82 season . 
 Kendall described Southall as the best goalkeeper in the First Division " outside the big three " of Ray Clemence , Peter Shilton and Joe Corrigan . However he began to suffer from ulcerated toes , which gave him severely swollen feet and caused him pain and discomfort throughout matches . On 6 November 1982 , he conceded five goals in a 5 – 0 defeat to Mersey rivals Liverpool at Goodison Park . Kendall then dropped Southall as part of a shake @-@ up at the club . He spent January and February on loan at John McGrath 's Port Vale , and played nine Fourth Division games . McGrath was impressed and tried to take Southall to Vale Park on a permanent basis , but was rebuffed by Kendall . Back at Everton he played the last four games of the 1982 – 83 season after Arnold picked up an injury . 
 Arnold was the preferred choice in goal at the start of the 1983 – 84 season , before Southall was recalled on 1 October against Notts County . Everton had a poor start to the league campaign , but excelled in cup competitions , reaching the final of both the League Cup and the FA Cup . Southall 's first appearance at Wembley was in the League Cup final against Liverpool , and he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw . The replay was held at Maine Road , and Liverpool won the tie 1 – 0 with a Graeme Souness goal . He was rarely called into action in the 1984 FA Cup Final , and kept a clean sheet as Everton claimed the trophy with a 2 – 0 victory over Watford . 
 Southall kept a clean sheet at Wembley in the 1984 FA Charity Shield , as Everton beat Liverpool 1 – 0 to take home the first silverware of the 1984 – 85 season . They then lost the opening two league games of the season , before losing only three of their next 37 league games to win the First Division title by a 13 @-@ point margin . Over the course of the season they beat Liverpool both at Anfield and at Goodison , and recorded a 5 – 0 win over Manchester United . Southall made one particularly crucial save from a point @-@ blank Mark Falco header in a 2 – 1 win over title chasers Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 3 April ; the Daily Mail 's Jeff Powell described it as " the most astonishing save since Gordon Banks left Pelé dumbfounded in Mexico " . In the European Cup Winners ' Cup , Everton beat UCD ( Ireland ) , Inter Bratislava ( Czechoslovakia ) , Fortuna Sittard ( Netherlands ) , and Bayern Munich ( Germany ) in two @-@ legged encounters , and Southall conceded just the one goal ( from Dieter Hoeneß ) over the course of all eight matches . They then beat Austrian club Rapid Wien 3 – 1 in the final at De Kuip to win the first European title in the club 's history . Three days later Everton played in the 1985 FA Cup Final , but lost 1 – 0 to Manchester United after a Norman Whiteside goal in extra @-@ time . At the end of the season Southall was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year , becoming only the first Everton player , second Welshman and fourth goalkeeper to win the award . 
 Though Everton had won a place in the European Cup , English clubs were banned from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium disaster . Southall remained bitter over this , blaming UEFA for the tragedy and stating that the ban was a convenient way to break up English dominance of European competitions . Limited to domestic competitions , Everton won the FA Charity Shield with a 2 – 0 win over Manchester United ; during the celebrations Southall wore a T @-@ shirt saying " I Love My Wife " as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair . After getting sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October , Kendal criticised Southall in the press by saying he " let the lads down " . Despite this set @-@ back , he agreed to sign a six @-@ year contract in December , which was then the longest contract the club had ever issued . However he twisted his ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play . In his absence , his deputy Bobby Mimms took his place , and Everton lost both the league title and the 1986 FA Cup Final to Liverpool . 
 Sidelined through injury at the start of the 1986 – 87 season , he returned to the first team against Watford in October . He was the club 's Player of the Month in February , and won man of the match awards in wins over Arsenal and Chelsea as Everton claimed another league title . Comparing the two title wins ( 1985 and 1987 ) , Southall said that the latter success was " more rewarding and satisfying " as it had proved to be " more of a struggle " compared to the ease in which the title was won in the former campaign . 
 After Kendall left Merseyside to coach Athletic Bilbao , his assistant Colin Harvey took charge at Goodison ; Southall responded well to the change , as he believed Harvey " understood my obsessive and relentless desire to be the best " . Everton finished fourth in 1987 – 88 , conceding a club record low of 27 goals in 40 league games , and reached the semi @-@ finals of the League Cup . Southall had missed the opening stages of the season after undergoing knee surgery . 
 Harvey had failed to adequately replace some of Everton 's departing star players , and Southall noted how " the mediocrity became habitual " as the club coasted to an eighth @-@ place finish in the 1988 – 89 season . He kept goal in the final of the Full Members Cup ( a largely unsuccessful tournament inspired by the ban on European football ) , as Everton were beaten 4 – 3 by Nottingham Forest . More significantly , he kept goal against Liverpool in the 1989 FA Cup Final after conceding only two goals in the seven games en route to the final . In an emotional match in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in the semi @-@ final encounter with Nottingham Forest , Liverpool won the cup with a 3 – 2 extra @-@ time victory . 
 Everton were leading the division at the start of the 1989 – 90 season , but their title challenge fell away after a televised 6 – 2 defeat to Aston Villa . Southall was later told he needed surgery that would keep him out of action for eight months , but he instead sought out a back specialist who told him he simply had a " bad back " and found that the problem corrected itself . 
 Southall requested a transfer before the start of the 1990 – 91 season . He famously sat down during a " sulking session " against a goalpost at half @-@ time of the season opener whilst his teammates were still in the changing rooms while three goals down to newly promoted Leeds United ( a game eventually lost 3 – 2 ) ; Southall was fined two weeks wages despite denying it was a protest and that he simply did it to clear his head . He then received a phone call from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson , but Southall 's hostile phone manner put Ferguson off the idea of signing him , and Ferguson instead bought Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel . Howard Kendall returned as Everton manager in November , with Colin Harvey being demoted to his assistant , and led the club out of relegation trouble to secure a ninth @-@ place finish . They also reached the final of the Full Members Cup at Wembley , losing 4 – 1 to Crystal Palace , though Southall refused to collect his runners @-@ up medal as he did not value the competition . 
 Everton were a declining force , and finished 12th in the league in 1991 – 92 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup at the Fourth Round . They then finished 13th in the 1992 – 93 season in the newly created Premier League , just four points above the relegation zone . Kendall resigned mid @-@ way through the 1993 – 94 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker – Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football . Walker oversaw a run of bad results and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon , winning 3 – 2 after turning round a 2 – 0 deficit . Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty . 
 Everton picked up four points from their opening 12 league games of the 1994 – 95 season , and Southall received death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park . Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle , who led the club to a 2 – 0 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge – this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall . It was also the second match of seven consecutive games Everton went without conceding a goal – another club record . Southall then conceded just one goal ( a penalty ) in five games en route to the 1995 FA Cup Final against Manchester United . Everton won the game 1 – 0 , with Southall making a double save from Paul Scholes ; the victory left Southall as the most decorated Everton player in the club 's history . 
 In the summer of 1995 Southall was given a testimonial match against Celtic as well as an MBE – during the ceremony the Queen asked Southall " what will you do now that you 're retired ? " . He went on to keep a clean sheet in the 1995 FA Charity Shield , as Everton beat Blackburn Rovers 1 – 0 . He remained an ever @-@ present in the 1995 – 96 season , though Royle then tried to sign Crystal Palace goalkeeper Nigel Martyn . He tried to sell Southall to Wolverhampton Wanderers , but cancelled the deal after becoming concerned over the pre @-@ season form of touted replacement Paul Gerrard , and instead doubled Southall 's wages to £ 6 @,@ 000 a week with a new two @-@ year contract . Despite this , Royle dedicated an entire chapter of his 2005 autobiography to decrying Southall as a " potential weak link " . 
 After a promising start to the 1996 – 97 , Everton were beaten six times in a row after Christmas and Southall resorted to ringing up a phone @-@ in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters . Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support , though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea , who were prepared to double Southall 's wages . Caretaker @-@ manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line @-@ up after Royle 's resignation , and steered the club away from relegation . 
 Howard Kendall returned again to manage Everton for the 1997 – 98 season , and played Southall in the Everton goal for the final time on 29 November , in a 2 – 0 defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur . Thomas Myhre took his place in goal , and Southall rejected a coaching role at the club in order to search for first team football elsewhere . 
 In December 1997 , Southall went to Alvin Martin 's Southend United of the Second Division on loan . He made nine appearances in a brief stay at Roots Hall . He joined Chris Kamara 's First Division Stoke City in February 1998 . Kamara resigned two months later , and caretaker @-@ manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside on his first day in charge to say " I 'll let you manage the reserves , so long as you keep your head down , do whatever I tell you , and I won 't tell everybody you 're a bad influence " . Southall was shocked by Durban 's words , and could not explain his attitude . Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions , and Everton only avoided relegation on the last day of the season . He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer , and later said " one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close " . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Former teammate Ian Snodin invited him to join Football Conference side Doncaster Rovers on a short @-@ term deal at the start of the 1997 – 98 season . He signed with Wes Saunders 's Torquay United of the Third Division in December 1998 . He saved a penalty on his debut at <unk> , in a 2 – 0 win over Hull City , and signed a contract lasting until the end of the 1998 – 99 campaign . He was named as Torquay 's Player of the Year at the end of the season . However , on 29 January 2000 , he picked up a concussion in a 2 – 1 defeat to Chester City at the Deva Stadium , and was substituted . Though he recovered from his injury after the match , he left the club not long afterwards . 
 Southall made a return to the Premier League by signing with Bradford City as a player @-@ coach , helping to coach Aidan Davison , Matt Clarke and Gary Walsh . All three goalkeepers picked up injuries , leaving manager Paul Jewell no choice but to play Southall at Valley Parade on 12 March 2000 , against Leeds United . At the age of 41 years and 178 days he became the fourth oldest player in Premier League history . Leeds won 2 – 1 , and Southall was criticised in the media for being too overweight to play professionally . He left Bradford at the end of the 2000 – 01 season after falling out with new boss Jim Jefferies .

 Wales manager Mike England preferred Dai Davies in goal as Southall began to play first team football at Everton , and Southall only got a run of games once Davies retired . His first cap came against Northern Ireland at the Racecourse Ground , Wrexham on 27 May 1982 in the 1982 British Home Championship , Wales won 3 – 0 . 
 Wales came close to qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to Iceland and Spain . Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park , before recording a surprise 1 – 0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal . A 3 – 0 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park , though a draw would not be enough . The game ended in a 1 – 1 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes 's opener ; Southall got a hand to the penalty , but could not keep it out . However , the result of the game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack at the end of the game and died shortly afterwards . 
 Wales came close to qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 , which would have been the first UEFA European Football Championship in the nation 's history . Going into the final two games of qualifying , Wales led their group . Southall was injured , and so missed the match against Denmark in Copenhagen , which ended in a 1 – 0 defeat with Eddie <unk> in goal . Southall returned to play the final game , a 2 – 0 defeat to Czechoslovakia in Prague which left Wales two points short of group winners Denmark . Manager Mike England was then replaced by Terry Yorath , who also made Southall a virtual ever @-@ present in the Wales goal . 
 In qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup , Wales faced Netherlands , West Germany and Finland . They failed to win a game and finished bottom of the group , though Southall did get the chance to play against some of the world 's best players in Ruud Gullit , Marco van Basten , Frank Rijkaard , Rudi <unk> , Andreas Möller , Andreas <unk> , and Jürgen Klinsmann . 
 In qualifying for UEFA Euro 1992 , Wales were placed in the same group as World Champions Germany , and finished just one points behind the Germans after conceding just six goals in their six games . Wales beat Germany 1 – 0 at the Cardiff Arms Park on 5 June 1991 , and three months later beat Brazil in a friendly by the same scoreline . The game which settled the qualifying group came in Nuremberg on 16 October 1991 , and Wales lost 4 – 1 to the Germans , ending Southall 's Wales record run of 385 minutes without conceding an international goal . 
 Wales were seen to have their best chance in reaching a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup . However a Gheorghe Hagi @-@ inspired Romania defeated Wales 5 – 1 in Bucharest to open the Wales campaign . Victories over the Faroe Islands and Belgium and two draws with the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks put Wales back on track , and a victory over Romania in Cardiff in the last game of the tournament would be enough to secure a place in the World Cup . However Southall allowed a 25 @-@ yard strike from Hagi slip under his body and into the net and was <unk> by Florin <unk> as Wales were beaten 2 – 1 . Once again a death put Welsh footballing hopes into perspective , as Southall attended the funeral of retired postman John Hill , who was killed after being struck by a flare released at the end of the match . 
 Manager Terry Yorath was replaced by John Toshack , who stuck with Southall but resigned after just 48 days after falling out with the Football Association of Wales . Results went badly under new boss Mike Smith , despite a 2 – 0 victory over Albania in the first game of qualifying for UEFA Euro 1996 . An embarrassing 3 – 2 defeat to Moldova was followed by a heavy 5 – 0 loss to Georgia . Two defeats to Bulgaria ended faint hopes of qualification and cost Smith his job . 
 Southall applied for the vacant position , but Bobby Gould was chosen instead , who in turn named Southall and Ian Rush as his assistants . He tried Danny Coyne , Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in friendly games , but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino . A month away from his 39th birthday , he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997 ; the Turks won 6 – 4 . Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals he conceded – his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half . His 92 Welsh caps are a national record , he conceded 126 goals , for an average of 1 @.@ 34 per match . The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until the end of his career that Wales qualified for a major tournament and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984 , therefore the majority of Southall 's caps came in friendlies or qualifying games .

 Southall was renowned for his shot @-@ stopping ability , particularly in dealing with one @-@ on @-@ one situations , quickly coming off his line to intimidate the onrushing forward and relying on his instinctive reactions to save the ball . He would spend hours reading books about boxing and golf to improve his balance and spring , and would focus on improving minor pieces of kit and behaviour , saying that " If I changed 100 things and got 1 % better because of one of them , then it was worth it " .

 Southall was appointed caretaker manager of Wales , alongside Mark Hughes , following the resignation of Bobby Gould after a 4 – 0 defeat against Italy on 5 June 1999 . In his only game in charge Wales lost 2 – 0 to Denmark at Anfield on 9 June 1999 , and Mark Hughes was appointed as manager on a full @-@ time basis . During his time playing for Torquay , he also worked as a goalkeeping coach at Huddersfield Town and Tranmere Rovers . He later became a player @-@ coach at York City , Rhyl , Shrewsbury Town , and Dagenham & Redbridge . 
 He was appointed manager of Football Conference club Dover Athletic in December 2001 . His managing stint at the Kent club was short and he was sacked in March 2002 , after only a few months in charge , after the club 's new owners decided to promote his assistant Clive Walker . He later made cameo appearances as a player at Canvey Island . He also began teaching young people from deprived backgrounds how to coach in a community scheme called Soccer Skills , and later worked in the special education sector . He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with <unk> , in partnership with Brooklands College . 
 He had a spell as Wales under @-@ 19 coach , but quit his post in November 2004 , claiming he was treated with " a total lack of respect " and that the coaching was compromised because " ... as always , it 's about money . " FAW management committee chairman Ken Tucker issued a rebuke , saying : " Nev is making comments on things he knows little about . It is sad when people make comments without any knowledge of the finances of the FAW . " 
 A month after resigning from the national scene , Southall returned to management with Hastings United . However just one year on he was sacked , with the Hastings chairman saying that " there have recently been an increasing number of issues on which Neville and I have disagreed and it had got to the point where our working relationship had broken down , beyond the point of repair , as far as I was concerned " . 
 In November 2008 , Margate manager Terry Yorath appointed Southall as his assistant in the Isthmian League . In September 2009 , he became the caretaker @-@ manager after Yorath resigned as manager .

 = Brigadier General Albert Pike = 
 Brigadier General Albert Pike is a public artwork in Washington , D.C. honoring Albert Pike ( 1809 – 1891 ) , a poet , lawyer , soldier , and influential figure in the Scottish Rite of freemasonry . The memorial is sited near the corner of 3rd and D Streets NW in the Judiciary Square neighborhood . The memorial 's two bronze figures were sculpted by Gaetano Trentanove , an Italian @-@ American artist responsible for another Washington , D.C. sculptural landmark , the Daniel Webster Memorial . The dedication ceremony in 1901 was attended by thousands of Masons who marched in a celebratory parade . 
 The Pike memorial is the only outdoor sculpture in Washington , D.C. honoring a Confederate general . Though Pike is depicted as a Mason , not a soldier , the memorial has often stirred controversy . The memorial is one of 18 Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. , which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . The memorial is owned and maintained by the National Park Service , a federal agency of the Interior Department .

 Albert Pike ( 1809 – 1891 ) was a Massachusetts native who became a schoolteacher and frontiersman before settling in Arkansas . There he began teaching again and continued to write poetry , a lifelong passion . His letters to local newspapers led to a job offer as editor for the Arkansas Advocate , a newspaper in Little Rock affiliated with the Whig Party . Pike later became a successful lawyer specializing in Native American claims against the U.S. government . He served as a captain in the Mexican – American War and resumed his legal practice following the war . In the 1850s , Pike switched his allegiance to the Know Nothing Party due to the Whig Party 's reluctance to embrace slavery and sided with the Confederacy when Southern states seceded from the United States in 1861 . During the Civil War , Pike 's knowledge of Native Americans led to him being commissioned a brigadier general in the Confederate Army . He assembled an Indian cavalry loyal to the Confederacy and led them in battle at Pea Ridge , where his poor leadership and inability to keep the cavalry engaged with the enemy was a contributing factor to the Confederate 's loss . Alleged atrocities committed by his troops include the scalping of captured enemy combatants . A few months after the battle , Pike resigned from the army and resumed practicing law . Following the war , Pike settled in Memphis , Tennessee , where it was rumored he became involved with the Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) , though no definitive evidence proves his relationship with the organization . 
 Around 1870 he moved to Washington , D.C. to practice law and continue serving as Sovereign Grand Commander ( SGC ) of the Washington @-@ based Supreme Council , Southern Jurisdiction ( SCJC ) , one of two jurisdictions in the Scottish Rite . Pike had become a Mason in 1850 and quickly rose up its ranks , becoming the SGC in 1859 . He rewrote and interpreted Masonic rituals and compiled the Southern Jurisdiction 's first philosophical document , Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry , an influential book in the organization . Pike continued serving as SGC until his death in 1891 . Pike once stated " When I am dead , I wish my monument to be builded only in the hearts and memories of my brethren of the Ancient and Accepted Rite " , but a few years after his death , Masons began plans for a monument in the nation 's capital . 
 The SCJC chose Italian @-@ American artist Gaetano Trentanove to sculpt the memorial . Trentanove was an acquaintance of Pike and had recently received praise for his sculpture of Jacques Marquette housed in the National Statuary Hall Collection . While Trentanove was working on the commission , Masons lobbied members of Congress for public land in Washington , D.C. where the monument could be placed . When members of the Grand Army of the Republic ( GAR ) , a fraternal organization of Union veterans , became aware of plans for a public memorial to be erected in Washington , D.C. in honor of a Confederate general , they contacted congressmen and told them it would be a disgrace to the memories of all Union soldiers . Nevertheless , on April 9 , 1898 , members of Congress approved the memorial after Masons assured them it would depict Pike as a civilian , not a soldier . 
 Excavation for the memorial site took place in the summer of 1899 and on July 4 , 1900 , the cornerstone was laid . Prior to the cornerstone ceremony , several members of the SCJC , including Third Assistant Secretary of State Thomas W. <unk> , gathered at the House of the Temple at 433 3rd Street NW ( current site of the Tax Court Building ) , where Pike had lived , to reminisce . The men signed a parchment noting the date and who was in attendance . At the ceremony , the parchment was enclosed in a bottle and placed in an opening of the memorial 's foundation . The total cost of the memorial was $ 15 @,@ 000 , raised by members of the SCJC . Fabrication was carried out by the Washington Granite Monumental Company and the sculptures founded by <unk> Galli . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The dedication ceremony on October 23 , 1901 , was planned to coincide with the centennial anniversary of the SCJC . At 2 P.M. , members of the Grand Lodge of the Masons of the District of Columbia led by Grand Master Harry <unk> marched from the Masonic Temple at 9th and F Streets NW to the House of the Temple where they joined thousands of Masons taking part in the parade . The parade ended at the memorial site , on a triangular lot bordered by 3rd Street , D Street , and Indiana Avenue NW . A large temporary stand for invited guests and ceremony participants was built at the base of the memorial . 
 Following a musical performance by Haley 's Washington Band , grand commanders of the SCJC , the Scottish Rite 's Northern Jurisdiction , and Royal Order of Scotland all released the halyard holding the U.S. flag that covered the memorial . This was followed by loud cheers from the crowd and a prayer given by Masonic chaplain Charles Alvin Smith . Frederick Webber , secretary general of the SCJC , then gave a speech and formally presented the memorial to the American people : 
 I am here to represent the Supreme Council , and in its name to present to the government of the United States this statue . It will long stand as a loving tribute from his brethren of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry . 
 President of the District Commission H. B. F. McFarland accepted the memorial on behalf of the American people : 
 Although Albert Pike was a soldier in the Civil War , this statue will commemorate him rather as a victor in the honorable rivalries of peace . It is well that you thus add to the comparatively small number of statues in the city of Washington which honor the victories of peace rather than of war . 
 After additional music was performed by the band , a benediction was given and the ceremony concluded . Throughout the ceremony , Pike was portrayed as a kind poet , though there were a few references to his service as a Confederate general . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 For many years , members of the United Daughters of the Confederacy would hold ceremonies at the site on Pike 's birthday and Masons would decorate the memorial , though the latter still happens on occasion . The memorial was removed in 1972 during construction of Interstate 395 and reinstalled in September 1977 near its former site . The memorial is one of 18 Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. , which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 20 , 1978 , and the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on March 3 , 1979 . It is also designated a contributing property to the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site , established on September 30 , 1965 . In 1993 , the memorial was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution as part of its Save Outdoor Sculpture ! program and it was deemed " well maintained . " The memorial is owned and maintained by the National Park Service , a federal agency of the Interior Department .

 Pike 's memorial has often stirred controversy throughout its history , beginning with the GAR 's lobbying efforts against its erection to protesters arguing it honors a traitor and alleged racist . Starting in the 1990s , there was renewed interest in removing the statue . In late 1992 , members of the LaRouche movement , including civil rights activist and Lyndon LaRouche 's vice presidential candidate James Bevel , began a series of protests demanding the memorial be removed , citing Pike 's alleged links with the KKK . During one such event , LaRouche supporters draped Pike 's statue with a KKK pointed hat and gown . Bevel stated : " One way or the other , this statue is coming down . Either the statue will be taken down gracefully or it will be torn down . " The protesters sought a congressional resolution to have the statue removed and replaced with a monument inscribed with the Declaration of Independence . Historian and LaRouche activist Anton <unk> called the statue a " monument to terrorism " and members of the Council of the District of Columbia petitioned to have the statue removed . Michael Farquhar , a former writer and editor at The Washington Post , called Pike a " blustering blowhard , a feeble poet , a laughable hypocrite , a shameless jingoist , a notoriously insubordinate military officer , and yes , a bigot with genocidal inclinations . " John W. <unk> , then managing editor of the Scottish Rite Journal , wrote a rebuttal op @-@ ed in The Washington Post in defense of the memorial and pointed out that only an Act of Congress could result in the statue 's removal . He stated : " [ Pike ] received a full pardon from the federal government for his service in the Civil War as a Confederate general . There is not a jot of reliable proof that Albert Pike was ever a member , much less an officer , of the Klan . " <unk> also claimed a LaRouche video promised the Middle East conflict would be solved and World War III averted if the statue was removed . The weekly protests by LaRouche supporters continued into 1993 . That year Bevel and <unk> were convicted of " unlawful statue climbing " and sentenced to one week in jail . 
 There was continued criticism of the memorial in the 1990s and 2000s . John F. Doyle , a retired judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia , said Pike was responsible for Native American casualties during the Civil War and their subsequent loss of land . Journalist and author Richard G. Zimmerman called Pike 's statue a " poor choice for a pedestal " and said inscriptions on the memorial noting Pike 's virtues should include " bigot , indicted traitor , alleged barbarian , suspected plagiarist , jailbird . " C. Fred <unk> , then chief executive officer of the Scottish Rite , defended Pike and said the statue was not in honor of his role as a Confederate general , but as an " advocate for Native Americans and his role as a champion of educational and social reform and for his literary accomplishments and scholarship . " Scottish Rite Journal managing editor S. Brent Morris has also defended the memorial and Pike 's role as a Confederate officer : " We 're not embarrassed in the least that he was a Confederate general ... Even in 1901 , I don 't think the United States Congress would have approved honoring a Confederate general , so he was honored for all his other accomplishments . "

 The statue of Pike is the only outdoor sculpture in Washington , D.C. honoring a Confederate general , although he is dressed as a civilian , not a soldier . It is located in Reservation 188 at the southwest corner of 3rd and D Street NW in the Judiciary Square neighborhood . It is sited between the U.S. Department of Labor 's Frances Perkins Building and Metropolitan Police Department headquarters .

 = Mount Rainier = 
 Mount Rainier ( pronounced : / <unk> / ) , Mount Tacoma , or Mount Tahoma is the highest mountain of the Cascade Range of the Pacific Northwest , and the highest mountain in the U.S. state of Washington . It is a large active stratovolcano located 54 miles ( 87 km ) south @-@ southeast of Seattle . It is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous United States and the Cascade Volcanic Arc , with a summit elevation of 14 @,@ 411 ft ( 4 @,@ 392 m ) . 
 Mt . Rainier is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in the world , and it is on the Decade Volcano list . Because of its large amount of glacial ice , Mt . Rainier could potentially produce massive lahars that could threaten the entire Puyallup River valley , and poses a grave threat to sections of Seattle , a city with nearly a million people living in it . 
 = = Name = = 
 Mount Rainier was first known by the Native Americans as <unk> , or Tacoma or Tahoma . One hypothesis of the word origin is [ <unk> ] ( " mother of waters " ) , in the Lushootseed language spoken by the Puyallup people . Another hypothesis is that " Tacoma " means " larger than Mount Baker " in Lushootseed : " Ta " , larger , plus " Koma ( Kulshan ) " , Mount Baker . Other names originally used include Tahoma , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 The current name was given by George Vancouver , who named it in honor of his friend , Rear Admiral Peter Rainier . The map of the Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804 @-@ 1806 refers to it as " Mt . <unk> " . 
 Although " Rainier " had been considered the official name of the mountain , Theodore Winthrop , in his posthumously published 1862 travel book The Canoe and the Saddle , referred to the mountain as " Tacoma " and for a time , both names were used interchangeably , although " Mt . Tacoma " was preferred in the city of Tacoma . 
 In 1890 , the United States Board on Geographic Names declared that the mountain would be known as " Rainier " . Following this in 1897 , the Pacific Forest Reserve became the Mount Rainier Forest Reserve , and the national park was established three years later . Despite this , there was still a movement to change the mountain 's name to " Tacoma " and Congress was still considering a resolution to change the name as late as 1924 . 
 In the lead up to Super Bowl XLVIII , the Washington State Senate passed a resolution on Friday , January 31 , 2014 , temporarily renaming the mountain Mount Seattle Seahawks until the midnight after the Super Bowl , Monday , February 3 , 2014 , in response to the renaming of 53 mountains in Colorado after the 53 members of the Denver Broncos by Governor of Colorado John Hickenlooper . 
 After the renaming of Mount McKinley in 2015 , debate over the name resumed .

 Mount Rainier is the highest mountain in Washington and the Cascade Range . This peak is located just east of Eatonville and just southeast of Seattle and Tacoma . Mount Rainier is ranked third of the 128 ultra @-@ prominent mountain peaks of the United States . Mount Rainier has a topographic prominence of 13 @,@ 210 ft ( 4 @,@ 026 m ) , which is greater than that of K2 , the world 's second @-@ tallest mountain , at 13 @,@ 189 ft ( 4 @,@ 020 m ) . On clear days it dominates the southeastern horizon in most of the Seattle @-@ Tacoma metropolitan area to such an extent that locals sometimes refer to it simply as " the Mountain . " On days of exceptional clarity , it can also be seen from as far away as Corvallis , Oregon ( at Marys Peak ) and Victoria , British Columbia . 
 With 26 major glaciers and 36 sq mi ( 93 km2 ) of permanent snowfields and glaciers , Mount Rainier is the most heavily glaciated peak in the lower 48 states . The summit is topped by two volcanic craters , each more than 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) in diameter , with the larger east crater overlapping the west crater . Geothermal heat from the volcano keeps areas of both crater rims free of snow and ice , and has formed the world 's largest volcanic glacier cave network within the ice @-@ filled craters , with nearly 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of passages . A small crater lake about 130 by 30 ft ( 39 @.@ 6 by 9 @.@ 1 m ) in size and 16 ft ( 5 m ) deep , the highest in North America with a surface elevation of 14 @,@ 203 ft ( 4 @,@ 329 m ) , occupies the lowest portion of the west crater below more than 100 ft ( 30 m ) of ice and is accessible only via the caves . 
 The Carbon , Puyallup , <unk> , Nisqually , and Cowlitz Rivers begin at eponymous glaciers of Mount Rainier . The sources of the White River are Winthrop , Emmons , and Fryingpan Glaciers . The White , Carbon , and <unk> join the Puyallup River , which discharges into Commencement Bay at Tacoma ; the Nisqually empties into Puget Sound east of Lacey ; and the Cowlitz joins the Columbia River between Kelso and Longview .

 The broad top of Mount Rainier contains three named summits . The highest is called the Columbia Crest . The second highest summit is Point Success , 14 @,@ 158 ft ( 4 @,@ 315 m ) , at the southern edge of the summit plateau , atop the ridge known as Success Cleaver . It has a topographic prominence of about 138 ft ( 42 m ) , so it is not considered a separate peak . The lowest of the three summits is Liberty Cap , 14 @,@ 112 ft ( 4 @,@ 301 m ) , at the northwestern edge , which overlooks Liberty Ridge , the Sunset Amphitheater , and the dramatic Willis Wall . Liberty Cap has a prominence of 492 ft ( 150 m ) , and so would qualify as a separate peak under most strictly prominence @-@ based rules . A prominence cutoff of 400 ft ( 122 m ) is commonly used in Washington state . 
 High on the eastern flank of Mount Rainier is a peak known as Little Tahoma Peak , 11 @,@ 138 ft ( 3 @,@ 395 m ) , an eroded remnant of the earlier , much higher , Mount Rainier . It has a prominence of 858 ft ( 262 m ) , and it is almost never climbed in direct conjunction with Columbia Crest , so it is usually considered a separate peak . If considered separately from Mt . Rainier , Little Tahoma Peak would be the third highest mountain peak in Washington . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Mount Rainier is a stratovolcano in the Cascade Volcanic Arc that consists of lava flows , debris flows , and pyroclastic ejecta and flows . Its early volcanic deposits are estimated at more than 840 @,@ 000 years old and are part of the Lily Formation ( about 2 @.@ 9 million to 840 @,@ 000 years ago ) . The early deposits formed a " proto @-@ Rainier " or an ancestral cone prior to the present @-@ day cone . The present cone is more than 500 @,@ 000 years old . 
 The volcano is highly eroded , with glaciers on its slopes , and appears to be made mostly of andesite . Rainier likely once stood even higher than today at about 16 @,@ 000 ft ( 4 @,@ 900 m ) before a major debris avalanche and the resulting Osceola Mudflow approximately 5 @,@ 000 years ago . In the past , Rainier has had large debris avalanches , and has also produced enormous lahars ( volcanic mudflows ) due to the large amount of glacial ice present . Its lahars have reached all the way to Puget Sound , a distance of more than 30 mi ( 48 km ) . Around 5 @,@ 000 years ago , a large chunk of the volcano slid away and that debris avalanche helped to produce the massive Osceola Mudflow , which went all the way to the site of present @-@ day Tacoma and south Seattle . This massive avalanche of rock and ice removed the top 1 @,@ 600 ft ( 500 m ) of Rainier , bringing its height down to around 14 @,@ 100 ft ( 4 @,@ 300 m ) . About 530 to 550 years ago , the Electron Mudflow occurred , although this was not as large @-@ scale as the Osceola Mudflow . 
 After the major collapse approximately 5 @,@ 000 years ago , subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about as recently as 1 @,@ 000 years ago . As many as 11 Holocene tephra layers have been found . 
 = = = Modern activity and the current threat = = = 
 The most recent recorded volcanic eruption was between 1820 and 1854 , but many eyewitnesses reported eruptive activity in 1858 , 1870 , 1879 , 1882 and 1894 as well . 
 Although Mount Rainier is an active volcano , as of 2016 seismic monitors within Mount Rainier National Park and on top of the mountain appear to show that it is indeed very much alive , but very soundly asleep . However , an eruption could be deadly for all living in areas within the immediate vicinity of the volcano and an eruption would also cause trouble from Vancouver , Canada to San Francisco because of the massive amounts of ash blasting out of the volcano into the atmosphere . 
 Mount Rainier is located in an area that itself is part of the eastern rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire . This includes mountains and calderas like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak in California , Crater Lake , Three Sisters , and Mount Hood in Oregon , Mount Saint Helens , Mount Adams , Glacier Peak , and Mount Baker in Washington , and Mount Cayley , Garibaldi , Silverthrone , and Mount Meager in British Columbia . All of the above are dormant , but alive , and scientists on both sides of the border gather research of the past eruptions of each in order to predict how mountains in this arc will behave and what they are capable of in the future , including Mount Rainier . Of these , only two have erupted in the past hundred years : Lassen in 1915 and St. Helens in 1980 & 2004 . However , past eruptions in this volcanic arc have multiple examples of sub @-@ plinian eruptions or higher : Crater Lake 's last eruption as Mount Mazama was large enough to cause its cone to implode , and Mt . Rainier 's closest neighbor , Mount St. Helen 's had a huge chunk of the side of the mountain blow up in a phreatic explosion caused by a mix of gas and water ; where St. Helens was once perfectly symmetrical there is now , thirty five years later , a huge crater at the top of one face . Statistics place the likelihood of a major eruption in this range at 2 @-@ 3 per century . 
 Mount Rainier is currently listed as a Decade Volcano , or one of the 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes . If Mt . Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May 18 , 1980 eruption , the effect would be cumulatively greater , because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens , the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier , and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano , almost twice the size of St. Helens . Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property , as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits . According to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) , about 150 @,@ 000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier . Not only is there much ice atop the volcano , the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity . According to Geoff Clayton , a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm , RH2 Engineering , a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw , Orting , Kent , Auburn , Puyallup , Sumner and all of Renton . Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle , and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington . Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava . 
 According to K. Scott , a scientist with the USGS : 
 " A home built in any of the <unk> defined inundation areas on the new maps is more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a lahar than by fire ... For example , a home built in an area that would be inundated every 100 years , on the average , is 27 times more likely to be damaged or destroyed by a flow than by fire . People know the danger of fire , so they buy fire insurance and they have smoke alarms , but most people are not aware of the risks of lahars , and few have applicable flood insurance . " 
 The volcanic risk is somewhat mitigated by lahar warning sirens and escape route signs in Pierce County . The more populous King County is also in the lahar area , but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard . More recently ( since 2001 ) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up , leading local authorities in at @-@ risk cities like Orting to fear a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy . 
 = = = Seismic background = = = 
 Typically , up to five earthquakes are recorded monthly near the summit . Swarms of five to ten shallow earthquakes over two or three days take place from time to time , predominantly in the region of 13 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 km ) below the summit . These earthquakes are thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids beneath Mount Rainier . Presumably , hot springs and steam vents within Mount Rainier National Park are generated by such fluids . Seismic swarms ( not initiated with a mainshock ) are common features at volcanoes , and are rarely associated with eruptive activity . Rainier has had several such swarms ; there were days @-@ long swarms in 2002 , 2004 , and 2007 , two of which ( 2002 and 2004 ) included M 3 @.@ 2 earthquakes . A 2009 swarm produced the largest number of events of any swarm at Rainier since seismic monitoring began over two decades earlier . Yet another swarm was observed in 2011 . 
 = = = Glaciers = = = 
 Glaciers are among the most conspicuous and dynamic geologic features on Mount Rainier . They erode the volcanic cone and are important sources of streamflow for several rivers , including some that provide water for hydroelectric power and irrigation . Together with perennial snow patches , the 26 major glaciers cover about 36 square miles ( 93 km2 ) of the mountain 's surface and have a volume of about 1 cubic mile ( 4 @.@ 2 km3 ) . 
 Glaciers flow under the influence of gravity by the combined action of sliding over the rock on which they lie and by deformation , the gradual displacement between and within individual ice crystals . Maximum speeds occur near the surface and along the centerline of the glacier . During May 1970 , Nisqually Glacier was measured moving as fast as 29 inches ( 74 cm ) per day . Flow rates are generally greater in summer than in winter , probably due to the presence of large quantities of meltwater at the glacier base . 
 The size of glaciers on Mount Rainier has fluctuated significantly in the past . For example , during the last ice age , from about 25 @,@ 000 to about 15 @,@ 000 years ago , glaciers covered most of the area now within the boundaries of Mount Rainier National Park and extended to the perimeter of the present Puget Sound Basin . 
 Between the 14th century and 1850 , many of the glaciers on Mount Rainier advanced to their farthest extent downvalley since the last ice age . Many advances of this sort occurred worldwide during this time period known to geologists as the Little Ice Age . During the Little Ice Age , the Nisqually Glacier advanced to a position 650 to 800 ft ( 200 to 240 m ) downvalley from the site of the Glacier Bridge , Tahoma and South Tahoma Glaciers merged at the base of Glacier Island , and the terminus of Emmons Glacier reached within 1 @.@ 2 mi ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) of the White River Campground . 
 Retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers was slow until about 1920 when retreat became more rapid . Between the height of the Little Ice Age and 1950 , Mount Rainier 's glaciers lost about one @-@ quarter of their length . Beginning in 1950 and continuing through the early 1980s , however , many of the major glaciers advanced in response to relatively cooler temperatures of the mid @-@ century . The Carbon , Cowlitz , Emmons , and Nisqually Glaciers advanced during the late 1970s and early 1980s as a result of high snowfalls during the 1960s and 1970s . Since the early @-@ 1980s , however , many glaciers have been thinning and retreating and some advances have slowed . 
 The glaciers on Mount Rainier can generate mudflows , through glacial outburst floods not associated with any eruption . The South Tahoma Glacier generated 30 floods in the 1980s and early 1990s , and again in August , 2015 . 
 = = Human history = = 
 At the time of European contact , the river valleys and other areas near the mountain were inhabited by many Pacific Northwest tribes who hunted and gathered berries in its forests and mountain meadows . These included the Nisqually , Cowlitz , Yakama , Puyallup , and <unk> . 
 Captain George Vancouver reached Puget Sound in early May 1792 and became the first European to see the mountain . 
 In 1833 , Dr. William Fraser Tolmie explored the area looking for medicinal plants . Hazard Stevens and P. B. Van Trump received a hero 's welcome in the streets of Olympia after their successful summit climb in 1870 . The first female ascent was made in 1890 by Fay Fuller , accompanied by Van Trump and three other teammates . 
 John Muir climbed Mount Rainier in 1888 , and although he enjoyed the view , he conceded that it was best appreciated from below . Muir was one of many who advocated protecting the mountain . In 1893 , the area was set aside as part of the Pacific Forest Reserve in order to protect its physical and economic resources , primarily timber and watersheds . 
 Citing the need to also protect scenery and provide for public enjoyment , railroads and local businesses urged the creation of a national park in hopes of increased tourism . On March 2 , 1899 , President William McKinley established Mount Rainier National Park as America 's fifth national park . Congress dedicated the new park " for the benefit and enjoyment of the people " and " ... for the preservation from injury or spoliation of all timber , mineral deposits , natural curiosities , or wonders within said park , and their retention in their natural condition . " 
 In 1998 , the United States Geological Survey began putting together the Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System to assist in the emergency evacuation of the Puyallup River valley in the event of a catastrophic debris flow . It is now run by the Pierce County Department of Emergency Management . Tacoma , at the mouth of the Puyallup , is only 37 mi ( 60 km ) west of Rainier , and moderately sized towns such as Puyallup and Orting are only 27 and 20 mi ( 43 and 32 km ) away , respectively . 
 Mt . Rainier appears on four distinct United States postage stamp issues . In 1934 , it was the 3 @-@ cent issue in a series of National Park stamps , and was also shown on a souvenir sheet issued for a philatelic convention . The following year , in 1935 , both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends . Because of complaints by the public , " Farley 's Follies " were reproduced in large numbers . The second stamp issue is easy to tell from the original because it is imperforate . Both stamps and souvenir sheets are widely available . 
 The Washington state quarter , which was released on April 11 , 2007 , features Mount Rainier and a salmon . 
 = = Climbing and recreation = = 
 Mountain climbing on Mount Rainier is difficult , involving traversing the largest glaciers in the U.S. south of Alaska . Most climbers require two to three days to reach the summit . Climbing teams demand experience in glacier travel , self @-@ rescue , and wilderness travel . About 8 @,@ 000 to 13 @,@ 000 people attempt the climb each year , about 90 % via routes from Camp Muir on the southeast flank . Most of the rest ascend Emmons Glacier via Camp Schurman on the northeast . About half of the attempts are successful , with weather and conditioning being the most common reasons for failure . All climbers who plan to climb above high camps , Camp Muir and Camp Schurman , are required by law to purchase a Mount Rainier Climbing Pass and register for their climb . Additionally , solo climbers must fill out a solo climbing request form and receive written permission from the Superintendent before attempting to climb . 
 The worst mountaineering accident on Mount Rainier occurred in 1981 , when eleven people lost their lives in an ice fall on the Ingraham Glacier . This was the largest number of fatalities on Mount Rainier in a single incident since 32 people were killed in a 1946 plane crash on the South Tahoma Glacier . 
 More recently , the mountain received media attention in 2012 , as one of the park rangers lost his life when several climbers were caught in a storm while trying to ascend the mountain . While trying to help load the climbers into a rescue helicopter , the ranger lost his footing , and slid 3 @,@ 700 feet ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) to his death . 
 In one of the worst disasters on the mountain in over thirty years , six climbers — two guides , and four clients — last heard from on May 28 , 2014 , were presumed dead on May 31 , 2014 , when low @-@ flying search helicopters <unk> the signals from the avalanche beacons worn by the climbers . Officials concluded that there was no possible chance for survival after the climbers fell 3 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) while attempting or returning from the summit via the Liberty Ridge climbing route . Searchers found tents and clothes along with rock and ice strewn across a debris field on the Carbon Glacier at 9 @,@ 500 ft ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) , possible evidence for a slide or avalanche in the vicinity where the team went missing , though the exact cause of the accident is unknown . The bodies of three of the guest climbers were spotted on August 7 , 2014 , during a training flight and subsequently recovered on August 19 , 2014 . The bodies of the fourth guest climber and two guides have not been located . 
 About two mountaineering deaths each year occur because of rock and ice fall , avalanche , falls , and hypothermia associated with severe weather ( 58 reported since and including the 1981 accident through 2010 per American Alpine Club Accidents in North American Mountaineering and the NPS ) . 
 Hiking , backcountry skiing , photography , and camping are popular in the park . Hiking trails , including the Wonderland Trail — a 93 @-@ mile or 150 @-@ kilometre circumnavigation of the peak — provide access to the backcountry . Mount Rainier is also popular for winter sports , including snowshoeing and cross @-@ country skiing .

 = Cowboy Jimmy Moore = 
 Cowboy Jimmy Moore ( September 14 , 1910 – November 17 , 1999 ) , born James William Moore , was a world @-@ class American pocket billiards ( pool ) player originally from Troup County , Georgia , and for most of his life a resident of Albuquerque , New Mexico , best known for his mastery in the game of straight pool ( 14 @.@ 1 continuous ) . 
 An excellent athlete at various sports , Moore 's many records in billiards include winning the Michigan State Billiard Championship four times , placing second at the World Championship five times competing against the best in the world such as Willie Mosconi , Irving Crane and Luther Lassiter , winning the United States National Pocket Billiards Championship in 1958 , the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship in 1965 and the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition in 1984 . 
 Moore was also known for his straight pool exhibition work , as a formidable road player , and for his unusual pool style , which included both his flamboyant cowboy dress , and his rare form of cueing technique known as a slip stroke . Moore also worked as a technical adviser for billiard @-@ related scenes in television and film in such productions as My Living Doll , and the Jerry Lewis movie The Family Jewels . He is an inductee of the Billiard Congress of America 's Hall of Fame , the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame , and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early years = = 
 James William Moore was born on September 14 , 1910 on a farm located in Troup County , Georgia , just outside the City of <unk> . He was the son of a Georgia blacksmith , sheriff and streetcar conductor . He began working at a young age , supplementing his family 's income variously as a cotton picker earning 35 cents per 100 pounds , managing a fruit stand , and delivering newspapers . His family moved to Detroit when he was 13 , where other ways of making money presented themselves . Moore ran card games and pursued other games of chance , even pitching pennies . He was very good at such gambling pursuits and was a naturally gifted athlete , attaining a Triple @-@ A level as a baseball player in the minor leagues , once bowled a perfect game , and was a fine golfer . 
 I was shooting in the ' 70s soon after I took up golf . I thought about trying to become a pro but I figured there wasn 't any money in it . That was true , back then . Same thing for baseball . I was a pretty good pitcher — I played in the minors for Belle Isle , out of Detroit — but I didn 't think I could make a living at it . 
 In 1928 at 18 years of age , Moore took a job as a <unk> at Car Barns , a local bowling alley , earning six cents a line . True to form , Moore was a quick study , for a time carrying a 233 bowling average . Moore first picked up a cue stick at Car Barns , playing on the single 4 x 8 foot pool table the bowling alley had available . According to Moore he immediately fell in love with the game ; specifically , with the game of straight pool ( 14 @.@ 1 continuous ) , at which he would chiefly compete during his career , though not to the exclusion of all other billiard disciplines — Moore would become national snooker champion , and would place second at the 1961 First Annual World 's One @-@ Pocket Billiards Tournament in Johnston City , Illinois . 
 Straight pool was the game of championship pocket billiards competition until approximately the 1980s when it was overtaken by " faster " games such as nine @-@ ball . In the game , a shooter may attempt to pocket any object ball on the table . The object is to reach a set number of points determined by agreement before the game — typically 150 in professional competition . One point is scored for each ball pocketed in the pocket called and where no foul has transpired . According to Moore , his high run in the game was 236 ball in a row . 
 Six months after his first introduction to the game , Moore entered and won the 1929 Michigan State billiard championship . He successfully defended that title in the following three years . During the midst of the Great Depression , however , playing pool for trophies was not a luxury Moore could afford , so he took his game on the road . 
 = = On the road = = 
 Moore first partnered with hustler cum exhibition player , Ray St. Laurent , a colorful character who staged exhibitions wearing a red cape and mask while billed as " The Red Devil " . Although St. Laurent fostered Moore , they were not equals on the pool table . One winter evening in Canton , Ohio , St. Laurent was losing badly in a thoroughly overmatched gambling session to Ohio road legend , Don Willis , known as the " Cincinnati Kid " , who was considered by many of his colleagues of the time " the deadliest player alive " . The wager was 25 cents a ball — a not inconsiderable sum at the time — and Moore was <unk> the match . Eventually disgusted by the uneven proceedings , Moore told St. Laurent that he couldn 't win and asked him to step aside and let him have a go . Willis later recalled : 
 Here was this punk kid sitting there saying , ' I 'll play you some . ' Well , he got out of that overcoat and ran over me in my home poolroom . He never missed a ball . 
 Moore and Willis became traveling partners following their match , often accompanied on the road by future six @-@ time world champion Luther " Wimpy " Lassiter . Given his skill and prominent road partners , Moore 's name began to be known in the billiard world . In 1940 , the World Pocket Billiards ( straight pool ) titleholder of that year , Andrew Ponzi , sought out Moore looking for a challenge . At the match ultimately arranged , Moore first beat Ponzi out of $ 80 playing nine @-@ ball , and then beat him at his own game of choice , straight pool , with Moore scoring 125 points to Ponzi 's 82 . 
 After Moore 's match with Ponzi , he was hired by Ponzi 's sometime employer , Sylvester Livingston , a pool impresario who hosted exhibitions with a stable of top pool talent including Irving Crane who , like Lassiter , would become a six @-@ time world champion . During 1941 Moore performed 250 exhibitions across the country , earning $ 5 for matinees , and $ 7 for evening performances . He lost only one match over the year , and posted straight pool runs of 100 or more in 24 out of the 250 exhibitions . 
 By that time Moore was recognizable by his cowboy airs . He customarily wore cowboy boots , a white Stetson hat and a string tie , kept his hair in a crew @-@ cut , and was rarely seen without a cigar . He was also known for his unusual form of stroke . Moore employed a slip stroke — a shooting technique in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re @-@ grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball . Employing the slip stroke to good effect , Moore was deadly accurate , but could also shoot with great power . 
 In 1945 , Moore 's purchased a home in Albuquerque , New Mexico , where he would live for the rest of his life with his wife , Julie Chavez , whom he married in 1949 . They had seven children together : sons Jamie , Raymond and Tommy , and daughters Pamela Nathan , <unk> Moore , Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates . Soon after moving to Albuquerque , he became co @-@ owner and operator of the U Cue Billiards Hall located in the City . It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore . 
 = = Exhibition and competition = = 
 Though Moore continued playing on the road — as he would for over 40 years — he began competing and placing in top @-@ tier tournaments . His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner @-@ up finishes that would earn him the nickname " pool 's underpaid prince " in such publications as Esquire Magazine . The name that stuck with him for life , however , was Cowboy . According to Moore , he became ' Cowboy ' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo , but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat . 
 The second @-@ place @-@ saga started in 1951 at the two @-@ week @-@ long , double @-@ elimination , round robin format , World Championship tournament , held that year in Boston . At the competition , Moore was defeated in his last match by Willie Mosconi . His record was seven wins in nine matches , including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America ( BCA ) Hall @-@ of @-@ Famers , Irving Crane and Arthur " Babe " Cranfield . 
 In 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition , held once more in Boston , running 93 balls against Lassiter , beating him 150 to 25 , but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi , this time sharing second place with Jimmy Caras and Joe Procita . Moore 's match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150 to 58 in 19 innings . Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco , but did not place , losing in his last match to Crane , 150 @-@ 56 in 7 innings . 
 The following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship , held that year in Philadelphia . The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA ; in its absence being organized by Irving Crane . It was denominated by newspapers , such as The New York Times , as the " Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship . " In a career highlight in the penultimate match there , Moore was losing 148 to 8 to Irving Crane . When Crane let him back to the table , Moore ran 142 balls and out . Despite this feat , Moore was dispatched to second place by Lassiter , with a final score of 150 to 95 , sharing second place with Crane . The defending champion , Mosconi , did not participate . 
 Moore 's runner @-@ up streak continued in the 1956 World Championship held at <unk> 's Academy in Brooklyn , New York . He clinched second place , to Willie Mosconi 's now almost ubiquitous first , with a 150 to 50 score over Al <unk> of Philadelphia in 15 innings , a win over Richard <unk> of Baltimore , 150 to 121 , with an inspired run of 107 balls , but a loss to Lassiter , 150 to 70 in 7 innings . That same year Moore played Mosconi at a challenge match in Kinston , North Carolina . It was not Moore 's day as Mosconi posted a career highlight ; a perfect match — 150 balls in a row in one inning . 
 In all , Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown . He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensinger 's Billiards in 1958 . The tournament was a challenge match , marathon straight pool race to 3 @,@ 000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter . It was a tight competition , with Lassiter leading at one point 1 @,@ 800 to 1 @,@ 512 . Moore battled back and eventually won with a final score of 3 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 634 . 
 He didn 't think I could beat him , and that made me mad . I had to get mad to win . I was way behind , then I ran 95 , 96 , 97 and 175 , and only missed then when I scratched on the break . Ran right past him . 
 Moore would eventually have ten second place finishes in world @-@ title competition . Nevertheless , he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play . In fact , later in 1958 , the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter , he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two @-@ day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque , with a final score of 500 to 397 . Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play . In addition to matches previously mentioned , they vied at Albuquerque 's old Chaplin Alley in 1956 ; at the Highland Bowl in 1958 ; and later , in matches in Winston @-@ Salem , North Carolina , Philadelphia , Chicago and Johnston City at the <unk> Brother 's Stardust Open , where Moore would win the prize for " all @-@ around honors " . 
 It was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship , seven years after his last first place finish , that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament . At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City , along the way to first place and the prize of $ 4 @,@ 000 , Moore defeated : Onofrio Lauri 150 to 117 ; Joe Balsis 150 to -3 ; <unk> Murphy 150 to 96 ; " Champagne " Edwin Kelly 150 to 83 in 3 innings ; and the ever @-@ present Luther Lassiter , 150 to 41 in 4 innings . The runner up in the tourney was Joe Balsis . 
 In addition to competition , Moore served as a technical adviser for billiard @-@ related scenes in television and film , including My Living Doll starring Julie Newmar and Robert Cummings in 1964 , and the Jerry Lewis movie The Family Jewels in 1965 .

 Moore was inducted into the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame in 1982 , the Billiard Congress of America 's Hall of Fame in 1994 , and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame in 1998 . He remained competitive in tournament and match play well into his 70s . In 1984 , at age 74 , Moore won the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition on ESPN . Even in later years he was still deadly on a pool table , running 111 balls three days after his 80th birthday . " Until the traffic accident I had about a year ago , I was still playing my usual speed " Moore said in July 1999 at the age of 89 . However , Moore 's health declined rapidly that same year . He died on November 17 , 1999 of natural causes . 
 = USS Constellation vs L 'Insurgente = 
 The USS Constellation vs L 'Insurgente , or the Action of 9 February 1799 , was a single @-@ ship action fought between frigates of the French Navy and the United States Navy during the Quasi @-@ War , the battle resulted in the USS Constellation 's capture of L 'Insurgente . 
 The previous year , an undeclared war had begun between the United States and France due to French privateering attacks against American vessels . An American squadron under Commodore Thomas Truxtun had been sent to patrol the waters between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts with orders to engage any French forces they found in the area . While Truxtun was sailing independently of his squadron in the Constellation , his flagship , he met and engaged L 'Insurgente . After chasing the French ship through a storm , Constellation was able to force L 'Insurgente into an engagement that lasted an hour and fourteen minutes before the French frigate surrendered . The French sustained heavy casualties in the action , while the numbers of American dead and wounded were low . After the action L 'Insurgente was taken to Saint Kitts and commissioned into the United States Navy as USS Insurgent . With this and later victories , American morale soared , and Truxtun returned home to honor and praise from the American government and the public at large . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1798 an undeclared war between the United States and France began due to French privateering attacks against American vessels . In response to the attacks , the United States government decided to go on the offensive by sending four naval squadrons to the Caribbean with orders to seize armed French vessels and prevent privateers from attacking American ships . One of the squadrons , under the command of Commodore Thomas Truxtun , was dispatched to cruise between Puerto Rico and Saint Kitts . Truxtun 's squadron consisted of his flagship , the frigate USS Constellation , the 20 @-@ gun Baltimore , the brigs Richmond and Norfolk , and the revenue cutter Virginia . Opposing Truxtun were several French vessels based out of Guadeloupe , among them a number of privateers as well as two French naval frigates and a smaller , 20 @-@ gun corvette . One of the French frigates , the L 'Insurgente , sortied out from Guadaloupe on 8 February , commanded by Michel @-@ Pierre Barreaut . 
 Though the 1 @,@ 265 @-@ ton Constellation was officially classified by the United States Navy as a 36 @-@ gun frigate , during the Quasi @-@ War she carried a heavier armament of 38 guns . Consisting of twenty @-@ eight 24 @-@ pounders on her main deck and ten 12 @-@ pounders on her spar deck , Constellation 's main armament had a combined throwing weight of 396 pounds ( 180 kg ) . In contrast , L 'Insurgente , rated a 32 @-@ gun Sémillante @-@ class frigate , was armed with 40 cannons . The armament of Barreaut 's 950 @-@ ton ship consisted of twenty @-@ four 12 @-@ pounders , two 18 @-@ pounders , eight 6 @-@ pounders , four 32 @-@ pounder carronades , and two 24 @-@ pounder carronades , totaling a combined throwing weight of only 282 pounds ( 128 kg ) . Thus although Barreaut 's vessel carried two more guns in total , Truxtun 's frigate had a more powerful armament due to shot weight . In a boarding action , the French frigate 's crew of 409 men would have had an advantage over the American ship 's 309 , but in a gunnery duel the Americans were superior . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At noon on 9 February , while cruising independently , Truxtun 's men sighted a frigate off the coast of Nevis . Upon approach it was evident that the vessel was flying American colors , and Constellation attempted to move closer to investigate . Unknown to Truxtun , the frigate was the French L 'Insurgente under Michel @-@ Pierre Barreaut . Nearing the still @-@ unidentified L 'Insurgente , Truxtun attempted to signal her to discern her nationality by displaying first British signals and then American signals . Unable to send the correct reply , L 'Insurgente replaced the American colors with French and fired a gun . Upon sighting Constellation at 12 : 30 p.m. , Barreaut mistook the ship for a British corvette and began to flee toward the Dutch islands of Saba and Sint Eustatius to evade his assailant . Truxtun gave chase , but was hampered at 1 : 30 p.m. when the two vessels ran into a gale . As a result of the storm , L 'Insurgente lost her main topmast and was severely damaged , while Constellation managed to avoid significant damage and was able to close in on Barreaut . 
 Though Truxton 's ship initially held an advantageous position in the wind known as the weather gauge , she was over @-@ armed , and as a result her leeward side heeled so much that the gunports on that side of the vessel could not be opened . Truxton decided to cede the weather gauge to the French by sailing around the L 'Insurgente 's leeward side and bringing the Constellation near the French frigate 's port side . In such a position the Constellation was disadvantaged by the wind , but was able to avoid some of the heeling effect on her guns . With the Constellation approaching his frigate fast , Barreaut tried to communicate with the Americans in order to avoid a fight . The American frigate ignored the French attempt at hailing her and closed to within fifty yards of L 'Insurgente before opening up on her with a broadside . Loading her cannons with double shot , the opening American salvo severely damaged the French frigate 's quarterdeck . Barreaut 's vessel replied with her own broadsides that damaged Constellation 's fore topmast . Midshipman David Porter , stationed in the rigging of the Constellation 's damaged mast , managed to relieve pressure from it and prevented its collapse . The L 'Insurgente attempted to close on the American frigate to board her . With less damage to her rigging , Constellation was easily able to avoid Barreaut 's attempts at boarding . 
 Constellation crossed L 'Insurgente 's bow and raked her with a broadside . Truxtun then maneuvered Constellation to the L 'Insurgente 's starboard side and fired further broadsides into the French frigate , but received damage to her rigging in return . Constellation slipped ahead of L 'Insurgente , again crossing her bow and raking her . Once more Constellation slipped next to L 'Insurgente 's leeward side and fired into her , disabling the French vessel 's 18 @-@ pounder guns . Constellation crossed the frigate 's bow a third time , but the French ship had by then sustained massive damage . Attempts by Barreaut 's crew to repair L 'Insurgente 's rigging were fruitless and the French captain subsequently was forced to strike his colors and surrender the vessel . The entire engagement had lasted one hour and fourteen minutes .

 The end of the action signaled the first victory over an enemy warship for the newly formed United States Navy . After Barreaut had struck his colors , Truxtun sent a boat over to board , identify , and take possession of the French vessel . It was only upon boarding L 'Insurgente that the Americans learned the identity of their opponents . The storm and the battle had caused immense damage to the French frigate . In comparison , Constellation had suffered moderate damage to her rigging , but was otherwise still intact . French casualties included 29 killed and 41 wounded , while the Americans suffered two dead and two wounded . One American died shortly after the action ended , of wounds received from French fire ; another was executed for cowardice by Constellation 's Lieutenant Andrew Sterett after the man deserted his gun at the start of the action . 
 Constellation began taking on prisoners of war from L 'Insurgente , but by nightfall the two ships had become separated in a storm . Left aboard L 'Insurgente were the Constellation 's First Lieutenant John Rodgers , Midshipman David Porter , and 11 enlisted men , along with 170 French prisoners . The Americans were forced to sail the vessel short @-@ handed while guarding the French prisoners . As the prisoners outnumbered their captors and no gear to secure them could be found aboard , the Frenchmen were driven into L 'Insurgente 's lower holds . Finally , after three nights , L 'Insurgente was brought in to Saint Kitts where Constellation was waiting for her . While at the American naval depot at Saint Kitts , the Constellation 's troublesome 24 @-@ pounder guns were removed and replaced with 18 @-@ pounder cannons . At the American prize court in Norfolk , Virginia , L 'Insurgente was condemned to be sold as a war prize , with the proceeds distributed to the crew of the Constellation . Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddert managed to negotiate the prize award down from $ 120 @,@ 000 to $ 84 @,@ 000 before purchasing L 'Insurgente and commissioning her in the United States Navy as the USS Insurgent . 
 For his victory over L 'Insurgente , Truxtun received honors both at home and abroad . When accounts of the action reached London , Truxtun was fêted by the merchants there who sent him a piece of silver plate to commemorate his victory . In the United States , morale soared upon hearing of the first American victory over the French . Truxtun was cited by Benjamin Stoddert , the Secretary of the Navy , for his excellent conduct during the action , and songs and poems such as Brave Yankee Boys were later written about the event . In contrast , when Barreaut returned to France he was accused of failing to put up sufficient resistance in the engagement and was given a court @-@ martial . Despite the accusations , he had been praised by Truxton after the action for his bravery and was acquitted during the court @-@ martial . The French were infuriated upon hearing the results of the action because the two countries were not officially at war ; Governor Edme Étienne Borne Desfourneaux of Guadeloupe demanded that Insurgent be returned to French control . Upon learning of the American refusal to repatriate Insurgent , Desfourneaux was outraged and ordered all American vessels and property to be seized , while also declaring that a state of war existed between the United States and Guadeloupe . After continuing their cruise for a few weeks , both Insurgent and Constellation were forced to return to Norfolk , Virginia , by the end of March due to the expiration of the terms of enlistment of their crews . On her next cruise Constellation dueled La Vengeance , though that French frigate escaped L 'Insurgente 's fate . 
 = Letocetum = 
 Letocetum is the ancient remains of a Roman settlement . It was an important military staging post and posting station near the junction of Watling Street , the Roman military road to North Wales , and Icknield ( or Ryknild ) Street ( now the A38 ) . The site is now within the parish of Wall , Staffordshire , England . It is owned and run by the National Trust , under the name Letocetum Roman Baths Site & Museum . The site is in the guardianship of English Heritage as Wall Roman Site . 
 The Romans came to Letocetum in 50 CE to establish a fortress during the early years of the invasion of Britain . The land could not support large amounts of soldiers and Letocetum , at an important cross @-@ roads , became a large scale posting station . The settlement developed with successive bath houses and mansiones built to serve the official travellers as well as the growing civilian population . It is known mainly from detailed excavations in 1912 – 13 , which concentrated on the sites of the mansio and bath @-@ house , but there is evidence of a substantial settlement with possible basilica , temples , and amphitheatre . 
 The remains visible today are those of the stone bath house and mansio , built in approximately 130 CE after Letocetum ceased to have a military function and became a civilian settlement . The settlement reached its peak during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and at this time occupied 8 @.@ 1 – 12 hectares ( 20 – 30 acres ) . At the end of the 3rd century , the town relocated within high defensive walls astride Watling Street . After the Romans left early in the 5th century the settlement went into decline . The modern village of Wall emerged in the land once occupied by Letocetum . 
 = = Name = = 
 The site is mentioned as <unk> in the Antonine Itinerary and presumably represented a Latinisation of a Brittonic place name reconstructed as * <unk> ( " Grey @-@ wood " ; cf . Old Welsh : <unk> and modern Welsh <unk> ) . The name possibly represented the species of tree prominent at the site such as ash and elm . Ford identifies the community as the Cair <unk> <unk> ( " Fort <unk> " ) listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his History of the <unk> , previously identified with Lincoln or Lichfield . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Native settlement = = = 
 It is likely that a small native settlement occupied the site before the advent of the Romans , possibly as the main trading station on the boundary between two British tribes , the Corieltauvi in the East Midlands whose later tribal centre was at <unk> <unk> , and the Cornovii to the west with their original capital <unk> ( which would later give its name to the important Roman British city of Viroconium ) at the hill fort on The Wrekin . These tribes offered little resistance to Roman rule . 
 = = = Military staging post = = = 
 In about 50 CE , a Roman <unk> built a large timber fortress on a hilltop ( near the site of the current church ) at Letocetum . This housed the Legio XIV Gemina during the campaigns of governor Aulus Didius Gallus against the Brigantes . It was a good defensive position , but the poor farmland surrounding the fortress could not support large numbers of soldiers . During the <unk> period this initial fortress was replaced with a smaller one and Letocetum then developed into a large @-@ scale posting station . Most of the troops moved to the fortress at Viroconium during the early administration of Gaius Suetonius Paulinus in about 58 CE . 
 = = = Posting station = = = 
 A mansio was built to provide lodging for official couriers travelling on Watling Street . A bath house was also built for the travellers and the growing civilian population . When the first mansio and bath house were completed , workers were needed to provide wood for the bath house , look after animals , and repair vehicles to be used by the official travellers . The civilian population would have provided many of these services . The native settlement grew during the Flavian period onwards to occupy 8 @.@ 1 – 12 hectares ( 20 – 30 acres ) . Roman burials with 1st and 2nd century pottery were found along Watling Street in 1927 , and more in 1966 . In the field between the mansio site and Watling Street , a round depression in the ground may mark the site of a Roman amphitheatre . A large earthenware vessel in the likeness of Minerva was found near the modern church , which may therefore be the site of a temple of Minerva . A rectangular crop @-@ mark in the field to the north @-@ west of the bath @-@ house , only visible in dry weather , may be the site of another temple . 
 When the Legion XIV first settled at Letocetum they would have used existing trackways . A stone @-@ surfaced road was needed to allow reliable movement . Watling Street was given a stone surface past Letocetum in about 70 CE . This date is approximated from two coins found in the centre of Letocetum beneath the first road surfacing . There is no evidence to indicate when Ryknild Street was constructed , but from the layout it is thought that Watling Street was built first . Watling Street stretched from Letocetum to London in one direction and to Wroxeter and Chester in the other . Ryknild Street , 7 @.@ 3 metres ( 24 ft ) wide where it crossed with Watling Street , connected Letocetum with Cirencester to the south west and Yorkshire to the north east . 
 = = = = Early mansiones and bath houses = = = = 
 The foundations of the last mansio built at the site , and its associated bath @-@ house , were uncovered by archaeologists in 1912 – 13 . The rooms of both the mansio and bath @-@ house were emptied and the stone foundations were exposed . This work left , in some lower stratified levels , traces of the two earlier wooden mansiones . 
 The hillside had been terraced and the first mansio , whose construction is dated to 54 – 60 CE , fully occupied one terrace . It was of a sleeper beam construction , the walls were wattle and daub , some were plastered and some were painted with simple linear decoration . It has been assumed the roof was thatch and was consumed when the building was destroyed by fire . The rooms were arranged around a square courtyard approximately 19 by 19 metres ( 62 ft × 62 ft ) . Due to the construction of later buildings the known layout of the first mansio is very fragmentary . The date at which the first mansio was destroyed is uncertain , it was probably near the beginning of the 2nd century , as the destruction layers contained Flavian @-@ Trajanic samian @-@ ware , part of a <unk> dating from 70 – 100 CE and part of a glass bowl which has been dated to the 2nd century . 
 The evidence for the layout of the second mansio is also very fragmentary . It was a courtyard building constructed with posts set vertically in foundation trenches . 
 The walls were plaster and daub and some rooms were painted in vivid colours . In the courtyard was a large well 2 @.@ 29 by 2 @.@ 44 metres ( 7 @.@ 5 ft × 8 @.@ 0 ft ) and 6 @.@ 1 metres ( 20 ft ) deep , cut into the underlying sandstone . The second mansio was deliberately dismantled in about 140 – 150 CE during construction of the third mansio . The well was filled in at this time and contained a samian sherd dated 125 – 145 CE . About the same time the second hilltop fort was abandoned and the town ceased to be a military site . One of the last military features at Letocetum was the " <unk> ditch " associated with this last small fort . The ditch was filled before any secondary silt formed and the filling contained a Trajanic coin dated 98 – 117 CE and pottery suggesting a Hadrianic or early Antonine date . 
 The earliest bath @-@ house was discovered during an excavation in 1956 . In a construction trench of the very first building was a worn coin of Vespasian dated 71 CE , due to the condition of the coin it is believed that this building was erected around 100 CE . It is thought that this building was built during the military period as the surviving masonry is of high quality with finely dressed stone and a wall some 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) thick . It is thought that the second mansio , the last fort , and the first bath house all ended approximately at the end of the military period on the site . 
 = = = = Civilian development ; the third mansio and second bath @-@ house = = = = 
 Letocetum ceased to be used by the military after about 130 CE , probably leaving the town under the authority of the civitas of the Cornovii with its capital at Viroconium Cornoviorum . About this time that a new mansio and bath house were built . 
 The third and best @-@ understood mansio was built on a stone base about 130 CE . It was at least two storeys high and fronted by a colonnade with a tiled roof , probably supported on wooden columns . In the centre of the colonnade , a large door formed the main entrance to the interior of the building . Through the entrance hall was a colonnaded atrium or courtyard with a plastered floor , the central area probably being open to the sky and perhaps containing a herbaceous garden . Timber posts resting on these foundations around the edges of the colonnade supported a balcony above . 
 The entrance hall was flanked on either side by similarly sized rooms probably accessible from the central courtyard . The one on the west contained washing facilities and a gutter leading to a soak @-@ away in the central part of the building , the room to the east may possibly have been a guardroom . On the western side of the courtyard were three small rooms which opened out onto the central colonnade at ground level . The function of these rooms is uncertain , but they were probably used as private accommodation for users of the mansio . The largest room in the mansio lay in the north @-@ east corner , the chamber was heated by a channelled hypocaust system added some time after the building was first completed . 
 To the west of the mansio lay the public bath @-@ house , separated from it by a cobbled road between 2 @.@ 4 and 3 metres ( 7 @.@ 9 and 9 @.@ 8 ft ) wide . From the street , a paved area led into a colonnade fronting the building on the east and continuing round the north side . Large doors in the centre of the eastern colonnade opened into a large , covered courtyard . This courtyard may have been a basilica ; a settlement of this size would be expected to have one , and this is the only candidate on the site . At the far north end of the bath complex was the stoke @-@ room or <unk> , which contained the wood @-@ fired furnaces of the hypocaust system . This underfloor heating system was present in the tepidarium , the caldarium and the <unk> where the floors were supported on pillars of tiles or <unk> . The hot combustion gases from the stoke @-@ room furnaces circulated under the floor between these pillars and were drawn up around the sides of the building through box tiles embedded in the walls , to escape finally through vents in the barrel @-@ vaulted roof . 
 = = = Late Roman defences ; abandoned mansio and bath @-@ house = = = 
 Letocetum lost its public buildings near the end of the 3rd century ; the bath @-@ house and mansio were destroyed by fire . Around this time , very solid defences were built which did not include the bath @-@ house or mansio sites . The reason the bath @-@ house and mansio were abandoned can not be determined but the reason was probably economic . Other mansio sites around Britain appear to have been abandoned at this time . This did not imply an end to the posting service at Letocetum , it may have been a less costly reorganisation . The late defences were built in about 300 CE astride Watling Street , approximately 150 metres ( 490 ft ) east of the mansio site . The defences consisted of a stone wall about 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) thick , fronted by three ditches and with a contemporary turf rampart to the rear , the area within the walls was 2 @.@ 1 hectares ( 5 @.@ 2 acres ) . The northern and western sides were identified and sectioned in 1964 and the foundations of a wall at the south west corner were uncovered . On the western side a section of wall was found still standing 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high above shallow foundations but below the ploughed soil . The wall is believed to have been built within the period 275 – 325 CE . 
 It is thought that the construction of these defences was related to a general uprising of the Welsh tribes , the Ordovices and Silures , that occurred at this time . The revolt was soon quelled , but , to guard against further disruptions , a series of strongholds including Letocetum , <unk> , and <unk> were established along the length of Watling Street . All 4th century archaeological remains have come from within the defences and none from outside , suggesting that the whole population were within the defences by the 4th century . The latest coin to be found at Letocetum was minted in the time of the Emperor Gratian and dated to 381 CE . Roman administration collapsed at the beginning of the 5th century and nothing has been found at the site that is datable after this time . 
 = = = Post @-@ Roman abandonment and later re @-@ occupation = = = 
 The settlement must have been significant for some time ; it is listed in the 9th century Historia Brittonum , and Reno writes " Wall , appearing as Cair <unk> , and undoubtedly correctly ascribed , appears rather incongruously among such major towns and military depots as York , London , Chester , Wroxeter and Caerleon but nevertheless must have been a place of important consequence because of its inclusion as a strategic city . " The late defences led to its description as a Caer and a British , possibly <unk> , outpost was established there . We have no knowledge of the period immediately after the Roman departure as no historical or archaeological evidence is present . 
 Letocetum lost all importance with the development of nearby Lichfield in the 7th century as the seat of a Bishop . When the place again emerged historically it was under a new name , Wall . This name referred to the remains of the late Roman defences , parts of which were still standing in the early 19th century . 
 = Waylon Smithers = 
 Waylon J. Smithers , Jr . , usually referred to as Mr. Smithers or simply Smithers , is a recurring fictional character in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons , who is voiced by Harry Shearer . Smithers first appeared in the episode " Homer 's Odyssey " , although his voice could be heard in the series premiere " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . He is the consummate executive and personal assistant of Springfield Nuclear Power Plant 's owner Mr. Burns . 
 Smithers ' devotion to Mr. Burns was inspired from how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller . The idea for Smithers ' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon , who proposed that Smithers should be gay , but little attention should be drawn to it . Smithers ' first name ( Waylon ) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers . 
 Smithers was originally animated and intended for storyline purposes by some producers and directors to be African American . This however was ultimately changed in later episodes with conflicting and unknown confirmed reasons as to why . Matt Groening however in an unintended interview with TMZ , confirms that the animation director at that time originally drew Smithers black according to plan , but he was changed to " yellow " . When asked by the interviewer why he wasn 't kept that way , Groening did not respond other than " it was a mistake " . 
 Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns , and the relationship between the two is a frequent running gag on The Simpsons . In many ways , Smithers represents the stereotype of a closeted gay man , and numerous overt allusions and double entendres concerning his homosexuality are made , though some of the show 's producers instead interpret him as a " Burns @-@ sexual " . In the season 27 ( 2016 ) episode " The Burns Cage " , he came out as gay . 
 = = Role in The Simpsons = = 
 Smithers is Mr. Burns ' devoted executive assistant . His father , Waylon Smithers , Sr. , worked for Burns until he died of radiation poisoning after saving Springfield from a potential nuclear meltdown , when Smithers was a baby . Although he is not openly gay , Smithers frequents Springfield 's gay village and goes on a vacation to a male @-@ only resort . It was revealed in a flashback that he was married to a woman once , but the two split up when Mr. Burns came between them . Smithers is shown to have a passionate and deep love for Mr. Burns , and his sexual orientation has been characterized by the writers of the show as " Burns @-@ sexual " . 
 Mr. Burns remained largely ignorant of Smithers ' devoted adoration , much to Smithers ' frustration . Mr. Burns himself has been involved with several women and in " A Hunka Hunka Burns in Love " , Smithers is noticeably disgusted when Mr. Burns starts looking for a female companion . Burns , for his part , views Smithers as somewhat of a lackey , albeit a highly valued one for his competence . He has " rewarded " Smithers ' devotion with the future " honor " of being buried alive with him after he dies . Smithers has been shown to be somewhat dependent on his relationship with Burns . In " Homer the Smithers " , Mr. Burns orders Smithers to take a vacation and Homer Simpson is hired as a temporary replacement . When Homer loses his temper and punches Mr. Burns in the face , Mr. Burns learns to become self @-@ reliant and this results in Smithers being fired . Smithers decides that he needs to be Mr. Burns ' assistant and eventually gets his job back . In the season 27 episode " The Burns Cage " , Smithers admits his love to Burns , who reaffirms his contempt for his assistant . 
 Smithers ' official job at the power plant appears to be that of executive assistant , which he says is " actually about 2 @,@ 800 smaller jobs " responsible for monitoring employee attendance , and is often a disciplinarian and has won dozens of employee of the month awards . He has often hinted at wanting to be promoted to the position of executive vice president , but Burns has repeatedly quashed this dream , while whimsically bestowing the vice presidency on a dog . Smithers has the largest collection of Malibu Stacy dolls in Springfield and is the president of the Malibu Stacy fan club .

 = = = Creation = = = 
 Smithers was partly based on how numerous Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller . The idea for Smithers ' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon , who proposed that Smithers should be gay , but the writers should never draw too much attention to it and should try to keep it in the back of their heads . Jay Kogen said " Originally he was gay and black ... But we thought it was too much so we just kept him gay . " The script for " Blood Feud " originally featured Smithers saying " Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids " , but the line had to be cut for time . Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer , who is also the voice of Mr. Burns . Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take . Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers . The name Waylon was first used in " I Married Marge " and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers . 
 Smithers made his first appearance in " Homer 's Odyssey " , which was the third episode of the first season , although he can be heard over a speaker in The Simpsons series premiere " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . In his first visual appearance in " Homer 's Odyssey " , Smithers was mistakenly animated with the wrong color and was made darker than most characters by <unk> <unk> , the color stylist . David Silverman has claimed that Smithers was always intended to be " Mr Burns ' white sycophant " , and the staff thought it " would be a bad idea to have a black subservient character " and so switched him to his intended color for his next episode . Silverman retconned this error by saying that Smithers had a tan from a recent holiday in the Caribbean . The first appearance of a yellow Smithers was " There 's No Disgrace Like Home " , the fourth episode of the first season . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Smithers ' relationship with Mr. Burns has long been a running gag on The Simpsons . Smithers is an obedient and sycophantic assistant to Mr. Burns . There have often been strong hints about Smithers ' true feelings for his boss , with one of the earliest references being in the season one episode " The Telltale Head " . Smithers ' sexual orientation has often come into question , with some fans claiming he is a " Burns @-@ sexual " and only attracted to his boss , while others maintain that he is , without a doubt , gay . During the Bill Oakley / Josh Weinstein era , they still tried to keep his sexuality mysterious and there was debate among the writers about his orientation . Al Jean , who thinks of Smithers as being a " Burns @-@ sexual " , felt that had Mr. Burns been a woman , then Smithers would not be gay . David Silverman , a former supervising director has said , " [ Smithers ] seems to be focused on one particular human , as opposed to anything beyond that . [ Rather than being gay ] , he 's sort of ' Burns @-@ sexual . ' " In a 2006 study conducted by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , it was determined that nine of the 679 lead and supporting characters on scripted broadcast television were gay or lesbian , but Smithers was not included . A list published in 2008 by the same organization included Smithers ; Patty Bouvier , Marge Simpson 's lesbian sister , was included on both lists . 
 The debate is referenced in " The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular " , when the episode host , Troy McClure is answering viewer questions , and one that is asked is " What is the real deal with Mr. Burns ' assistant Smithers ? You know what I 'm talking about . " A montage of various clips that shows Smithers ' lust for Mr. Burns follows , and in the end , McClure says " as you can see , the real deal with Waylon Smithers is that he 's Mr. Burns ' assistant . He 's in his early forties , is unmarried , and currently resides in Springfield . Thanks for writing ! " 
 Several of the allusions to Smithers ' sexuality have turned into battles with the censors . For example , in Smithers ' fantasy of a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake in " Rosebud " , the censors had not wanted Mr. Burns to be naked . Another example is " Marge Gets a Job " , which has a dream sequence where Smithers is sleeping and Burns flies through a window . The sequence shows Burns flying towards him and Smithers looking happy , but originally it went on for a few seconds longer . It had to be trimmed down due to scenes that showed " Mr. Burns land [ ing ] in a particular position on Smithers ' anatomy " . There were also issues with " the lump in his bed " , which the animators said had drawn as his knee , but the censors had misinterpreted . 
 In the second season , the writers started to enjoy writing about Smithers and Burns ' relationship , and the writers often pitched episodes with them as the focus , but many never came to fruition . 
 Mostly in the early seasons , Smithers had a catchphrase , which comes from a recurring joke that Mr. Burns never remembers who Homer Simpson is . Smithers and Burns would watch Homer ( usually over a security camera feed ) and Burns would ask , " Who is that man ? " , to which Smithers would reply , " That 's Homer Simpson , sir , one of your [ drones , organ banks , carbon blobs , etc . ] from sector 7G . " Burns would invariably respond , " Simpson , eh ? " 
 In September 2015 , it was confirmed by Jean that Smithers would come out to Mr. Burns in a season 27 episode . The episode , " The Burns Cage " , was broadcast the following April and saw Smithers unsuccessfully try to move on from Burns . A writer for British progressive magazine the New Statesman felt that the episode was a retcon , making a serious story about the character 's homosexuality instead of the previous jokes and innuendo which were arguably homophobic .

 In 2004 , The Simpsons producers announced that one of their characters was going to come out of the closet . Speculation on who it would be was printed in newspapers throughout the United States and Canada ( even claiming Smithers ' " sexual orientation was about the worst @-@ kept secret in Springfield " ) as well as in Australia , New Zealand , Ireland , ( the Irish Independent called Smithers " too obvious " a choice ) , and the United Kingdom . Despite Matt Groening joking that it would be Homer , the Boston Herald calculated the odds of several characters being gay , with Smithers at a million to one . <unk> Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on " cartoon gaydar " who was gay on the Simpsons , with 97 % of the respondents choosing Smithers . Jenny Stewart , the entertainment editor at the site said of the poll , " We 've never had such an avalanche of people voting in any of our polls as we did on The Simpsons . " It was Patty Bouvier who came out . 
 In a 2007 article , Entertainment Weekly named Smithers the 16th @-@ greatest sidekick of all time . They have also described Smithers and Mr. Burns as being " TV 's most functional dysfunctional couple " . Star News Online named " Smithers ' fey way " as one of the four hundred reasons why they loved The Simpsons . In a 2003 article , Entertainment Weekly named the " Who Shot Mr. Burns ?

 = United States National Bank Building = 
 The United States National Bank Building is a building located in downtown Portland , Oregon , that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Designed by famed Portland architect A. E. Doyle in a Roman classical style , the four @-@ story building 's first section , facing Sixth Avenue , was completed and opened in 1917 . An extension westward to Broadway , approximately doubling its size , was constructed in 1925 . Since then the building has occupied one @-@ half of a city block . It features a four @-@ story @-@ high colonnade of Corinthian order columns at its eastern end , originally the principal façade , and extensive use of glazed terracotta . The interior is also decorated extensively with highly textured materials . The building was constructed for the United States National Bank of Portland ( <unk> ) , which ultimately became part of U.S. Bancorp , whose retail banking division operates as U.S. Bank . In 2016 , almost 100 years after the building 's opening , it continues to serve as the bank 's main Portland branch . 
 = = History = = 
 The United States National Bank of Portland , the predecessor of present @-@ day U.S. Bancorp , was established in Portland in 1890 , opening for business in February 1891 . During the following three decades , the bank experienced significant growth . It weathered the Panic of 1893 better than many of its competitors , and later acquired some of the competing Portland banks , including the Ainsworth National Bank ( in 1902 ) , the Wells Fargo Bank ( in 1905 ) , and the Lumbermen 's National Bank ( in 1917 ) . With the 1902 acquisition , U.S. National Bank moved its headquarters into a larger space formerly occupied by Ainsworth National , in the Ainsworth Building , then located at S.W. Third and Stark streets in downtown Portland . By the 1910s , the bank had outgrown its space . The firm purchased a quarter @-@ block of land at the northwest corner of Sixth and Stark streets in early 1916 and hired Portland architect A. E. Doyle to design a new , dedicated headquarters building . 
 Construction began in 1916 and was completed in 1917 ; the building opened to the public on July 30 , 1917 . Although the building now extends a full block along Stark Street , with entrances on both 6th Avenue and Broadway , it originally faced only 6th Street ( now 6th Avenue ) and extended only about halfway to Broadway . 
 In 1922 ( another source says 1920 ) , the bank purchased the building that had occupied the quarter @-@ block immediately to the west from the Elks organization which would allow the 1917 bank building to be expanded west to Broadway . ( The Elks were preparing to move to a new building elsewhere in downtown . ) Originally , a new 24 @-@ story building was planned for the site , but the bank ultimately decided to expand its existing building , keeping the same design and height for the new section . Shortly after demolition of the old Elks Building in early 1924 , construction of the bank building 's expansion began . The new section opened in 1925 , doubling the building 's size and adding an entrance on Broadway . Doyle was hired again to oversee the expansion , which helped to ensure that that new section would replicate the style of the original section as much as possible , making the expanded building look as though it were built as a single structure , rather than in two stages separated by eight years . In the same year , U.S. National Bank of Portland acquired the Ladd & Tilton Bank , which had been established in 1859 , and was the first financial institution in the Pacific Northwest . This acquisition made <unk> " the largest financial institution north of San Francisco and west of Minneapolis " . 
 In 1946 , U.S. National purchased the Wells Fargo Building ( since 1922 known as the Porter Building ) , a multistory office building located directly adjacent , immediately to the north , to expand its downtown Portland headquarters . United States National Bank of Portland changed its name to United States National Bank of Oregon in 1964 . By 1970 , the bank was operating 119 branches . At that time , it announced plans for another major expansion of its headquarters on property it had acquired diagonally across from the Wells Fargo Building . The entire oversize block , bounded by 5th and 6th Avenues , and Oak and Burnside Streets , had been acquired , its existing buildings to be razed and replaced by new U.S. National Bank buildings . The first of these was a seven @-@ story building ( the U.S. Bank Plaza , at 5th & Oak ) , completed in 1974 . But the headline structure was the U.S. Bancorp Tower , a 42 @-@ story building that opened in 1983 ( having already been part of the bank 's long @-@ term site plans in 1970 , but ultimately delayed until the 1980s ) . Notwithstanding this major expansion , the firm continued to own and use its landmark 1917 building , which company president LeRoy Staver , in a 1970 Oregonian article , called " a jewel of a banking property and one that will never be duplicated " . 
 In a 1979 article , The Oregonian wrote that , " The 1917 @-@ vintage U.S. National Bank , 321 S.W. Sixth Avenue , retains nearly all its original features , inside and out , a rare trait among Portland landmarks . " The U.S. National Bank of Oregon was honored by the Portland Historical Landmarks Commission in that year for its longstanding commitment to maintaining the building in nearly original condition . 
 The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986 , and was still serving as the bank 's main branch . Since the end of 1968 , United States National Bank of Oregon has been owned by the then @-@ newly formed holding company U.S. Bancorp , which provides consumer banking under the U.S. Bank name . Almost 100 years after its opening , the 1917 @-@ built , 1925 @-@ expanded original United States National Bank Building continues to serve as the main branch of U.S. Bank in Portland in 2016 .

 The building is five stories tall including a mezzanine level and , after its 1925 expansion , occupies a 100 @-@ by @-@ 200 @-@ foot ( 30 m × 61 m ) area , along the north side of SW Stark Street from Sixth Avenue to Broadway . The eastern façade , facing Sixth Avenue , features six freestanding Corinthian columns , each 54 ft ( 16 m ) in height . These support a portico that is topped by a large and richly decorated Roman frieze , a cornice and balustrade . Decorations on the cornice include lion heads and <unk> . At the back of the portico , and behind the columns , are two Corinthian pilasters , at the far left and right ends of the façade . Between these are " five vertical bays separated by piers made of coursed , rusticated terra cotta . Window openings are set in cast @-@ bronze frames . " The five windows at the second @-@ floor level are topped by cast @-@ bronze segmental pediments . There are three entrance doorways in the three central bays , although originally there was only one . The central entrance features a pair of large bronze doors with highly decorated bas relief panels , surrounded by detailed terracotta , including a heraldic eagle in a pedimented cornice above the doorway . The bronze relief panels were cast in 1931 , replacing the 1917 door panels which had used replicas of early Greek , Roman and U.S. coins as a design motif . Designed by Avard Fairbanks , they " depict noble concepts of American life , such as ' Knowledge and Service ' , ' Domestic Welfare ' , ' Progress through Direction ' , and so on . " Fairbanks also designed bronze relief panels for the building 's western façade , built in 1925 . 
 The overall exterior design was modeled closely on a 1904 bank building , the headquarters of the Knickerbocker Trust Company , in New York City . 
 The southern façade , along Stark Street , is 200 ft ( 61 m ) long and features a line of 14 Corinthian pilasters . The 12 window bays on this side have frames made of cast iron . Above the pilasters and fourth @-@ floor windows are a cornice and balustrade with a design similar to that used at the eastern end . The Stark Street side includes one entrance , which was present from 1917 , located at what was then the far back corner of the building , but its position became approximately midway along the Stark Street side following the 1925 expansion . 
 At the building 's west end , constructed eight years later and facing Broadway , the façade is similar to the eastern one , but the main body of the building extends to the corners of the lot , and instead of a full @-@ width portico there is a recessed portico with only two columns in the center . Six pilasters line the eastern façade , three to each side of the columns , all topped by Corinthian capitals , the same as on the building 's other two exposed sides . Another difference from the eastern façade is that , on the western façade , " United States National Bank " is inscribed in the central section of the frieze , in place of the <unk> decoration there at the building 's opposite end . Ornamental bronze lanterns flank the central entrance , which features bas relief panels cast in bronze in 1926 – 27 and designed by Avard Fairbanks . The panels at the western entrance " depict pivotal events in the historical development of the Columbia Basin " .

 The ground floor holds the main banking room ( the Portland branch of U.S. Bank ) , and a grand room measuring 100 by 40 feet ( 30 m × 12 m ) with 30 @-@ foot ( 9 m ) ceilings . The interior is extensively decorated with highly textured materials . Square columns of polished marble topped by Corinthian capitals that incorporate an eagle motif line all four sides of the main public space . The coffered ceiling is intricately detailed . The marble floor is patterned , and the teller windows are divided by Hauteville @-@ marble pillars detailed with bas reliefs . A recessed mezzanine floor runs along the north and south sides , behind the columns . The bank vaults are in the basement , where the public space also has a marble floor . 
 The third and fourth floors are office space , centered around a courtyard . A remodeling of the fourth @-@ floor offices in 1948 , based on designs by Pietro Belluschi , incorporated Oregon myrtle in the paneling and custom furnishings . The bank 's board room , located on the third floor , includes a marble fireplace and stained glass windows by the noted Portland company , Povey Brothers Studio . The room is 55 ft × 30 ft ( 16 @.@ 8 m × 9 @.@ 1 m ) . Its walls are covered in dark walnut . Ornamental lighting fixtures with brass wall mountings adorn the east and west ends of the room , and a bronze ring chandelier hangs above the center .

 At its east end , the United States National Bank Building stands directly across 6th Avenue from another A. E. Doyle @-@ designed bank building , the Bank of California Building , of 1925 . The aforementioned building 's Italianate style contrasts sharply with the U.S. National Bank Building 's classical design . The northbound Portland Transit Mall passes in front of the building 's east end , and during the mall 's construction in 1976 – 77 the plain concrete sidewalk there was resurfaced in brick , and street trees were added . MAX light rail trains have passed in front of the building 's east end on 6th Avenue since 2009 , following a 2007 – 08 rebuilding of the transit mall .

 On September 28 , 2005 , JIVE Records announced through a press release that Spears would release a remix album titled Remixed . However , on November 8 , 2005 , it was reported by Jennifer Vineyard of MTV that the album was actually titled B in the Mix : The Remixes , and was going to be released on November 22 , 2005 . The album includes songs from her previous albums remixed by DJs such as Peter Rauhofer and Stuart Price . Price had previously remixed " Breathe on Me " from In the Zone for a limited edition bonus disc of Spears ' 2004 compilation , Greatest Hits : My Prerogative . B in the Mix : The Remixes also includes one new song , " And Then We Kiss " ; the song had previously been set to be included on a bonus disc of her 2005 DVD Britney & Kevin : Chaotic , but was left out for unknown reasons . B in the Mix : The Remixes had two covers . In the American edition , Spears does not appear on the cover ; there is a butterfly instead . Vineyard noted this saying , " [ the album ] is being marketed in a more underground way than usually associated with a superstar act " . In the international edition , Spears appears behind the butterfly . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The Bill Hamel remix of " Touch of My Hand " is a trance track with elements of ambient . Spears ' voice has been described as " chopped up into skittering syllables and [ ... ] becomes part of the beat " . The album 's fourth track , the Jacques Lu Cont 's Thin White Duke Mix of " Breathe on Me " slows the beat from the original track making the song " darker and dirtier " . The remix style was compared to songs by Kylie Minogue and Madonna . Dave Audé Slave Driver Mix of " I 'm a Slave 4 U " consists of a guitar track and " quirky analog touches " , according to Kurt Kirton of About.com. " And Then We Kiss " contains influences of euro @-@ trance , techno and usage of synthesizers . The song blends dance @-@ rock guitars and symphonic strings and closes with an orchestral overtone . Its lyrics talk about a kiss and the different sensations that the protagonist experiences , including trembling , crying and moaning . At the beginning she sings the lines " Lying alone / touching my skin " which suggest that the whole song may actually be a fantasy . The album 's seventh track , the Valentin remix of " Everytime " contains a serious groove and pounding percussion , with usage of synthesizers . The Jason Nevins remix of " Early Mornin ' " is considered the only hip hop song of B in the Mix : The Remixes .

 B in the Mix : The Remixes received mixed reviews from music critics . Kurt Kirton of About.com highlighted the remixes of " Everytime " and " Don 't Let Me Be the Last to Know " , adding that the album would be better if it included more tracks . He summarized his review saying , " this is a decent release that should please any Britney fan and most club music fanatics " . Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said the album was " even more redundant " than Greatest Hits : My Prerogative , but added that with the exception of " Toxic " , " just about every original track is bettered here " . Spence D. of IGN said , " If you had the choice to purchase only one Britney Spears ' album , then this would be the one to spend your money on . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that " B in the Mix doesn 't exactly erase the impression that Spears isn 't in tune with her recording career " . He also stated that on tracks such as " Toxic " , " her flaws stand out just a bit too much [ ... ] the instrumental hooks have been removed from the record , leaving Spears to carry the day — which she can 't really do . [ ... ] Overall this album sounds and feels like what it really is : a piece of product " . MTV writer Bradley Stern praised the album , saying it " featured loads of excellent remixes stretching from ' ... Baby One More Time ' to ' Toxic ' , but nothing shined quite as bright as the album 's undeniable highlight : ' And Then We Kiss ( Junkie XL Remix ) ' . " 
 Gregg Shapiro of the Bay Area Reporter gave the album a mostly negative review , calling it " hazardous waste " . He also noted that Spears 's voice was " reedy , cold and mechanical " when stripped from the original mixes . However , he highlighted two tracks , saying , " Spears come closest to achieving dance @-@ diva status on the Valentin remix of ' Everytime ' , while the Davidson Ospina 2005 remix of ' Baby One More Time ' elevates the original bubblegum track to club classic " . Mike Daniel of The Dallas Morning News called the Justice remix of " Me Against the Music " the best track of the album , but said it " has the feel of a hastily executed stopgap measure with almost no marketing @-@ related thought behind it except to fulfill the once @-@ every @-@ two @-@ years release cycle that 's been established for Britney material . " Entertainment Weekly writer Leah Greenblatt noted the remixes " amps already @-@ aggressive singles like ' Toxic ' and ' Me Against the Music ' to brain @-@ popping levels of synth spiraling " , and transforms " sad @-@ eyed slow jams like ' Everytime ' and ' Don 't Let Me Be the Last to Know ' into Hi @-@ NRG bursts .

 = Königsberg @-@ class cruiser ( 1905 ) = 
 The Königsberg class was a group of four light cruisers built for the German Imperial Navy . The class comprised four vessels : SMS Königsberg , the lead ship , SMS Nürnberg , SMS Stuttgart , and SMS Stettin . The ships were an improvement on the preceding Bremen class , being slightly larger and faster , and mounting the same armament of ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns and two 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The four ships saw extensive service during World War I. Königsberg conducted commerce warfare in the Indian Ocean before being trapped in the Rufiji River and sunk by British warships . Her guns nevertheless continued to see action as converted artillery pieces for the German Army in German East Africa . Nürnberg was part of the German East Asia Squadron , and participated in the Battles of Coronel and Falkland Islands . At the former , she sank the British armored cruiser HMS Monmouth , and at the latter , she was in turn sunk by the cruiser HMS Kent . 
 Stuttgart and Stettin remained in German waters during the war , and both saw action at the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916 . The two cruisers engaged in close @-@ range night fighting with the British fleet , but neither was significantly damaged . Both ships were withdrawn from service later in the war , Stettin to serve as a training ship , and Stuttgart to be converted into a seaplane tender in 1918 . They both survived the war , and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes ; they were dismantled in the early 1920s . 
 = = Design = = 
 The 1898 Naval Law authorized the construction of 30 new light cruisers by 1904 ; the Gazelle and Bremen classes filled the requirements for the first seventeen vessels . The Königsberg design followed the same general parameters as the two earlier classes , but with significant improvements in terms of size and speed . Like the Bremens , one member of the Königsberg class , Stettin , was fitted with steam turbines to evaluate their performance compared to traditional triple @-@ expansion engines . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The ships of the Königsberg class had slightly different characteristics . The lead ship was 114 @.@ 8 meters ( 377 ft ) long at the waterline and 115 @.@ 3 m ( 378 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 13 @.@ 2 m ( 43 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 29 m ( 17 @.@ 4 ft ) forward . The remaining three ships were 116 @.@ 8 m ( 383 ft ) long at the waterline and 117 @.@ 4 m ( 385 ft ) long overall ; they had a beam of 13 @.@ 3 m ( 44 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 14 to 5 @.@ 4 m ( 16 @.@ 9 to 17 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . Königsberg displaced 3 @,@ 390 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 340 long tons ; 3 @,@ 740 short tons ) as designed and up to 3 @,@ 814 t ( 3 @,@ 754 long tons ; 4 @,@ 204 short tons ) at full combat load . Nürnberg and Stuttgart were designed to displace 3 @,@ 469 t ( 3 @,@ 414 long tons ; 3 @,@ 824 short tons ) , with full load displacements of 3 @,@ 902 t ( 3 @,@ 840 long tons ; 4 @,@ 301 short tons ) and 4 @,@ 002 t ( 3 @,@ 939 long tons ; 4 @,@ 411 short tons ) , respectively . Stettin displaced 3 @,@ 480 t ( 3 @,@ 430 long tons ; 3 @,@ 840 short tons ) as designed and 3 @,@ 822 t ( 3 @,@ 762 long tons ; 4 @,@ 213 short tons ) at combat load . 
 The ships ' hulls were constructed with transverse and longitudinal steel frames , over which the steel outer hull was built . The hulls were divided into thirteen or fourteen watertight compartments . A double bottom ran for forty @-@ seven percent of the length of the keel . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . The ships of the class were good sea boats , but they were crank and rolled up to twenty degrees . They were also very wet at high speeds and suffered from a slight weather helm ; in the case of Stuttgart , she suffered from quite severe weather helm . The ships ' metacentric height was <unk> to .65 m ( 1 ft 9 in to 2 ft 2 in ) . The ships had a crew of fourteen officers and 308 enlisted men . They carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one barge , one cutter , two yawls , and two dinghies . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The first three Königsberg @-@ class ships ' propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines rated at 13 @,@ 200 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 800 kW ) for a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . Stettin was instead equipped with a pair of Parsons steam turbines , rated at 13 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 10 @,@ 100 kW ) and a top speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . Each ship exceeded their design speed by at least half a knot on speed trials , however . All four ships ' engines were powered by eleven coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type boilers , which were trunked into three funnels . The ships were designed to carry 400 t ( 390 long tons ; 440 short tons ) of coal , though they could store up to 880 t ( 870 long tons ; 970 short tons ) . Königsberg could steam for 5 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 650 km ; 6 @,@ 620 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , while the other three ships ' ranges were considerably shorter . Nürnberg and Stuttgart could cruise for 4 @,@ 120 nmi ( 7 @,@ 630 km ; 4 @,@ 740 mi ) at the same speed , and Stettin had a range of 4 @,@ 170 nmi ( 7 @,@ 720 km ; 4 @,@ 800 mi ) . Königsberg had two electricity generators , while the other three ships were equipped with three generators . The generators produced a total output of 90 and 135 kilowatts at 100 volts , respectively . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 The ships were armed with ten 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 40 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , six were located amidships , three on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 500 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . Königsberg later had a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns installed . The last three ships were also equipped with eight 5 @.@ 2 cm SK L / 55 guns with 4 @,@ 000 rounds of ammunition . All four ships were also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . 
 Armor protection for the members of the class consisted of two layers of steel with one layer of Krupp armor . The ships of the Königsberg class were protected by an armored deck that was 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick amidships , and reduced to 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick aft . Sloped armor 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) thick gave a measure of vertical protection . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm thick roof . The ships ' guns were protected with 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick gun shields . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The first three ships of the class were built by government shipyards . Königsberg was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in 1905 , launched on 12 December 1905 , and commissioned into the German Navy on 6 April 1907 . Nürnberg was also laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel , in 1906 . Her launching occurred on 28 August 1906 , and she was commissioned on 10 April 1908 . Stuttgart was built by the Imperial Dockyard in Danzig . She was laid down in 1905 , launched on 22 September 1906 , and commissioned on 1 February 1908 . Stettin was the only ship of the class built by a private shipbuilding firm , by AG Vulcan in her namesake city . She was laid down in 1906 , launched on 7 March 1907 , and commissioned just seven months later on 29 October 1907 . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The ships of the Königsberg class served with the High Seas Fleet after their <unk> , though Stuttgart also saw service as a gunnery training ship . Nürnberg and Königsberg were deployed overseas in 1910 and 1914 , respectively . Nürnberg was sent to the East Asia Squadron , while Königsberg went to east African waters . Stuttgart and Stettin meanwhile remained in Germany . 
 All four ships had active careers during World War I and saw action at many major battles during the conflict . At the outbreak of war , Königsberg was stationed in German East Africa ; she was ordered to begin raiding British commerce in the region . She was relatively unsuccessful in this regard , having sunk only the British freighter City of Winchester . She did , however , surprise the British cruiser HMS Pegasus in harbor and sank her in the Battle of Zanzibar . She was then blockaded in the Rufiji River and eventually destroyed by two British monitors , HMS Mersey and HMS Severn . Königsberg 's guns were removed from the wreck and mounted on improvised gun carriages and used in German East Africa during the World War I land campaign . 
 Nürnberg was still assigned to the East Asia Squadron under Admiral Maximilian von Spee when war broke out . Initially based in Tsingtao , China , the squadron crossed the Pacific in an attempt to raid British commerce off South America . The ship saw action at the Battle of Coronel in November 1914 where a British squadron attempted to intercept the German flotilla . There she sank the British armored cruiser HMS Monmouth . The following month during the Battle of the Falkland Islands , Nürnberg was sunk by the armored cruiser HMS Kent , part of another British squadron sent to hunt down Spee 's squadron . 
 Stettin and Stuttgart both saw action with the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea . Stettin participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914 , and suffered relatively minor damage . Both cruisers participated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916 . Stettin was hit twice but was not badly damaged during the night , while Stuttgart emerged from the battle unscathed . Both ships were withdrawn from service in 1917 ; Stettin was used as a training ship , while Stuttgart was converted into a seaplane tender in 1918 . The two ships survived the war and were surrendered to Britain as war prizes ; they were later broken up for scrap in the early 1920s .

 Marceline the Vampire Queen is a character in the American animated television series Adventure Time created by Pendleton Ward . She is voiced by Olivia Olson in most appearances , by Ava Acres as a child and by Cloris Leachman as an old woman . Marceline is a fun @-@ loving 1 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old trickster vampire queen . The name " Marceline " is based on the middle name of a childhood friend of Ward 's , Marie . The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward , with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda , former lead @-@ character designer and prop designer for Adventure Time . Unlike a traditional vampire , Marceline does not need to drink blood to survive ; rather , she eats the color red . Marceline is a musician who plays an electric bass that she made from her family 's heirloom battle @-@ axe . 
 The character makes her debut in the first season episode " Evicted ! " and functions as an antagonist , forcing Finn and Jake from their home . However , as the series progresses , Marceline becomes a close friend to Finn and Jake . Information regarding her early life remains sparse as of 2015 ; however , her demon @-@ father Hunson Abadeer ( voiced by Olivia 's real @-@ life father , Martin Olson ) has appeared in several episodes . In addition , Marceline was the focus of a miniseries entitled Stakes , which aired during the show 's seventh season . 
 Marceline has been critically acclaimed and is popular with fans of Adventure Time . Ward himself has stated that Marceline is his favorite character in the series because he does not know everything about her history and backstory , which he noted adds a mysterious element to her character . Despite the positivity , the episodes " What Was Missing " and " Sky Witch " became somewhat controversial because of an implied past relationship between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline . 
 = = Creation and design = = 
 Marceline is one of the major characters in Adventure Time . Although she did not appear in the series ' pilot , the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book , penned by series creator Pendleton Ward . Marceline 's name is based on the name of a childhood friend of Ward 's , Marie , whose middle name is Marceline . Ward described Marie as someone who likes the horror movie Psycho and wears dark clothing . Ward purposely set out to make Marceline 's character complex , as he explained that " with the female characters it ’ s easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés [ … ] I just try to make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have . " 
 Marceline is voiced by Olivia Olson . Olivia 's father Martin Olson was an acquaintance of Ward , and Olivia was encouraged to audition for Adventure Time after Ward told her father that he wanted " her as a voice " on his show . She had originally auditioned for the role of Princess Bubblegum . After her initial audition , she was asked to read for the role of Marceline , and was " definitely impressed by the character " after seeing design drawings . Martin Olson later noted that Olivia 's audition was a " sham " to please the network executives because Ward had already wanted her to be a voice on the show . In order to get into character , Olson often dresses in a manner similar to Marceline when she records her lines ; she explained , " I always find ... that on the days that I go in to record Marceline , I ’ ll dress like her , in a weird way ... I ’ ll throw on some rock n ’ roll boots , maybe some red lipstick , and just go in there . " Olson also is the character 's singing voice . According to storyboard artist Cole Sanchez , composers Casey James Basichis and Tim Kiefer produce the bass music that the character performs in the series . Many of the songs written for Marceline were uploaded onto the internet by the writers as well as the production company . For instance , Rob Sugar — the father of former storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar — often uploaded demos of songs written for Marceline by Rebecca . Furthermore , Frederator also posted demos , as well as a full version of the popular " Fry Song " , sung by Marceline in the episode " It Came from the Nightosphere " , on its official blog . In flashback sequences , younger Marceline is voiced by Ava Acres . In the fifth season episodes " Finn the Human " and " Jake the Dog " , an older , alternate universe version of the character is voiced by Cloris Leachman . Martin Olson also provides the voice for Marceline 's demonic father Hunson Abadeer . Olivia Olson later noted that the opportunity to voice act with her father was " pretty cool ” . 
 The design for Marceline was created by Ward , with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda , former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time . Visually , Marceline has long , dark hair . She rarely walks on the ground , generally preferring to float when she travels , moves , and sleeps . Marceline , unlike many of the other characters , wears varying outfits in most of her appearances . According to Ward , her clothing changes from episode to episode because " girls own more than one outfit " . Olson was impressed by her character 's fashion design stating , " she has really cool style [ … ] I love what they come up with [ in ] every episode . " Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode , she is " totally surprised " by the costuming for Marceline . While she says her lines , she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs . Marceline 's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her . Rynda later called this " one of the coolest parts " about the character 's animation due to the fact that " every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw . "

 Roughly a thousand years prior to the events of the series , Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer ( voiced by Martin Olson ) and a human woman ( voiced by Rebecca Sugar ) . Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere — a Hell @-@ like demon dimension — and subsists on the souls of sentient beings . For some reason , Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War , a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series . During this time , Simon Petrikov — the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown — found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up . The two developed a caring relationship , although the crown took a toll on Simon 's mental health , forcing him to leave Marceline alone . During this period in her life , she was reunited with her father , only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways . Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics , she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself . In the following years , Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans . She became their guardian and ally , and she helped them kill vampires , who had taken over much of the land . Marceline soon discovered that , upon killing a vampire , she was able to acquire their unique abilities . However , when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself , she was bitten . Although she eventually managed to slay him , she was turned in the process . At some point , she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash . The two would move into the Tree Fort , but their relationship would come to an end . Presumably , around this time , Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum ; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom 's elaborate rock candy mining complex . Eventually , however , Bubblegum pushed Marceline away , leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while . 
 In the series ' present , Marceline eventually comes into contact with Finn and Jake in the episode " Evicted ! " , when she forces them from their home . In the episode " Henchman " , Marceline tricks Finn into becoming her accomplice , but Finn soon discovers that she is not evil , but rather fond of mischief and pranks , and the two develop a friendship . In the second season premiere " It Came From the Nightosphere " , Abadeer is accidentally summoned to Ooo by Finn . While Abadeer ravages the land , Finn discovers that there is animosity between Marceline and her father . Finn manages to distract Abadeer by playing a recording of Marceline 's " Fry Song " , which leads to a brief moment of reconciliation between the two before Finn sends him back to the Nightosphere . In the third season episode " Memory of a Memory " , Ash attempts to rekindle his former relationship with Marceline via trickery . Disguised as Marceline 's " spirit animal " , he tricks Finn and Jake into believing that Marceline has fallen asleep due to a sleep spell that has been self @-@ inflicted . Following Ash 's advice , the two enter into Marceline 's mind to retrieve the " memory core " in an attempt to wake her up . Along the way , they encounter various memories of her as a child in the aftermath of the Mushroom War . However , the duo soon learn that it was an elaborate trick by Ash ; Finn and Jake actually removed Marceline 's memory of their break @-@ up . In the end , Finn is able to convince Marceline , and she promptly attacks her chauvinistic ex @-@ boyfriend . In " What Was Missing " , past animosity between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum is explored when Finn , Jake , Princess Bubblegum , BMO , and Marceline form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what was stolen from them . 
 In " Daddy 's Little Monster " , Marceline 's dad returns and gives her an amulet that causes her to become the demonic and evil overlord of the Nightosphere . After an ordeal , Finn saves Marceline from the amulet . Marceline admits that all she wants is for her father to understand her . When Finn wishes for an alternate reality in which the Lich never existed during the events of the fifth season premiere " Finn the Human " , a universe is created in which the Mushroom War was prevented by Simon Petrikov and Marceline never became a vampire . She appears in the episode as an extremely frail and aged half @-@ demon , who was killed when a " mutagenic bomb " that was frozen in ice by Simon Petrikov detonates . Jake manages to undo this reality with his wish and sets everything back to the way it was . In " Sky Witch " , Marceline enlists the help of Princess Bubblegum , and the two are able to track down Maja , the titular Sky Witch . It is revealed that Ash sold Hambo to Maja . Only when Bubblegum trades her beloved rock shirt — which was given to her by Marceline — is Hambo able to be reunited with Marceline . After the events of " Sky Witch " , Bubblegum and Marceline are on much friendlier ground , and their friendship is completely reaffirmed in the seventh season episode " <unk> " . In " Betty " , Marceline sacrifices Hambo so that Ice King — who lost his powers and became Simon Petrikov again — can open a portal into time so that Simon can reconcile with his estranged fiancee Betty .
