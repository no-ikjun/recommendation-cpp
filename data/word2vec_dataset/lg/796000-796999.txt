 = = Culture = = 
 Culture in the Anuradhapura Kingdom was largely based on Buddhism with the slaughter of animals for food considered low and unclean . As a result , animal husbandry , except for the rearing of buffalo and cattle , was uncommon . Elephants and horses were prestige symbols , and could only be afforded by the nobility . The skills needed to train and care for these animals were highly regarded . Cattle and buffalo were used for ploughing and preparing paddy fields . Dairy products formed an important part of people 's diets while Pali and Sinhala literature often refer to five products obtained from the cow : milk , curd , buttermilk , ghee and butter . Bullocks and bullock carts were also used for transport . 
 Metalwork was an important and well @-@ developed craft , and metal tools such as axes , <unk> and hoes were widely used . Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military . A good indication of the development of metalwork of this period is the Lovamahapaya , which had been roofed entirely with copper . 
 Villages were usually concentrated around irrigation reservoirs to enable easy access to water for agriculture . Houses stood immediately below the reservoir embankment , between the water and the paddy fields below . This facilitated easy control of the water supply to the fields and also supported maintenance of domestic gardens for fruit and vegetable production . A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings , paddy fields , a reservoir , a grazing ground , shift crop reserves and a village forest . In areas of high rainfall , a perennial watercourse often took the place of the reservoir . Inland fishing was widespread during the Anuradhapura Kingdom period because of the numerous reservoirs . Although not entirely absent , sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland . 
 Women appear to have been allowed considerable freedom and independence during this period . Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother 's advice during his military campaign . Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples for the use of the sangha . However , there are no records of women holding any administrative posts . It is not clear if women were given equal footing with men , but they did have complete freedom in religious matters . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 After the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa , it spread throughout the country under his patronage . After this , the rulers were expected to be the protectors of Buddhism in the country and it became a legitimizing factor of royal authority . Three fraternities of Buddhism had come into existence by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom ; Mahavihara , Abhayagiri and Jetavana . Mahavihara was established immediately after the introduction of Buddhism to the country . Representing the Theravada teachings , it remained strictly conventional throughout the Anuradhapura Kingdom . The Abhayagiri fraternity , established after <unk> was built , represented several schools of Buddhist thought . It did not restrict itself to Theravada and accepted Mahayana and Tantric ideas as well . Little evidence exists on the Jetavana fraternity which was established after the <unk> was built , later than the other two . However , it too was receptive to new and more liberal views regarding Buddhism . 
 Rulers sponsored Theravada and often took steps to stop the spreading of Mahayana beliefs . Rulers such as Aggabodhi I , Kashyapa V ( 914 – 923 ) and Mahinda IV ( 956 – 972 ) promulgated disciplinary rules for the proper conduct of the Sangha . <unk> Tissa and <unk> ( 249 – 262 ) expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views . A change in this occurred when Mahasena embraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions . However , he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him . As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined , Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread , however , Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine . 
 Followers of Hinduism were also present to some extent during the Anuradhapura Kingdom . There were a number of them in Rajarata during Elara 's reign . Mahasen destroyed several Hindu temples during his reign in the 2nd century . Particularly Indian merchant communities living near ports such as <unk> and <unk> were followers of Hinduism and Hindu temples were constructed in these areas . By the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom , large Hindu temples such as the <unk> temple had been constructed . Historical sources indicate that there were also Jains in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 from the 3rd century BC to 3rd century AD , inscriptions are recorded in the <unk> script . This gradually developed into the modern <unk> script , but this was not complete by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom . The first reference in historical sources to any written work is about 80 BC , but both Sinhala and Pali literature existed even two centuries before this , if not earlier . The oldest Sinhala literature is found at Sigiriya . Poems written from the 6th century to the end of the <unk> kingdom are found among the graffiti on the mirror wall at Sigiriya . Most of these verses are describing or even addressed to the female figures depicted in the frescoes of Sigiriya . The majority of these poems have been written between the 8th and 10th centuries . 
 Only three Sinhala books survive from the Anuradhapura period . One of them , <unk> , was written in the 9th or 10th century on the art of poetry and is based on the Sanskrit <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> is another , and is a glossary for the Pali <unk> , providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words . The third book is Mula <unk> Ha <unk> , a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks . Both these have been written during the last two centuries of the Anuradhapura period . 
 During the reign of Valagamba , the Pali Tripitaka was written in palm leaves . Several commentaries on Buddhism , known as <unk> have also been written during the reign of <unk> ( 406 – 428 ) . Pali chronicles such as Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa have been written during the Anuradhapura Kingdom , and are still useful as resources for studying the history of the country . 
 = = = Art = = = 
 The Sigiriya Frescoes found at Sigiriya , Sri Lanka were painted during the reign of King Kashyapa I ( ruled 477 — 495 AD ) . Depicting female figures carrying flowers , they are the oldest surviving paintings of the Anuradhapura period . Various theories exist as to who are shown in these paintings . Some suggest that they are apsaras ( celestial nymphs ) , others suggest that they are the ladies of the king 's court or even a representation of lightning and rain clouds . Although they bear some similarity to the paintings of Ajanta in India , there are significant differences in style and composition suggesting that these are examples of a distinctive Sri Lankan school of art . 
 Paintings from a cave at <unk> date back to the late Anuradhapura period , and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya paintings . The paintings of Sigiriya and <unk> are the only surviving specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom . However , remnants of paintings indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of stupas and <unk> were also painted . <unk> had employed painters to decorate the Ruwanweli Seya when his brother Dutthagamani wanted to see it on his death bed . 
 Statue making , most noticeably statues of the Buddha , was an art perfected by the Sri Lankan sculptors during the Anuradhapura Kingdom . The earliest Buddha statues belonging to the Anuradhapura period date back to the 1st century AD . Standard postures such as Abhaya Mudra , Dhyana Mudra , <unk> Mudra and Kataka Mudra were used when making these statues . The Samadhi statue in Anuradhapura , considered one of the finest examples of ancient Sri Lankan art , shows the Buddha in a seated position in deep meditation , and is sculpted from dolomite marble and is datable to the 4th century . The <unk> statue is similar to this , and dates to the later stages of the Anuradhapura Kingdom . Notable standing Buddha statues dating from the Anuradhapura period include the ones at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> statue is the tallest in the country , standing at 50 feet ( 15 m ) . All these statues are carved out of rock . 
 The carvings at <unk> are some of the best examples of the stone carving art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom . Skill in arts was a respected and valued trait during this period and artists were well rewarded by the rulers . The Mahavamsa records that <unk> II ( 328 – 337 ) was himself skilled in stone and ivory carving . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 The construction of stupas was noticeable not only during the Anuradhapura Kingdom but throughout the history of Sri Lanka . <unk> were built enshrining an object of worship . The stupa of <unk> , built by Devanampiya Tissa , is one of the earliest built and was constructed immediately after the arrival of Buddhism . The construction of large stupas was begun by King Dutthagamani with the construction of the Ruwanweli Seya , standing 300 feet ( 91 m ) high with a circumference of 298 feet ( 91 m ) . 
 The Anuradhapura <unk> which date from the early centuries of the Anuradhapura period , are of such colossal proportions that they constitute the largest structures of their type anywhere in the Buddhist World , even rivaling the Pyramids of Egypt in size . 
 The Abhayagiri stupa in the <unk> monastic complex is another large stupa of the Anuradhapura period the original height of which was 350 feet ( 110 m ) . The Jetavana stupa , constructed by Mahasen , is the largest in the country . <unk> had deep and well constructed foundations , and the builders were clearly aware of the attributes of the materials used for construction . Suitable methods for each type of material have been used to lay foundations on a firm basis . 
 All buildings have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and were supported by large stone columns . These stone columns can be seen in several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya ( brazen palace ) . Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned , and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits . Large ponds were attached to some monasteries , such as the <unk> <unk> ( twin pond ) . Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries . Buildings were constructed using timber , bricks and stones . Stones were used for foundations and columns , while brick were used for walls . Lime mortar was used for plastering walls . 
 = = Irrigation and water management = = 
 Rainfall in the dry zone of Sri Lanka is limited to 50 @-@ 75 inches . Under these conditions , rain fed cultivation was difficult , forcing early settlers to develop means to store water in order to maintain a constant supply of water for their cultivations . Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level , to support the cultivations of that village . The earliest medium @-@ scale irrigation tank is the <unk> reservoir built by King Pandukabhaya . Nuwara wewa and Tissa <unk> reservoirs were constructed a century later . These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers . 
 Construction of large scale reservoirs began in the 1st century AD under the direction of Vasabha . The <unk> canal , constructed by damming the <unk> river to divert water to the west for 30 miles ( 48 km ) , was constructed during this period . Among the reservoirs constructed during the reign of Vasabha , <unk> and <unk> reservoirs both have circumferences of about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) . During the reign of Mahasen , the <unk> canal was widened and lengthened to supply water to the newly constructed Minneriya tank , which covered 4 @,@ 670 acres ( 18 @.@ 9 km2 ) and had a 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 @.@ 01 km ) long and 44 feet ( 13 m ) high embankment . He was named <unk> <unk> ( god of Minneriya ) for this construction and is still referred to as such by the people in that area . The <unk> reservoir , <unk> canal and <unk> reservoir were among the large irrigation constructions carried out during this period . These constructions contributed immensely to the improvement of agriculture in the northern and eastern parts of the dry zone . Reservoirs were also constructed using tributaries of the <unk> Oya during this period , thereby supplying water to the south western part of the dry zone . This conservation and distribution of water resources ensured that the water supply was sufficient throughout the dry zone . James Emerson Tennent described the ancient irrigation network as : 
 ... there seems every reason to believe that from their own subsequent experience and the prodigious extent to which they occupied themselves in the formulation of works of this kind , they attained a facility unsurpassed by the people of any other country . 
 The water resources of the dry zone were further exploited during the times of <unk> I and Dhatusena . The construction of the Kala wewa , covering an area of 6 @,@ 380 acres ( 25 @.@ 8 km2 ) with an embankment 3 @.@ 75 miles ( 6 @.@ 04 km ) long and 40 feet ( 12 m ) high , was done during Dhatusena 's reign . A 54 miles ( 87 km ) canal named the Jayaganga carries water from the Kala wewa to the Tissa <unk> and feeds a network of smaller canals . The construction of this network is also attributed to Dhatusena . The Jayaganga supplied water to 180 square kilometres of paddy fields . By the end of the 5th century , two major irrigation networks , one supported by the Mahaweli river and the other by <unk> Oya and Kala Oya , were covering the Rajarata area . The Mahavamsa records that many other rulers constructed a number of irrigation tanks , some of which have not yet been identified . By the 8th century , large tanks such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> had come into existence , further expanding the <unk> network . However , from the 8th century to the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom , there wasn 't much activity in construction of irrigation works . 
 = = = Technology = = = 
 Advanced technology was required for the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals . When constructing reservoirs , the gaps between low ridges in the dry zone plains were used for damming water courses . Two different techniques were used in construction ; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs . All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network , so that excess water from one will flow into the other . The locations of these constructions indicate that the ancient engineers were aware of geological formations in the sites as well , and made effective use of them . Underground conduits have also been constructed to supply water to and from artificial ponds , such as in the <unk> <unk> and the ponds at Sigiriya . 
 The 54 miles ( 87 km ) long Jayaganga has a gradient of six inches to the mile , which indicates that the builders had expert knowledge and accurate measuring devices to achieve the minimum gradient in the water flow . The construction of <unk> , a cistern sluice used to control the outward flow of water in reservoirs , indicates a major advancement in irrigation technology . Since the 3rd century , these sluices , made of brick and stone , were placed at various levels in the embankments of reservoirs . 
 = = Military = = 
 During the early stages , the Anuradhapura Kingdom did not have a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers . These were assigned for guarding the capital and the royal palace . The King had the right to demand an able bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom . In times of war , a larger army was formed using this method . An army consisted of four main divisions ; an elephant corps , cavalry , chariots and infantry . This combination was called <unk> Sena ( fourfold army ) . However , the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen , spearmen and archers . 
 When such an army was prepared , it was commanded by several generals . The Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the army was usually a member of nobility . The King and his generals led the army from the front during battles , mounted on elephants . The major cities of the kingdom were defended with defensive walls and moats . Sieges , often lasting several months , were common during warfare . Single combat between the opposing kings or commanders , mounted on elephants , often decided the outcome of the battle . 
 South Indian mercenaries were often employed in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages . <unk> and <unk> I ( 491 – 508 ) obtained the assistance of the Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne . However , the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods , such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king . Gajabahu I also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12 @,@ 000 captives , and brought back 12 @,@ 000 prisoners as well as the freed captives . Surprisingly however , a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom , and one was rarely maintained . This would have been the first line of defence for the island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India . 
 = Graduados = 
 Graduados ( English : The Graduates ) is a 2012 Argentine telenovela which was broadcast by Telefe from March 12 to December 19 . The plot concerns a group of people who graduated from high school in 1989 and reunite twenty years later . The main character , Andrés Goddzer ( Daniel Hendler ) , discovers that María Laura Falsini ( Nancy Dupláa ) was pregnant in 1989 and married Pablo Catáneo ( Luciano Cáceres ) , who thought that he was the child 's father . The resulting parental dispute , the love triangle of the main characters and 1980s nostalgia are frequent plot elements , and story arcs related to school bullying and LGBT rights are also featured . The frequent flashbacks of the characters to their high @-@ school days use the same actors , playing teenagers . 
 The series , written by Sebastián Ortega , was produced by Endemol and Underground <unk> . Although Andy Kusnetzoff was offered the lead @-@ character role , Hendler was cast when Kusnetzoff turned it down ( the latter joined the cast several months later as another character ) . The telenovela featured cameos and guest appearances by Argentine rock musicians and other celebrities . Graduados was widely successful , prevailing in the ratings over the blockbuster competitive dance program Showmatch and the telenovela Sos mi hombre . Although it received the 2012 Golden Martín Fierro award , seven other Martín Fierro Awards and ten <unk> Awards ( including Program of the Year ) , plans for theatrical and film adaptions were abandoned . The telenovela 's proposed second season was renamed Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll , with most of the cast and similar storylines . Local versions of the series have been made in Chile , Colombia and Greece . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A group of high @-@ school students graduates in 1989 . María Laura Falsini ( Nancy Dupláa ) is the girlfriend of Pablo Catáneo ( Luciano Cáceres ) , the school bully . When María Laura sees Pablo having sex in the bathroom with another girl during the graduation party , she leaves the party . Andrés Goddzer ( Daniel Hendler ) accompanies her , and they have sex in his car . María Laura becomes pregnant and her father , Clemente Falsini ( Juan Leyrado ) , owner of McCan , a successful dog @-@ food company , orders her to marry Pablo — unaware of her encounter with Andrés . 
 The first episode then makes a <unk> from 1989 to 2012 . Pablo works for Clemente 's company , and Andrés is a slacker without a stable job who works as dog walker . María Laura hires Andrés by chance , and remembers their 1989 encounter ; a DNA test confirms that Andrés ( not Pablo ) is the father of her son , Martín . These events give the series its basic plot : Andrés tries to adjust to his newly discovered paternity , Pablo resents his intrusion , Martín tries to stay on good terms with both of them and María Laura begins a romance with Andrés . Pablo cheats on her with Patricia Longo ( Isabel Macedo ) , Clemente 's wife and secretary . She becomes pregnant by Pablo , but claims that Clemente is her son 's father . 
 Andrés ' family is Jewish . His parents are Elías ( Roberto Carnaghi ) and Dana ( Mirta Busnelli ) , and his sister Gabriela ( Violeta Urtizberea ) works at McCan and has been unlucky in love . Andrés maintains his friendship with two high @-@ school classmates : Benjamín " Tuca " Pardo ( Mex Urtizberea ) and Verónica Diorio ( Julieta Ortega ) , who runs a radio station which plays 1980s Argentine rock music . María Laura keeps in touch with her best friend in high school : psychiatrist Victoria Lauría ( Paola Barrientos ) , a single woman looking for a couple with whom to have a surrogate child . Guillermo Almada ( Juan Gil Navarro ) , another classmate , takes a job at McCan and comes out during a meeting of the graduates . Clemente 's wife Patricia is , unknown to everybody else , another classmate . Obese at school , she lost weight and changed her face and name . 
 Patricia 's secret is slowly revealed to the other characters . Pablo learns her true identity in the series finale , and they stay together . Andrés and Maria Laura leave the city ; Victoria has a son with Tuca ; Elías and Dana open a <unk> shop and Gabriela marries her neighbor , <unk> ( Alan Sabbagh ) . The series ends with a party hosted by the school for the 1989 graduates , similar to the graduation party in the first episode .

 Graduados refers frequently to the 1980s ( the decade in which the main characters attended high school ) , using 1980s Argentine slang and flashbacks to evoke nostalgia . The series uses 1980s music — in particular , Argentine rock — and several Argentine musicians made cameo appearances . Graduados was part of a trend in 2012 Argentine television toward nostalgia . According to Argentine consumer @-@ trends consultant Ximena Díaz Alarcón , " The 80s are nowadays far enough to be idealized and close enough to laugh about the earlier versions of oneself " . Psychologist and consumer @-@ trends consultant Mariela <unk> also suggested that the show 's structure invited viewers to compare their lives with the plans they made when they were younger . 
 Graduados had scripts written by Ernesto <unk> , Silvina <unk> and Alejandro Quesada . Although it was primarily a comedy , it also had a dramatic approach to LGBT rights and school bullying . In Clarín , Adriana <unk> praised its transitions from dramatic to comic scenes , its acting and scripts and its faithfulness to the characters ' profiles . 
 = = = Creation and cast = = = 
 Graduados was created by Sebastián Ortega with the working title of El <unk> ( Spanish : The Dog Walker ) , a planned miniseries about a character and his group of friends . The writers gradually expanded the storyline , incorporating more characters and story arcs . Although Andy Kusnetzoff turned down a starring role in the show because of his work at Radio Metro , he made cameo appearances in six episodes and later became a regular character . Mike <unk> was offered the lead @-@ protagonist and lead @-@ antagonist roles , but declined both . Relative unknown Daniel Hendler was finally selected to play Andrés ; he had already been cast as the secondary character Tuca , who was played by Mex Urtizberea after Hendler was recast as Andrés . The character of Verónica Diorio was initially written for actress Verónica Lozano , who turned down the role . Julieta Ortega , initially cast as Victoria Lauría , replaced Lozano and Victoria was played by stage actress Paola Barrientos . <unk> Rivas and Ludovico Di Santo also turned down roles in the series and their characters were played by Nancy Dupláa and Marco Antonio Caponi , respectively . 
 Juan Leyrado played a grandfather for the first time in his career . Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather ( a secondary character ) , his character has a prominent role and his own story arcs . Leyrado , who was 60 years old when the series was made , said that he was still active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences . Korean @-@ Argentine Chang Kim Sung , who played Walter Mao , said he was proud that his character did not conform to stereotypes of Asian people . 
 Although Mex and Violeta Urtizberea are father and daughter , Violeta accepted a role in the series without knowing that her father was also part of the cast and asked him to respect her space . Although they played characters of similar ages , they rarely have joint scenes . Julieta Ortega said that she has nothing in common with her character in the series . Juan Gil Navarro , who appeared in the television drama La <unk> at the same time , said that although he does not normally appear in comedies he followed his wife 's suggestion . 
 Isabel Macedo had played several villains , including in <unk> , and took the Patricia Longo @-@ Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had not done before . Although Patricia 's past identity as Jimena was intended to be a secret for only ten episodes , Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time . She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series , becoming emotionally attached to her character .

 The series includes a homosexual character , Guillermo Almada ( Juan Gil Navarro ) , who came out in the early episodes and later married his partner in a ceremony featuring guest appearances by Evangelina Salazar and Luis <unk> . This was the first fictional same @-@ sex marriage on Argentine television since it was legalized in 2010 , reflected the growing acceptance of sexual freedom in Argentina . Another character , Patricia Longo , was an obese girl who was a victim of school bullying . Isabel Macedo had to be heavily made up to appear obese for the flashbacks . Patricia was initially the telenovela 's villain , with the bullying her motivation for inflicting revenge on her former classmates . The episode in which she reveals her true identity was well received . 
 = = = = Flashbacks = = = = 
 The high @-@ school years of the main characters are depicted in flashbacks , a recurring element . For comic effect , the flashbacks were filmed with the actors who played the adult characters instead of younger actors . One episode includes a reenactment of the 1980s game show Feliz <unk> para la <unk> , with an appearance by host Silvio <unk> . This episode also features a guest appearance by Andy Kusnetzoff , who later joined the regular cast . Another episode has a flashback set in <unk> , an Argentine theme park which closed in 1990 . Since the <unk> rides are now in Luján , the production moved there to shoot those scenes . 
 One episode includes a flashback to San Carlos de Bariloche , the location of the graduation trip ( an Argentine prom tradition ) . Pablo <unk> made a guest appearance as the trip 's coordinator , and fans of the show were selected in an internet competition to join the trip to Bariloche as extras . Another flashback features the Pumper Nic fast @-@ food restaurant and a guest appearance by sportswriter Juan Pablo <unk> . Not all flashbacks are focused on the 1980s or high school ; some are events from a character 's adolescence , such as the shotgun wedding of María Laura and Pablo or her 15th birthday . 
 = = = = Music = = = = 
 The program uses 1980s music ( usually Argentine rock ) extensively , and several Argentine musicians from the decade were invited to make cameo appearances . Charly García appears in one episode , discussing the lyrics of his song " <unk> <unk> " ( " Collective Unconscious " ) with the characters . Fito Páez appears in a flashback , meeting María Laura during a sound check and asking her opinion of his new song " 11 y 6 " . Páez resurrected his 1980s look , which differs slightly from his current appearance . 
 Musician Emanuel Ortega , brother of producer Sebastián Ortega , appeared ( as himself ) as Victoria Lauría 's patient . Similar plots were used in other episodes , with guest stars appearing as themselves ; Victoria Lauría 's character became a psychologist with famous clients , such as soccer player Martín Palermo , tennis player Gastón Gaudio , model Luciana Salazar and soccer agent Guillermo Coppola . All performing members of the Ortega family made cameos on the series . 
 Bahiano , the former singer of Los Pericos , made a cameo appearance in the Spring Day episode and played " El ritual de la banana " ( " Ritual of the Banana " , Los Pericos ' first hit ) . Bahiano left the band in 2005 , and did not maintain a good relationship with them . Los Pericos sent a cease and desist letter to the production team and complained on Twitter about the episode . Bahiano dismissed their reaction as jealousy . The Spring Day episode also included a cameo by Los Twist , who played their hit " El <unk> " ( " The Student " ) . The scene , filmed in Tigre , also included a cameo by Lalo Mir . 
 = = = = Holidays and observances = = = = 
 Holidays ( such as Spring Day ) were part of the plot of an episode aired that day , unless the holiday fell over a weekend . Since the <unk> are a Jewish family , Jewish holidays are included . On July 18 the 1994 AMIA bombing , when the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association was destroyed in a terrorist attack , was mentioned when Elías said he would attend the annual protest of the unsolved case 's handling . Minor Jewish characters ( such as relatives and friends ) returned for Rosh Hashanah , the Jewish New Year celebration . Its Jewish characters and the number of Argentine and Latin American expatriates in Israel helped Graduados obtain good ratings in Israel . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The first episode of Graduados was a ratings success , scoring nearly 28 points . Subsequent episodes continued to receive high ratings and El Trece , Telefe 's main rival for prime @-@ time ratings , competed with Graduados by moving its blockbuster program Showmatch an hour earlier ( opposite Graduados ) . The move was unsuccessful , with Graduados more highly rated than Showmatch before and after the change . Showmatch returned to its original time slot and El Trece aired a new series , Sos mi hombre , opposite Graduados . Sos mi hombre 's premiere episode was outscored by Graduados , 26 to 18 @.@ 4 ; according to El Trece this was not a disappointment , since its target rating was 17 @-@ 19 points . Graduados maintained its lead in the ratings for the rest of the season . 
 It was a multi @-@ target success , with an audience not limited to viewers in their forties as the focus on 1980s nostalgia might have indicated . This countered a contemporary trend in series television to target a specific audience demographic . The plots include characters and situations for all ages , and the series ' general tone is family @-@ friendly . Although it includes a number of flashbacks , the scripts did not limit the actors to a 1980s viewpoint ; according to consultant Mariela <unk> , the show reflects more modern realities ( such as men showing their emotions and women having greater autonomy in their lives ) than TV shows of the 1980s did . 
 The series finale was broadcast from the Gran Rex Theater in a ceremony attended by fans who obtained tickets in a raffle on the Telefe website . The cast ( except for Ortega and Urtizberea , who were out of the country ) attended the performance , watching the episode from a VIP room in the theater , appearing on stage after the episode ended to thank the audience . Also in attendance were actors and musicians who had made guest appearances on the show during the year , including Pablo Ruiz ( the singer of Vilma Palma e <unk> ) , Sandra <unk> , Luciana Salazar , Luisa Albinoni and Max Berliner . 
 In February 2013 Sebastian Ortega and the cast agreed to produce another season of Graduados after a year off , and Telefe had begun negotiations to bring the series back . The project became a new telenovela , Viudas e hijos del Rock and Roll , which would employ similar themes and most of the cast . Nancy Dupláa left the project , with Paola Barrientos replacing her as the female lead .

 = Admiral David G. Farragut ( Ream statue ) = 
 Admiral David G. Farragut is a statue in Washington , D.C. honoring David Farragut , a career military officer who served as the first admiral in the United States Navy . The monument is sited in the center of Farragut Square , a city square in downtown Washington , D.C. The statue was sculpted by female artist Vinnie Ream , whose best known works include a statue of Abraham Lincoln and several statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection . The monument was dedicated in 1881 in an extravagant ceremony attended by President James A. Garfield , members of his cabinet , and thousands of spectators . It was the first monument erected in Washington , D.C. in honor of a naval war hero . 
 The statue is one of eighteen Civil War monuments in Washington , D.C. , which were collectively listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 . The bronze statue , which rests on a granite base , was cast from the USS Hartford bronze propellers and not from enemy cannon like most Civil War monuments in the city . The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the National Park Service , a federal agency of the Interior Department .

 David Farragut ( 1801 – 1870 ) was a career military officer who first saw combat during the War of 1812 at the age of 9 . He served on the USS Essex and was captured by the British . After the war , Farragut fought pirates in the West Indies on the ship USS Ferret , his first command of a United States Navy vessel . He also fought in the Mexican – American War and oversaw the construction of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in San Francisco . Although Farragut and his wife were Southerners , they remained loyal to the United States during the Civil War . His success in capturing New Orleans resulted in Farragut being honored with a new title created by the Navy , rear admiral . He continued to have great success in defeating Confederate forces , most notably at the Battle of Mobile Bay , where he uttered his famous phrase " Damn the torpedoes ! Full speed ahead ! " Following the war , President Andrew Johnson promoted Farragut to admiral , the first U.S. naval officer to receive the title . 
 Soon after Farragut 's death in 1870 , there were calls for a memorial to honor the naval hero . Representative Nathaniel P. Banks introduced a resolution in Congress for the erection of a monument to Farragut . The resolution stated that the statue was to be " after a design molded from life " , a subtle caveat intended to assist someone Banks already had in mind to create the statue , sculptor Horatio Stone of Washington , D.C. , who claimed to have met Farragut and had already begun working on a statue . Bank 's resolution was referred to the Joint Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds , where the committee chose to hold a competition , much to the dismay of Stone . Sculptors were only given sixty days to submit models of the statue , but when the congressional act approving the monument passed on April 16 , 1872 , the resolution was amended and the deadline for design submissions was extended by nine months . 
 Vinnie Ream ( 1847 – 1914 ) , a sculptor who at age nineteen had received the first government commission ever granted a female artist when she created a bust of President Abraham Lincoln , began working on a bust of Farragut , whom she had met several times . Farragut 's widow , Virginia , admired Ream 's design and became a strong advocate for the artist 's model to be selected . Virginia wrote letters of endorsement to committee members and supplied Ream with the names of Farragut 's friends so that they too would offer their endorsements to the committee . There were thirteen artists who submitted models with Ream being the only woman . Their designs were displayed in the basement of the United States Capitol and several were severely criticized by the press , most notably the models by J. Wilson MacDonald , Randolph Rogers , and Edward Watson . 
 Stone and Ream 's model received the most praise . Stone 's model was praised by several naval officers who called it " true to life " and " unsurpassed by similar works . " Ream 's model received praise from several high profile individuals , most notably President Ulysses S. Grant , who called it " first rate " . Admiral David Dixon Porter said the model " of Miss Vinnie Ream is the only likeness in the lot . " General William Tecumseh Sherman , who was reportedly infatuated with Ream , also became a strong advocate for her model . He wrote to the committee that " the plaster model of Vinnie Ream struck me decidedly as the best likeness , and recalled the memory of the Admiral 's face and figure more perfectly than any other model there on exhibition . " The decision by the committee ultimately ended in a three @-@ way tie between Ream , Stone , and MacDonald . The project stalled until the next Congress convened in 1874 . A commission to select the winning model was created and consisted of Virginia , Sherman , and Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson . Virginia and Sherman voted to approve Ream 's design , though Robeson refused to accept the result and tried in vain to convince Virginia to change her mind . Two months after the vote , Robeson relented and Ream 's model was officially selected . 
 Ream was awarded $ 20 @,@ 000 for the design and worked on the statue for the next few years . She consulted Virginia and incorporated her suggestions , much to the delight of Virginia . In 1879 , Ream announced that the model was ready to be cast and that the process would take place at the Washington Navy Yard , which had never before cast such a large statue . She continued to perfect the model while at the Navy Yard , much to the delight of the sailors . Although many of the city 's statues of military heroes were cast from captured enemy cannon , Farragut 's statue was cast from the USS Hartford bronze propellers that were removed and shipped to the Navy Yard . The amount of bronze yielded from the propellers was enough not only for the statue , but the four mortars on the corners of the statue base . 
 The site chosen for the statue was Farragut Square , a park renamed in honor of the admiral shortly after his death . The original dedication date , March 4 , 1881 , was pushed back because the statue base wasn 't ready . The base did not arrive until April 20 , five days before the dedication , resulting in Ream 's husband , Lieutenant Richard L. Hoxie , working around the clock with a crew of workers to make sure the site was ready . The base was completed and statue erected just hours before the ceremony began . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The statue was dedicated at 1 pm on April 25 , 1881 , becoming the first monument erected in Washington , D.C. in honor of a naval war hero . Government employees were dismissed at noon , the same time a procession began at the base of Capitol Hill . The military contingent , led by Commodore Charles H. Baldwin , moved west on Pennsylvania Avenue , where houses were decorated with bunting , and past the White House , before heading north on Connecticut Avenue . The homes surrounding the square were decorated with streamers and flags . Nearly 4 @,@ 000 invited guests , including members of the Grand Army of the Republic and fellow sailors who served alongside Farragut , listened to John Philip Sousa conduct the Marine Band as they filled three temporary stands that were built on three sides of the statue . Distinguished guests included President James A. Garfield and his wife , Lucretia , members of the President 's cabinet , Virginia Farragut , and Ream . 
 An opening prayer was led by Reverend Arthur Brooks followed by the statue being unveiled by two members of Farragut 's Hartford crew , Quartermaster C. B. Knowles and Boatswain James Wiley . When the statue was unveiled , the Marine Band began playing a march and a seventeen gun salute was fired from nearby Lafayette Square . Secretary of the Navy William H. Hunt then introduced the President , who formally accepted the statue on behalf of the American people and gave a brief address . He stated : " Today we come to hail this hero , who comes from the sea , down from the shrouds of his flagship , wreathed with the smoke and glory of victory , bringing 60 years of national life and honor , to take his place as an honored compatriot and perpetual guardian of his Nation 's glory . In the name of the Nation I accept this noble statue , and his country will guard it as he guarded his country . " Speeches were then given by former Postmaster General Horace Maynard and Senator Daniel W. Voorhees followed by the Marine Band playing " Hail to the Chief " and another seventeen gun salute . At the conclusion of the ceremony , the military procession saluted the statue as they marched back down Connecticut Avenue , past the White House , and down Pennsylvania Avenue .

 Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Bob Dylan , released on May 16 , 1966 , on Columbia Records . Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians , including members of Dylan 's live backing band , the Hawks . Though sessions continued until January 1966 , they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album — " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " . At producer Bob Johnston 's suggestion , Dylan , keyboardist Al Kooper , and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville , Tennessee . These sessions , augmented by some of Nashville 's top session musicians , were more fruitful , and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded . 
 Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966 , starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited . Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time . Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility , the album 's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically , while featuring lyrics one critic called " a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial " . It was one of the first double albums in rock music . 
 The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US , where it eventually was certified double platinum , and it reached number three in the UK . Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top @-@ twenty hits in the US : " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " and " I Want You " . Two additional songs , " Just Like a Woman " and " Visions of Johanna " , have been named as among Dylan 's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list .

 After the release of Highway 61 Revisited in August 1965 , Dylan set about hiring a touring band . Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on his new album and at Dylan 's controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival . Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan , preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band . After backing him at concerts in late August and early September , Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him . Dylan 's manager , Albert Grossman , was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months , touring the U.S. , Australia , and Europe . Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks , consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians : Robbie Robertson , Rick Danko , Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson . They had come together as a band in Canada , backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins . Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan : Mary Martin , the executive secretary of Albert Grossman , and blues singer John Hammond , Jr . , son of record producer John Hammond , who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961 ; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album So Many Roads . 
 Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15 , where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar 's Club , and on September 24 , they made their debut in Austin , Texas . Two weeks later , encouraged by the success of their Texas performance , Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City . Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow @-@ up to " Positively 4th Street " , but Dylan was already shaping his next album , the third one that year backed by rock musicians . 
 = = = New York sessions = = = 
 Producer Bob Johnston , who had overseen the recording of Highway 61 Revisited , started work with Dylan and the Hawks at Columbia Studio A , 799 Seventh Avenue , New York , on October 5 . They concentrated on a new arrangement of " Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window ? " , a song recorded during the Highway 61 Revisited sessions but not included on that album . Three further numbers were attempted , but none progressed into completed songs . Both the fragmentary " Jet Pilot " and " I Wanna Be Your Lover " , a quasi @-@ parody of the Beatles ' " I Wanna Be Your Man " , finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective , Biograph . Also attempted were two takes of " Medicine Sunday " , a song that later evolved into " Temporary Like Achilles " . 
 On November 30 , the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A , but drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Levon Helm , who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit . They began work on a new composition , " Freeze Out " , which was later retitled " Visions of Johanna " , but Dylan wasn 't satisfied with the results . One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on The Bootleg Series Vol . 7 : No Direction Home : The Soundtrack in 2005 . At this session , they completed " Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window ? " The song was released as a single in December , but only reached number 58 on the American charts . 
 Dylan spent most of December in California , performing a dozen concerts with his band , and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son Jesse . On January 21 , 1966 , he returned to Columbia 's Studio A to record another long composition , " She 's Your Lover Now " , accompanied by the Hawks ( this time with Sandy <unk> on drums ) . Despite nineteen takes , the session failed to yield any complete recordings . Dylan did not attempt the song again , but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 ( Rare & Unreleased ) 1961 – 1991 . ( Although the song breaks down at the start of the last verse , Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session . ) 
 Around this time , Dylan became disillusioned about using the Hawks in the studio . He recorded more material at Studio A on January 25 , backed by drummer Bobby Gregg , bassist Rick Danko ( or Bill Lee ) , guitarist Robbie Robertson , pianist Paul Griffin , and organist Al Kooper . Two more new compositions were attempted : " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " and " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " . Dylan was satisfied with " One of Us Must Know " ; the January 25 take was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album . 
 Another session took place on January 27 , this time with Robertson , Danko , Kooper and Gregg . Dylan and his band recorded " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " and " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " again , but Dylan was not satisfied with the recorded performance of either song . Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of " I 'll Keep It With Mine " , a song which he had already recorded twice as a demo . The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer Clinton Heylin described as " cursory " . The recording was ultimately released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 in 1991 . 
 A shortage of new material and the slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan 's decision to cancel three additional recording dates . Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton , " Oh , I was really down . I mean , in ten recording sessions , man , we didn 't get one song ... It was the band . But you see , I didn 't know that . I didn 't want to think that " . 
 = = = Move to Nashville = = = 
 Recognizing Dylan 's dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings , producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville . Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians . He recalled how Dylan manager Albert Grossman , was hostile to the idea : " Grossman came up to me and said ' If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again , you 're gone . ' I said , ' What do you mean ? ' He said , ' You heard me . We got a thing going here ' " . Despite Grossman 's opposition , Dylan agreed to Johnston 's suggestion , and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia 's A Studio on Nashville 's Music Row in February 1966 . 
 In addition to Kooper and Robertson , who accompanied Dylan from New York , Johnston recruited harmonica player , guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy , guitarist Wayne Moss , guitarist and bassist Joe South , and drummer Kenny Buttrey . At Dylan 's request , Johnston removed the baffles — partitions separating the musicians so that there was " an ambience fit for an ensemble " . Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston 's re @-@ arrangement of the studio , " as if we were on a tight stage , as opposed to playing in a big hall where you 're ninety miles apart " . Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics . Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions . 
 On the first Nashville session , on February 14 , Dylan successfully recorded " Visions of Johanna " , which he had attempted several times in New York . Also recorded was a take of " 4th Time Around " which made it onto the album and a take of " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " which did not . 
 On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards , napped and chatted . Finally , at 4 a.m. , Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song . Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in , as he attempted his epic composition " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " . Kenny Buttrey recalled , " If you notice that record , that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy , and everybody 's just peaking it up ' cause we thought , Man , this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we 've gotta put everything into it we can . And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we 're cracking up at each other , at what we were doing . I mean , we peaked five minutes ago . Where do we go from here ? " The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes , 23 seconds , and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album . 
 The next session began similarly — Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics , and the session continued into the early hours of February 17 , when the musicians began to record " Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again " . After several musical revisions and false starts , the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album . 
 = = = Recording sessions in Nashville = = = 
 Most accounts of recording Blonde on Blonde , including those by Dylan scholars Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray , agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions : February 14 – 17 and March 8 – 10 , 1966 . This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records . 
 Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa , Montreal , and Philadelphia in February and March , and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8 . On that date , Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of " Absolutely Sweet Marie " that Dylan selected for the album . Historian Sean Wilentz observed that " with the sound of ' Sweet Marie ' , Blonde on Blonde entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll " . The same day saw the successful takes of " Just Like a Woman " , and " Pledging My Time " , the latter " driven by Robertson 's screaming guitar " . 
 According to Wilentz the final recording session , on March 9 – 10 , produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time . The first number to be recorded to Dylan 's satisfaction was " Most Likely You Go Your Way And I 'll Go Mine " , when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica , changing the sound of the song radically . Dylan and his band then quickly recorded " Temporary Like Achilles " . The session atmosphere began to " get giddy " around midnight when Dylan roughed out " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " on the piano . Johnston recalled commenting ; " That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band " . Dylan replied ; " Can you get one ? " Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler , the only additional musician required , and Dylan and the band , with McCoy again on trumpet , played a high @-@ spirited version of the song . 
 In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded " Obviously 5 Believers " and a final take of " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " powered by Robertson 's lead guitar . The session concluded with " I Want You " on which , as Wilentz notes , " Wayne Moss 's rapid @-@ fire sixteenth notes on the guitar " are an impressive element of the recording .

 Al Kooper , who played keyboards on every track of Blonde on Blonde , has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville . In comments on Michael Gray 's website , Kooper wrote : " There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I , and ALL THE <unk> were cut in that one visit " , stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert . Charlie McCoy agreed with Kooper 's version . Wilentz analyzed the recording of Blonde on Blonde in his book Bob Dylan In America , concluding that the " official " documented version fits Dylan 's known touring schedule , and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after " Stuck Inside of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again " , but none of those recorded earlier , include a middle @-@ eight section — Dylan 's first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure " . 
 = = = Mixing and album title = = = 
 Dylan mixed the album in Los Angeles in early April , before he departed on the Australian leg of his 1966 world tour . Wilentz writes that it was at this point it became " obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a single LP " , and they had " produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured double album , the first of its kind in contemporary popular music " . According to producer Steve Berkowitz , who supervised the reissue of Dylan 's LPs in mono as The Original Mono Recordings in 2010 , Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours . 
 Al Kooper recalled that both the album title , Blonde on Blonde , and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions . " When they were mixing it , we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said , ' What do you want to call this ? ' And [ Bob ] just like said them out one at a time ... Free association and silliness , I 'm sure , played a big role . " Another Dylan chronicler , Oliver Trager , notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan 's first name , the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht , a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting . Dylan himself has said of the title : " Well , I don 't even recall exactly how it came up , but I know it was all in good faith ... I don 't know who thought of that . I certainly didn 't . "

 " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " 
 According to author Andy Gill , by starting his new album with what sounded like " a demented marching @-@ band ... staffed by crazy people out of their mind on loco @-@ weed " , Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans . The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with " nudge @-@ nudge wink @-@ wink bohemian hedonism " . Heylin points out that the Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army @-@ style musical backing seem like a good joke . The enigmatic title came about , Heylin suggests , because Dylan knew a song entitled " everybody must get stoned " would be kept off the airwaves . Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs , chapter 27 , verse 15 : " A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike . " Released as a single on March 22 , 1966 , " Rainy Day Women " reached number two on the Billboard singles chart , and number seven in the UK . 
 " Pledging My Time " 
 Following the good @-@ time fun of " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " , the Chicago blues @-@ influenced " Pledging My Time " sets the somber tone that runs through the album . It draws on several traditional blues songs , including Elmore James ' recording of " It Hurts Me Too " . For critic Michael Gray , the lines " Somebody got lucky but it was an accident " echo the lines " Some joker got lucky , stole her back again " from Robert Johnson 's " Come On in My Kitchen " , which is itself an echo of the Skip James 1931 recording " Devil Got My Woman " . Gray suggests that " the gulping movements of the melodic phrases " derive from the melody of " Sitting on Top of the World " , recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930 . The couplet at the end of each verse expresses the theme : a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she " will come through , too " . Besides Dylan 's vocals and improvised harmonica breaks , the song 's sound is defined by Robbie Robertson 's guitar , Hargus " Pig " Robbins 's blues piano and Ken Buttrey 's snare drum rolls . The song was released in edited form as the B @-@ side of " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " in March . 
 " Visions of Johanna " 
 Considered by many critics as one of Dylan 's masterpieces , " Visions of Johanna " proved difficult to capture on tape . Heylin places the writing in the fall of 1965 , when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his wife Sara . In the New York recording studio , on November 30 , Dylan announced his epic composition : " This is called ' Freeze Out ' . " Gill notes that this working title captures the " air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched ... full of whispering and muttering . " Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through fourteen takes , trying to sketch out how he wanted it played , saying at one point , " it 's not hard rock , The only thing in it that 's hard is Robbie . " Wilentz notes that , as Dylan quiets things down , he inches closer to what will appear on the album . 
 Ten weeks later , " Visions of Johanna " fell into place quickly in the Nashville studio . Kooper recalled that he and Robertson had become adept at responding to Dylan 's vocal and also singled out Joe South 's contribution of " this throbbing ... rhythmically amazing bass part " . Gill comments that the song begins by contrasting two lovers , the carnal Louise , and " the more spiritual but unattainable " Johanna . Ultimately , for Gill , the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection . For Heylin , the triumph of the song is in " the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid , immediate way . " 
 " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " 
 When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25 , 1966 , he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on Blonde on Blonde 's first side . With Dylan piecing together the song 's sections , and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five , the session stretched through the night and into the next morning . It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded . Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later . Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin 's piano for binding the song together : " At the chorus , Griffin unleashes a symphony ; hammering his way up and down the keyboard , half Gershwin , half gospel , all heart . The follow @-@ up , a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse , releases none of the song 's tension . " 
 " One of Us Must Know " is a straightforward account of a burned @-@ out relationship . Dissecting what went wrong , the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one @-@ sided conversation with his former lover . As he presents his case in the opening verse , it appears he is incapable of either acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse : " I didn 't mean to treat you so bad . You don 't have to take it so personal . I didn 't mean to make you so sad . You just happened to be there , that 's all . " " One of Us Must Know " was the first recording completed for Blonde on Blonde and the only one selected from the New York sessions . The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14 , the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville . It failed to appear on the American charts , but reached number 33 in the UK . 
 " I Want You " 
 Andy Gill notes that the song displays a tension between the very direct tone of the chorus , the repeated phrase " I want you " , and a weird and complex cast of characters , " too numerous to inhabit the song 's three minutes comfortably " , including a guilty undertaker , a lonesome organ grinder , weeping fathers , mothers , sleeping saviors , the Queen of Spades , and the " dancing child with his Chinese suit " . Analyzing the evolution of the lyrics through successive drafts , Wilentz writes that there are numerous failures , " about deputies asking him his name ... lines about fathers going down hugging one another and about their daughters putting him down because he isn 't their brother " . Finally Dylan arrives at the right formula . 
 Heylin points out that the gorgeous tune illustrates what Dylan explained to a reporter in 1966 : " It 's not just pretty words to a tune or putting tunes to words ... [ It 's ] the words and the music [ together ] — I can hear the sound of what I want to say . " Al Kooper has said that of all the songs that Dylan had outlined to him in his hotel , this was his favorite , so Dylan delayed recording it to the very end of the Nashville sessions , " just to bug him " . Released as a single in June 1966 , shortly before the album Blonde on Blonde , " I Want You " reached number 20 in the USA , and number 16 in the UK . 
 " Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again " 
 Recorded at the third Nashville session , this song was the culmination of another epic of simultaneous writing and recording in the studio . Wilentz describes how the lyrics evolved through a surviving part @-@ typed , part @-@ handwritten manuscript page , " which begins ' honey but it 's just too hard ' ( a line that had survived from the very first New York session with the Hawks ) . Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images ( ' people just get uglier ' ; ' banjo eyes ' ; ' he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot ' ) , before , in Dylan 's own hand , amid many crossings @-@ out , there appears ' Oh <unk> you 're here IN MOBILE <unk> with the Memphis blues again ' . " 
 Inside the studio , the song evolved through several musical revisions . Heylin writes , " It is the song 's arrangement , and not its lyrics , that occupies the musicians through the wee small hours . " On the fifth take , released in 2005 on the No Direction Home Soundtrack , <unk> Dylan stumbles on the formula " Stuck inside of Mobile " on the fourth verse , and never goes back . The song contains two oft @-@ quoted pieces of Dylan 's philosophy : " Your debutante just knows what you need / But I know what you want " and " here I sit so patiently / Waiting to find out what price / You have to pay to get out of / Going through all these things twice " . 
 " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " 
 " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " is a sarcastic satire on materialism , fashion and <unk> . Done in Chicago @-@ blues style , the song derives its melody and part of its lyrics from Lightnin ' Hopkins 's " Automobile ( Blues ) " . Paul Williams writes that its misogynistic attitude is " moderated slightly when one realizes that jealous pique is the underlying emotion " . In the lyrics , the narrator observes his former lover in various situations wearing her " brand new leopard @-@ skin pill @-@ box hat " , at one point finding his doctor with her and later spying her making love with a new boyfriend because she " forgot to close the garage door " . In the closing lines , the narrator says he knows what her boyfriend really loves her for — her hat . 
 The song evolved over the course of six takes in New York , 13 in the first Nashville session , and then one try on March 10 , the take used for the album . Dylan , who gets credit on the liner notes as lead guitarist , opens the song playing lead ( on the center @-@ right stereo channel ) ; however , Robertson handles the solos with a " searing " performance ( on the left stereo channel ) . A year following the recording , " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " became the fifth single released from Blonde on Blonde , making it to number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 . 
 " Just Like a Woman " 
 According to Wilentz 's analysis of the session 's tapes , Dylan felt his way into the lyrics of one of his most popular songs , singing " disconnected lines and semi @-@ gibberish " during the earlier takes . He was unsure what the person described in the song does that is just like a woman , rejecting " shakes " , " wakes " , and " makes mistakes " . This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored — " not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol 's Factory retinue " — to be about Edie Sedgwick . The reference to Baby 's penchant for " fog ... amphetamine and ... pearls " suggests Sedgwick or some similar debutante , according to Heylin . 
 Discussing the lyrics , literary critic Christopher Ricks detects a " note of social exclusion " in the line " I was hungry and it was your world " . In response to the accusation that Dylan 's depiction of female strategies is misogynistic , Ricks asks , " Could there ever be any challenging art about men and women where the accusation just didn 't arise ? " The song reached number 33 in the US . 
 " Most Likely You Go Your Way And I 'll Go Mine " 
 A bright blues " stomper " about lovers parting , " Most Likely You Go Your Way And I 'll Go Mine " is one of the more literal songs Dylan recorded in his 1965 – 66 period . The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is going to let her " pass " . As in " Just Like a Woman " and " Absolutely Sweet Marie " , he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line , which in this case comes from the title . " Most Likely You Go Your Way " was issued as a single a year later , in March 1967 , on the B @-@ side of " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " . 
 " Temporary Like Achilles " 
 This slow @-@ moving blues number is highlighted by Hargus " Pig " Robbins 's " dusky barrelhouse piano " and Dylan 's " brief wheeze of harmonica " . In the song , the narrator has been spurned by his lover , who has already taken up with her latest boyfriend . Referring to his rival as " Achilles " , the narrator senses the new suitor may end up being discarded as quickly as he was . The refrain that ends each of the main verses — " Honey , why are you so hard ? " — is a double entendre Dylan had been wanting to work into a song . 
 " Absolutely Sweet Marie " 
 This song , described as " up @-@ tempo blues shuffle , pure Memphis " and an example of " obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody " , was recorded in four takes on March 7 , 1966 . Gill sees the lyrics as a series of sexual metaphors , including " beating on my trumpet " and keys to locked gates , many deriving from traditional blues . Nonetheless , the song contains what has been termed " one of the most oft @-@ repeated of Dylan 's life lessons " , the thought that " to live outside the law you must be honest " , which was later invoked in many bohemian and counter @-@ cultural contexts . 
 " 4th Time Around " 
 When The Beatles released their sixth studio album , Rubber Soul , in December 1965 , John Lennon 's song " Norwegian Wood " attracted attention for the way in which Lennon disguised his account of an illicit affair in cryptic , Dylanesque language . Dylan sketched out a response to the song , also in 3 / 4 time , copying the tune and circular structure , but taking Lennon 's tale in a darker direction . Wilentz describes the result as sounding " like Bob Dylan impersonating John Lennon impersonating Bob Dylan " . 
 " Obviously 5 Believers " 
 " Obviously 5 Believers " , Blonde on Blonde 's second @-@ to @-@ last track , is a roadhouse blues love song similar in melody and structure to Memphis Minnie 's " Me and My <unk> Blues " , and was described by Robert Shelton as " the best R & B song on the album " . Recorded in the early morning hours of the March 9 – 10 Nashville session under the working title " Black Dog Blues " , the song is driven by Robertson 's guitar , Charley McCoy 's harmonica and Ken Buttrey 's drumming . After an initial breakdown , Dylan complained to the band that the song was " very easy , man " and that he didn 't want to spend much time on it . Within four takes , the recording was done . 
 " Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " 
 Written in the CBS recording studio in Nashville over the space of eight hours on the night of February 15 – 16 , " Sad Eyed Lady " eventually occupied the whole of side four of Blonde On Blonde . Critics have observed that " Lowlands " hints at " Lownds " , and Dylan biographer Robert Shelton wrote that this was a " wedding song " for Sara Lownds , whom Dylan had married just three months earlier . In his paean to his wife , " Sara " , written in 1975 , Dylan amends history slightly to claim that he stayed " up for days in the Chelsea Hotel / <unk> ' ' Sad @-@ Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ' for you " . 
 When Dylan played Shelton the song , shortly after recording it , he claimed , " This is the best song I 've ever written . " Around the same time , Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel , " Just listen to that ! That 's old @-@ time religious carnival music ! " However , in 1969 , Dylan confessed to Rolling Stone 's editor , Jann Wenner , " I just sat down at a table and started writing ... And I just got carried away with the whole thing ... I just started writing and I couldn 't stop . After a period of time , I forgot what it was all about , and I started trying to get back to the beginning [ laughs ] . " 
 Heard by some listeners as a hymn to an other @-@ worldly woman , for Shelton " her travails seem beyond endurance , yet she radiates an inner strength , an ability to be reborn . This is Dylan at his most romantic . " Wilentz comments that Dylan 's writing had shifted from the days when he asked questions and supplied answers . Like the verses of William Blake 's " Tyger " , Dylan asks a series of questions about the " Sad Eyed Lady " but never supplies any answers . 
 = = = Outtakes and The Cutting Edge = = = 
 The following outtakes were recorded during the Blonde on Blonde sessions . 
 In 2015 , Dylan released Volume 12 of his Bootleg Series , The Cutting Edge , in three different formats . The 18 @-@ disc Collector 's Edition was described as including " every note recorded during the 1965 – 1966 sessions , every alternate take and alternate lyric . " The 18 CDs contain every take of every song recorded in the studio during the Blonde on Blonde sessions , from October 5 , 1965 , to March 10 , 1966 . 
 The New York sessions comprise : two takes of " Medicine Sunday " , one take of " Jet Pilot " , twelve takes of " Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window ? " , seven takes of " I Wanna Be Your Lover " , fourteen takes of " Visions of Johanna " , sixteen takes of " She 's Your Lover Now " , four takes of " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " , twenty @-@ four takes of " One of Us Must Know ( Sooner or Later ) " , one take of " I 'll Keep It with Mine " , and one take of " Lunatic Princess " . 
 The Nashville sessions comprise : twenty takes of " Fourth Time Around " , four takes of " Visions of Johanna " , fourteen takes of " Leopard @-@ Skin Pill @-@ Box Hat " , four takes of " Sad @-@ Eyed Lady of the Lowlands " , fifteen takes of " Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again " , three takes of " Absolutely Sweet Marie " , eighteen takes of " Just Like a Woman " , three takes of " Pledging My Time " , six takes of " Most Likely You Go Your Way ( And I 'll Go Mine ) " , four takes of " Temporary Like Achilles " , four takes of " Obviously Five Believers " , five takes of " I Want You " , and one take of " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " . The 18 CDs also contain brief recordings of guitar and keyboard inserts . 
 Describing the process of listening to all these alternative versions , Neil McCormick wrote : " The Cutting Edge allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history , a new approach to song being forged before our very ears . " 
 = = Cover photo = = 
 The cover photo of Blonde on Blonde shows a 12 @-@ by @-@ 12 inch close @-@ up portrait of Dylan . The double album gatefold sleeve opens to form a 12 @-@ by @-@ 26 inch photo of the artist , at three quarter length . The artist 's name and the album 's title only appear on the spine . A sticker was applied to the shrink wrap to promote the release 's two hit singles , " I Want You " and " Rainy Day Women # 12 & 35 " . 
 The cover shows Dylan in front of a brick building , wearing a suede jacket and a black and white checkered scarf . The jacket is the same one he wore on his next two albums , John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline . The photographer , Jerry Schatzberg , described how the photo was taken : 
 I wanted to find an interesting location outside of the studio . We went to the west side , where the Chelsea art galleries are now . At the time it was the meat packing district of New York and I liked the look of it . It was freezing and we were very cold . The frame he chose for the cover is blurred and out of focus . Of course everyone was trying to interpret the meaning , saying it must represent getting high on an LSD trip . It was none of the above ; we were just cold and the two of us were shivering . There were other images that were sharp and in focus but , to his credit , Dylan liked that photograph . 
 Research by rock historian Bob Egan suggests the location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street , at the extreme west of Greenwich Village . The original inside gatefold featured nine black @-@ and @-@ white photos , all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself . A shot of actress Claudia Cardinale from Schatzberg 's portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale 's representatives threatened to sue , making the original record sleeve a collector 's item . Dylan included a self @-@ portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer . The photos , for Gill , added up to " a shadowy glimpse of [ Dylan 's ] life , including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other : they all contributed to the album 's air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius . " 
 = = Release = = 
 Blonde on Blonde reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK album charts , and also spawned a number of hits that restored Dylan to the upper echelons of the singles charts . In August 1967 , the album was certified as a gold disc . 
 Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote , " Dylan is a superbly eloquent writer of pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images . " The editor of Crawdaddy ! , Paul Williams , reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966 : " It is a cache of emotion , a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry , blended and meshed and ready to become part of your reality . Here is a man who will speak to you , a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides , but a truthful man with x @-@ ray eyes you can look through if you want . All you have to do is listen . " 
 To accompany the songbook of Blonde on Blonde , Paul Nelson wrote an introduction stating , " The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan . For Dylan 's music of illusion and delusion — with the tramp as explorer and the clown as happy victim , where the greatest crimes are lifelessness and the inability to see oneself as a circus performer in the show of life — has always carried within it its own inherent tensions ... Dylan in the end truly <unk> situations , and once one truly understands anything , there can no longer be anger , no longer be moralizing , but only humor and compassion , only pity . " 
 = = = Date uncertainty = = = 
 The dating of the album 's release is uncertain . May 16 , 1966 , has been widely accepted as the official release date ; however , Michael Gray , author of The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia , disputes this . Gray maintains the earliest Blonde on Blonde was available was late June or early July . This coincides with the album 's promotion in Billboard , which carried a full @-@ page Columbia advertisement on June 25 , selected the album as a " New Action LP " on July 9 , and ran a review and article on July 16 . The album debuted on Billboard 's Top LP 's chart on July 23 at # 101 — just six days before Dylan 's motorcycle accident in Woodstock removed him from public view . Roger Ford posits it highly unlikely that a new Bob Dylan album in the mid @-@ 1960s would take a full two months to finally rack up enough weekly sales to appear on the album chart ; another iconic contemporary LP which also has an official 1966 release date of May 16 , Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys , entered the Billboard LP chart less than two weeks after release on May 28 at # 105 . Clinton Heylin argues that early July is the probable release date , stating that an overdub on " Fourth Time Around " was recorded in June . Blonde on Blonde has been described as rock 's first studio double LP by a major artist . 
 = = Retrospective assessment and legacy = = 
 Twelve years after its release , Dylan said : " The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the Blonde on Blonde album . It 's that thin , that wild mercury sound . It 's metallic and bright gold , with whatever that conjures up . " For critics , the double album was seen as the last installment in Dylan 's trilogy of mid @-@ 1960s rock albums . As Janet Maslin wrote , " The three albums of this period — Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited both released in 1965 , and Blonde on Blonde from 1966 — used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn 't approached before . " Mike Marqusee has described Dylan 's output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966 , when he recorded these three albums , as " a body of work that remains unique in popular music . " For Patrick Humphries , " Dylan 's body of work during the 14 @-@ months period ... stands unequalled in rock 's 30 @-@ year history . In substance , style , ambition and achievement , no one has even come close to matching Bringing It All Back Home , Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde . " 
 Dylan scholar Michael Gray wrote : " To have followed up one masterpiece with another was Dylan 's history making achievement here ... Where Highway 61 Revisited has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery , descending from outside the sickness , Blonde on Blonde offers a persona awash inside the chaos ... We 're tossed from song to song ... The feel and the music are on a grand scale , and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial . " Critic Tim Riley wrote : " A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism , Blonde on Blonde confirms Dylan 's stature as the greatest American rock presence since Elvis Presley . " Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as " a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle , which began with Bringing It All Back Home " . Summing up the album 's achievement , Shelton wrote that Blonde on Blonde " begins with a joke and ends with a hymn ; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances , love , society , and unrealized hope ... There 's a remarkable marriage of funky , bluesy rock expressionism , and Rimbaud @-@ like visions of discontinuity , chaos , emptiness , loss , being ' stuck ' . " 
 That sense of crossing cultural boundaries was , for Al Kooper , at the heart of Blonde on Blonde : " [ Bob Dylan ] was the quintessential New York hipster — what was he doing in Nashville ? It didn 't make any sense whatsoever . But you take those two elements , pour them into a test tube , and it just exploded . " For Mike Marqusee , Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques : " [ Dylan ] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere . ' Pledging My Time ' and ' Obviously 5 Believers ' adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid @-@ fifties ( both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of " early in the mornin " ) . Yet like ' Visions of Johanna ' or ' Memphis Blues Again ' , these songs are beyond category . They are allusive , repetitive , <unk> abstract compositions that defy reduction . " 
 Blonde on Blonde has been consistently highly placed in polls of the greatest albums of all time . In 1974 , the writers of NME voted Blonde on Blonde the number @-@ two album of all time . Demonstrating the transitory nature of such polls , in 1997 the album was placed at number 16 in a " Music of the Millennium " poll conducted by HMV , Channel 4 , The Guardian and Classic FM . In 2006 , TIME magazine included the record on their 100 All @-@ TIME Albums list . In 2003 , the album was ranked number nine on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of " The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . In 2004 , two songs from the album also appeared on the magazine 's list of " The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " : " Just Like a Woman " ranked number 230 and " Visions of Johanna " number 404 . ( When Rolling Stone updated this list in 2010 , " Just Like a Woman " dropped to number 232 and " Visions of Johanna " to number 413 . ) The album was additionally included in critic Robert Dimery 's book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 = 2015 Football League Cup Final = 
 The 2015 Football League Cup Final was a football match that took place on 1 March 2015 at Wembley Stadium , London . It was the final match of the 2014 – 15 Football League Cup , the 55th season of the Football League Cup , a competition for the 92 teams in the Premier League and the Football League . 
 It was contested by Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur in a repeat of the 2008 Football League Cup Final , which the latter team won . Chelsea won 2 – 0 in the 2015 final , with a goal from captain John Terry at the end of the first half , and a second from Diego Costa in the 56th minute . It was Chelsea 's fifth League Cup win , and their first silverware in the second managerial spell of José Mourinho at the club . Chelsea qualified for the next season 's UEFA Europa League by winning the match , but eventually qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League . The Europa League place went to Liverpool , who finished sixth in the Premier League . 
 Mourinho expressed delight in winning another trophy in his career , while Terry spoke of optimism for Chelsea 's future prospects . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino declared pride in his side despite their defeat . 
 = = Background = = 
 Chelsea were playing in their seventh League Cup final , having won four , most recently in 2007 . Their most recent appearance in the final was the first at Wembley , which they lost in 2008 to Tottenham . The game was Chelsea 's first domestic cup final since their victory in the 2012 FA Cup Final . Incumbent Chelsea manager José Mourinho was in charge in their League Cup wins in 2005 and 2007 , and squad members Petr Čech , John Terry and Didier Drogba played in both finals , with the latter scoring in both victories . All three also played in the 2008 defeat by Tottenham . 
 Tottenham were making their eighth appearance in the final , having won four previous times , last of which was in 2008 . The 2008 final was the first at Wembley and was won against Chelsea . Tottenham 's most recent appearance was a defeat against Manchester United in a penalty shootout the following year . Of their squad in the 2014 – 15 season , captain Younès Kaboul was an extra @-@ time substitute in their 2008 victory , while Aaron Lennon – on loan at Everton at the time of the 2015 final – started that match and the defeat in 2009 . 
 The two teams also played at the old Wembley in the 1967 FA Cup Final , which Tottenham won 2 – 1 . Tottenham 's most recent appearance at Wembley was also against Chelsea , a 5 – 1 defeat in an FA Cup semi @-@ final in 2012 . 
 By the time of the final , Chelsea and Tottenham had already played each other twice during the league season . On 3 December 2014 , Chelsea hosted a 3 – 0 win , with goals from Eden Hazard , Didier Drogba and substitute Loïc Rémy , despite missing leading scorer Diego Costa through suspension .

 Chelsea , of the Premier League , began their League Cup campaign in the third round , where they were drawn at home against Bolton Wanderers of the Championship . Defender Kurt Zouma , making his debut , opened the scoring , but Bolton equalised six minutes later through a Matt Mills header . Ten minutes after the start of the second half , Oscar put Chelsea back into the lead and they won 2 – 1 , dominating the match with 28 shots to Bolton 's 3 . 
 In the fourth round , Chelsea travelled to the New Meadow to face Shrewsbury Town of League Two . Three minutes after play resumed from a goalless first half , Didier Drogba 's half @-@ volley gave Chelsea the lead , but Shrewsbury gained an equaliser from substitute Andy Mangan . With nine minutes to play , Chelsea regained the advantage when Shrewsbury defender Jermaine Grandison deflected a shot from Willian . 
 Chelsea again were the away team to a lower opponent in the quarter @-@ finals , facing Derby County of the Championship . In the first half , Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead , later doubled by a Filipe Luís free kick , the full @-@ back 's first for Chelsea . Craig Bryson halved the deficit for Derby , but soon afterwards defender Jake Buxton was sent off for a foul on Loïc Rémy and André Schürrle scored the final goal of a 3 – 1 Chelsea win . In the semi @-@ final , Chelsea beat Liverpool 2 – 1 on aggregate after Branislav Ivanović scored the winning goal in the first half of extra time in the second leg , heading in Willian 's free kick .

 Tottenham , also of the Premier League , began by facing Nottingham Forest at White Hart Lane . After a goalless first half , Jorge Grant gave the visitors from the Championship the lead in the 65th minute . Substitute Ryan Mason equalised six minutes later , and Spurs eventually won 3 – 1 after two late goals from Roberto Soldado and another substitute , Harry Kane . 
 Tottenham hosted another second @-@ tier opponent in the fourth round , Brighton & Hove Albion , and went into the lead through Érik Lamela , a half @-@ time replacement for Aaron Lennon . Kane later confirmed a 2 – 0 victory .

 Tottenham were eliminated from the last 32 of the 2014 – 15 UEFA Europa League by Fiorentina three days before the final , leading manager Mauricio Pochettino to say that the team needed to recover quickly . 
 Chelsea manager José Mourinho used his pre @-@ match interview to state that his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup : " Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition , as a real challenge . It is a big competition . " He separated the final from the league season , saying , " I don 't think if we win the cup final we will win the league , or if we lose it we will lose the league . " He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić , dismissing it with " If I speak to you about that , I promise you I will be in big trouble " . Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly , he criticised players who dive , despite not naming any names . Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea for the first time in September 2007 , he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy , and again in 2012 .

 Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matić was suspended for the final , due to a two @-@ match ban he received for pushing over Burnley 's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015 . Another central midfielder for the club , John Obi Mikel , missed the match through a knee injury . Due to Matić 's absence , Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield , with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma 's previous position . Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley : Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois , César Azpilicueta at left @-@ back instead of Filipe Luís , and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield at the expense of Juan Cuadrado and Oscar . Chelsea set up with a three @-@ man attack , with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa . 
 Tottenham 's second @-@ choice goalkeeper Michel Vorm had played all of their fixtures on their way to the final , but was dropped to the bench and replaced with Hugo Lloris for the decisive game . Compared to their defeat at Fiorentina , Tottenham made three changes in defence , with only Jan Vertonghen retaining his place – Vlad <unk> , Federico Fazio and Ben Davies were replaced by Kyle Walker , Eric Dier and Danny Rose , with <unk> not even featuring on the substitutes ' bench . Defensive midfielder Benjamin <unk> and attacking midfielder Érik Lamela were replaced by Ryan Mason and Andros Townsend respectively , with the lone striker position changing from Roberto Soldado to Harry Kane .

 In the 10th minute , Christian Eriksen had the first meaningful shot , hitting the crossbar with a 25 @-@ yard free kick for Tottenham . Twenty minutes later , Eric Dier was given the game 's first yellow card for a foul on Diego Costa . At the end of the first half , Chelsea won a free kick on their right side when Branislav Ivanović was pulled down by Nacer Chadli . Willian took the free kick , which arrived at Kurt Zouma , played it down to captain John Terry . Terry 's shot – Chelsea 's first on target – went past Hugo Lloris due to a deflection by Dier . In added time at the end of the first half , Gary Cahill had a header from a corner , which was caught by Lloris . 
 Neither side made a substitution at half time . In the 56th minute , Cesc Fàbregas – who had a bicycle kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa , whose shot from the left of the area deflected off Tottenham right @-@ back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea 's advantage . After conceding their second goal , Tottenham made a series of attacking substitutions – Andros Townsend , Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé , Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score . In the 74th minute , Dier 's knee caught César Azpilicueta , drawing blood ; the Chelsea left @-@ back left the pitch to be bandaged and returned two minutes later . There were four minutes of added time , in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba .

 Mourinho was pleased to have won the final , earning the 21st trophy of his managerial career : " I am like a kid winning the first one , it 's hard for me to live without titles . I need to feed myself with them . " Terry was optimistic about the club 's prospects for the future , saying , " It is the start of something ... we 've got a great squad , with some great young players , and hungry and experienced players too . It 's a great mix . " Although praising the atmosphere at Wembley , Terry ruled out returning to the England team , for whom he had not played since 2012 . Despite losing , Pochettino expressed pride in his team 's performance . 
 Matić took part in Chelsea 's trophy ceremony in full kit despite being suspended , similar to what Terry had done after Chelsea won the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final with him suspended . Mourinho did not concur with the official man of the match award going to Terry , stating that the honour should have gone to Thibaut Courtois and Filipe Luís for their performances against Liverpool , and Andreas Christensen for his performance against Shrewsbury Town . 
 Chelsea qualified for the next season 's UEFA Europa League by winning the match . As they qualified for the UEFA Champions League by winning the Premier League , the Europa League place went to Liverpool , who finished sixth in the Premier League . 
 = Battle of Jumonville Glen = 
 The Battle of Jumonville Glen , also known as the Jumonville affair , was the opening battle of the French and Indian War fought on May 28 , 1754 near what is present @-@ day Hopwood and Uniontown in Fayette County , Pennsylvania . A company of colonial militia from Virginia under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Washington , and a small number of Mingo warriors led by Tanacharison ( also known as " Half King " ) , ambushed a force of 35 Canadiens under the command of Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville . 
 The British colonial force had been sent to protect a fort under construction under the auspices of the Ohio Company at the location of present @-@ day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . A larger Canadien force had driven off the small construction crew , and sent Jumonville to warn Washington about encroaching on French @-@ claimed territory . Washington was alerted to Jumonville 's presence by Tanacharison , and they joined forces to surround the Canadian camp . Some of the Canadians were killed in the ambush , and most of the others were captured . Jumonville was among the slain , although the exact circumstances of his death are a subject of historical controversy and debate . 
 Since Britain and France were not then at war , the event had international repercussions , and was a contributing factor in the start of the Seven Years ' War in 1756 . After the action , Washington retreated to Fort Necessity , where Canadian forces from Fort Duquesne compelled his surrender . The terms of Washington 's surrender included a statement ( written in French , a language Washington did not read ) admitting that Jumonville was assassinated . This document and others were used by the French and Canadiens to level accusations that Washington had ordered Jumonville 's slaying . 
 = = Background = = 
 Throughout the 1740s and early 1750s , British and Canadian traders had increasingly come into contact in the Ohio Country , including the upper watershed of the Ohio River in what is now western Pennsylvania . Authorities in New France became more aggressive in their efforts to expel British traders and colonists from this area , and in 1753 began construction of a series of fortifications in the area . 
 The French action drew the attention of not just the British , but also the Indian tribes of the area . Despite good Franco @-@ Indian relations , British traders had become highly successful in convincing the Indians to trade with them in preference to the Canadiens , and the planned large @-@ scale advance was not well received by all . In particular , Tanacharison , a Mingo chief also known as the " Half King " , became decidedly anti @-@ French as a consequence . In a meeting with Paul Marin de la Malgue , commander of the French and Canadien construction force , the latter reportedly lost his temper , and shouted at the Indian chief , " I tell you , down the river I will go . If the river is blocked up , I have the forces to burst it open and tread under my feet all that oppose me . I despise all the stupid things you have said . " He then threw down some wampum that Tanacharison had offered as a good will gesture . Marin died not long after , and command of the operations was turned over to Jacques Legardeur de Saint @-@ Pierre . 
 Virginia Royal Governor Robert Dinwiddie sent militia Major George Washington to the Ohio Country ( a territory that was claimed by several of the British colonies , including Virginia ) as an emissary in December of 1753 , to tell the French to leave . Saint @-@ Pierre politely informed Washington that he was there pursuant to orders , that Washington 's letter should have been addressed to his commanding officer in Canada , and that he had no intention of leaving . 
 Washington returned to Williamsburg and informed Governor Dinwiddie that the French refused to leave . Dinwiddie commissioned Washington a lieutenant colonel , and ordered him to begin raising a militia regiment to hold the Forks of the Ohio , a site Washington had identified as a fine location for a fortress . The governor also issued a captain 's commission to Ohio Company employee William Trent , with instructions to raise a small force and immediately begin construction of the fort . Dinwiddie issued these instructions on his own authority , without even asking for funding from the Virginia House of Burgesses until after the fact . Trent 's company arrived on site in February 1754 , and began construction of a storehouse and stockade with the assistance of Tanacharison and the Mingos . That same month a force of 800 Canadien militia and French troupes de la marine departed Montreal for the Ohio River valley under the command of the Canadien Claude @-@ Pierre <unk> de Contrecœur , who took over command from Saint @-@ Pierre . When Contrecœur learned of Trent 's activity , he led a force of about 500 men ( troupes de la marine , militia , and Indians ) to drive them off ( rumors reaching Trent 's men put its size at 1 @,@ 000 ) . On April 16 , Contrecœur 's force arrived at the forks ; the next day , Trent 's force of 36 men , led by Ensign Edward Ward in Trent 's absence , agreed to leave the site . The French then began construction of the fort they called Fort Duquesne . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In March 1754 , Governor Dinwiddie ordered Washington back to the frontier with instructions to " act on the [ defensive ] , but in Case any Attempts are made to obstruct the Works or interrupt our [ settlements ] by any Persons whatsoever , You are to restrain all such Offenders , & in Case of resistance to make Prisoners of or kill & destroy them . " Historian Fred Anderson describes Dinwiddie 's instructions , which were issued without the knowledge or direction of the British government in London , as " an invitation to start a war . " Washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way . By the time he left for the frontier on April 2 , he had recruited fewer than 160 men . 
 Along their march through the forests of the frontier , Washington was joined by more men at Winchester . At this point he learned from Captain Trent of the French advance . Trent also brought a message from Tanacharison , who promised warriors to assist the British . To keep Tanacharison 's support , Washington decided not to turn back , choosing instead to advance . He reached a place known as the Great Meadows ( now in Fayette County , Pennsylvania ) , about 37 miles ( 60 km ) south of the forks , began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions . 
 Contrecœur operated under orders that forbade attacks by his force unless they were provoked . On May 23 , he sent Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville with 35 soldiers ( principally Canadian recruits , but also including French recruits and officers ) to see if Washington had entered French territory , and with a summons to order Washington 's troops out ; this summons was similar in nature to the one Washington had delivered to them four months earlier . 
 On May 27 , Washington was informed by Christopher Gist , a settler who had accompanied him on the 1753 expedition , that a Canadian party numbering about 50 was in the area . In response , Washington sent 75 men with Gist to find them . That evening , Washington received a message from Tanacharison , informing him that he had found the Canadien camp , and that the two of them should meet . Despite the fact that he had just sent another group in pursuit of the Canadians , Washington went with a detachment of 40 men to meet with Tanacharison . The Mingo leader had with him 12 warriors , two of whom were boys . After discussing the matter , the two leaders agreed to make an attack on the Canadians . The attackers took up positions behind rocks around the Canadian camp , counting not more than 40 Canadiens . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Exactly what happened next has been a subject of controversy and debate . The few primary accounts of the affair agree on a number of facts , and disagree on others . They agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes , that Jumonville was killed , and that most of his party were either killed or taken prisoner . According to Canadian records , most of the dead were colonials : <unk> and Caron from Québec City , Charles Bois from Pointe @-@ Claire , Jérôme from La Prairie , L 'Enfant from Montréal , Paris from Mille @-@ Isles , Languedoc and Martin from <unk> , and <unk> from Trois @-@ Rivières . 
 Washington 's accounts of the battle exist in several versions ; they are consistent with each other , but short on details . He wrote in his diary , " We were advanced pretty near to them ... when they discovered us ; whereupon I ordered my company to fire ... [ <unk> 's ] Company ... received the whole Fire of the French , during the greatest Part of the Action , which only lasted a Quarter of an Hour , before the Enemy was routed . We killed Mr. de Jumonville , the commander ... also nine others ; we wounded one , and made Twenty @-@ one Prisoners " . 
 Contrecœur prepared an official report of the action that was based on two sources . Most of it came from a Canadien named Monceau who escaped the action but apparently did not witness Jumonville 's slaying : " [ Jumonville 's party ] saw themselves surrounded by the English on one side and the Indians on the Other . The English gave them two volleys , but the Indians did not fire . Mr. de Jumonville , by his interpreter , told them to desist , that he had something to tell them . Upon which they ceased firing . Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire , to be read ... Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville , whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time , said Monceau made the best of his Way to us " . Contrecœur 's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison 's camp , who reported that " Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket @-@ Shot in the Head , whilst they were reading the Summons " . The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the Englishmen from slaughtering the Frenchmen . 
 A third account was made by a private named John Shaw who was in Washington 's regiment , but not present at the affair . His account , based on detailed accounts from others who were present , was made in a sworn statement on August 21 ; the details on Tanacharison 's role in the affair are confirmed in a newspaper account printed on June 27 . In his account , the French were surrounded while some still slept . Alerted by a noise , one of the Frenchmen " fired a Gun upon which Col. Washington gave the Word for all his Men to fire . Several of them being killed , the rest <unk> themselves to flight , but our Indians haveing gone round the French ... they fled back to the English and delivered up their Arms ... Some Time after [ , ] the Indians came up [ , ] the Half King took his Tomahawk and split the Head of the French Captain haveing first asked if he was an Englishman and haveing been told he was a French Man . He then took his Brains and washed his Hands with them and then scalped him . All this ... [ Shaw ] has heard and never heard it contradicted but knows nothing of it from his own Knowledge " . Shaw 's narrative is substantially correct on a number of other details , including the size and composition of both forces . Shaw also claimed to have seen and counted the dead , numbering 13 or 14 . 
 Historian Fred Anderson documents a fourth account , by a deserter from the British @-@ Indian camp named Denis Kaninguen ; Anderson speculates that he was one of Tanacharison 's followers . His report to the French commanders echoed that of Shaw : " notwithstanding the discharge of musket fire that [ Washington ] had made upon him , he [ Washington ] intended to read [ the summons ] and had withdrawn himself to his people , whom he had [ previously ] ordered to fire upon the French [ . T ] hat [ Tanacharison ] , a savage , came up to [ the wounded Jumonville ] and had said , Thou are not yet dead , my father , and struck several hatchet blows with which he killed him . " Anderson notes that Kaninguen apparently understood what Tanacharison said , and understood it to be a ritual slaying . Kaninguen reported that 30 men were taken prisoner , and 10 to 12 had been killed . The British colonists suffered only one killed and two or three wounded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Washington wrote a letter to his brother after the battle , in which he said " I can with truth assure you , I heard bullets whistle and believe me , there was something charming in the sound . " Following the battle , Washington returned to the Great Meadows and pushed onward the construction of a fort , which was called Fort Necessity . The dead were left on the field or buried in shallow graves , where they were later found by the French . 
 On June 28 , 1754 , a combined force of 600 French , Canadien and Indian soldiers under the command of Jumonville 's brother , Louis Coulon de Villiers , left Fort Duquesne . On July 3 , they captured Fort Necessity in the Battle of the Great Meadows , forcing Washington to negotiate a withdrawal under arms . The capitulation document Washington signed , which was written in French ( a language Washington did not know how to read , and may have been poorly translated for him ) , included language claiming that Jumonville and his men were assassinated .

 When news of the two battles reached England in August , the government of the Duke of Newcastle , after several months of negotiations , decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French . Major General Edward Braddock was chosen to lead the expedition . He was defeated at the Battle of the Monongahela , and the French remained in control of Fort Duquesne until 1758 , when an expedition under General John Forbes finally succeeded in taking the fort . 
 Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock 's departure for North America , and King Louis XV dispatched a much larger body of troops to Canada in 1755 . Although they arrived too late to participate in Braddock 's defeat , the French troop presence led to a string of French victories in the following years . In a second British act of aggression , Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide in a naval action on June 8 , 1755 , capturing her and two troop ships carrying some of those troops . Military matters escalated on both North American soil and at sea until France and Britain declared war on each other in spring 1756 , marking the formal start of the Seven Years ' War . 
 = = Propaganda and analysis = = 
 Because of the inconsistent nature of the record of the action , contemporary and historical coverage of it has been easily colored by preferences for one account over another . Francis Parkman , for example , accepted Washington 's account , and was highly dismissive of the accounts by Monceau and the Indian . 
 French authorities assembled a dossier of documents to counter British accounts of the affair . Entitled " Mémoire <unk> le <unk> des faits , avec leurs pièces <unk> , pour servir de <unk> aux ' Observations ' <unk> par les <unk> d 'Angleterre , dans les cours de l 'Europe " , a copy was intercepted in 1756 , translated , and published as " A memorial containing a summary view of facts , with their authorities , in answer to observations sent by the English ministry to the courts of Europe " . It used Washington 's capitulation statement and other documents , including extracts of Washington 's journal taken at Fort Necessity , to suggest that Washington had actually ordered the assassination of Jumonville . But not all Frenchmen agreed with the story : the Chevalier de Lévis called it a " pretended assassination " . The French story contrasted with that of the British account . Based on Washington 's report , the British suggested that Jumonville , rather than being engaged on a diplomatic mission , was spying on them . Jumonville 's orders included specific instructions to notify Contrecœur if the summons was read , so that additional forces might be sent if needed . 
 Historian Fred Anderson theorizes about the reasons for Tanacharison 's action in the killing , and provides a possible explanation for why one of Tanacharison 's men reports the event as a British killing of a Frenchman . Tanacharison had lost influence over some of the local tribes ( specifically the Delawares ) , and may have thought that conflict between the British and French would bring them back under his influence as allies of the British . According to Parkman , after the Indians scalped the French , they sent a scalp to the Delawares , in essence offering them the opportunity to " take up the hatchet " with the British and against the French .

 New York State Route 5 ( NY 5 ) is a state highway that extends for 370 @.@ 87 miles ( 596 @.@ 86 km ) across the state of New York in the United States . It begins at the Pennsylvania state line in the Chautauqua County town of Ripley and passes through Buffalo , Syracuse , Utica , Schenectady , and several other smaller cities and communities on its way to downtown Albany in Albany County , where it terminates at U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) , here routed along the service roads for Interstate 787 ( I @-@ 787 ) . Prior to the construction of the New York State Thruway , it was one of two main east – west highways traversing upstate New York , the other being US 20 . West of New York , NY 5 continues as Pennsylvania Route 5 ( PA 5 ) to Erie . 
 NY 5 overlaps with US 20 twice along its routing . The second , a 68 @-@ mile ( 109 km ) overlap through western and central New York , is the second @-@ longest concurrency in the state , stretching from Avon east to the city of Auburn in Cayuga County . The concurrency is known locally as " Routes 5 and 20 " . As the route proceeds across the state , it also directly or indirectly meets every major north – south highway in upstate New York , including all three north – south Interstate Highways ( I @-@ 390 in Avon , I @-@ 81 in Syracuse via US 11 , and I @-@ 87 in Albany ) . 
 NY 5 was assigned in 1924 as a true cross @-@ state highway , extending from the Pennsylvania state line in the west to the Massachusetts state line in the east , mostly by way of modern US 20 . At the time , modern NY 5 between Buffalo and Albany was designated as New York State Route 5A . By 1926 , NY 5 was moved onto the routing of NY 5A while the old routing of NY 5 became NY 7 . It was truncated in 1927 to Athol Springs in the west and Albany in the east following the assignment of US 20 , and again in 1930 to downtown Buffalo . NY 5 was reextended to the Pennsylvania state line c . 1932 by way of its old routing to Athol Springs , an old alignment of US 20 , and a lakeside spur route of US 20 that had been assigned in 1930 . Only local realignments have occurred since . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Although it is no longer commonly used for long distance travel , NY 5 is still regionally important . NY 5 is named Main Street in Buffalo , Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street in Syracuse , State Street in Schenectady , and Central Avenue in Albany , the state capital . It is a major local road in many other locations along its path . NY 5 runs concurrent to US 20 twice between its endpoints : for three miles ( 5 km ) between Silver Creek and Irving and for 68 miles ( 109 km ) across western and central New York . At 67 @.@ 6 miles ( 108 km ) in length , the eastern overlap between US 20 and NY 5 is the longest surface @-@ road concurrency in New York state , behind only the concurrency of I @-@ 86 and NY 17 in the Southern Tier . 
 Maintenance of the majority of NY 5 's 371 miles ( 597 km ) is performed by the New York State Department of Transportation . However , locally owned and maintained sections exist in six cities . The city @-@ maintained sections of NY 5 are in Buffalo from NY 16 north to the city line ( except of the Goodell Street portion , which is state @-@ maintained ) ; in Syracuse between the western city line and just west of NY 635 ; in Utica from Leland Avenue east to the city line ; in Amsterdam between Division and West Main streets ; in Schenectady from Washington Avenue to the eastern city line ; and the entirety of NY 5 within Albany .

 At the New York – Pennsylvania border in Ripley , PA 5 becomes NY 5 upon entering New York . It very closely follows the shore of Lake Erie through all of Chautauqua County . Once reaching the village of Silver Creek it briefly overlaps US 20 until entering Erie County at the Cattaraugus Reservation and NY 438 where the roads once again split . Once in Erie County it pulls slightly inward from the lake shore from Brant to the hamlet of <unk> . Once past <unk> , the road once again closely borders the lake shore and goes through steadily more heavily developed areas , particularly the Ford Stamping Plant and the Bethlehem Steel plant in the city of Lackawanna where the road is called the Hamburg Turnpike and eight wind powered turbines , which pump power into the national grid are visible . Near the northern edge of the city , NY 5 begins to ascend onto an elevated roadway as it connects to Ridge Road and the Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens by way of an interchange . Here , the route becomes the Buffalo Skyway , a limited @-@ access highway with exits for Ohio and <unk> streets and Fuhrmann Boulevard . After a quarter @-@ mile , NY 5 passes seamlessly into the city of Buffalo . 
 A short distance past the city line , NY 5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on a span of the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge . North of the waterway , the Skyway gains a pair of frontage roads , both named Fuhrmann Boulevard . Both the service roads and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until the northern end of the Buffalo Outer Harbor . Here , the frontage roads end while NY 5 turns to the northeast , crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown . On the north bank , the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes First Niagara Center , located directly to the east , and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park , situated to the west , and meets I @-@ 190 at exit 7 . Past the interchange , the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation , becoming an at @-@ grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall . NY 384 begins here , following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown , while NY 5 turns east onto Church . 
 At Main Street , Church Street splits into a pair of one @-@ way streets and becomes North and South Division Street . The route follows South Division eastward for two blocks to an intersection with Ellicott Street located one block north of Coca @-@ Cola Field . At the junction , which includes the northern terminus of NY 16 , NY 5 turns northward , rejoining NY 5 westbound one block later at North Division . The route continues on Ellicott for nine blocks to the unidirectional East Tupper Street , where NY 5 westbound separates from the route once more . NY 5 eastbound , however , continues north on Ellicott for an additional block to the one @-@ way Goodell Street . NY 5 heads west on Goodell for two blocks before turning north onto Main Street , rejoining NY 5 westbound at the intersection . 
 The route continues along Main Street throughout the remainder of its length in Buffalo , cutting through the city diagonally from southwest to northeast until it enters the town of Amherst at the intersection of Bailey Avenue ( US 62 ) at the south campus of the University at Buffalo . 
 = = = Buffalo to Avon = = = 
 Once leaving the city of Buffalo , NY 5 heads east through the densely populated suburban town of Amherst , including the hamlets of Snyder and Eggertsville and the village of Williamsville and is heavily developed through the entire length of the town , particularly at the intersection with Transit Road ( NY 78 ) . In the town of Clarence , the road dips into a significant depression known as Clarence Hollow . Once leaving Clarence , NY 5 goes through predominantly rural areas until reaching the city of Batavia in Genesee County , closely paralleling the New York State Thruway through much of the county . The road travels eastward until reaching Livingston County and the village of Caledonia . 
 NY 5 heads southeast from the village of Caledonia , paralleling the former right @-@ of @-@ way of an Erie – Lackawanna Railroad branch line that connected the villages of Caledonia and Avon as it heads through spacious fields containing little more than farmland . At a rural intersection controlled by single @-@ head flashing traffic signals west of Avon , NY 5 meets US 20 for the second time . The routes embark on a second concurrency , merging onto the right @-@ of @-@ way of NY 5 as they cross the Genesee River and enter both the town and village of Avon . 
 = = = Avon to Ontario County = = = 
 US 20 and NY 5 become West Main Street upon entering the village , underscoring the road 's status as the primary east – west highway through the town . The route continues southeast from the Genesee , passing through the forested but sparsely populated western area of the village . As the route approaches the Livonia , Avon and Lakeville Railroad ( <unk> ) grade crossing , the number of homes increases rapidly , only to be replaced by businesses in the area surrounding the <unk> mainline . Located on the western edge of this transition is NY 39 , which terminates at this junction . Past the tracks , West Main intersects Rochester Street , a locally important north – south two @-@ lane arterial that continues north of the village to the Rochester suburb of Brighton as East River Road . Shortly after this intersection , the homes return , following US 20 and NY 5 as West Main enters the heart of the village . 
 In the center of Avon , West Main feeds into Park Place , a large traffic circle providing access to two local streets from US 20 and NY 5 . The routes follow the circle counterclockwise , departing the roundabout on East Main Street . The street proceeds east , passing through four blocks of densely populated neighborhoods before exiting the village and abruptly entering vast , barren fields to the east . US 20 and NY 5 , now named Avon – Lima Road , intersects NY 15 two miles ( 3 km ) to the east in East Avon , a community based around the intersection and the streets comprising it , and connects to I @-@ 390 at exit 10 a half @-@ mile from NY 15 . Continuing on , the road intersects a number of county routes over the next four miles ( 6 km ) before becoming West Main Street once more , this time for the village of Lima . At an intersection with NY 15A in the village center , US 20 and NY 5 become East Main Street , retaining the name to the Ontario County line at Honeoye Creek .

 In the town of West Bloomfield , US 20 and NY 5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward . Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield , US 20 and NY 5 meet the southern terminus of NY 65 . Exiting the hamlet , US 20 and NY 5 head through another area dominated by open land , intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield . A mile and a half from the town line , US 20 and NY 5 intersect NY 64 , a road running northwest – southeast from the Monroe County line south to US 20 and NY 5 . NY 64 , whose right @-@ of @-@ way ends at US 20 and NY 5 at the foot of a small hill , joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap , entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY 444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb . Near the junction with NY 444 , US 20 , NY 5 and NY 64 take on a due east alignment , absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point . 
 A mile to the east at Whalen Road , NY 64 separates from US 20 and NY 5 , following the road , and US 20A , which has its eastern terminus at this intersection , south toward Bristol . US 20 and NY 5 continue on through rural Ontario County before splitting from its easterly alignment at an intersection four miles ( 6 km ) east of US 20A and NY 64 in the town of Canandaigua . West Avenue , the former routing of US 20 and NY 5 into downtown Canandaigua , continues east from the junction while US 20 and NY 5 turn south onto a bypass around Canandaigua . 
 = = = = Canandaigua area = = = = 
 Half a mile from the start of the bypass and a short distance before the arterial makes a turn eastward to traverse Canandaigua Lake to the southeast , US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 21 at a four @-@ way intersection . Like US 20 and NY 5 , NY 21 once continued directly into downtown , in this instance via Bristol Street to the east of the junction , but now follows US 20 and NY 5 along the east – west leg of the bypass . Past Bristol Street , the bypass widens from two to four lanes and , after meeting two local streets , enters the city of Canandaigua as the limited @-@ access Western Boulevard , albeit with no exits . The route loses this distinction prior to intersecting South Main Street , where US 20 , NY 5 and NY 21 meet the southern terminus of NY 332 . NY 21 departs the bypass , following NY 332 into downtown , while US 20 and NY 5 continue onto the four @-@ laned , median separated Eastern Boulevard , the original section of the US 20 and NY 5 bypass of Canandaigua . The roadway acts a center of commerce for the city , sporting restaurants , hotels , and supermarkets along its length within the city limits . 
 Upon exiting the city , the establishments become a pair of shopping plazas centered around the intersection with the northern terminus of NY 364 . Across the town line in Hopewell a quarter @-@ mile to the east , a third plaza , anchored by Runnings , formerly a Walmart , dominates the northeast corner of CR 10 and Eastern Boulevard . On the adjacent parcel is another plaza containing the current Walmart . At the entrance to the second plaza , US 20 and NY 5 intersect Lakeshore Drive , the former routing of US 20 and NY 5 to the south of the bypass . Past the junction , the divided highway comes to an end and , after another half @-@ mile , narrows to two lanes . 
 = = = Canandaigua to Auburn = = = 
 Deeper into Hopewell , the area surrounding US 20 and NY 5 become rural once more . Roughly 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the end of the bypass , US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 247 . After 10 @.@ 3 miles ( 16 @.@ 6 km ) of eastward progression through open land , the routes meet the northern terminus of both NY 14A and NY 245 , concurrent at this location , in the town of Geneva . A half @-@ mile past NY 14A and NY 245 , US 20 and NY 5 enter the city of Geneva and widens into a four lane road . In the city , US 20 and NY 5 intersect NY 14 by way of a pseudo @-@ interchange on the bank of Seneca Lake . US 20 and NY 5 turn into a divided highway again at this point . At the interchange , NY 14 Truck joins US 20 and NY 5 , bypassing a sharp turn on NY 14 downtown . US 20 and NY 5 continues as a divided highway around the northern tip of Seneca Lake , crossing the <unk> Line and entering Seneca County at its midpoint . A mile to the east in East Geneva , just east of a railroad underpass , US 20 and NY 5 meet the northern terminus of NY 96A at a former trumpet interchange that has been converted to an intersection with a traffic signal . 
 From NY 96A east to the village of Waterloo , a distance of roughly four miles , US 20 and NY 5 become a two lane road and run parallel to the Cayuga – Seneca Canal . In Waterloo , the concurrency meets NY 96 in the village center . East of the village , the distance between the canal and the roadway decreases , making US 20 and NY 5 the closest road to the water for the next one and a half miles to NY 414 in the town of Seneca Falls . NY 414 joins US 20 and NY 5 , overlapping the road for 4 @.@ 3 miles ( 6 @.@ 9 km ) into the hamlet of Seneca Falls . At Cayuga Street , NY 414 turns south , crossing the water body that is the canal and the Seneca River and becoming Ovid Street while US 20 and NY 5 turn north onto Cayuga , following the street around the small Van Cleef Lake , through the Finger Lakes Railway grade crossing , and exiting the hamlet . Three miles from NY 414 , just west of Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge , US 20 and NY 5 meet NY 318 and NY 89 at intersections just 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 16 km ) apart . The intersection with NY 89 has a traffic signal . 
 About three miles ( 5 km ) later , after entering Cayuga County over the Seneca River / Cayuga and Seneca Canal , just north of Cayuga Lake , the two routes meet NY 90 in the town of Aurelius , at a traffic signal . A few miles east of that intersection , the highway meets the Finger Lakes Railway again , but crosses it via an overpass . The routes continue eastward through Aurelius to the city of Auburn where it turns into a divided four @-@ lane highway again . On the western edge of the city , just after passing Finger Lakes Mall , US 20 and NY 5 meet the eastern terminus of NY 326 , which is also a four lane divided highway for a short stretch . In downtown Auburn , US 20 and NY 5 's east and west lanes split apart from each other for a short distance as an arterial over the alignments of Clark Street , Franklin Street , and Grant Avenue . The arterial runs concurrent with NY 38 for 0 @.@ 2 miles ( 0 @.@ 3 km ) . NY 38 then splits from the concurrency and joins NY 34 . A quarter @-@ mile to the east , US 20 separates from NY 5 at the northern terminus of NY 38A . NY 5 continues on after the split as the four @-@ lane Grant Avenue passing by a high number of shopping areas .

 From NY 174 in Camillus to Fairmount , NY 5 is a 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) limited @-@ access highway traversing the western suburbs of Syracuse . At one time , the highway was to be extended to West Street in Syracuse , via the current Grand Avenue . The freeway has partial access to NY 173 from westbound NY 5 . East of NY 173 , the freeway connects to NY 695 at a directional T interchange and passes over NY 297 without access . East of Fairmount , NY 5 alters to the south before turning east onto West Genesee Street and converting to grade @-@ level intersections . 
 In Syracuse , NY 5 is parallel to I @-@ 690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway , thus making the north – south streets that intersect NY 5 entry points to and from I @-@ 690 . In downtown Syracuse , West Genesee Street becomes James Street . At the southern tip of the interchange between I @-@ 690 and I @-@ 81 , NY 5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street ( US 11 ) , but passes under I @-@ 81 without access . From the downtown area to DeWitt , NY 5 is divided . At the Syracuse – DeWitt boundary , NY 5 intersects NY 635 and eastward , it curves to a southeast course . Near <unk> Mall , NY 5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY 92 . Less than a mile east of the mall , NY 5 and NY 92 intersect I @-@ 481 at a cloverleaf interchange . 
 = = = Syracuse to Utica = = = 
 NY 5 and NY 92 remain concurrent up to Highbridge Road , where NY 92 splits from NY 5 and heads southeast to Manlius . The segment of the overlap with NY 92 between I @-@ 481 and the eastern split is the busiest area of NY 5 in the Syracuse area and in all of Onondaga County . Past the split , NY 5 continues east through Onondaga and Madison counties , passing Fayetteville , Chittenango , and <unk> before entering the vicinity of Oneida . West of the city , NY 5 intersects NY <unk> , a spur route of NY 365 leading directly into downtown . To the east , NY 5 ( which forms the southern boundary of the city ) meets NY 46 before crossing over Oneida Creek and into Oneida County . 
 Just past the county line in Oneida Castle , NY 5 intersects NY 365 , a route leading northward to the New York State Thruway in Verona . NY 5 presses on , passing through the city of Sherrill and the village of Vernon ( briefly overlapping NY 31 ) and the town of Westmoreland to the town of Kirkland , where NY 5 intersects NY 233 , crosses over Oriskany Creek , and meets the western terminus of NY 5B . The spur of NY 5 later rejoins its parent yards from where NY 5A departs NY 5 to serve western Utica . NY 5 itself continues eastward through New Hartford , meeting NY 12B prior to merging with NY 12 at Genesee Street . Both routes continue eastward across the <unk> Creek into Utica . 
 = = = Utica to Albany = = = 
 NY 5 enters the city of Utica on a concurrency with NY 12 heading in a northeast direction . It shortly picks up NY 8 , and all three cross the city together . NY 5 also intersects with the terminus of NY 840 at this point . Just south of the New York State Thruway , I @-@ 790 begins as a short expressway , also including NY 5 , NY 8 , and NY 12 . After crossing out of the city , they meet the Thruway , with NY 8 and 12 continuing northeast , while I @-@ 790 and NY 5 turn to the east @-@ south @-@ east , picking up the tail @-@ end of NY 49 . These three , still as an expressway , straddle each side of the Thruway for a short way , with I @-@ 790 technically ending at the ramps for I @-@ 90 . NY 5 continues to the end of the expressway , only a few hundred feet later , dropping to Leland Avenue . A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway , NY 5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road . It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer , where NY 5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village , becoming State Street , while I @-@ 90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance . There is a short concurrency with NY 28 in the village . 
 After exiting Herkimer , NY 5 continues east , closely paralleling this time the canal , through the city of Little Falls as Main Street , where two more concurrencies occur , with NY 167 and NY 169 . NY 5 continues to parallel the canal , and in some instances again , the Thruway , through Amsterdam , becoming Amsterdam Road all the way to Scotia , where it crosses the canal into Schenectady as Mohawk Avenue , turning into State Street upon entering the city limits . It continues fairly straight on a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park . At this point , NY 5 turns into Washington Avenue and all signage referring to NY 5 ceases . The New York State Department of Transportation recognizes the route , however , as it continues down Washington Ave past the New York State Capitol building , turning south for a short distance as Eagle Street . NY 5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway , where it again turns south east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway , traveling underneath US 9 and I @-@ 787 . NY 5 ends at the Hudson River .

 Soon after the end of the American Revolution in 1783 , a surge of westward migration into Central and Western New York began . At the time , most travel west of the Albany area was by water . While rudimentary roads were laid out following the Mohawk River , there were no major land routes west of Fort Schuyler ( present day Utica ) , except for an old east – west Iroquois trail that was a simple foot path . By the late 1780s many companies began to set up their operations in the new settlements in the Central and Western New York . As a result , there was a clamor for the building of a main road running west from Utica . 
 On March 22 , 1794 , the New York State Legislature passed a law calling for the laying out and improvement of a public road from old Fort Schuyler on the Mohawk River to the settlement of Canawaugus on the Genesee River , in as straight a line as the topography of the land would allow . This road was officially known as the " Great Genesee Road " and is one of the earliest state roads in New York , intended to provide access to the New Military Tract . As planned , it generally followed the old Iroquois trail through Oneida , Manlius , Onondaga Valley ( south of modern Syracuse ) , Skaneateles , Auburn , Seneca Falls , Geneva , and Canandaigua before ending at the Genesee River . Four years later , another legislative act authorized the extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo . 
 By the end of the 18th century , while the Genesee Road had been greatly improved and saw heavy traffic , many portions were still substandard and some sections had still not been completed . Partly because of this , and also because of the success of the Lancaster Turnpike in Pennsylvania , the state outsourced the task of improving and maintaining the Genesee Road to a private company . On April 1 , 1800 , the Seneca Road Company was chartered for this purpose and the portion of the Genesee Road from Utica to Canandaigua was improved and operated as a toll road known as the Seneca Turnpike , which was 157 miles ( 253 km ) long and , at the time , the longest turnpike in the state . Three days later , the old road following the Mohawk River between Utica and Schenectady also became a turnpike , known as the Mohawk Turnpike . 
 With the road leading from Albany northwest to Schenectady having been already established as a turnpike ( the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike ) in 1797 , an all @-@ turnpike route over good quality roads was now available from Albany to Canandaigua . The western extension of the Genesee Road to Buffalo soon followed suit and also became an improved Macadam toll road , the Ontario and Genesee Turnpike , in 1805 . The Seneca Road Company was authorized to create a more northerly alternate route of the Seneca Turnpike in 1806 . This branch left the original turnpike east of Seneca Falls and crossed more level terrain through Elbridge , Geddes , and Fayetteville before rejoining the old path at Chittenango . As the city of Syracuse developed , traffic patterns changed and the northern branch route became more heavily used than the original road . 
 The construction and opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies . In time , the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852 , causing the roads to revert to public control . The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852 . The old , southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus , NY 175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill , and NY 173 from there east to Chittenango . 
 = = = Designation = = = 
 The improvement of the road from Buffalo southwest to Pennsylvania in the mid @-@ 19th century soon allowed for continuous travel across the entire state of New York . With the advent of the automobile , the state began to take over and pave major thoroughfares at the beginning of the 20th century . In 1908 , the state legislature created a statewide system of unsigned legislative routes . One of the routes assigned at this time was Route 6 , an Albany – Buffalo highway that followed the path of the Genesee Road and the Seneca Turnpike from Buffalo to Utica , the Mohawk Turnpike between Utica and Schenectady , and the Albany and Schenectady Turnpike from Schenectady to Albany . From Auburn to Chittenango , Route 6 utilized most of the newer , northern branch of the Seneca Turnpike . 
 The automobile allowed people to quickly travel long distances and a way to mark routes became needed . One early means of marking routes was the establishment of various auto trail associations in the 1910s . These associations selected good quality roads and marked them with symbols or colors on telephone poles . Most of legislative Route 6 eventually became part of the Yellowstone Trail , a cross @-@ country auto trail established in 1912 that ran from Washington to Massachusetts . In New York , the trail used modern US 20 from Pennsylvania to Silver Creek , most of modern NY 5 from Silver Creek to Albany , and modern US 20 again from Albany to Massachusetts . 
 In 1924 , following what other states did , New York began to assign route numbers to its main thoroughfares . The Albany to Buffalo portion of the Yellowstone Trail , which ran through the cities of Syracuse and Utica , was assigned the number NY 5A . The portion of the Yellowstone Trail southwest of Buffalo and east of Albany became part of NY 5 , which bypassed Syracuse and Utica to the south . The Buffalo to Albany portion of NY 5 's original alignment used a new road , Broadway Road , from Buffalo to Avon and the old Cherry Valley Turnpike alignment from Skaneateles to Albany . In between Avon and Skaneateles , NY 5 and NY 5A overlapped . 
 By 1926 , however , the Buffalo to Albany section of NY 5 was relocated onto the Genesee Road alignment , replacing NY 5A . NY 5 's former , more southerly alignment was redesignated as NY 7 . In 1927 , the establishment of the U.S. Highway System created more numbering changes . US 20 , which mainly followed the Yellowstone Trail elsewhere in the country , was designated in New York along NY 5 southwest of Hamburg and east of Albany and along old NY 7 from Skaneateles to Albany . Between the towns of Hamburg and Avon , the new US 20 used an even more southerly alignment , running via East Aurora and Warsaw . This truncated both ends of NY 5 to Athol Springs ( south of Buffalo in the town of Hamburg ) in the west , and to Albany in the east . 
 In the 1930 state highway renumbering , NY 5 was truncated even further to begin in downtown Buffalo . The portion between Buffalo and Athol Springs was assigned as part of NY 62 . Southwest of Buffalo , Southwestern Boulevard , an alternate route of US 20 between Irving and Big Tree ( east of Athol Springs ) became NY 20B . Further southwest , another alternate route of US 20 between the Pennsylvania line and Silver Creek , running along the shore of Lake Erie , was designated as NY 20A . The NY 20A and NY 20B designations proved to be short @-@ lived . US 62 was extended into New York c . 1932 , causing NY 62 to be renumbered . Around the same time , US 20 was realigned to follow NY 20B from Irving to Big Tree . NY 5 was extended along part of old NY 62 to Athol Springs , from where it continued to the Pennsylvania state line by way of US 20 's old routing to Irving and all of NY 20A .

 Originally , NY 5 entered Buffalo from the south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and followed South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street . In the mid @-@ 1950s , a new limited @-@ access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River . At the river , the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown , returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square . The expressway , known as the Buffalo Skyway , became part of a rerouted NY 5 by 1956 . Visually , the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor . In 2008 , there was momentum to tear it down , but the momentum has passed . 
 Farther east in Utica , construction began in the early 1950s on a new arterial highway — known as the North – South Arterial — through the city center . The new roadway bypassed NY 5 , which was initially routed on Genesee Street and Herkimer Road through Utica . The first portion of the highway to open was the segment north of River Road , which was completed by 1956 . It was extended southward to Oriskany Street ( NY 5A ) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964 , at which time it became part of a rerouted NY 5 and NY 12 . Two portions of Genesee Street , from NY 12 in New Hartford to the Utica city line and from NY 5S to Herkimer Road in Utica , remain state maintained to this day as unsigned NY <unk> and NY <unk> , respectively . 
 In the Syracuse suburbs of Camillus and Geddes , NY 5 was initially routed on West Genesee Street between the villages of Camillus and Solvay . Construction on a bypass of this segment of NY 5 began in the early 1970s and was completed between NY 695 and Genesee Street by 1977 . By the following year , the freeway was open to traffic up to Hinsdale Road ; however , NY 5 remained on Genesee Street between Hinsdale and the Solvay village limits . The remainder of the Camillus Bypass was completed c . 1979 , at which time NY 5 was realigned to follow the freeway . Genesee Street is now largely maintained by Onondaga County as CR 98 ; however , two portions of the street remain state maintained . Near the western end of the expressway , the former routing of NY 5 became part of an extended NY 174 . Between the Camillus town line and the eastern end of the bypass , Genesee Street is unsigned NY <unk> . 
 Smaller realignments also took place in other cities along the route . In Canandaigua , NY 5 originally entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore Drive through the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell . In the mid @-@ 1950s , a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell . It became part of a realigned NY 5 by 1956 . The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern extents of the city was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s . The former routing of NY 5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY <unk> ; until 1996 , the portion of West Avenue between the west end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) as NY <unk> . Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996 , the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007 . 
 In Geneva , NY 5 was initially routed on East North Street and Border City Road , overlapping NY 14 through the city and rejoining its modern routing in East Geneva . The overlap was eliminated c . 1931 when NY 5 was moved onto a new roadway located along the edge of Seneca Lake . NY 5 was realigned again in the 1960s to use a new divided highway built midway between the lake shore road and Border City Road . Border City Road is now maintained by Seneca County as CR 110 . 
 = = Suffixed routes = = 
 NY 5 has three suffixed routes , all located in Oneida County , with NY 5S extending eastward into three other counties . The NY 5A designation was also used for two other routes . 
 The NY 5A designation has been used for three distinct highways : 
 The first NY 5A was a short @-@ lived designation for the portion of modern NY 5 east of Buffalo . When it existed from 1924 to the mid @-@ 1920s , NY 5 was routed on what is now US 20 . 
 The second NY 5A was a northerly alternate route of NY 5 between Aurelius and Sennett in Cayuga County . It was assigned c . 1933 and renumbered to NY 135 c . 1937 . That route was removed c . 1939 . Its former routing is now maintained by Cayuga County as CR 10A , CR 10B , and CR 10C . 
 The current NY 5A ( 5 @.@ 65 miles or 9 @.@ 09 kilometres ) is a short alternate route of NY 5 between New Hartford and downtown Utica in Oneida County . It was assigned in the mid @-@ 1930s . 
 NY 5B ( 3 @.@ 12 miles or 5 @.@ 02 kilometres ) is a short alternate route southwest of Utica in Oneida County , connecting NY 5 to NY 12B . The route was assigned in the 1930s . 
 NY 5S ( 73 @.@ 03 miles or 117 @.@ 53 kilometres ) is an alternate route of NY 5 on the south side of the Mohawk River between Utica , Oneida County , and Rotterdam , Schenectady County . The route parallels NY 5 ( which follows the north side of the river ) and is partially a limited @-@ access highway . It was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York .

 The Sycamore Historic District is a meandering area encompassing 99 acres ( 400 @,@ 000 m2 ) of the land in and around the downtown of the DeKalb County , Illinois , county seat , Sycamore . The area includes historic buildings and a number of historical and Victorian homes . Some significant structures are among those located within the Historic District including the DeKalb County Courthouse and the Sycamore Public Library . The district has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since May 2 , 1978 . 
 There are over 200 properties within the irregular boundaries of the Sycamore Historic District . Of those , 187 are considered contributing properties to the historic district , and 22 are non @-@ contributing .

 The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act , which created the National Register of Historic Places , empowered individual states to create review boards to function with the state historical preservation officer . Illinois did not create its historic preservation program until the early 1970s , under the direction of the Illinois Department of Conservation . The Department of Conservation dispatched field surveyors to all Illinois counties to find anything that might qualify for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 The field surveyor who traveled to Sycamore in 1973 found a large number of late 19th and 20th century examples of architecture that he recommended the establishment of a historic district . The mayor of Sycamore then appointed a citizens ' committee to assist the state with the work involved in listing the district . 
 The residential areas within the district achieved their maturity before 1900 , though Sycamore has grown considerably from the 3 @,@ 330 or so that lived there from about 1900 until the 1970s most of the historic district remains intact as it was organized in 1978 . 
 = = Boundaries = = 
 The Historic District is bounded by Somonauk Street on the west and Main Street on the east , a stretch of two blocks . On the north end the district is bounded by Page Street and extends to the end of South Main street . Main and Somonauk are both north / south roads while Page is an east / west street . The district also extends along State Street ( Illinois Route 64 ) to the west until the 300 block . Somonauk Street is included through its 900 block . In addition section of Locust , Maple and California Streets are within the Sycamore Historic District . Other east / west streets also have portions included in the district , these are : Elm , High , Ottawa , Waterman and Lincoln . 
 The boundaries were drawn up by Robert Wagner , a Chicagoan who worked as a National Register assistant with the Illinois Department of Conservation . Wagner drew up the boundaries on the basis of " visual integrity . " . This led to an irregular pattern of inclusion for the Sycamore Historic District . Often one side of the street will be in the district while the other side will not . In other cases , such as with the library or the U.S. Post Office an arbitrary line was drawn with the sole purpose of including a specific structure . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The hodge podge of architectural styles that mingle in the Sycamore Historic District begins with Greek Revival structures which date from Sycamore 's foundation in the mid to late 1830s , also the heyday for that particular style . These structures are the oldest surviving within the district . After the Civil War other styles began to dot the landscape in and around downtown Sycamore , Illinois . Styles such as Italianate , Gothic Revival and Queen Anne can be found throughout the neighborhood . Government buildings and commercial buildings offer prime examples of Classical Revival architecture , a style showcased by the ornate DeKalb County Courthouse , Sycamore Public Library , U.S. Post Office and The National Bank & Trust Co. building . The current Sycamore Center , in the 300 block of State Street and once known as the Daniel Pierce Block , also exhibits . Classical Revival architecture . 
 Of the 226 properties within the Sycamore Historic District 40 are identified as " strongly contributing " to the overall character of the district . Twenty @-@ one of those are ranked as the most significant structures in the district . The majority of the rest of the buildings date from 1860 @-@ 1900 .

In the time since its listing , two churches have been destroyed or demolished . The Evangelical Church of St. John was destroyed by fire in 2004 and the United Methodist Church in Sycamore is no longer extant , replaced by a modern office building .

 The commercial buildings in the Sycamore Historic District , located in Sycamore , Illinois , United States are mostly located in and around the city 's downtown . The largest concentration of commercial contributing properties to the historic district are found along Illinois Route 64 as it passes through Sycamore . They include several buildings known as " blocks " which can consist of more than one adjacent and attached structure , as is the case with the Waterman Block , one of the Sycamore commercial buildings .

 Possibly the gem of the Sycamore Historic District is the DeKalb County Courthouse . The Courthouse sits in the center of a square facing Illinois Route 64 , directly across the north / south street , Main , from the Sycamore Public Library . It is a stunning example of Classical Revival architecture . The current structure was erected in 1905 being the third in a line of courthouses to serve DeKalb County .

 This building on Main Street was originally a garage owned by Sycamore resident Frederick B. Townsend . Townsend 's Queen Anne style home overlooks the lot from a small incline . The distinctive stone structure was constructed in 1906 for use as a garage for the estate of Frederick B. Townsend , his former home is the Queen Anne mansion that overlooks the garage property . Today it is home to a restaurant . After the building left private ownership the property was exploited for commercial use and became a gas station . Despite the years and the changes in function the building 's historical character remains intact .

 Though quite altered from its original state in the mid 19th century George 's Block remains one of the more eye catching structures in the Historic District . The George 's Block was constructed in 1857 and was then known as the James Block , after the owner Daniel P. James . James , a prominent citizen , lived in the nearby Jerkin @-@ roofed D. B. James House , another contributing property . By the 1860s the James name was gone but the building was still known as a block . Many buildings of the period were known as blocks , usually multi @-@ story and multi @-@ business , the buildings contained retail and professional space or , in the case of George 's Block , lecture halls or auditoriums . In the first year the building existed such famous men as Horace Greeley , Charles Sumner and Bayard Taylor spoke there .

 The houses in the Sycamore Historic District cross a variety of architectural styles and span from the 1830s to the early 20th century . There are 187 contributing properties within the historic district , 75 % of the districts buildings . Many of the homes are associated with early Sycamore residents , usually prominent business leaders or politicians . Houses within the district are known by , either their street address or by a name associated with a prominent owner or builder . For most of the houses , the latter is true . Some of the more prominent homes include the Charles O. Boynton House , the Frederick B. Townsend House , David Syme House and the Carlos <unk> House .

 The district includes 226 properties over its 99 acres ( 400 @,@ 000 m2 ) , of those , 187 are considered contributing members of the historic district . The buildings consist of a mix of residential , religious , commercial and governmental buildings . Many of the residential buildings are 2 or 2 ½ stories in height and feature generous setbacks from the street . These factors , along with the growth of mature shade trees , combine to give the streetscape a well @-@ balanced and integrated look and feel . While the usage of the properties in Sycamore Historic District is similar to that in other small , Illinois county seats the district 's properties are separated by their survival through the 20th century . The buildings themselves are most significant for their architecture which contributes to what the National Register of Historic Places nomination form in 1978 said conveyed " a gracious calm very close to the popular American image of an ideal small town .

 = Dewey Decimal Classification = 
 The Dewey Decimal Classification ( DDC ) , or Dewey Decimal System , is a proprietary library classification system first published in the United States by Melvil Dewey in 1876 . It has been revised and expanded through 23 major editions , the latest issued in 2011 , and has grown from a four @-@ page pamphlet in 1876 with fewer than 1 @,@ 000 classes to a four volume set . It is also available in an abridged version suitable for smaller libraries . It is currently maintained by the Online Computer Library Center ( OCLC ) , a non @-@ profit cooperative that serves libraries . OCLC licenses access to an online version for <unk> called WebDewey . 
 The Decimal Classification introduced the concepts of relative location and relative index which allow new books to be added to a library in their appropriate location based on subject . Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic . The classification 's notation makes use of three @-@ digit Arabic numerals for main classes , with fractional decimals allowing expansion for further detail . Using Arabic numerals for symbols , it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects . A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library , on the basis of its subject . The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves . The classification system is used in 200 @,@ 000 libraries in at least 135 countries . 
 The major competing classification system to the Dewey Decimal system is the Library of Congress Classification system created by the U.S. Library of Congress . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early development ( 1873 – 1885 ) = = = 
 Melvil Dewey ( 1851 – 1931 ) was an American librarian and self @-@ declared reformer . He is best known for the Decimal System that he created , but he also was a founding member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business . He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library . He applied the classification to the books in that library , until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification . In 1876 , he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library . He used the pamphlet , published in more than one version during the year , to solicit comments from other librarians . It is not known who received copies or how many commented as only one copy with comments has survived , that of Ernest Cushing Richardson . His classification system was mentioned in an article in the first issue of the Library Journal and in an article by Dewey in the Department of Education publication " Public Libraries in America " in 1876 . In March 1876 , he applied for , and received copyright on the first edition of the index . The edition was 44 pages in length , with 2 @,@ 000 index entries , and was printed in 200 copies . 
 = = = Period of adoption ( 1885 – 1942 ) = = = 
 The second edition of the Dewey Decimal system , published in 1885 with the title Decimal Classification and Relativ Index for arranging , cataloging , and indexing public and private libraries and for <unk> , clippings , notes , scrap books , index <unk> , etc . , comprised 314 pages , with 10 @,@ 000 index entries . 500 copies were produced . Editions 3 – 14 , published between 1888 and 1942 , used a variant of this same title . Dewey modified and expanded his system considerably for the second edition . In an introduction to that edition Dewey states that " nearly 100 persons hav [ spelling of " have " per English @-@ language spelling reform , which Dewey championed ] contributed criticisms and suggestions " . 
 One of the innovations of the Dewey Decimal system was that of positioning books on the shelves in relation to other books on similar topics . When the system was first introduced , most libraries in the US used fixed positioning : each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book 's height and date of acquisition . Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons , so shelf browsing was not considered of importance . The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons . 
 New editions were readied as supplies of previously published editions were exhausted , even though some editions provided little change from the previous , as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand . In the next decade , three editions followed closely on : the 3rd ( 1888 ) , 4th ( 1891 ) , and 5th ( 1894 ) . Editions 6 through 11 were published from 1899 to 1922 . The 6th edition was published in a record 7 @,@ 600 copies , although subsequent editions were much lower . During this time , the size of the volume grew , and edition 12 swelled to 1243 pages , an increase of 25 % over the previous edition . 
 In response to the needs of smaller libraries who were finding the expanded classification schedules difficult to use , in 1894 , the first abridged edition of the Dewey Decimal system was produced . The abridged edition generally parallels the full edition , and has been developed for most full editions since that date . By popular request , in 1930 , the Library of Congress began to print Dewey Classification numbers on nearly all of its cards , thus making the system immediately available to all libraries making use of the Library of Congress card sets . 
 Dewey 's was not the only library classification available , although it was the most complete . Charles Ammi Cutter published the Expansive Classification in 1882 , with initial encouragement from Melvil Dewey . Cutter 's system was not adopted by many libraries , with one major exception : it was used as the basis for the Library of Congress Classification system . 
 In 1895 , the International Institute of Bibliography , located in Belgium and led by Paul <unk> , contacted Dewey about the possibility of translating the classification into French , and using the classification system for bibliographies ( as opposed to its use for books in libraries ) . This would have required some changes to the classification , which was under copyright . Dewey gave permission for the creation of a version intended for bibliographies , and also for its translation into French . Dewey did not agree , however , to allow the International Institute of Bibliography to later create an English version of the resulting classification , considering that a violation of their agreement , as well as a violation of Dewey 's copyright . Shortly after Dewey 's death in 1931 , however , an agreement was reached between the committee overseeing the development of the Decimal Classification and the developers of the French Classification Decimal . The English version was published as the Universal Decimal Classification and is still in use today . 
 According to a study done in 1927 , the Dewey system was used in the US in approximately 96 % of responding public libraries and 89 % of the college libraries . After the death of Melvil Dewey in 1931 , administration of the classification was under the Decimal Classification Committee of the Lake Placid Club Education Foundation , and the editorial body was the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee with participation of the American Library Association ( ALA ) , Library of Congress , and Forest Press . By the 14th edition in 1942 , the Dewey Decimal Classification index was over 1 @,@ 900 pages in length and was published in two volumes . 
 = = = Forging an identity ( 1942 – present ) = = = 
 The growth of the classification to date had led to significant criticism from medium and large libraries which were too large to use the abridged edition but found the full classification overwhelming . Dewey had intended issuing the classification in three editions : the library edition , which would be the fullest edition ; the bibliographic edition , in English and French , which was to be used for the organization of bibliographies rather than of books on the shelf ; and the abridged edition . In 1933 , the bibliographic edition became the Universal Decimal Classification , which left the library and abridged versions as the formal Dewey Decimal Classification editions . The 15th edition , edited by Milton Ferguson , implemented the growing concept of the " standard edition " , designed for the majority of general libraries but not attempting to satisfy the needs of the very largest or of special libraries . It also reduced the size of the Dewey system by over half , from 1 @,@ 900 to 700 pages , a revision so radical that Ferguson was removed from the editorship for the next edition . The 16th and 17th editions , under the editorship of the Library of Congress , grew again to two volumes . However , by now , the Dewey Decimal system had established itself as a classification for general libraries , with the Library of Congress Classification having gained acceptance for large research libraries . 
 The first electronic version of " Dewey " was created in 1993 . Hard @-@ copy editions continue to be issued at intervals ; the online WebDewey and Abridged WebDewey are updated quarterly . 
 = = Administration and publication = = 
 Administratively , the very early editions were managed by Dewey and a small editorial staff . Beginning in 1922 , administrative affairs were managed by the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation , a not @-@ for @-@ profit organization founded by Melvil Dewey . The ALA created a Special Advisory Committee on the Decimal Classification as part of the Cataloging and Classification division of ALA , in 1952 . The previous Decimal Classification Committee was changed to the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee , with participation of the ALA Division of Cataloging and Classification , and the Library of Congress . 
 Melvil Dewey edited the first three editions of the classification system and oversaw the revisions of all editions until his death in 1931 . May Seymour became editor in 1891 , until her death in 1921 . She was followed by Dorcas Fellows , who was editor until her death in 1938 . Constantin J. <unk> edited the 14th edition . Milton Ferguson was editor from 1949 to 1951 . The 16th edition in 1958 was edited under an agreement between the Library of Congress and Forest Press , with David <unk> as director . Editions 16 @-@ 19 were edited by Benjamin A. Custer and the editor of edition 20 was John P. <unk> . Joan Mitchell was editor until 2013 , covering editions 21 @-@ 23 . The current Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief is Michael Panzer of OCLC . 
 Copyright in editions 1 @-@ 6 ( 1876 – 1919 ) was held by Dewey himself . Copyright in editions 7 – 10 were held by the publisher , The Library Bureau . On the death of May Seymour , Dewey conveyed the " <unk> and control of all editions " to the Lake Placid Club Educational Foundation , a non @-@ profit chartered in 1922 . The Online Computer Library Center ( OCLC ) of Dublin , Ohio , US , acquired the trademark and copyrights associated with the Dewey Decimal Classification system when it bought Forest Press in 1988 . In 2003 , the Dewey Decimal Classification came to national attention when OCLC sued the Library Hotel for trademark infringement for using the classification system as the hotel theme . The case was settled shortly thereafter . 
 Since 1988 , the classification has been maintained by the OCLC , which also publishes new editions of the system . The editorial staff responsible for updates is based partly at the Library of Congress and partly at OCLC . Their work is reviewed by the Decimal Classification Editorial Policy Committee , a ten @-@ member international board which meets twice each year . The four @-@ volume unabridged edition is published approximately every six years , the most recent edition ( DDC 23 ) in mid @-@ 2011 . The web edition is updated on an ongoing basis , with changes announced each month . An experimental version of Dewey in RDF is available at <unk> This includes access to the top three levels of the classification system in 14 languages . 
 In addition to the full version , a single volume abridged edition designed for libraries with 20 @,@ 000 titles or fewer has been made available since 1895 . " Abridged 15 " was published in early 2012 .

 The Dewey Decimal Classification organizes library materials by discipline or field of study . Main divisions include philosophy , social sciences , science , technology , and history . The scheme is made up of ten classes List of Dewey Decimal classes , each divided into ten divisions , each having ten sections . The system 's notation uses Arabic numbers , with three whole numbers making up the main classes and sub @-@ classes and decimals creating further divisions . The classification structure is hierarchical and the notation follows the same hierarchy . Libraries not needing the full level of detail of the classification can trim right @-@ most decimal digits from the class number to obtain a more general classification . For example : 
 500 Natural sciences and mathematics 
 510 Mathematics 
 516 Geometry 
 516 @.@ 3 Analytic geometries 
 516 @.@ 37 Metric differential geometries 
 516 @.@ 375 <unk> Geometry 
 The classification was originally enumerative , meaning that it listed all of the classes explicitly in the schedules . Over time it added some aspects of a faceted classification scheme , allowing classifiers to construct a number by combining a class number for a topic with an entry from a separate table . Tables cover commonly used elements such as geographical and temporal aspects , language , and bibliographic forms . For example , a class number could be constructed using 330 for economics + .9 for geographic treatment + <unk> for Europe to create the class 330 @.@ 94 European economy . Or one could combine the class 973 for United States + .05 for periodical publications on the topic to arrive at the number 973 @.@ 05 for periodicals concerning the United States generally . The classification also makes use of mnemonics in some areas , such that the number 5 represents the country Italy in classification numbers like 945 ( history of Italy ) , 450 ( Italian language ) , 195 ( Italian philosophy ) . The combination of faceting and mnemonics makes the classification synthetic in nature , with meaning built into parts of the classification number . 
 The Dewey Decimal Classification has a number for all subjects , including fiction , although many libraries create a separate fiction section shelved by alphabetical order of the author 's surname . Each assigned number consists of two parts : a class number ( from the Dewey system ) and a book number , which " prevents confusion of different books on the same subject . " A common form of the book number is called a Cutter number , which represents the author and distinguishes the book from other books on the same topic .

 The " Relativ Index " [ sic ] is an alphabetical index to the classification , for use both by classifiers but also by library users when seeking books by topic . The index was " relative " because the index entries pointed to the class numbers , not to the page numbers of the printed classification schedule . In this way , the Dewey Decimal Classification itself had the same relative positioning as the library shelf and could be used either as an entry point to the classification , by <unk> , or as an index to the Dewey @-@ classed library itself .

 Dewey Decimal Classification numbers formed the basis of the Universal Decimal Classification ( UDC ) , which combines the basic Dewey numbers with selected punctuation marks ( comma , colon , parentheses , etc . ) . Adaptations of the system for specific regions outside the English @-@ speaking world include the Korean Decimal Classification , the New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries , and the Nippon Decimal Classification ( Japanese ) . 
 Despite its widespread usage , the classification has been criticized for its complexity and limited scope of scheme @-@ adjustment . In particular , the arrangement of <unk> has been described as archaic and as being biased towards an Anglo @-@ American world view . In 2007 – 08 , the Maricopa County Library District in Arizona , abandoned the DDC in favor of the Book Industry Standards and Communications ( <unk> ) system , one that is commonly used by commercial bookstores , in an effort to make their libraries more accessible for patrons . Several other libraries across the United States , and other countries ( including Canada and The Netherlands ) followed suit . The classification has also been criticized as being a proprietary system licensed by a single entity ( OCLC ) , making it expensive to adopt . However , book classification critic Justin <unk> stands by the Dewey Decimal System , stating newer , more advanced book classification systems " are too confusing to understand for newcomers " . 
 = Music of the Final Fantasy series = 
 Final Fantasy is a media franchise created by Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games , motion pictures , and other merchandise . The series began in 1987 as an eponymous role @-@ playing video game developed by Square , spawning a video game series that became the central focus of the franchise . The music of the Final Fantasy series refers to the soundtracks of the Final Fantasy series of video games , as well as the surrounding medley of soundtrack , arranged , and compilation albums . The series ' music ranges from very light background music to emotionally intense <unk> of character and situation leitmotifs . 
 The franchise includes a main series of numbered games as well as several spin @-@ off series such as Crystal Chronicles and the Final Fantasy Tactics series . The primary composer of music for the main series was Nobuo Uematsu , who single @-@ handedly composed the soundtracks for the first nine games , as well as directing the production of many of the albums . Music for the spin @-@ off series and main series games beginning with Final Fantasy X was created by a variety of composers including Masashi Hamauzu , Naoshi Mizuta , Hitoshi Sakimoto , and Kumi Tanioka . 
 The majority of Final Fantasy games , including all of the main series games , have received a soundtrack album release . Many have also inspired orchestral , vocal , or piano arrangement albums . In addition to the regular albums , a number of compilation albums of tracks from multiple games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups . Music from the original soundtracks of the games has been arranged as sheet music for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing , while sheet music from the piano albums have been published by Yamaha Music Media . The franchise 's music has been performed numerous times in concert tours and other live performances such as the Orchestral Game Music Concerts , Symphonic Game Music Concerts , and the Play ! A Video Game Symphony and Video Games Live concert tours , as well as forming the basis of specific Final Fantasy concerts such as the Dear Friends and Distant Worlds concert tours . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Although each game in the Final Fantasy series offers a variety of music , there are some frequently reused themes . Most of the games open with a piece called " Prelude " , which is based on a short piece by Bach that has evolved from a simple , two @-@ voice , arpeggiated theme in the early games to a complex melodic arrangement in recent installments . It has been described as being " as recognizable in gaming circles as the Super Mario Bros. theme or Sonic the Hedgehog 's title screen pop " . Battle victories in the first 10 installments of the series were accompanied by a victory fanfare ; this theme has become one of the most recognized pieces of music in the series . Chocobos and moogles , two mascots for the series , each have their own themes . The basic theme for chocobos is rearranged in a different musical style for each installment , and usually has a title ending in " de Chocobo " , while moogles have a theme entitled " Moogle 's Theme " , which first appeared in Final Fantasy V. The chocobo inspired the spin @-@ off Chocobo series , and many of the pieces from the soundtracks of that series are stylistically based on the main chocobo theme . A piece called " Prologue " or " Final Fantasy " , originally featured in the first game , has appeared in some form in every game in the main series , with the exceptions of Final Fantasy II , Final Fantasy X , and Final Fantasy XIII ; originally appearing in the prologue of the games . It sometimes appears as a full arrangement and surfaces other times as a theme played during the finale track . Although leitmotifs are often used in the more character @-@ driven installments , theme music is typically reserved for main characters and recurring plot elements .

 When Nobuo Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo , a woman working in the art department for Square , which would later become Square Enix , approached him about creating music for some of their titles in development , and he agreed . Uematsu considered it a side job and was skeptical it would become any sort of full @-@ time position . He said it was a way to make some money on the side , while also keeping his part @-@ time job at the music rental shop . Before joining Square , he composed music for television commercials . The first score he produced for Square was the soundtrack for the role @-@ playing video game Cruise Chaser <unk> . While working at Square , he met Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi , who asked him if he wanted to compose music for some of his games , which Uematsu agreed to . Sakaguchi gave him a few instructions for the soundtrack of Final Fantasy , Uematsu 's 16th score , such as the need for " battle " and " town " music , but left the remainder of the composing to Uematsu , aside from informing him of the specific technical limitations of the Famicom system . The game was released in 1987 . 
 After the success of Final Fantasy I , Uematsu remained with the series to compose the soundtrack to Final Fantasy II ( 1988 ) . Although I and II were composed separately , music from the two games have only been released on albums together . These albums include a soundtrack album and two arranged albums . Final Fantasy III ( 1990 ) was released two years later and featured a soundtrack from Uematsu that has been lauded as one of the best soundtracks of any NES game . The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums , as well as a disc of vocal and orchestral arrangements . 
 Final Fantasy IV ( 1991 ) was the first game in the series to be released for the Super Famicom , and the resultant changes in the sound technology resulted in a composition process that Uematsu noted was " excruciating " . Uematsu has stated that , beginning with this soundtrack , he started to move away from the idea that the soundtrack had to be solely an orchestral score . In addition to the soundtrack album , the music of IV was arranged and released in the style of Celtic music , performed by Máire Breatnach . It also sparked the release of an album of piano arrangements , something which would be repeated for every subsequent main @-@ series game to date . 
 Having now gained experience with the Super Famicom sound chip , Uematsu felt that the sound quality of the soundtrack for the next game in the series , Final Fantasy V ( 1992 ) , was much better than that of IV . He named this as the primary reason that the soundtrack album was two CDs long , a first for the series . Like IV , the discography of Final Fantasy V included an arranged and a piano album in addition to the main soundtrack album . 
 In 1994 , Square released Final Fantasy VI ( 1994 ) , the last for the Super Famicom , and the accompanying soundtrack has been considered one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever composed . The game 's discography also includes orchestral and piano arrangement CDs , as well as EPs of unreleased tracks and character themes . The soundtrack included the first attempt in the Final Fantasy series to include a vocal track , " Aria di Mezzo Carattere " , which has been described as " one of Uematsu 's greatest achievements " . This track features an unintelligible synthesized " voice " that harmonizes with the melody , as technical limitations for the SPC700 sound format chip prevented the use of an actual vocal track . The first actual vocals in a piece appeared in Final Fantasy VII . 
 = = = = 1997 – 2000 : PlayStation era = = = = 
 Beginning with Final Fantasy VII ( 1997 ) , the series moved platforms to the PlayStation . While the media capabilities of the PlayStation allowed for CD quality music , Uematsu opted instead to use Sequence format . The soundtrack album ran a record four discs , and Uematsu has stated that the move into the " PlayStation era " , which allowed video game composers to use sounds recorded in the studio rather than from synthesizers , had " definitely been the biggest change " to video game music . VII was the first game in the series to include a track with digitized vocals , " One @-@ Winged Angel " , which has been described as Uematsu 's " most recognizable contribution " to the music of the series . The piece , described as " a fanfare to impending doom " , is said to not " follow any normal genre rules " and has been termed " possibly the most innovative idea in the series ' musical history . " The lyrics of the piece , a Latin choral track which plays at the climax of the game , were taken from the medieval poetry on which Carl Orff based his Carmina Burana , specifically the songs " Estuans Interius " , " O Fortuna " , " Veni , Veni , Venias " and " Ave Formosissima " . There was a plan to use a " famous vocalist " for the ending piece as a " theme song " for the game , but the idea was dropped due to time constraints and thematic concerns . The idea of a theme song would be resurrected in the following installment of the series . In 2006 , IGN ranked VII 's music the best Final Fantasy soundtrack to date and cited the " gripping " character tracks and " One @-@ Winged Angel " in particular as contributing factors . The discography of the original game only includes soundtrack , best of , and piano albums . However , beginning in 2005 Square Enix produced a collection of media centered on the game and world of Final Fantasy VII entitled the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII . This collection has produced five additional soundtrack albums , each for a different game or animation . 
 The soundtrack of Final Fantasy VIII ( 1999 ) , unlike that of VI and VII , did not include character themes , as Uematsu felt they would not be effective . In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game , Uematsu stated " the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line , of course , but it 's also my intention to put various types of music into one game " . Although the idea had not been used in the previous game , he thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of VIII , and composed " Eyes on Me " , performed by Faye Wong . The song was released as a single , while Square produced soundtrack , orchestral , and piano albums for the game 's music . 
 The music of Final Fantasy IX , ( 2000 ) , was based around a theme of Renaissance music , and was heavily inspired by previous Final Fantasy games , incorporating themes and motifs from earlier soundtracks . Uematsu felt previous games VII and VIII had a mood of realism , but that Final Fantasy IX was more of a fantasy , so " a serious piece as well as silly , fun pieces could fit in " . Uematsu has claimed several times that the music of IX is his favorite work , as well as the one he is most proud of . Like Final Fantasy VIII , IX included a vocal theme , " Melodies of Life " , which was sung by Emiko Shiratori . The game 's discography includes albums of the original soundtrack , a selection of the best tracks , a piano arrangement album , an album of unreleased tracks , and a single of " Melodies of Life " . 
 = = = = 2001 – present : other composers = = = = 
 Final Fantasy X ( 2001 ) marked the first time in the series ' history that Uematsu was not the sole composer for the soundtrack . Released on the PlayStation 2 , the score was also created by Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano . Uematsu contributed 51 tracks , Hamauzu contributed 20 tracks and Nakano contributed 18 tracks to the game . The two new composers were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu 's while still working together . The discography for the game includes the soundtrack album , piano , and vocal arrangement albums , and an EP of tracks by Uematsu inspired by the game . The theme song for the game , " Suteki da ne " , which translates to " Isn 't it Wonderful ? " , was written by Nobuo Uematsu and Kazushige Nojima and was sung by Japanese folk singer Ritsuki Nakano , known as " RIKKI " , whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere . " Suteki da ne " is sung in its original Japanese form in both the Japanese and English versions of Final Fantasy X , and was released as a single . 
 Uematsu , Naoshi Mizuta , and Kumi Tanioka composed Final Fantasy XI ( 2002 ) . It was the last Final Fantasy soundtrack that Uematsu was a main composer for until Final Fantasy XIV , as he resigned from Square Enix in November 2004 . The expansion packs were mostly scored by Mizuta alone . The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in Esperanto . According to Uematsu , the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers ' hope that their online game could contribute to cross @-@ cultural communication and cooperation . The game and each of its four expansion packs have produced a soundtrack album ; the discography for the game also includes two piano albums , an album of unreleased tracks , two arranged albums , and a single for its vocal theme , " Distant World " , which was composed by Uematsu and performed by Japanese opera singer Izumi Masuda . 
 Final Fantasy XII ( 2006 ) was mainly composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , although six compositions were contributed by his fellow composers Hayato Matsuo and Masaharu Iwata . Uematsu only contributed the theme song , " Kiss Me Good @-@ Bye " , sung by Angela Aki . Violinist Taro Hakase also contributed a piece named " Symphonic Poem ' Hope ' " , featured during the game 's ending credits . Sakimoto was brought in to compose the soundtrack to the game by Yasumi Matsuno , the producer of the game , five months before the game was officially announced . Sakimoto experienced difficulty following in Uematsu 's footsteps , but he decided to create a unique soundtrack in his own way , although he cites Uematsu as his biggest musical influence . Sakimoto did not meet with Uematsu for direction on creating the soundtrack and tried to avoid copying Uematsu 's style from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks . However , he did attempt to ensure that his style would mesh with Uematsu 's " Kiss Me Good @-@ Bye " and the overall vision of the series . The current discography , while originally limited to the soundtrack album and singles for " Kiss Me Good @-@ Bye " and " Symphonic Poem ' Hope ' " , was late in 2012 given an album of piano arrangements like most prior soundtracks in the series . 
 Final Fantasy XIII ( 2009 ) was composed by Masashi Hamauzu . Although its main theme was originally announced to be composed by Nobuo Uematsu , Uematsu instead gave it to Hamauzu to compose after being selected as the composer for Final Fantasy XIV , making XIII the first game in the main series to not have any work by Uematsu . The game has sparked the release of a soundtrack album , an arranged album , two gramophone record albums of music from the soundtrack , a piano album , and a single of the game 's theme song " Because You 're Here " ( 君がいるから , Kimi ga Iru Kara ) , sung by Sayuri Sugawara . The international versions of XIII feature the song " My Hands " sung by British singer Leona Lewis from her second album Echo . 
 The latest game in the series , Final Fantasy XIV ( 2010 ) was composed by Uematsu through his " Smile Please " studio , and is the first Final Fantasy since IX to have a score completely composed by him at release . The theme song Answers was sung by Susan Calloway , with lyrics from game writers <unk> Sato and Michal @-@ Christopher Koji Fox . Since original launch , and for the A Realm Reborn relaunch , additional in @-@ game music has been composed by Naoshi Mizuta , Ryo Yamazaki , Tsuyoshi Sekito , and Masayoshi Soken . The full official soundtrack with all 104 tracks from the original version of Final Fantasy XIV was released on August 14 , 2013 in a single Blu @-@ ray disc compilation . Titled Before Meteor : FINAL FANTASY XIV Original Soundtrack , the disc contains all of the music composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the initial release , as well as music added on subsequent patches by Uematsu , Mizuta , Yamazaki , Sekito and Soken . Uematsu , along with Calloway and Koji Fox ( plus scenario writer <unk> <unk> ) , also returned for the title theme to the game 's 2015 expansion , Heavensward , titled <unk> .

 = = = = Compilation of Final Fantasy VII = = = = 
 The Compilation of Final Fantasy VII is the formal title for a series of games and animated features developed by Square Enix based in the world and continuity of Final Fantasy VII . Spearheaded by Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase , the series consists of several titles across various platforms , all of which are extensions of the Final Fantasy VII story . The first announced element of the series was Final Fantasy VII Advent Children , an animated sequel to the original game , though the first to be released was the mobile phone game Before Crisis : Final Fantasy VII . Before Crisis 's soundtrack was composed by Takeharu Ishimoto , while Advent Children was scored by Nobuo Uematsu , Keiji Kawamori , Kenichiro Fukui , and Tsuyoshi Sekito . Other titles in the series are Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII , the soundtrack of which was composed by Masashi Hamauzu , Crisis Core : Final Fantasy VII , which was primarily composed by Takeharu Ishimoto with a few tracks provided by Kazuhiko Toyama , and Last Order : Final Fantasy VII , also composed by Ishimoto . 
 Advent Children featured a song by former Japanese rock band Boøwy 's singer Kyosuke Himuro in its ending credits , the Dirge of Cerberus soundtrack contained two songs by Gackt , including its theme song " Redemption " , and Crisis Core 's theme song , " Why " , was performed by Ayaka . Each element of the series sparked its own soundtrack album except for Before Crisis and Last Order , which had their soundtracks released together in one album . Dirge of Cerberus also had a download @-@ only soundtrack album for its Japan @-@ only multiplayer mode , while " Redemption " and " Why " each had a single release by their respective artists . 
 = = = = Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 = = = = 
 Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 ( 2003 ) , was the first direct video game sequel to any Final Fantasy game . Despite having composed the majority of the soundtrack for Final Fantasy X , Nobuo Uematsu did not contribute any music to the project . No tracks from X or other games in the series were used in the game . In an attempt to make a different style of music for the game than previous franchise titles , Square brought Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi on board to compose the music for X @-@ 2 , as the developers felt they were the " perfect fit " to incorporate a " pop " style into the music . The game includes two songs with vocalized elements , one of which , the J @-@ Pop song " real Emotion " , was written by Ken Kato and composed by Kazuhiro Hara . The other , J @-@ Pop ballad " 1000 Words " , was written by scenario writers Kazushige Nojima and Daisuke Watanabe . Matsueda and Eguchi composed and arranged the track . Both songs were sung by Jade Villalon from Sweetbox in the English version of the game , and are available as bonus tracks on the Japanese release of her album Adagio . In the Japanese version of the game both the songs were sung by Kumi Koda and were released as a single entitled real Emotion / 1000 no Kotoba . Koda also released her own English versions of the songs on her CD single Come with Me , with slightly different versions of the lyrics than Jade . In addition to Come with Me , the collection of music for Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 includes the two @-@ disc soundtrack album , a piano album , a soundtrack album for the Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 International + Last Mission version of the game , a single for the song " Eternity ~ Memory of <unk> " , and a set of three singles themed around the three main characters of the game . 
 = = = = Tactics and Ivalice Alliance = = = = 
 The Final Fantasy Tactics series is a spin @-@ off of the main Final Fantasy series , consisting of primarily tactical role @-@ playing games with heavy thematic similarities to the main series . After Final Fantasy XII was set in the same world , Ivalice , as the two games in the series Final Fantasy Tactics ( 1997 ) and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance ( 2003 ) , Square Enix announced that all future games set in the game world would be part of the new Ivalice Alliance subseries . These games to date include Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings ( 2007 ) , Final Fantasy Tactics : The War of the Lions ( 2007 ) , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift ( 2007 ) , and Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System ( 2007 ) . 
 The music of these games has been primarily composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto , who also composed the main @-@ series game set in Ivalice , Final Fantasy XII . Masaharu Iwata shared compositional duties with him for Tactics ; Sakimoto composed 47 tracks for the game while Iwata composed the other 24 . Sakimoto composed almost all of the music for Tactics Advance , while Uematsu contributed the main theme and Kaori Ohkoshi and Ayako Saso composed additional battle tracks . Both games have a soundtrack album , while Tactics Advance inspired an arranged album . Sakimoto again was the composer for Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift , though this time he was supported by composers from his studio Basiscape , and it too sparked a soundtrack album release . He also scored Revenant Wings , though it primarily consisted of arrangements of his previous work and has not been released as a separate album , and his work on Tactics was used as the score for the spinoff series Crystal Defenders . 
 = = = = Crystal Chronicles = = = = 
 Another spin @-@ off of the main series , the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series consists of Crystal Chronicles ( 2004 ) , its sequel Ring of Fates ( 2007 ) , and their spin @-@ offs My Life as a King ( 2008 ) , Echoes of Time ( 2009 ) , My Life as a Darklord ( 2009 ) , and the newest title The Crystal Bearers ( 2009 ) . Kumi Tanioka is the main composer for the series , having composed the music for all of the released games . Her only work on the main series to date has been as one of the co @-@ composers for Final Fantasy XI . She did not compose the soundtrack for The Crystal Bearers ; Hidenori Iwasaki composed it instead . Tanioka is known for using an eclectic mix of instruments in her albums ; she has described the musical style for the soundtrack to Crystal Chronicles as being based on " ancient instruments " . The soundtrack has extensive use of many medieval and Renaissance musical instruments — such as the recorder , the <unk> and the lute ; creating a distinctively rustic feel — and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music . For the soundtrack to Ring of Fates , Tanioka purposefully did not focus on " world music " , instead focusing on " creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere " . Echoes of Time also incorporates a variety of instruments , including oboes , xylophones , marimbas , and Latin guitars . 
 Of the released games , Crystal Chronicles , Ring of Fates , and Echoes of Time are the only ones to have a released soundtrack . Crystal Chronicles also has sparked a single of its theme song , " Sound of the Wind " ( <unk> , Kaze no Ne ) , composed by Kumi Tanioka and performed by Fujimoto Yae . Ring of Fates also has an associated single of its theme song , " A World Without Stars " ( 星のない世界 , Hoshi no Nai Sekai ) , written and performed by Aiko . Echoes of Time did not have a theme song . 
 = = = = Chocobo = = = = 
 The Chocobo series is a spin @-@ off series of games first developed by Square and later by Square Enix , featuring a super deformed version of the Final Fantasy series mascot — the chocobo — as the protagonist . These games include Mystery Dungeon installments and a variety of minigame collections over a wide variety of video game consoles . The series includes over a dozen games , most of which have been released only in Japan . The soundtracks to the games have been composed by a wide variety of composers , and many of the soundtracks are composed primarily of arranged versions of tracks from previous Final Fantasy soundtracks , especially the " chocobo " theme . 
 Only some of the games have led to separate soundtrack releases . The first of these was Chocobo 's Mystery Dungeon ( チョコボの不思議なダンジョン オリジナル ・ サウンドトラック , Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon ) , which was scored by Masashi Hamauzu and inspired an orchestral arrangement album also composed by Hamauzu . The soundtrack of Chocobo 's Dungeon 2 was composed by Kumi Tanioka , Yasuhiro Kawakami , Tsuyoshi Sekito , Kenji Ito , and Nobuo Uematsu . The games whose soundtracks were primarily composed of previous Final Fantasy and Chocobo tracks were Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo 's Dungeon , which was arranged by Yuzo Takahashi of Joe Down Studio , Chocobo Racing , whose original tracks were composed by Kenji Ito , and Final Fantasy Fables : Chocobo Tales . The sequel to Chocobo Tales , Chocobo and the Magic Picture Book : The Witch , The Maiden , and the Five Heroes , contains mainly original works , and the two games were scored by Yuzo Takahashi . Unlike the other Chocobo games , they had a joint soundtrack album release , while Chocobo Tales had a previous download @-@ only " best of " album . 
 = = = = Others = = = = 
 Other spin @-@ offs of the main Final Fantasy series include Final Fantasy Adventure ( 1991 ) , a spin @-@ off game later also considered as the first game in the Mana series , which had references to Final Fantasy removed in its remake , Sword of Mana . It was scored by Kenji Ito , with one track by Uematsu . Final Fantasy Mystic Quest ( 1992 ) is an SNES game scored by Ryuji Sasai and Yasuhiro Kawakami . Final Fantasy : Legend of the Crystals ( 1994 ) is an animated sequel to Final Fantasy V , and was scored by Masahiko Sato . Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within ( 2001 ) , a computer animated science fiction film , was scored by Elliot Goldenthal , and Final Fantasy : Unlimited ( 2001 ) , a 25 @-@ episode anime series , was scored by Nobuo Uematsu , Shiro Hamaguchi , and Akifumi Tada . The soundtracks to The Spirits Within and Mystic Quest were released as separate albums , while Unlimited had two soundtrack album releases . Final Fantasy Adventure saw the release of a soundtrack album , an arranged album , a release which compiled both previous albums together , and a soundtrack album for its remake . 
 = = Merchandise = = 
 The majority of games in the franchise , including all of the main series games , have led to a soundtrack album release . Many have also inspired orchestral , vocal , or piano arrangement albums as well . These albums have been produced and reprinted by a number of different companies , including DigiCube , NTT Publishing , Square Enix itself , and many others . Additionally , many albums have been made available at the iTunes Music Store . In addition to the regular albums , a number of compilation albums of pieces from several Final Fantasy games have been produced both by Square Enix and outside groups , both officially and unofficially . These albums include music directly from the games , as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles . Square Enix produced the first album , Final Fantasy 1987 – 1994 ( 1994 ) and has since produced 13 albums , leading up to Final Fantasy Remix ( 2008 ) . The first compilation album produced by an outside group was The Best of Final Fantasy 1994 – 1999 : A Musical Tribute , released in 2000 by Sherman F. Heinig ; the newest is Voices of the Lifestream , an unlicensed download @-@ only album from OverClocked ReMix released in 2007 . 
 Music from the original soundtracks has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing . Books are available for every main series game except for Final Fantasy V , as well as for Advent Children and Crystal Chronicles . All piece in each book have been rewritten by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate level piano solos , though they are meant to sound as much like the originals as possible . " Best of " collections and arrangements for guitar solos and piano duets are also available . 
 Additionally , the actual piano sheet music from each of the ten Final Fantasy Piano Collections albums has been published as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media . Each book contains the original music , exactly as arranged and performed on the albums . Unlike the Original Score arrangements , these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult . Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set , and , like the album itself , is unavailable for purchase elsewhere ; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha .

 The Ilyushin Il @-@ 40 ( NATO reporting name : Brawny ) was a two @-@ seat Soviet jet @-@ engined armored ground @-@ attack aircraft . The first prototype flew in 1953 and was very successful except when it fired its guns , as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup . <unk> this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes all the way to the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage , just behind the nose wheel . The aircraft , now resembling a double @-@ barreled shotgun from the front , was ordered into production in 1955 . Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air support doctrine in favor of tactical nuclear weapons on the battlefield . 
 = = Development = = 
 Sergey Ilyushin had begun design studies during 1950 – 51 for a jet @-@ engined ground @-@ attack aircraft possessing better performance characteristics than was possible with piston @-@ engined aircraft . By the end of 1951 the Ilyushin design bureau had prepared a technical proposal for a two @-@ seat armored aircraft using two Mikulin AM @-@ 5 axial @-@ flow turbojets rated at 2 @,@ 150 kgf ( 4 @,@ 740 lbf ) at maximum power ( without afterburner ) and 2 @,@ 700 kgf ( 5 @,@ 952 lbf ) with afterburner . In January 1952 Ilyushin sent this proposal to the government , which was quickly accepted , and he was directed to design and build one prototype . 
 The Il @-@ 40 had wings set low on the fuselage , swept back at an angle of 35 ° , and a tricycle undercarriage . The two AM @-@ 5 engines were in pods adjacent to the fuselage . As was traditional for Ilyushin ground @-@ attack aircraft the core of Il @-@ 40 's structure was a load @-@ bearing armored shell that protected both crew positions , six fuel tanks and part of the radio and electrical equipment . The thickness of the shell ranged from 3 to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 to 0 @.@ 31 in ) in thickness . The armored bulkhead protecting the pilot from the front was 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) thick . The cockpit glazing was also bulletproof and the pilot was given an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) armored headrest to protect him against shells fired from above and behind . The gunner was protected by armor 4 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) thick . The total weight of the armored shell and the bulletproof glass was 1 @,@ 918 kg ( 4 @,@ 228 lb ) . Ejection seats were provided for both crewmembers . Three perforated airbrakes were fitted on the rear fuselage , one on each side and one underneath , to enhance the aircraft 's maneuverability during a dive . 
 The initial armament was six 23 mm ( 0 @.@ 91 in ) Nudelman @-@ Rikhter NR @-@ 23 autocannons mounted in the nose , three on each side , each with 150 rounds , with their muzzles protruding into the slipstream . One NR @-@ 23 was mounted in a remotely controlled Il @-@ <unk> tail barbette with 200 rounds . It had a maximum elevation of 55 ° , a maximum depression of 40 ° and could traverse 60 ° to either side . The Il @-@ <unk> could traverse at a rate of 42 ° per second and elevate at a rate of 38 ° per second . Four small bomb bays were fitted in the wings with a maximum capacity of 100 kg ( 220 lb ) each . Alternatively four bomb racks could be fitted under the wings that could carry bombs up to 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 100 lb ) , 82 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) TRS @-@ 82 or 132 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) TRS @-@ 132 rockets , or drop tanks with a total capacity of 1 @,@ 100 litres ( 290 US gal ) . The normal bomb load was 400 kg ( 880 lb ) , but 1 @,@ 000 kg ( 2 @,@ 200 lb ) could be carried at overload . Under overloaded conditions a maximum of twelve TRS @-@ 82 or eight TRS @-@ 132 rockets could be carried . Two cameras were fitted in the rear fuselage for day and night damage @-@ assessment photos . 
 First flown on 7 March 1953 , flight tests revealed no serious shortcomings in the air . The operational CG was too far aft , but this was only a minor problem when landing , taking off and taxiing , especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase . The biggest problem proved to be the guns and their effect on the engines . During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out . The pilot was able to restart the engines and made it back safely , but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems . Ground tests with high @-@ speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference ; the engines would hiccup even if only a single gun fired just five to ten rounds . 
 A decision was made to replace the six NR @-@ 23 guns in the nose with four AM @-@ 23 cannon with 225 rounds per gun that had a rate of fire 50 % greater than that of the NR @-@ 23 and to totally revise the gun installation . The guns were moved to the very tip of the nose in a separate compartment made of heat @-@ resistant steel and provided with a special blast deflector chamber to deflect the blast gasses away from the engine inlets . Two doors were provided at the bottom of the chamber to ventilate the chamber while firing . One problem occurred almost immediately during testing when the blast gases accumulated in the section where spent cartridges and links were saved and sometimes ignited . Occasionally this was strong enough to actually deform the chamber . The spent shell case section was thoroughly ventilated and muzzle brakes were introduced to successfully cure the problem . 
 Resolving the problem with the guns had prevented the aircraft from undergoing its State acceptance trials in July 1953 as stipulated and a special commission was appointed to conduct the trials on 31 December 1953 . After the manufacturer 's trials were successfully concluded in January 1954 the aircraft was turned over and the State acceptance trials lasted from 21 January — 15 March 1954 . The tests were generally successful with the Il @-@ 40 proving to be easy to fly , maneuverable enough to be a handful for the MiG @-@ <unk> and MiG @-@ 17 fighters opposing it and considerably superior to the piston @-@ engined Ilyushin Il @-@ 10M ground @-@ attack aircraft then in service . However fight tests did reveal blast gas ingestion when firing in a sideslip by the engine on the side opposite the sideslip . Several solutions were evaluated to cure the problem , but Ilyushin pushed for the more radical solution of extending the air intakes for the engines all the way to the nose of the aircraft and moving the guns to the bottom of the nose , behind the air intakes . 
 The change in position of the guns and the extension of the air intakes , which looked " uncannily like a double @-@ barreled shotgun , " allowed the nose wheel to be moved forward to lengthen the wheelbase . The guns were mounted behind the nose wheel well and a special shield was added to protect the gun barrels from debris thrown up by the nose wheel ; it was mechanically linked to the nose wheel and extended when it did . Other changes included the replacement of the original AM @-@ 5F engines by the Tumansky RD @-@ 9V , an improved version of the AM @-@ 5F , the normal bomb load was increased to 1 @,@ 000 kg and 1 @,@ 400 kg ( 3 @,@ 100 lb ) in overloaded condition , and a rear @-@ view mirror was added to allow the pilot to better observe the rear upper hemisphere . 
 = = Production = = 
 Ilyushin began construction of another prototype to evaluate this solution and this was endorsed on 16 October 1954 when the Council of Ministers ordered production to begin at Factory ( Zavod ) No. 168 at Rostov @-@ on @-@ Don of the improved version , designated as the Il @-@ 40P . The Il @-@ 40P prototype first flew on 14 February 1955 and began State acceptance trials on 12 October 1955 . The changes had resolved all the problems suffered by the earlier design and an order for a first batch of forty production machines was placed . 
 Five of these had been completed by the spring of 1956 and were undergoing pre @-@ flight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped . A week later , the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter @-@ Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified . No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army , but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield . 
 Before the program was canceled two variants had been studied by Ilyushin . The first was an artillery @-@ spotting version known as the Il @-@ 40K . This model added a third crewman in a redesigned forward fuselage . The air intakes were reverted to their original position as the guns had been placed in the small wing bomb bays and there wasn 't any danger of the engines ingesting blast gasses from the guns . The spotter @-@ navigator was given an extensively glazed position at the tip of the nose that was well @-@ protected with armor and bulletproof glass . The first fuselage was nearing completion when the order came to cancel the entire program . The second variant was a torpedo @-@ carrying version called the Il @-@ <unk> which was based on the fuselage of the Il @-@ 40K , but the navigator @-@ bombardier 's position had optically flat glass panels to facilitate aiming . Not much effort was devoted to this model and it was canceled at an early stage .

 = = History = = 
 Khajuraho and <unk> were once the capital of the Chandela Rajputs . The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple , one of the best examples of temples preserved from the medieval period in India. is the largest of the western group of temples in the Khajuraho complex which was built by the Chandela rulers . Shiva is the chief deity in the temple deified in the sanctum <unk> . 
 The temple is said to have been built by the Chandela king Vidhyadhara , who ruled from 1017 to 1029 . At various periods of the reign of this dynasty many famous temples dedicated to Vishnu , Shiva , Surya , Shakti of the Hindu religion and also for the <unk> of Jain religion were built . Vidhyadhara , also known as Bida in the recordings of the Muslim historian Ibn @-@ al @-@ Athir , who is credited with building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple , was a powerful ruler who fought Mahmud of Ghazni in the first offensive launched by the latter in 1019 . This battle was not conclusive and Mahmud had to return to Ghazni . Mahmud again waged war against Vidhyadhara in 1022 . He attacked the fort of <unk> . The siege of the fort was unsuccessful . It was lifted and Mahmud and Vidhyadhara called a truce and parted by exchanging gifts . Vidhyadhara celebrated his success over Mahmud and other rulers by building the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple , dedicated to his family deity Shiva . <unk> inscriptions on a pilaster of the mandapa in the temple mentions the name of the builder of the temple as <unk> , which is interpreted as the pseudonym of Vidhyadhara . Its construction is dated to the period from 1025 and 1050 AD . 
 All the extant temples including the Kandariya Mahadeva Temple were inscribed in 1986 under the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites under Criterion III for its artistic creation and under Criterion V for the culture of the <unk> that was popular till the country was invaded by Muslims in <unk>

 The Kandariya Mahadeva Temple , 31 metres ( 102 ft ) in height , is in the western complex , which is the largest among the three groups of the Khajuraho complex of temples . This western group of temples , consisting of the Kandariya , <unk> and <unk> temples , is compared to a " cosmic design of a hexagon ( a yantra or Cosmo gram ) " representing the three forms of Shiva . The temple architecture is an assemblage of porches and towers which terminates in a shikhara or spire , a feature which was common from the 10th century onwards in the temples of Central India . 
 The temple is founded on a massive plinth of 4 metres ( 13 ft ) height . The temple structure above the plinth is dexterously planned and pleasingly detailed . The superstructure is built in a steep mountain shape or form , symbolic of Mount Meru which is said to be the mythical source of creation of the world . The superstructure has richly decorated roofs which rise in a grand form terminating in the shikara , which has 84 miniature spires . The temple is in layout of 6 square kilometres ( 2 @.@ 3 sq mi ) , of which 22 are extant including the Kaṇḍāriyā Mahādeva Temple . This temple is characteristically built over a plan of 102 feet ( 31 m ) in length and 67 feet ( 20 m ) in width with the main tower soaring to a height of 102 feet ( 31 m ) , and is called the " largest and grandest temple of Khajuraho " . A series of steep steps with high rise lead from the ground level to the entrance to the temple . The layout of the temple is a five part design , a commonality with the Lakshmana and <unk> temples in the Khajuraho complex . Right at the entrance there is torana , a very intricately carved garland which is sculpted from a single stone ; such entrances are part of a Hindu wedding procession . The carvings on the entrance gate shows the " tactile quality of the stone and also the character of the symmetrical design " that is on view in the entire temple which has high relief carvings of the figurines . Finely chiseled , the decorative quality of the ornamentation with the sharp inscribed lines has " strong angular forms and brilliant dark @-@ light patterns " . The carvings are of circles , undulations giving off spirals or sprays , geometric patterns , masks of lions and other uniform designs which has created a pleasant picture that is unique to this temple , among all others in the complex . 
 In the interior space from the entrance there are three <unk> or halls , which successively rise in height and width , which is inclusive of a small chamber dedicated to Shiva , a chamber where Shiva 's wife , Parvati is deified , and a central sanctum or garbhagriha ( literal meaning " womb chamber " ) where the Shiva linga , the phallic emblem of Shiva is deified . The sanctum sanctorum is surrounded by interlinked passages which also have side and front balconies . Due to inadequate natural light in the balconies the sanctum has very little light thus creating a " cave like atmosphere " which is in total contrast to the external parts of the temple . In the interior halls of the temple and on its exterior faces there are elaborately carved sculptures of gods and goddesses , musicians and apsaras or nymphs . The huge pillars of the halls have architectural features of the " vine or scroll motif " . In the corners of the halls there are insets which are carved on the surface with incised patterns . There is a main tower above the sanctum and there are two other towers above the other mantapas also in the shape of " semi @-@ rounded , stepped , pyramidal form with progressively greater height " . The main tower is encircled by a series of interlinked towers and spires of smaller size . These are in the form of a repeated subset of miniature spires that abut a central core which gives the temple an unevenly cut contour similar to the shape of a mountain range of mount Kailasa of the Himalayas where god Shiva resides , which is appropriate to the theme of the temples here . 
 The exterior surfaces of the temples are entirely covered with sculptures in three vertical layers . Here , there are horizontal ribbons carved with images , which shine bright in the sun light , providing rhythmic architectural features . Among the images of gods and heavenly beings , Agni , the god of fire is prominent . They are niches where erotic sculptures are fitted all round which are a major attraction among visitors . Some of these erotic sculptures are very finely carved and are in <unk> ( coitus ) postures with maidens flanking the couple , which is a frequently noted motif . There is also a " male figure suspended upside " in coitus posture , a kind of yogic pose , down on his head . The niches also have sculptures of Saptamatrikas , the <unk> of mother goddesses along with the gods Ganesha and Virabhadra . The seven fearful protector goddesses include : Brahmi seated on a swan of Brahma ; Maheshwari with three eyes seated on Shiva 's bull Nandi ; Kumari ; Vaishnavi mounted on Garuda ; the boar @-@ headed Varahi ; the lion @-@ headed Narasimhi and Chamunda , the slayer of demons Chanda and Munda . 
 = Enemies & Allies = 
 Enemies & Allies is a 2009 novel by American science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson . The book is set in the 1950s , in the midst of the Cold War , and follows Superman and Batman . Though suspicious of each other , they confront Lex Luthor who stages an international nuclear conflict and spreads fear of an alien invasion so that he can sell advanced weapons to governments . Themes used in the novel , reflective of the 1950s era , include alien invasion films , nuclear threats , and Cold War paranoia . 
 Anderson has written supporting novels in the past in established franchises , such as Star Wars and Dune . He had previously written about Superman in the 2007 novel The Last Days of Krypton . Enemies & Allies was published in May 2009 and met with mixed reviews which noted flat characterization but that it may be entertaining for comic book fans . 
 = = Background = = 
 The novel Enemies & Allies uses the DC Comics characters Batman and Superman . It was written by science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson who , at the time of publication , was 47 years old and living in Colorado . He had been writing novels for the past 20 years and had 15 years ' experience writing tie @-@ in novels to existing franchises , such as The X @-@ Files and Star Wars . He was best known for his prequel novels in the Dune franchise with co @-@ author Brian Herbert . His latest novels in the Dune series were Paul of Dune , published in September 2008 , and The Winds of Dune , which would be released in August 2009 , only several months after releasing Enemies & Allies . He gained experience writing in the comic book format by authoring the 2004 – 05 six issue miniseries , JSA : Strange Adventures featuring the Justice Society of America . He had previously written a novel about the origins of Superman , The Last Days of Krypton published in 2007 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The novel begins in Gotham City where Batman attempts to thwart a crime but he is being pursued by the police force who consider him a villain . In Metropolis Superman is seen as a hero as he rescues a sinking passenger boat . Lex Luthor , head of LuthorCorp , is allying himself with Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov who is mining and experimenting with kryptonite in Siberia . Luthor intends to stoke fears of an alien invasion and sell anti @-@ alien defenses to world governments . What appears to be an alien spacecraft flies over United States airspace and is confronted by the air force and Superman , but is ultimately stopped by <unk> airplanes . Meanwhile , Bruce Wayne , Batman 's alter @-@ ego , discovers that Lex Luthor is blackmailing members of Wayne Enterprises ' board of directors to steal technology designs , allowing him to beat Wayne Enterprises on military contracts . As Batman , Wayne infiltrates Luthor 's mansion to gather evidence but also steals Luthor 's sample of kryptonite which sets off alarms . Superman and Batman confront each other , suspicious of the other 's motives , but both flee as security forces respond to the alarms . Wayne turns his board of directors into double agents , having them give faulty technology to Luthor . To demonstrate his defensive capabilities , Luthor has Ceridov launch nuclear missiles from Russia to the US but Luthor 's faulty systems fail and Superman stops the missiles . 
 Eventually , Superman discovers the Soviet kryptonite mine but is defeated by the physiological effects of the material . Batman travels to Siberia to rescue Superman . With both heroes in Siberia Lex Luthor attacks alien ships which had just attacked Metropolis , but are actually his own aircraft staging an alien invasion . Superman and Batman arrive in the middle of the fight and defeat Luther 's forces and subdues Luthor who is arrested for treason . While Luthor is sentenced to death , Superman and Batman privately meet again and reflect that the world can use both of them to protect it , revealing their knowledge of each other 's secret identities and their promise not to expose the other .

 The story is set in the DC Universe but is non @-@ canon , similar to an Elseworlds story . The content is divided into 60 chapters which mostly alternate between the ( third person ) points @-@ of @-@ view of the two protagonists , Batman / Bruce Wayne and Superman / Clark Kent , though several chapters follow antagonists ( Lex Luthor and Soviet General Anatoly Ceridov ) . While the novel is based on comic book characters , it consists solely of prose . Anderson commented on the difficulty in writing comics as prose stating , " in the comics , several pages of superpowered action can propel the story , but when you read it in a book , it 's not quite so interesting . You need more parts to the story ... " 
 Anderson sought to capture the nostalgic feel of the 1950s . In this effort , he used several themes associated with the time period , including alien invasion movies , nuclear threats , Cold War paranoia , and optimism in the future . About the time period , Anderson said " it seemed like this was a time when you could say with a straight face , ' I 'm fighting for truth , justice and the American way . ' " For the characters Anderson was picturing George Reeves 's Superman and Noel Neill 's Lois Lane as portrayed in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman . One reviewer noted that Anderson 's portrayal of Lex Luthor is that of the post @-@ Crisis on Infinite Earths amoral businessman and Batman was more reminiscent of a 1930s @-@ style or a " Year One " -style Batman where he is actively pursued by the police .

 Interstate 97 ( I @-@ 97 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs entirely within Maryland . The intrastate Interstate runs 17 @.@ 62 miles ( 28 @.@ 36 km ) from U.S. Route 50 and US 301 in Parole near Annapolis north to I @-@ 695 and I @-@ 895 in Brooklyn Park near Baltimore . The Interstate is the primary highway between Baltimore and Annapolis . I @-@ 97 connects Annapolis with Baltimore – Washington International Airport and links the northern Anne Arundel County communities of Crownsville , Millersville , Severna Park , Glen Burnie , and Ferndale . It is the shortest primary Interstate Highway . 
 I @-@ 97 was constructed along the corridor of Maryland Route 3 ( MD 3 ) between Millersville and Ferndale and MD 178 between Parole and Millersville . From Millersville to south of Glen Burnie , the Interstate closely follows the former course of MD 3 , which was built in the late 1910s and early 1920s and expanded to a divided highway in the late 1950s . North of there , the highway follows the Glen Burnie Bypass , a freeway built in the mid @-@ 1950s . The segment of I @-@ 97 from Millersville to Crownsville originated as a two @-@ lane portion of MD 32 in the early 1970s . The Interstate was introduced in 1979 after the state of Maryland successfully obtained Interstate mileage for a Baltimore – Annapolis freeway from the federal government . The state decided to build the highway along I @-@ 97 's current corridor rather than along the MD 2 corridor , which has partial freeway access via MD 10 . 
 Construction on I @-@ 97 began in the late 1980s with new construction from US 50 and US 301 to Crownsville . The Crownsville – Millersville segment of MD 32 was expanded and incorporated into the Interstate and the MD 3 – MD 32 junction was upgraded . The portion of the MD 3 corridor from Millersville to south of Glen Burnie was upgraded on the spot to Interstate Highway standards in the early 1990s , after which MD 3 was truncated at Millersville . I @-@ 97 's interchange with I @-@ 695 was rebuilt in the late 1980s and early 1990s . The Glen Burnie Bypass was upgraded and expanded to six lanes in the mid @-@ 1990s . The complex process included reconstruction of several interchanges ; the last interchange to be reconstructed was upgraded in the mid @-@ 2000s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 97 begins at US 50 and US 301 ( John Hanson Highway ) , which run concurrently with unsigned I @-@ 595 , on the edge of the community of Parole west of Annapolis . The freeways meet at a semi @-@ directional T interchange ; the ramp from I @-@ 97 to eastbound US 50 and US 301 merges with a collector @-@ distributor road that extends east to that freeway 's interchange with MD 665 ( Aris T. Allen Boulevard ) . I @-@ 97 heads northwest as a four @-@ lane freeway with a speed limit of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . The freeway crosses over MD 450 ( Defense Highway ) and passes along the south and west sides of Crownsville , where it crosses several tributaries of the Bacon Ridge Branch of the South River . North of Crownsville , I @-@ 97 has a partial interchange that comprises a pair of long ramps to MD 178 ( Generals Highway ) ; the interchange allows access from southbound I @-@ 97 to MD 178 and from the state highway to the northbound Interstate . I @-@ 97 gains an extra lane in each direction from the MD 178 ramps ; those extra lanes split off at the freeway 's partial interchange with the eastern end of MD 32 just north of Millersville . The Interstate curves northeast and has a complementary partial interchange with the northern end of MD 3 ( Robert Crain Highway ) . The two state highways meet each other at a six @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange immediately to the west of I @-@ 97 's sweeping curve , which facilitates all movements between the three highways . 
 I @-@ 97 continues north as a six @-@ lane freeway and is closely paralleled on the east by Veterans Highway on the western edge of Severna Park . The highways cross Severn Run within Severn Run Natural Environment Area before they diverge slightly at the Interstate 's partial cloverleaf interchange with Benfield Boulevard ; access from northbound I @-@ 97 to the crossroad is via Veterans Highway . I @-@ 97 and Veterans Highway continue to parallel each other to the latter highway 's northern end at I @-@ 97 's partial cloverleaf interchange with the southern end of MD 3 Business ( Robert Crain Highway ) and New Cut Road . The interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I @-@ 97 to northbound Veterans Highway just south of its intersection with MD 3 Business . The freeway continues north along the west side of Glen Burnie and meets MD 174 ( <unk> Road ) at a four @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and MD 100 at a cloverstack interchange that has flyover exit ramps from both directions of I @-@ 97 . 
 I @-@ 97 temporarily gains two extra lanes in each direction between MD 100 and its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 176 ( Dorsey Road ) . Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 ( Aviation Boulevard ) , which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimore – Washington International Airport . I @-@ 97 continues through Ferndale , where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway 's four @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 ( Baltimore – Annapolis Boulevard ) , which provides access to the transit line 's terminal station , Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie . I @-@ 97 's final interchange is with I @-@ 695 ( Baltimore Beltway ) . The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange , which includes a flyover ramp from I @-@ 97 to westbound I @-@ 695 ; that ramp and the one from eastbound I @-@ 695 to I @-@ 97 merge on the inside of the two carriageways of the Beltway . The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I @-@ 695 to I @-@ 97 in Brooklyn Park . The highway continues as I @-@ 895A , a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I @-@ 895 ( Harbor Tunnel Thruway ) to MD 2 ( Governor Ritchie Highway ) . The continuation from I @-@ 97 includes a ramp to westbound I @-@ 695 that allows access to the Beltway 's interchange with MD 648 . 
 I @-@ 97 does not have an official name . However , the Interstate is dedicated to John A. Cade , who served the area around Severna Park in the Maryland Senate from 1974 to his 1996 death and who worked to secure funding for the highway . The Maryland General Assembly passed a dedication bill in 1998 , and the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) installed a pair of signs noting the dedication in Millersville and near Parole . Like all Interstate Highways , I @-@ 97 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length . I @-@ 97 is the shortest 2 @-@ digit mainline Interstate and only <unk> 2 @-@ digit Interstate in the contiguous United States . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Predecessor highways = = = 
 The first modern highway along the path of what is now I @-@ 97 followed the corridor from New Cut Road to south of the intersection of MD 178 and Veterans Highway at Dorrs Corner . This highway was intended as a second route from Glen Burnie to Annapolis to complement the highway along the east side of the Severn River ; this western route later became known as General 's Highway , a name still applied to its MD 178 portion . Construction of this highway was underway by 1919 . The new highway was completed as a gravel road from New Cut Road to north of Benfield and as a concrete road through Benfield and across Severn Run to near Dorrs Corner by 1921 . In 1922 , this highway was designated part of Robert Crain Highway , a new highway to connect the Baltimore area with Southern Maryland . The Glen Burnie – Dorrs Corner portion of the new highway was reconstructed and completed as a concrete road from Glen Burnie south through Millersville by 1923 . Robert Crain Highway became part of MD 3 in 1927 and then US 301 in 1939 when the U.S. Highway was extended from Virginia to Baltimore . MD 3 was reconstructed in 1933 and 1934 . The reconstruction eliminated several dangerous curves , particularly near Severn Run , and expanded the highway from a width of 15 to 20 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) . Veterans Highway follows much of that early 1930s course . 
 The next portion of I @-@ 97 predecessor highway was built as the four @-@ lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road north to the Baltimore Beltway . Construction on the four @-@ lane freeway began in August 1954 with construction of several bridges over or for the highway ; these bridges were completed in 1955 and 1956 . The dual roadways and interchange ramps from the southern end of the bypass to MD 648 were constructed starting in March 1955 ; the concrete @-@ surfaced highway was completed in February 1957 . The northernmost portion of the bypass , including the adjacent portion of the Baltimore Beltway , was constructed between December 1955 and September 1957 . US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the Beltway when the projects were completed in 1957 . The small portion of I @-@ 97 north of the Beltway was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway 's southern approach from MD 2 in 1955 . This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957 . The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges : a partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 3 Business and New Cut Road ; a tighter four @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 174 ; a diamond interchange at MD 176 ; the current four @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange at MD 648 ; and a half @-@ cloverleaf interchange at I @-@ 695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and Beltway but no access between the Beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway . 
 US 301 was expanded to a divided highway from the southern end of the Glen Burnie Bypass to Benfield in 1956 and 1957 . The highway 's second set of lanes , including a new bridge across Severn Run , was constructed and the existing roadway was reconstructed from Benfield to Millersville between 1957 and 1960 . The second set of lanes was built on the west side of what became a very wide median , which allowed businesses to site themselves in the median between the northbound and southbound lanes . During construction of the Benfield – Millersville stretch , US 301 was relocated to its present course from Bowie to the Eastern Shore and replaced with MD 3 . A pair of ramps between the Glen Burnie Bypass and MD 177 's freeway southern bypass of Glen Burnie ( now MD 100 ) were constructed between 1963 and 1965 . The first section of highway south of Dorrs Corner was built between 1969 and 1972 as a two @-@ lane segment of MD 32 from east of Odenton to MD 178 in Crownsville . The highway used what are now the ramps of I @-@ 97 's partial interchange with MD 178 and had a five @-@ ramp interchange with MD 3 in Millersville that lacked access from northbound MD 3 to eastbound MD 32 and from westbound MD 32 to southbound MD 3 . 
 = = = Interstate designation and construction = = = 
 Despite the existence or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis , a freeway connecting I @-@ 695 and US 50 was proposed as early as 1956 in the form of the Arundel Expressway , which would relieve congestion on MD 2 . The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I @-@ 695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978 . MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50 , but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975 . MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991 . The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore – Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal @-@ Aid Highway Act of 1968 . However , the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore – Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard – Cramer amendment , which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred . Much of the mileage of what became I @-@ 97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the Washington area . 
 With Interstate funding assured , MDSHA commissioned the Baltimore – Annapolis Transportation Corridor Study in 1973 to figure out , among other things , the best route for the Baltimore – Annapolis Interstate . The study discovered a western route following the MD 3 and MD 178 corridors would be less disruptive and require fewer acquisitions of homes and businesses compared to an extension of the Arundel Expressway south along the MD 2 corridor . In June 1979 , MDSHA announced plans for I @-@ 97 . The original route numbering plan , which was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) at its November 1975 meeting , was for I @-@ 97 to include its current route plus US 50 from Parole west to I @-@ 95 ( Capital Beltway ) . That proposal included two auxiliary Interstate highways . I @-@ 197 would follow US 50 and US 301 east from I @-@ 97 to just west of the Severn River . I @-@ 297 would follow MD 3 between a pair of intersections with I @-@ 97 in Millersville and Bowie . AASHTO rescinded its approval of the 1975 plan at its June 1981 meeting , then approved what was essentially the original 1975 plan at its June 1982 meeting . The east – west segment of I @-@ 97 and I @-@ 197 was replaced by I @-@ 68 . I @-@ 297 was withdrawn by request of the state of Maryland in 1983 . The 1982 concept of I @-@ 68 became unsigned I @-@ 595 and I @-@ 68 was applied to the National Freeway in Western Maryland in 1991 after AASHTO approved the new designations at its June 1989 meeting . 
 The first portion of I @-@ 97 proper to be constructed was the section south of Millersville , which was placed under construction in three sections in March 1985 . The first section of the highway , from US 50 and US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange , opened in December 1987 . Construction of I @-@ 97 from Millersville Road to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner started in July 1987 . The Interstate through Millersville opened in April 1989 . The interchange at I @-@ 97 's southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange , with I @-@ 97 tying into what are now the collector @-@ distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301 . The ramps from eastbound US 50 and US 301 to I @-@ 97 and from I @-@ 97 to the westbound U.S. Highways were added during the reconstruction of US 50 and US 301 in 1992 and 1993 .

 Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway and the Glen Burnie Bypass was a complex operation that involved many temporary openings , lane shifts , construction of new roadways , and reconstruction of existing roadways over several phases over several years . The first improvement was the reconstruction of the I @-@ 695 interchange between 1987 and 1991 . The modern ramps from I @-@ 97 to westbound I @-@ 695 and from eastbound I @-@ 695 to I @-@ 97 were built , eastbound I @-@ 695 's ramp over these two ramps was constructed , and the loop ramp from I @-@ 97 to westbound I @-@ 695 was removed . I @-@ 97 from its interchange with MD 648 to the new Beltway ramps was reconstructed to Interstate Highway standards and expanded to six lanes between May 1993 and August 1995 . Part of the functionality of the loop ramp to westbound I @-@ 695 was restored in October 1995 when another ramp from the Harbor Tunnel Thruway approach to westbound I @-@ 695 was added to allow access from I @-@ 97 to MD 648 . 
 Reconstruction of the MD 3 divided highway from Millersville to MD 3 Business began in 1987 over two sections . The first section , from north of MD 3 Business to north of Benfield Boulevard , began in 1987 . The work included the construction of the flyover ramp from northbound I @-@ 97 to Veterans Highway just south of MD 3 Business . The section from north of Benfield Boulevard to MD 178 at Dorrs Corner was reconstructed starting in 1989 . The second section included construction of the Benfield Boulevard interchange . The southbound MD 3 roadway was rebuilt in place as the southbound lanes of I @-@ 97 . New northbound lanes were built immediately to the east of the southbound lanes . In February 1991 , the new northbound lanes opened and access from I @-@ 97 to Veterans Highway was removed at Dorrs Corner . The old northbound lanes were reconstructed and re @-@ purposed as a two @-@ lane road , Veterans Highway , later that year . Anne Arundel County agreed to accept Veterans Highway for maintenance after the I @-@ 97 – related construction concluded in a road transfer agreement on July 21 , 1988 . MD 3 was truncated at Millersville after I @-@ 97 opened in October 1991 ; signage for MD 3 on I @-@ 695 was removed by 1993 . 
 Before reconstruction of the Glen Burnie Bypass from MD 3 Business to MD 648 began in November 1993 , the Stewart Avenue bridge across the Interstate just south of the MD 100 interchange was replaced and ramps from northbound I @-@ 97 to eastbound MD 100 and from westbound MD 100 to southbound I @-@ 97 were added between 1990 and 1992 . The freeway was reconstructed to Interstate standards in three sections . The middle section from MD 174 to MD 176 was reconstructed concurrently with the segment of MD 100 west from I @-@ 97 to MD 295 starting in 1993 . That segment of MD 100 , including the MD 100 – I @-@ 97 interchange , opened in November 1996 , and the reconstruction of the middle section of I @-@ 96 was finished in July 1997 . The sections of I @-@ 97 from MD 3 Business to MD 174 and from MD 176 to MD 648 and were reconstructed starting in January 1994 . The MD 176 – MD 648 roadway section was completed in March 1996 . The northern half of the MD 176 interchange was reconstructed as part of the latter project . The new loop ramp from northbound I @-@ 97 to westbound MD 176 and the new ramp from MD 176 to northbound I @-@ 97 were completed in 1995 . The ramp from southbound I @-@ 97 to MD 176 was removed during the widening project . The pair of ramps between southbound I @-@ 97 and MD 162 to replace the removed ramp were constructed between 1996 and 1998 . The final piece of construction on I @-@ 97 was the reconstruction of its interchange with MD 174 , which began in 2002 and concluded in 2005 .
