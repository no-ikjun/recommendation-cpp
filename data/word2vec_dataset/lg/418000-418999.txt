 In Eurasia , some authorities distinguish between cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter , or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris . In Europe , various subspecies have been named based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves , the extent to which the stems are angled or rounded , and the size and shape of the terminal umbel . 
 The etymology of the generic name Pastinaca is not known with certainty , but is probably derived from either the Latin word <unk> , meaning " to prepare the ground for planting of the vine " or <unk> , meaning " food " . The specific epithet sativa means " sown " .

 Parsnips resemble carrots and can be used in similar ways , but they have a sweeter taste , especially when cooked . They can be baked , boiled , pureed , roasted , fried , or steamed . When used in stews , soups , and casseroles , they give a rich flavor . In some cases , parsnips are boiled and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew , leaving behind a more subtle flavor than the whole root , and starch to thicken the dish . Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner in some parts of the English @-@ speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast . Parsnips can also be fried or thinly sliced and made into crisps . They can be made into a wine with a taste similar to Madeira . 
 In Roman times , parsnips were believed to be an aphrodisiac . However , parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking . Instead , they are fed to pigs , particularly those bred to make Parma ham . In traditional Chinese medicine , the root of Chinese parsnip is used as a herbal medicine ingredient .

 A typical 100 @-@ g parsnip contains 75 Calories ( 230 kJ ) of energy . Most parsnip cultivars consist of about 80 % water , 5 % sugar , 1 % protein , 0 @.@ 3 % fat , and 5 % dietary fiber . The parsnip is rich in vitamins and minerals , and is particularly rich in potassium with 375 mg per 100 g . Several of the B @-@ group vitamins are present , but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking . Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin , many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole . During frosty weather , part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter . 
 The consumption of parsnips has potential health benefits . They contain antioxidants such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and methyl @-@ <unk> , which may potentially have anticancer , anti @-@ inflammatory and antifungal properties . The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose , hemicellulose , and lignin . The high fiber content of parsnips may help prevent constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 While folk etymology sometimes assumes the name is a portmanteau of parsley and turnip , it actually comes from Middle English <unk> , alteration ( influenced by <unk> , turnip ) of Old French <unk> ( now <unk> ) from Latin <unk> , a kind of fork . The word 's ending was changed to <unk> by analogy with turnip because it was mistakenly assumed to be a kind of turnip . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places , particularly on chalk and limestone soils . Parsnips are biennials , but are normally grown as annuals . Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt , clay , and stony ground ; the latter produces short , forked roots . Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long . Seeds are usually planted in early spring , as soon as the ground can be worked to a fine <unk> , in the position where the plants are to grow . The growing plants are thinned and kept weed @-@ free . Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost , and continues through winter . The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather . Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars , giving them a sweeter taste . 
 = = = Cultivation problems = = = 
 Parsnip leaves are sometimes tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly ( <unk> <unk> ) . Irregular , pale brown passages can be seen between the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves . The effects are most serious on young plants , as whole leaves may shrivel and die . Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves , or by chemical means . 
 The crop can be attacked by larvae of the carrot fly ( <unk> <unk> ) . This pest feeds on the outer layers of the root , burrowing its way inside later in the season . Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled . The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker . The fly is attracted by the smell of bruised tissue . 
 Parsnip is used as a food plant by the larvae of some lepidopteran species , including the parsnip swallowtail ( Papilio <unk> ) , the common swift moth ( <unk> <unk> ) , the garden dart moth ( <unk> nigricans ) , and the ghost moth ( <unk> <unk> ) . The larvae of the parsnip moth ( <unk> <unk> ) , native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid @-@ 1800s , construct their webs on the umbels , feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds . 
 Parsnip canker is a serious disease of this crop . Black or orange @-@ brown patches occur around the crown and shoulders of the root accompanied by cracking and hardening of the flesh . It is more likely to occur when seed is sown into cold , wet soil , the pH of the soil is too low , or the roots have already been damaged by carrot fly larvae . Several fungi are associated with canker , including <unk> <unk> , <unk> radicicola , <unk> <unk> , and I. <unk> . In Europe , <unk> <unk> has been found to cause a black rot that kills the plant early . Watery soft rot , caused by Sclerotinia minor and S. <unk> , causes the taproot to become soft and watery . A white or buff @-@ colored mold grows on the surface . The pathogen is most common in temperate and subtropical regions that have a cool wet season . 
 Violet root rot caused by the fungus <unk> purpureum sometimes affects the roots , covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere . The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants . Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet , acid conditions . <unk> <unk> causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss . Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage . Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor the development of the disease . 
 Several viruses are known to infect the plant , including seed @-@ borne strawberry latent ringspot virus , parsnip yellow <unk> virus , parsnip <unk> virus , parsnip mosaic potyvirus , and potyvirus celery mosaic virus . The latter causes clearing or yellowing of the areas of the leaf immediately beside the veins , the appearance of ochre mosaic spots , and <unk> of the leaves in infected plants . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 While the root of the parsnip is edible , handling the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic . Like many other members of the family Apiaceae , the parsnip contains <unk> as a defense against herbivory , photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as <unk> . The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction , and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy ( Toxicodendron radicans ) . Symptoms include redness , burning , and blisters ; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years . Although some reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made , these have been small in number compared to the number of people who grow the crop . The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed . The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate . 
 The toxic properties of parsnip extracts are resistant to heating , or a storage period of several months . Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed . <unk> can be found in Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip , and they show cytotoxic activities .

 = Serjeant @-@ at @-@ law = 
 A Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law ( SL ) , commonly known simply as a Serjeant , was a member of an order of barristers at the English bar . The position of Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law ( servientes ad <unk> ) , or Sergeant @-@ Counter , was centuries old ; there are writs dating to 1300 which identify them as descended from figures in France prior to the Norman Conquest . The Serjeants were the oldest formally created order in England , having been brought into existence as a body by Henry II . The order rose during the 16th century as a small , elite group of lawyers who took much of the work in the central common law courts . With the creation of Queen 's Counsel ( or " Queen 's Counsel Extraordinary " ) during the reign of Elizabeth I , the order gradually began to decline , with each monarch opting to create more King 's or Queen 's Counsel . The Serjeants ' exclusive jurisdictions were ended during the 19th century , and with the Judicature Act 1873 coming into force in 1875 , it was felt that there was no need to have such figures , and no more were created . The last Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law was Serjeant Sullivan ( d . 1959 ) . The last purely English Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law was Lord Lindley ( d . 1921 ) . 
 The Serjeants had for many centuries exclusive jurisdiction over the Court of Common Pleas , being the only lawyers allowed to argue a case there . At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts ( the Court of King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas ) and precedence over all other lawyers . Only Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century , and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath . Within the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law were more distinct orders ; the King 's Serjeants , particularly favoured Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law , and within that the King 's Premier Serjeant , the Monarch 's most favoured Serjeant , and the King 's Ancient Serjeant , the oldest . Serjeants ( except King 's Serjeants ) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress , the chief feature of which was the coif , a white lawn or silk skullcap , afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace at the top of the wig . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The history of Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law goes back to within a century of the Norman Conquest ; Alexander Pulling argues that Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law existed " before any large portion of our law was formed " , and Edward Warren agrees , supporting him with a Norman writ from approximately 1300 which identifies Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law as directly descending from Norman <unk> ; indeed , they were sometimes known as Serjeant @-@ <unk> . The members of the Order initially used St Paul 's Cathedral as their meeting place , standing near the " <unk> " where they would give counsel to those who sought advice . Geoffrey Chaucer makes reference to the Serjeants in the Canterbury Tales , writing : 
 A serjeant of the law , ware and wise , 
 That often <unk> ben at the <unk> , 
 Ther was also , full rich of excellence . 
 Discreet he was and of great reverence , 
 He <unk> <unk> ; his <unk> were so wise , 
 Justice he was ful often in <unk> , 
 By patent , and by <unk> <unk> ; 
 For his science , and for his high <unk> , 
 Of fees and robes had he many on . 
 The Order certainly existed during the reign of Henry II from 1154 – 1189 , who created a dozen Serjeants and thus moved the order 's existence " out of the realm of conjecture " and into recorded fact . As such it is the oldest royally created order ; the next is the Order of the Garter , created in 1330 . Serjeants at Law existed in Ireland from at least 1302 , and were appointed by letters patent in a similar way to English Serjeants . Henry de Bracton claimed that , for the trial of Hubert de Burgh in 1239 the king was assisted by " all the <unk> of the bench " , although it is not known who they were . By the 1270s there were approximately 20 recorded Serjeants ; by 1290 , 36 . This period also saw the first regulation of Serjeants , with a statutory power from 1275 to suspend from practise any Serjeant who misbehaved ( enacted as chapter 29 of the Statute of Westminster 1275 ) . The exclusive jurisdiction Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law held over the Court of Common Pleas slowly came about during the 1320s , squeezing the size of the bar until only a consistent group reappeared . From this period , Serjeants also began to be called in regular groups , rather than individually on whatever date was felt appropriate . 
 = = = Rise = = = 
 During the 16th century the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law were a small , though highly respected and powerful , elite . There were never more than ten alive , and on several occasions the number dwindled to one ; William <unk> bragged that he had been " the only Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law in England " in 1559 . Over these 100 years , only 89 Serjeants were created . At the time they were the only clearly distinguishable branch of the legal profession , and it is thought that their work may have actually created barristers as a separate group ; although Serjeants were the only lawyers who normally argued in court , they occasionally allowed other lawyers to help them in special cases . These lawyers became known as outer or " utter " barristers ( because they were confined to the outer bar of the court ) ; if they were allowed to act they had " passed the bar " towards becoming a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law . 
 Despite holding a monopoly on cases in the Court of Common Pleas , Serjeants also took most of the business in the Court of King 's Bench . Although required to make the Common Pleas their principal place of work , there is evidence of Serjeants who did not ; one , Robert Mennell , worked entirely in the North of England after his creation in 1547 and was not known in Westminster , where the Common Pleas was located . This was also a time of great judicial success for the Serjeants ; since only Serjeants could be appointed to the common law courts , many also sat in the Exchequer of Pleas , a court of equity . This period was not a time of success for the profession overall , however , despite the brisk business being done . The rise of central courts other than the Common Pleas allowed other lawyers to gain advocacy experience and work , drawing it away from the Serjeants , and at the same time the few Serjeants could not handle all the business in the Common Pleas , allowing the rise of barristers as dedicated advocates . 
 = = = Decline and abolition = = = 
 The decline of the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law started in 1596 , when Francis Bacon persuaded Elizabeth I to appoint him " Queen 's Counsel Extraordinary " ( QC ) , a new creation which gave him precedence over the Serjeants . This was not a formal creation , in that he was not granted a patent of appointment , but in 1604 James I saw fit to finally award this . The creation of Queen 's ( or King 's ) Counsel was initially small ; James I created at least one other , and Charles I four . Following the English Restoration this increased , with a few appointed each year . The largest change came about with William IV , who appointed an average of nine a year , and following him approximately 12 were created a year , with an average of 245 at any one time . 
 Every new Queen 's Counsel created reduced the Serjeants in importance , since even the most junior QC took precedence over the most senior Serjeant . Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law , the King 's Serjeant and the King 's Ancient Serjeant , and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs , the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments . The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented : anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant , and immediately thereafter a judge . In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister , Serjeant or not , and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid . 
 The Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years , however , before Parliament intervened . The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846 , from 18 August 1846 , allowed all barristers to practice in the Court of Common Pleas . The next and final blow was the Judicature Act 1873 , which came into force on 1 November 1875 . Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law , removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants . With this Act and the rise of the Queen 's Counsel , there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants , and the practice ended . 
 The equivalent Irish rank of Serjeant @-@ at @-@ law ( Ireland ) survived until 1919 . Alexander Sullivan , the last Irish serjeant , spent the second half of his career at the English Bar , and as a matter of courtesy was always addressed as Serjeant . 
 = = Organisation = = 
 = = = Serjeant 's Inn = = = 
 Serjeant 's Inn was an Inn of Court restricted to Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law . It operated from three locations , one in Holborn , known as <unk> 's Inn , which was abandoned by 1498 for the one in Fleet Street , which was pulled down during the 18th century , and one on Chancery Lane , pulled down in 1877 . The Inn was a voluntary association , and although most Serjeants joined upon being appointed they were not required to . There were rarely more than 40 Serjeants , even including members of the judiciary , and the Inns were noticeably smaller than the Inns of Court . Unlike the Inns of Court , Serjeant 's Inn was a private establishment similar to a gentlemen 's club . 
 The Inn on Fleet Street existed from at least 1443 , when it was rented from the Dean of York . By the 16th century it had become the main Inn , before being burnt down during the Great Fire of London . It was rebuilt by 1670 , but the end finally came in 1733 . The Fleet Street Inn had fallen into a " ruinous state " , and the Serjeants had been unable to obtain a renewal of their lease . They abandoned the property , and it returned to the Dean . 
 The property on Chancery Lane consisted of a Hall , dining room , a library , kitchens and offices for the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law . This Inn was originally known as " <unk> 's Inn " from about 1390 , named after John <unk> , who became Master of the Rolls in 1394 . By 1404 it was known as " Farringdon 's Inn " , but although the Serjeants were in full possession by 1416 it was not until 1484 that the property became known as Serjeant 's Inn . Newly promoted Serjeants had to pay £ 350 in the 19th century , while those promoted solely to take up judicial office had to pay £ 500 . The Hall was a large room hung with portraits of various famous judges and Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law , with three windows on one side each containing the coat of arms of a distinguished judge . Around the room were the coats of arms of various Serjeants , which were given to their descendants when the Inn was finally sold . When the Fleet Street Inn was abandoned , this location became the sole residence of the Serjeants . With the demise of the order after the Judicature Act 1873 , there was no way to support the Inn , and it was sold in 1877 for £ 57 @,@ 100 . The remaining Serjeants were accepted into their former Inns of Court , where judicial Serjeants were made Benchers and normal Serjeants barristers . 
 = = = Call to the Coif = = = 
 The process of being called to the order of Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law stayed fairly constant . The traditional method was that the Serjeants would discuss among themselves prospective candidates , and then make recommendations to the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas . He would pass these names on to the Lord Chancellor , who would appoint the new Serjeants . This was intended to provide a way to select possible judges in a period where political favouritism was rampant – since only Serjeants could become judges , making sure that Serjeants were not political appointees was seen to provide for a neutral judiciary . Serjeants were traditionally appointed by a writ directly from the King . The writ was issued under the Great Seal of the Realm and required " the elected and qualified apprentices of the law to take the state and degree of a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law " . The newly created Serjeants would then assemble in one of the Inns of Court , where they would hear a speech from the Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice and be given a purse of gold . The Coif was then placed on the Serjeant 's head . The Serjeants were required to swear an oath , which was that they would : 
 " serve the King 's people as one of the Serjeants @-@ at @-@ law , and you shall truly counsel them that you be retained with after your cunning ; and you shall not defer or delay their causes willingly , for <unk> of money , or other thing that may turn you to profit ; and you shall give due attendance accordingly . So help you God . " 
 The new Serjeants would give a feast to celebrate , and gave out rings to their close friends and family to mark the occasion . The King , the Lord Chancellor and other figures also received rings . The major courts would be suspended for the day , and the other Serjeants , judges , leaders of the Inns of Court and occasionally the King would attend . Serjeant 's Inn and the Inns of Court were not big enough for such an occasion , and Ely Place or Lambeth Palace would instead be used . The feasts gradually declined in importance , and by the 17th century they were small enough to be held in the Inns . The last recorded feast was in 1736 in Middle Temple , when fourteen new Serjeants were raised to the Coif . 
 = = = Robes = = = 
 The traditional clothing of a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law consisted of a Coif , a robe and a furred cloak . The robe and cloak were later adapted into the robe worn by judges . The cut and colour of this robe varied – records from the King 's Privy Wardrobe show judges being instructed to wear robes of scarlet , green , purple and miniver , and Serjeants being ordered to wear the same . In 1555 new Serjeants were required to have robes of scarlet , brown , blue , mustard and <unk> . By the time the order came to an end the formal robes were red , but Mr. Serjeant Robinson recalled that , towards the end days of the order , black silk gowns were the everyday court garb and the red gown was worn only on certain formal occasions . The cape was originally a cloak worn separately from the robe , but gradually made its way into the uniform as a whole . John Fortescue described the cape as the " main ornament of the order " , distinguished only from the cape worn by judges because it was furred with lambskin rather than miniver . The capes were not worn into court by the advocates , only by the <unk> . 
 The Coif was the main symbol of the Order of Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law , and is where their most recognisable name ( the Order of the Coif ) comes from . The Coif was white and made of either silk or lawn . A Serjeant was never obliged to take off or cover his Coif , not even in the presence of the King , except as a judge when passing a death sentence . In that situation he would wear a Black cap intended to cover the Coif , although it is often confused with the coif itself . When wigs were first introduced for barristers and judges it caused some difficulty for Serjeants , who were not allowed to cover the Coif . <unk> got around this by adding a small white cloth to the top of the wig , representing the Coif . 
 = = = King 's or Queen 's Serjeants = = = 
 A King 's or Queen 's Serjeant was a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law appointed to serve the Crown as a legal adviser to the monarch and their government in the same way as the Attorney @-@ General for England and Wales . The King 's Serjeant ( who had the postnominal KS , or QS during the reign of a female monarch ) would represent the Crown in court , acting as prosecutors in criminal cases and representatives in civil ones , and would have higher powers and ranking in the lower courts than the <unk> or Solicitor General . King 's Serjeants also worked as legal advisers in the House of Lords , and were not allowed to act in cases against the Crown or do anything that would harm it ; in 1540 Serjeant Browne was heavily punished for creating a tax avoidance scheme . The King 's Serjeants would wear a black Coif with a narrow strip of white , unlike the all @-@ white Coif of a normal Serjeant . The King 's Serjeants were required to swear a second oath to serve " The King and his people " , rather than " The King 's people " as a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law would swear . The King 's favoured Serjeant would become the King 's Premier Serjeant , while the oldest one was known as the King 's Ancient Serjeant . 
 = = = Precedence , status and rights of audience = = = 
 For almost all of their history , Serjeants at Law and King 's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of audience in the Court of Common Pleas . Until the 17th century they were also first in the order of precedence in the Court of King 's Bench and Court of Chancery , which gave them priority in motions before the court . Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery . It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas . As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties , such as levying fines . In exchange for these privileges , Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties ; firstly , that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay , and secondly that , due to the small number of judges , they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available . 
 Only Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law could become judges of the common law courts ; this rule came into being in the 14th century for the Courts of Common Pleas and King 's Bench , and was extended to the Exchequer of Pleas in the 16th century ; it did not apply to the Court of Chancery , a court of equity , or the Ecclesiastical Courts . The Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law also had social privileges ; they ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath , and their wives had the right to be addressed as " Lady - " , in the same way as the wives of Knights or Baronets . A Serjeant made a King 's Counsel or judge would still retain these social privileges . As the cream of the legal profession , Serjeants earned higher fees than normal barristers . 
 In the order of precedence King 's Serjeants came before all other barristers , even the Attorney @-@ General , until the introduction of King 's Counsel . This state of affairs came to an end as a result of two changes – firstly , during the reign of James I , when a royal patent gave the Attorney General precedence over all King 's Serjeants " except the two <unk> " , and secondly in 1814 when the Attorney General of the time was a barrister and the Solicitor General ( politically junior to the Attorney General ) a King 's Serjeant . To reflect the political reality , the Attorney General was made superior to any King 's Serjeant , and this remained until the order of Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law finally died out .

 John Bruce " Jack " Thompson ( born July 25 , 1951 ) is an American activist and disbarred attorney , based in Coral Gables , Florida . Thompson is known for his role as an anti @-@ video @-@ game activist , particularly against violence and sex in video games . During his time as an attorney , Thompson focused his legal efforts against what he perceives as obscenity in modern culture . This included rap music , broadcasts by shock jock Howard Stern , the content of computer and video games and their alleged effects on children . 
 He is also known for his unusual filings to the Florida Bar , including challenging the constitutionality of the Florida Bar itself in 1993 . Later the Florida Supreme Court described his filings as " repetitive , frivolous and insulting to the integrity of the court " . On March 20 , 2008 , the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson , requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of the Florida Bar other than himself . In July 2008 , Thompson was permanently disbarred by the Supreme Court of Florida for inappropriate conduct , including making false statements to tribunals and disparaging and humiliating litigants .

 Thompson first met Janet Reno in November 1975 , when he applied for a job as an assistant State 's Attorney in Dade County , but was not hired . In 1988 , he ran for prosecutor against then incumbent Dade County State Attorney Janet Reno , after she had declined his request to prosecute Neil Rogers . Thompson gave Reno a letter at a campaign event requesting that she check a box to indicate whether she was homosexual , bisexual , or heterosexual . Thompson said that Reno then put her hand on his shoulder and responded , " I 'm only interested in virile men . That ’ s why I 'm not attracted to you . " He filed a police report accusing her of battery for touching him . In response , Reno asked Florida governor Bob Martinez to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate . The special prosecutor rejected the charge , concluding that it was " a political ploy " . Reno was ultimately re @-@ elected with 69 % of the vote . Thompson repeated allegations that Reno was a lesbian when she was nominated as U.S. Attorney General , leading one of her supporters , lieutenant governor Buddy MacKay , to dismiss him as a " <unk> " . 
 In 1990 , after his election loss , Thompson began a campaign against the efforts of Switchboard of Miami , a social services group of which Reno was a board member . Thompson charged that the group placed " homosexual @-@ education tapes " in public schools . Switchboard responded by getting the Florida Supreme Court to order that he submit to a psychiatric examination . Thompson did so and passed .

( Luke <unk> Records , the company of 2 Live Crew 's Luther Campbell , had previously released a record supporting Reno in her race against Thompson . ) On January 1 , 1990 , he wrote to Martinez and Reno asking them to investigate whether the album violated Florida obscenity laws . Although the state prosecutor declined to proceed with an investigation , Thompson pushed local officials in various parts of the state to block sales of the album , along with N.W.A ’ s Straight Outta Compton . In sending documents to opponents , Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver 's license , with a photo of Batman pasted over his own . Thompson said , " I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I 'm playing the role of Batman . Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie , I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County . " He also wore a Batman wristwatch . Thompson compared Campbell to the Joker . Thompson also said , " I understand as well as anybody that the First Amendment is a cornerstone of a free society — but there is a responsibility to people who can be harmed by words and thoughts , one of which is the message from Campbell that women can be sexually abused . " 
 Thompson also took issue with another 2 Live Crew song , " Banned in the U.S.A. " . He sent a letter to Jon Landau , manager of Bruce Springsteen , whose song " Born in the U.S.A. " was to be sampled by the group . Thompson suggested that Landau " protect ' Born in the U.S.A. ' from its apparent theft by a bunch of clowns who traffic toxic waste to kids , " or else Thompson would " be telling the nation about Mr. Springsteen 's tacit approval " of the song , which , according to Campbell , " expresses anger about the failure of the First Amendment to protect 2 Live Crew from prosecution " . Thompson also said , " the ' social commentary ' on this album is akin to a sociopath 's discharging his AK @-@ 47 into a crowded schoolyard , with the machine gun bursts interrupted by Pee @-@ wee Herman 's views on politics " . 
 The members of 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal district court . The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album could result in a prosecution for obscenity violations . While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech , the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene . However , an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling , because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value . 
 As the debate continued , Thompson wrote , " An industry that says a line cannot be drawn will be drawn and quartered . " He said of his campaign , " I won 't stop till I get the head of a record company or record chain in jail . Only then will they stop trafficking in obscenity " . Bob Guccione , Jr . , founder of Spin magazine , responded by calling Thompson " a sort of latter @-@ day Don Quixote , as equally at odds with his times as that mythical character was , " and argued that his campaign was achieving " two things ... : pissing everybody off and compounding his own celebrity " . Thompson responded by noting , " Law enforcement and I put 2 Live Crew 's career back into the toilet where it began . " 
 Thompson wrote another letter in 1991 , this time to the Minnesota attorney general Skip Humphrey , complaining about the N.W.A album Niggaz4Life . Humphrey warned locally @-@ based <unk> that sales of the album might violate state law against distribution of sexually explicit material harmful to minors . Humphrey also referred the matter to the Minneapolis city attorney , who concluded that some of the songs might fit the legal definition if issued as singles , but that sales of the album as a whole were not prosecutable . Thompson also initiated a similar campaign in Boston . Later , Thompson would criticize the Republican Party for inviting N.W.A member and party donor Eric " Eazy @-@ E " Wright to an exclusive function . 
 In 1992 , Thompson was hired by the Freedom Alliance , a self @-@ described patriot group founded by Oliver North , described as " far @-@ right " by The Washington Post . By this time , Thompson was looking to have Time Warner , then being criticized for promoting the Ice @-@ T song " Cop Killer " , prosecuted for federal and state crimes such as sedition , incitement to riot , and " advocating overthrow of government " by distributing material that , in Thompson 's view , advocated the killing of police officers . Time Warner eventually released Ice @-@ T and his band from their contract , and voluntarily suspended distribution of the album on which " Cop Killer " was featured . 
 Thompson ’ s push to label various musical performances obscene was not entirely limited to rap . In addition to taking on 2 Live Crew , Thompson campaigned against sales of the racy music video for Madonna 's " Justify My Love " . Then in 1996 , he took on MTV broadcasts for " objectification of women " by writing to the station 's corporate parent , Viacom , demanding a stop to what he called " corporate pollution " . He also went after MTV 's advertisers and urged the United States Army to pull recruiting commercials , citing the Army ’ s recruitment of women and problems with sexual harassment scandals .

 Thompson has heavily criticized a number of video games and campaigned against their producers and distributors . His basic argument is that violent video games have repeatedly been used by teenagers as " murder simulators " to rehearse violent plans . He has pointed to alleged connections between such games and a number of school massacres . According to Thompson , " In every school shooting , we find that kids who pull the trigger are video gamers . " Also , he claims that scientific studies show teenagers process the game environment differently from adults , leading to increased violence and copycat behavior . According to Thompson , " If some wacked @-@ out adult wants to spend his time playing Grand Theft Auto : Vice City , one has to wonder why he doesn 't get a life , but when it comes to kids , it has a demonstrable impact on their behavior and the development of the frontal lobes of their brain . " Thompson has described the proliferation of games by Sony , a Japanese company , as " Pearl Harbor 2 " . According to Thompson , " Many parents think that stores won ’ t sell an M @-@ rated game to someone under 17 . We know that 's not true , and , in fact , kids roughly 50 percent of that time , all the studies show , are able to walk into any store and get any game regardless of the rating , no questions asked . " 
 Thompson has rejected arguments that such video games are protected by freedom of expression , saying , " Murder simulators are not constitutionally protected speech . They ’ re not even speech . They ’ re dangerous physical appliances that teach a kid how to kill efficiently and to love it , " as well as simply calling video games " mental masturbation " . In addition , he has attributed part of the impetus for violent games to the military , saying that it was looking " for a way to disconnect in the soldier 's mind the physical act of pulling the trigger from the awful reality that a life may end " . Thompson further claims that some of these games are based on military training and simulation technologies , such as those being developed at the Institute for Creative Technologies , which , he suggests , were created by the Department of Defense to help overcome soldiers ' inhibition to kill . He also claims that the PlayStation 2 's DualShock controller " gives you a pleasurable buzz back into your hands with each kill . This is operant conditioning , behavior modification right out of B. F. Skinner 's laboratory . " 
 Although his efforts dealing with video games have generally focused on juveniles , Thompson got involved in a case involving an adult on one occasion in 2004 . This was an aggravated murder case against 29 @-@ year @-@ old Charles McCoy , Jr . , the defendant in a series of highway shootings the previous year around Columbus , Ohio . When McCoy was captured , a game console and a copy of The Getaway were in his motel room . Although not representing McCoy and over the objections of McCoy 's lawyers , Thompson succeeded in getting the court to unseal a search warrant for McCoy 's residence . This showed , among other things , the discovery of additional games State of Emergency , Max Payne , and Dead to Rights . However , he was not allowed to present the evidence to McCoy , whose defense team was relying on an insanity defense based on paranoid schizophrenia . In Thompson 's estimation , McCoy was the " functional equivalent of a 15 @-@ year @-@ old , " and " the only thing insane about this case is the ( insanity ) defense " . 
 = = = Early litigation = = = 
 Thompson filed a lawsuit on behalf of the parents of three children killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997 . Investigations showed that the perpetrator , 14 @-@ year @-@ old Michael Carneal , had regularly played various computer games ( including Doom , Quake , Castle Wolfenstein , Redneck Rampage , Nightmare Creatures , MechWarrior , and Resident Evil ) and accessed some pornographic websites . Carneal had also owned a videotape of The Basketball Diaries , which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates . The suit sought $ 33 million in damages , alleging that the producers of the games , the movie , and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence . Additional claims included product liability for making " defective " products ( the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings ) and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act for distributing this material to minors . Said Thompson , " We intend to hurt Hollywood . We intend to hurt the video game industry . We intend to hurt the sex porn sites . " 
 The suit was filed in federal district court and was dismissed for failing to present a legally recognizable claim . The court concluded that Carneal 's actions were not reasonably foreseeable by the defendants and that in any case , his actions superseded those of the defendants , so that the latter could not be the proximate cause of the harm . In addition , the judge determined that " thoughts , ideas and images " in the defendants ' materials did not constitute " products " that could be considered defective . The ruling was upheld on appeal . 
 = = = Grand Theft Auto = = = 
 In February 2003 , Thompson asked permission to file an amicus curiae ( or " friend of the court " ) brief in the Ohio case of Dustin Lynch , 16 , who was charged with aggravated murder in the death of <unk> Mishne ; Lynch was " obsessed " with Grand Theft Auto III . When Judge John <unk> ruled that Lynch would be tried as an adult , Thompson passed a message from Mishne 's father to the judge , asserting that " the attorneys had better tell the jury about the violent video game that trained this kid [ and ] showed him how to kill our daughter , <unk> . If they don 't , I will . " In a motion sent to the prosecutor , the boy 's court @-@ appointed lawyer , and to reporters , Thompson asked to be recognized as the boy 's lawyer in the case . However , Medina County Prosecutor Dean Holman said Thompson would be faced with deeply conflicting interests if he were to represent Dustin Lynch because he also advised Mishne 's parents . Claiming that delays had weakened his case , Thompson asked Medina County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Collier to disqualify himself from presiding over the case because the judge had not ruled on Thompson 's request for two months . Lynch himself eventually rejected Thompson 's offer , withdrawing his insanity plea . Lynch 's mother , <unk> Thomas , who previously demanded that Collier appoint Thompson to defend her son , said she changed her mind after visiting with her boy in jail , saying , " It has nothing to do with video games or Paxil , and my son 's no murderer . " 
 Thompson returned to file a lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 on behalf of the victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide , endangerment , and assault . Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III , Thompson sought $ 246 million in damages from the publisher , Take @-@ Two Interactive , along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal @-@ Mart . The suit charged that the defendants knew or should have known that the game would cause copycat violence . On October 22 , 2003 , the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee . Two days later , the plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal , and the case was closed . 
 Thompson was involved in another similar suit in Alabama in 2005 on behalf of the families of police personnel killed by Devin Moore , a teenager who was reportedly a compulsive Grand Theft Auto player . However , his participation in the case ran into a dispute over his pro <unk> vice admission to practice law in that state . The opposing attorneys sought removal of this privilege by arguing that his conduct was unethical and claiming he had threatened and harassed them in letters and emails . The judge added that Thompson had violated his gag order during Moore ’ s criminal trial . Thompson tried to withdraw from the case , but his request was denied by the judge , who went ahead and revoked Thompson 's temporary admission to the state bar . For his part , Thompson said he thought the judge was trying to protect Moore 's criminal conviction at any cost . He also complained about the judge 's ethics , saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on the judge had assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson 's team , and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website . 
 In the aftermath of this lawsuit , Thompson lobbied Alabama attorney general Troy King to file a civil suit and call on retailers not to sell " cop @-@ killing games " . After the slaying of another police officer in <unk> , Arkansas by Jacob D. Robida , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old fugitive , Thompson again raised the possibility of a connection to Grand Theft Auto , but investigators found no evidence that video games were involved . 
 Thompson once reported that he had videotaped a Miami Best Buy selling a copy of Grand Theft Auto : Vice City to his son who was 10 at the time . In a letter to Best Buy , he wrote , " Prosecutions and public relations consequences should fall on your Minneapolis headquarters like snowflakes . " He eventually sued the company in Florida , arguing that it had violated a law against sale of sexual materials deemed harmful to minors . In January 2005 , Best Buy agreed that it would enforce an existing policy to check the identification of anyone who appeared to be 17 or under and tried to purchase games rated " M " ( for mature audiences ) . No law in effect at the time prohibited selling " M " rated video games to juveniles . 
 In September 2006 , Thompson filed a suit in Albuquerque , New Mexico against Sony , Take @-@ Two , Rockstar Games , and Cody Posey , for the wrongful death of three members of Posey 's family . The 69 @-@ page complaint filed by Thompson and Albuquerque attorney Steven Sanders argued that " obsessively " playing Grand Theft Auto : Vice City made violence " pleasurable and attractive , " disconnected violence from consequences , and caused Posey to " act out , copycat , replicate and emulate the violence " when he shot and killed his father , stepmother , and stepsister , and then buried them under a manure pile at a ranch owned by former ABC News reporter Sam Donaldson in July , 2004 . Thompson and Sanders filed the lawsuit on behalf of the surviving family members of Posey 's father . According to Thompson , " Posey essentially practiced how to kill on this game . If it wasn 't for Grand Theft Auto , three people might not now be dead . " The lawsuit claims that Thompson was told by a sheriff 's deputy that the game and a Sony PlayStation 2 were found at the ranch . The suit also claims that the game taught Posey " how to point and shoot a gun in a fashion making him an extraordinarily effective killer without teaching him any of the constraints or responsibilities needed to inhibit such a killing capacity " . Gary Mitchell , Posey 's criminal defense attorney , said Thompson contacted him " numerous times " before the trial , urging Mitchell to highlight the game in Posey 's defense , but Mitchell said he " just didn 't find it had any merit whatsoever " . 
 On March 14 , 2007 , Take @-@ Two filed a lawsuit to prevent Thompson from preventing the sale of Grand Theft Auto IV and Manhunt 2 to minors , claiming that Thompson 's effort to block sales of its games through lawsuits violates the company 's First Amendment rights . Responding , Thompson said , " I have been praying , literally , that Take @-@ Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid , so arrogant , so dumb , even dumber than what they have to date done , that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take @-@ Two . " On April 19 , 2007 , Thompson and Take @-@ Two settled their suit , with Thompson agreeing not to restrict sales through any court worldwide of Take @-@ Two 's games , threaten to sue the company , or accuse Take @-@ Two of any wrongdoing based on the sale of any of its games . One analyst said that the settlement was likely to mute his public pronouncements and lawsuits against the company . However , upon the game 's 2008 release , Thompson called Grand Theft Auto IV " the gravest assault upon children in this country since polio , " and asked Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty to " pursue and file criminal charges against [ Minnesota @-@ based retailers ] Target and Best Buy " . He also sent a letter to Take @-@ Two chairman Strauss Zelnick 's attorney , addressed to Zelnick 's mother , in which Thompson accused her son of " doing everything he possibly can to sell as many copies of GTA : IV to teen boys in the United States , a country in which your son claims you raised him to be a ' a Boy Scout ' . ... More like the Hitler Youth , I would say . " On May 1 , 2008 Thompson appeared on the CNN Headline News program Glenn Beck , asserting that the game 's sexual content made its sale to minors illegal , and that he was working with law enforcement to have criminal prosecutions brought . Thompson also filed a complaint with the Chicago Transit Authority about poster ads for the game at Chicago , Illinois bus stops . 
 In September 2013 , Thompson expressed his hatred of Grand Theft Auto V during a series of e @-@ mails exchange with GameZone writer Lance Liebl during its launch week . The game happened to launch around the same time as the Washington Navy Yard shooting . Traditional media outlets such as FOX News sought out to find proof that violent video games , such as Grand Theft Auto V , had a role in the brutal killings . Gamezone responded by writing an article that disagrees with this . These caught Thompson 's attention , who then sent an e @-@ mail to the site . " Look , Lance , " he wrote in an email , " The American Psychological Association has established a causal link between these games and increased aggression . The Dept. of Defense uses them for that purpose . " Lance responded by offering Thompson a chance to come on the site and explain his stance , which he refused , describing gamers as " too brain @-@ impaired to get it . " 
 = = = Bully = = = 
 Beginning in 2005 , Thompson supported a campaign to discourage Take @-@ Two ’ s subsidiary , Rockstar Games , from releasing a game called Bully , in which , according to Thompson , " what you are in effect doing is rehearsing your physical revenge and violence against those whom you have been victimized by . And then you , like Klebold and Harris in Columbine , become the ultimate bully . " According to Thompson , the game " shows you how to — by bullying — take over your school . You punch people ; you hit them with sling shots ; you dunk their heads in dirty toilets . There 's white @-@ on @-@ black crime in the game . You bludgeon teachers and classmates with bats . It 's absolutely nuts . " Thompson sued Wal @-@ Mart , Best Buy , Target , Circuit City , GameStop , and Toys ' R ' Us , seeking an order to bar the game ’ s release . He also participated in a protest at Rockstar 's office that also included students from <unk> , a Washington , D.C. mentoring organization . Thompson said he hoped that the pressure would get retailers to refuse to carry the game . In March 2006 , a Florida school board he had lobbied passed a resolution criticizing the game , but only urged retailers not to sell the game to minors . 
 Thompson also criticized Bill Gates and Microsoft for contracting with Rockstar Games to release the game on the Xbox . The Xbox version has since been canceled for undisclosed reasons , but a version was released years later on the Xbox 360 . In August 2006 , Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy , threatening to file suit in Miami if he did not gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns . Once the game is out , according to Thompson , " the horse will be out of the barn and it will be too late to do anything about it " . Thompson argued that it violated Florida 's public nuisance laws , which prohibit activities that can injure the health of the community . 
 Rockstar Games co @-@ founder Terry Donovan responded , saying " I would prefer it if we could simply make great games and not have to deal with misunderstanding and misperception of what we do . " After receiving no response from Rockstar regarding an advance copy , Thompson filed the public nuisance complaint against Wal @-@ Mart , Take @-@ Two Interactive , and GameStop , demanding that he be allowed to preview the game before its October 17 release date . Take @-@ Two offered to bring in a copy and let both Judge Ronald Friedman and Thompson view the game in the judge 's chambers on October 12 , 2006 . The judge ultimately saw no reason to restrict sales and dismissed the complaint the next day . 
 Thompson was critical of the judge 's decision , telling the judge " You did not see the game ... You don 't even know what it was you saw , " as well as accusing the Take @-@ Two employee who demonstrated the game of avoiding the most violent parts . Blank Rome subsequently filed a motion to have Thompson 's behavior declared " contempt for the court " . Judge Friedman then recused himself from ruling , and instead filed a complaint against Thompson with the Florida Bar , calling Thompson 's behavior " inappropriate by a member of the bar , unprofessional and contemptible " . 
 Thompson later drew attention to the game 's main character , a 15 @-@ year old male , being able to kiss other boys . Thompson wrote to ESRB president Patricia Vance , " We just found gay sexual content in Bully as Jimmy Hopkins makes out with another male student . Good luck with your Teen rating now . " The ESRB responded by saying they were already aware that the content was in the game when they rated it . 
 = = = Manhunt = = = 
 During the aftermath of the murder of Stefan Pakeerah , by his friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire , England , the game Manhunt was linked after the media wrongfully claimed police has found a copy in Leblanc 's room . Although the police officially denied any link , citing drug @-@ related robbery as the motive and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah 's bedroom , not Leblanc 's , Thompson , who had heard of the murder , claimed that he had written to Rockstar after the game was released , warning them that the nature of the game could inspire copycat killings ; " I wrote warning them that somebody was going to copycat the Manhunt game and kill somebody . We have had dozens of killings in the U.S. by children who had played these types of games . This is not an isolated incident . These types of games are basically murder simulators . There are people being killed over here almost on a daily basis . " Soon thereafter , the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £ 50 million in a wrongful death claim . 
 Jack Thompson would later vow to permanently ban the game during the release of the sequel Manhunt 2 . Thompson said he planned to sue Take @-@ Two / Rockstar in an effort to have both Manhunt 2 and Grand Theft Auto IV banned as " public nuisances " , saying " Killings have been specifically linked to Take @-@ Two 's Manhunt and Grand Theft Auto games . [ I have ] asked Take @-@ Two and retailers to stop selling Take @-@ Two 's " Mature " murder simulation games to kids . They all refuse . They are about to be told by a court of law that they must adhere to the logic of their own " Mature " labels . 
 The suits were eradicated when Take @-@ Two petitioned U.S. District Court , SD FL to block the impending lawsuit , on the grounds that video games purchased for private entertainment could not be considered public nuisances . The following day , Thompson wrote on his website ; " I have been praying , literally , that Take @-@ Two and its lawyers would do something so stupid , that such a misstep would enable me to destroy Take @-@ Two . The pit Take @-@ Two has dug for itself will be patently clear next week when I strike back . " 
 = = = Mortal Kombat = = = 
 In October 2006 , Thompson sent a letter to Midway Games , demanding they cease and desist selling the latest game in the Mortal Kombat series , Mortal Kombat : Armageddon , claiming that the game was illegally profiting on his likeness , because gamers could use the Kreate a Fighter option to make a character who looked like Thompson . Midway did not respond to his letter . 
 = = = Activism and lobbying = = = 
 In addition to filing lawsuits , Thompson has pushed for measures against similar games in a variety of public settings . He wrote a joint article in the Christian Science Monitor with Eugene F. <unk> , a University of Miami professor who studies the effects of video games on children . Originally brought together to provide opposing viewpoints on 60 Minutes in the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre , they said they had become friends and were collaborating on a book . They described themselves as having " a shared belief that first @-@ person shooter video games are bad for our children , teaching them to act aggressively and providing them with efficient killing skills and romanticized and trivialized scenarios for killing in the real world " . 
 Thompson has supported legislation in a number of states that would ban sales of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors . In response to First Amendment concerns , he argued that the games were a " public safety hazard . " However , he rejected as " completely unconstitutional " Hillary Clinton 's proposed legislation to ban sales to minors of games rated " M " for Mature by the Entertainment Software Rating Board . Thompson contended that the government could not enforce a private @-@ sector standard but had to depend on a Miller obscenity test . He charged that Clinton was simply positioning herself politically , with the support of the gaming industry , by proposing a bill which he felt she knew would be unconstitutional . 
 In July 2005 , Thompson sent a letter to several politicians urging them to investigate The Sims 2 , alleging that the game contained nudity accessible by entering special codes . Thompson called the nudity inappropriate for a game rated " T " for Teen , a rating which indicates suitability for anyone 13 and older . Manufacturer Electronic Arts dismissed the allegations , with vice president Jeff Brown explaining that game characters have " no anatomical detail " under their clothes , effectively resembling Barbie dolls . Although the game does display blurred @-@ out patches over body regions when characters are naked , such as when taking a shower , Brown said that was for " humorous effect " and denied there was anything improper about the game . Nevertheless , a command that could be entered into the in @-@ game console in order to disable the blur effect was removed from the game in an expansion . No official reason was given for the change . 
 In Louisiana , Thompson helped draft a 2006 bill sponsored by state representative Roy Burrell to ban the sale of violent video games to buyers under 18 ( <unk> ) . In an effort to avoid constitutional problems , it avoided trying to define " violent " and instead adopted a variation of the Miller obscenity test : sales to minors would be illegal based on community standards if the game appealed to " the minor 's morbid interest in violence " , was patently offensive based on adult standards of suitability for minors , and lacked serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value for minors . The bill was passed unanimously by the state House and approved by the Senate Judiciary A Committee , despite industry opposition and predictions that it too would be unconstitutional . The Shreveport Times editorialized that Thompson 's support of the bill " should immediately set off alarms " and described Thompson as someone who " thrives on chasing cultural ambulances " . In defense of the bill , Thompson said that it was needed for public safety , and that it was a " miracle " that a Columbine @-@ type event hadn 't happened yet in Louisiana . However , the ESA filed suit under Entertainment Software Association v. <unk> , and U.S. District Judge James Brady issued a preliminary injunction , temporarily blocking the law from taking effect until full judicial review can be done . The law was permanently enjoined in late November 2006 , and the state was ordered to pay the legal fees of the plaintiffs . Judge Brady was " dumbfounded " that state legislators and Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco wasted taxpayer money by trying to enact the law . 
 At one point , Thompson was asked by the National Institute on Media and the Family to stop invoking the organization 's name in his campaigns . <unk> president David Walsh felt Thompson cast the organization in a bad light whenever he brought up their name . " Your commentary has included extreme hyperbole and your tactics have included personally attacking individuals for whom I have a great deal of respect , " Walsh said in an open letter to Thompson . 
 Thompson has additionally worked to influence police investigations concerning violent acts which he views as being connected to violence in video games media . On June 2 , 2006 , Thompson suggested that West Feliciana Parish , Louisiana police detectives , investigating the murder of 55 @-@ year @-@ old Michael Gore by 17 @-@ year @-@ old Kurt Edward Neher , should look into the video games played by Neher . According to Sheriff J. Austin Daniel , an autopsy showed Gore was beaten to death as well as shot in the face . Concerning this , Thompson stated that " nobody shoots anybody in the face unless you 're a hit man or a video gamer . " 
 = = = Other public commentary = = = 
 Thompson predicted that the perpetrator of the Beltway sniper attacks would be " a teenaged boy , who plays video games " and speculated incorrectly that he " may indeed ride a bicycle to and from his shooting locations , his gun broken down and placed in a backpack while he pedals . " Saying that the shooter , Lee Boyd Malvo , had " trained " on Halo , Thompson later claimed credit for this on The Today Show : " I predicted that the beltway sniper would be a teen @-@ aged boy that trained on a game switched to sniper mode . And three months later , NBC reported that that 's exactly what Malvo did . And Muhammed had him train on the game to suppress his inhibition to kill . " John Muhammad was a Gulf War veteran and earned an expert marksmanship badge in the U.S. Army . 
 Thompson has also criticized a Christian video game based on the Left Behind series . In Left Behind : Eternal Forces , players participate in " battles raging in the streets of New York , " according to the game 's fact sheet . They engage in " physical and spiritual warfare : using the power of prayer to strengthen your troops in combat and wield modern military weaponry throughout the game world . " Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values . He said , " Because of the Christian context , somehow it 's OK ? It 's not OK . The context is irrelevant . It 's a mass @-@ killing game . " Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees , saying " Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime , I prefer to give them something that 's positive . " The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House , which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson 's book , Out of Harm 's Way . Thompson has not seen the game , which he says has " personally broken my heart , " but claims , " I don 't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States . " 
 In April 2007 , only hours after the Virginia Tech shooting ( and before Seung @-@ Hui Cho was actually identified ) , Thompson predicted that the shooter had trained on the game Counter @-@ Strike . According to Thompson , the game " drills you and gives you scenarios on how to kill them [ and ] gets you to kill them with your heart rate lower . " He says that Seung @-@ Hui " was in a hyper @-@ reality situation in virtual reality . " Though Seung @-@ Hui had last been known to have played Counter @-@ Strike in high school , four years prior to the shooting , Thompson asserts that " you don 't drop it when you go to college , typically . " Thompson disputed Seung @-@ Hui 's roommate 's claim that Seung @-@ Hui only used his computer to write fiction , on the grounds that " Cho was able to go room to room calmly , efficiently , coolly killing people . " Prior to being identified , Thompson attributed the " flat effect [ sic ] on [ Seung @-@ Hui 's ] face " and the efficiency of his attack to video game rehearsals of the shooting . However , a search warrant released , listing the items found in Cho 's dorm room , did not contain any video games , and a Washington Post story cited by Thompson later removed a paragraph stating that Seung @-@ Hui enjoyed violent video games in high school . Despite all evidence indicating that Seung @-@ Hui had not played Counter @-@ Strike in years , Thompson continued to insist that " this is not rocket science . When a kid who has never killed anyone in his life goes on a rampage and looks like the Terminator , he 's a video gamer . " Thompson also sent a letter to Bill Gates , saying , " Mr. Gates , your company is potentially legally liable ( for ) the harm done at Virginia Tech . Your game , a killing simulator , according to the news that used to be in the Post , trained him to enjoy killing and how to kill . " However , Microsoft did not create Counter @-@ Strike - they only published the Xbox version of the game . The official Virginia state panel commissioned to investigate the shooting determined that Seung @-@ Hui " played video games like Sonic the Hedgehog , " and that " none of the video games [ he had played ] were war games or had violent themes . " 
 In December 2007 , Thompson filed suit against Omaha , Nebraska Police Chief Thomas Warren , asking him to produce information on all " violent entertainment material " belonging to Robert Hawkins , who killed nine people , including himself , in a shooting at the Westroads Mall earlier that month . According to Omaha police , such information is not a matter of public record , as it is part of an ongoing criminal investigation . 
 On February 15 , 2008 , Jack Thompson claimed that the actions of Steven Kazmierczak , who the previous day killed five people at Northern Illinois University before committing suicide , were influenced by the game Counter @-@ Strike . In a subsequent news release , Thompson claimed that " We have a nation of Manchurian Candidate video gamers out there who are ready , willing , and able to massacre , and some of them will . " Thompson also threatened the university with a lawsuit if the school did not provide copies of " all documents that reveal [ Kazmierczak 's ] play of violent videogames . "

 Thompson 's " high @-@ profile crusades " have made him an enemy of video game aficionados . On occasion , Thompson has sparred directly with the gaming industry and its fans . In 2005 , he wrote an open letter to Entertainment Software Association president Doug Lowenstein , making what he described as " a modest video game proposal " ( an allusion to the title of Jonathan Swift 's satirical essay , A Modest Proposal ) to the video game industry : Thompson said he would donate $ 10 @,@ 000 to a charity designated by Take @-@ Two CEO Paul Eibeler if any video game company would create a game including the scenario he described in the letter . The scenario called for the main character , whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games , to murder a number of industry executives ( including one modeled on Eibeler ) and go on a killing spree at the Electronic Entertainment Expo . Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer , resulting in the game I 'm <unk> – A Murder Simulator , among others . Afterwards , he claimed that his proposal was satire , and refused to make the promised donation . 
 In response , Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik , the creators of gaming webcomic Penny Arcade and of the children 's charity Child 's Play , stepped in to make the $ 10 @,@ 000 donation instead , writing in the memo field of their cheque , " For Jack Thompson , Because Jack Thompson Won 't . " Afterwards , Thompson tried unsuccessfully to get Seattle police and the FBI to investigate Holkins and Krahulik for orchestrating " criminal harassment " of him through articles on their site . Other webcomics have regularly incorporated references to Thompson , alluding to this incident as well as others . 
 In 2006 , two Michigan gamers began a project dubbed " Flowers for Jack " , soliciting donations to deliver a massive floral arrangement to Thompson ’ s office . The flowers were delivered in February along with a letter aimed at opening a dialogue between Thompson and the video gaming community . Thompson rejected this overture and forwarded the flowers to some of his industry foes , with such comments as " <unk> them along with the decency you discarded long ago . I really don 't care . Grind them up and smoke them if you like . " 
 Gamers have responded to Thompson 's attempt to link the Virginia Tech massacre to the game Counter @-@ Strike . Video game Web sites and young gamers on Internet message boards " teemed with anger " at what San Francisco Chronicle reporter Peter Hartlaub called " his serial misstatements , " in some cases linking to YouTube videos of Thompson and dissecting his claims point by point . Jason Della Rocca , executive director of the International Game Developers Association , said , " It 's so sad . These massacre chasers — they 're worse than ambulance chasers — they 're waiting for these things to happen so they can jump on their soapbox . " In response , Thompson referred to Della Rocca as an " idiot " and a " jackass [ ... ] paid not to connect the dots [ connecting shootings to video games ] , " and compared himself to people who warned that the government should be more concerned about terrorism before the September 11 , 2001 attacks . According to Della Rocca , Thompson then challenged him to a series of gaming debates , claiming that they could each make more than $ 3 @,@ 000 per event . When Della Rocca suggested that neither he nor Thompson accept any money for the events , Thompson refused . 
 In July 2009 , Entertainment Consumers Association ( ECA ) president Hal Halpin posted a copy of an email exchange between himself and Thompson , stating , " I get messages ( IMs , emails , FB notes , etc . ) from members all the time , asking what the ( almost daily ) notes are from JT . Since this one 's fairly harmless and I 've redacted anything personal ( not that I don 't love getting his threatening cease and desist letters ) , I thought I 'd share it as a pretty typical exchange . " Halpin and Thompson have been vocal opponents since 1998 , when Halpin ran the game retail trade association IEMA . The exchange was sparked by a guest editorial that Halpin entitled , " Perception is Everything " for <unk> where he called for consumers and the industry to speak out against negative stereotyping of gamers . 
 In March 2011 , in response to the creation of a school shooter mod entitled School Shooter : North American Tour 2012 , developed by <unk> Studios on Valve Corporation 's Source engine , Thompson emailed Valve 's managing director , Gabe Newell , demanding that the mod be removed , as he speculated that Valve played a part in the mod 's development . In the letter , Thompson stated that Half @-@ Life was directly responsible for the Erfurt massacre , as well as the Virginia Tech massacre and that Valve had until 5 : 00 PM on March 18 to remove the mod . 
 = = The Howard Stern Show = = 
 In 2004 , Thompson helped get Howard Stern 's show taken off a radio station in Orlando , Florida by filing a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission . Thompson objected to Stern ’ s use of perceived obscenities on the air . He argued that " Either broadcasters will accept the light harness of decency that has been the law for decades and start cleaning up their acts , or the public 's deepening outrage will foster a more fearsome governmental response . " Thompson claimed to have received death threats from listeners of Stern 's show , noting that " you 'd expect that considering the IQ of people who listen to Howard Stern . Apparently they fail to realize that I might have caller ID . " 
 During his opposition to Howard Stern , Thompson was asked in an interview with a reporter if , by his standards , he would blame Christianity for the murders committed by Michael Hernandez , a fourteen @-@ year @-@ old who murdered one of his classmates in 2004 , because Hernandez wrote a diary in which he constantly spoke about praying to God . Thompson replied , " The Bible doesn 't promote killing innocent people , Grand Theft Auto does . Islam does . " Thompson then expanded his comments in the same interview by saying , " Islam promotes the killing of innocent people . The Quran requires the infidel , whether Jew or Christian , to be killed . ... That 's a core essence of the religion . ... Muhammad was a pirate who killed infidels and who advocated the killing of infidels — not a nice guy . Osama bin Laden is in keeping with his fine tradition . " 
 He later spoke in defense of Stern during the latter ’ s legal dispute with CBS over promoting Sirius on @-@ air before his switch to satellite radio . Thompson contended that the technology added by CBS to edit out profanity also could have worked to edit out Stern 's references to Sirius . According to Thompson , " The reason why CBS chose not to edit Stern is that Stern 's Arbitron ratings remained high and were arguably even enhanced by people tuning in to hear daily about Stern 's running feud with CBS and his move to Sirius . In other words , CBS actually used Stern 's discussion of his move to Sirius to make more money for CBS . " 
 CBS President Leslie Moonves responded , saying " You know what ? You can ’ t let people like that tell you what to put on the air or what not to put on the air . That would only open the door when suddenly next week , he says , ' Take David Letterman off the air or take <unk> off the air . ' Or you know what ? Everybody Loves Raymond was about , you know , sex last week or about a 70 @-@ year @-@ old man — you know , we dealt with Peter Boyle having sex with Doris Roberts . ' Take that off the air . ' That 's something we can ’ t let happen . "

 = = = Actions against the bar = = = 
 In 1993 , Thompson asked a Florida judge to declare The Florida Bar unconstitutional . He said that the Bar was engaged in a vendetta against him because of his religious beliefs , which he said conflicted with what he called the Bar 's pro @-@ gay , humanist , liberal agenda . He also said that the " wedding of all three functions of government into The Florida Bar , the ' official arm ' of the Florida Supreme Court , is violative of the bedrock constitutional requirement of the separation powers and the ' checks and balances ' which the separation guarantees . " Thompson accepted a $ 20 @,@ 000 out @-@ of @-@ court settlement . 
 On January 7 , 2002 , Thompson sent the Supreme Court of Florida a letter regarding The Florida Bar 's actions . The letter was filed with the court on January 10 , 2002 and was treated as a petition for a writ of mandamus against The Florida Bar . Before any action was taken on the petition , Thompson sent the court another letter on January 28 , 2002 voluntarily dismissing the case . The letter was filed with the court on January 30 , 2002 , and the Florida Supreme Court issued an order of dismissal on February 28 , 2002 . 
 In January 2006 , Thompson asked the Justice Department to investigate The Florida Bar 's actions . " The Florida Bar and its agents have engaged in a documented pattern of this illegal activity , which may sink to the level of criminal racketeering activity , in a knowing and illegal effort to chill my federal First Amendment rights , " Thompson wrote in a letter to Alex Acosta , interim U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida . 
 In April 2006 , Thompson filed another suit against The Florida Bar , this time in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida , alleging that the Bar harassed him by investigating what he called baseless complaints made by disgruntled opponents in previous disputes . His five @-@ count complaint asked for more than $ 1 million in damages . The lawsuit alleged that the Bar was pursuing baseless ethics complaints brought against Thompson by Tew Cardenas attorneys Lawrence Kellogg and Alberto Cardenas of Miami , and by two lawyers from the Philadelphia office of Blank Rome , in violation of Thompson 's constitutional rights . According to the lawsuit , the Bar looked at Thompson for violations of a bar rule that prohibits attorneys from making disparaging remarks about judges , other attorneys , or court personnel . Thompson also filed a motion with the court to order the mediation of his dispute with the Bar . Thompson commented , " I enjoy doing what I do and I think I 've got a First Amendment right to annoy people and participate in the public square in the cultural war . " Thompson also said he is optimistic his federal lawsuit will be successful . " I 'm 100 percent certain that it will effect change , otherwise I would not have filed it . " 
 On April 25 , 2006 , The Florida Bar filed a motion to dismiss Thompson 's complaint . The Bar argued that Thompson 's complaint should be dismissed for a number of reasons , including the fact that the complaint failed to state a claim on which he could be granted relief . The Bar also argued that it was absolutely immune from liability for actions arising out of its disciplinary functions , that the Eleventh Amendment barred Thompson 's recovery of damages , and that the court should dismiss the case pursuant to the abstention doctrine of Younger v. Harris . On May 4 , 2006 , Thompson filed a motion asking Judge Federico Moreno to recuse himself from the case , as Judge Moreno was a member of the Florida Bar . Citing an " abundance of caution , " Judge Moreno recused himself on May 9 , 2006 and referred the case to Chief Judge William <unk> for further action . Thompson did not , however , respond to the Bar 's motion to dismiss the case . Finally , on May 17 , 2006 , Thompson filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal with the court , and the case was dismissed without prejudice . 
 = = = Filings = = = 
 In October 2007 , then @-@ Chief U.S. District Judge Federico Moreno sealed court documents submitted by Thompson in the Bar case that depicted " gay sex acts . " Thompson 's submission prompted U.S. District Judge Adalberto Jordan on to order Thompson to show cause why his actions should not be filed as a grievance with the court 's Ad Hoc Committee on Attorney Admissions , Peer Review and Attorney Grievance , but the order was dismissed after Thompson promised not to file any more pornography . Thompson then sent letters to acting U.S. Attorney General Peter <unk> and U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy and Arlen Specter demanding that Jordan be removed from his position for failing to prosecute Florida attorney Norm Kent , who Thompson claimed had " collaborated " with the Bar for 20 years to discipline him . 
 In February 2008 , the Florida Supreme Court ordered Thompson to show cause as to why it should not reject future court filings from him unless they are signed by another Florida Bar member . The Florida Supreme Court described his filings as " repetitive , frivolous and insult [ ing to ] the integrity of the court , " particularly one in which Thompson , claiming concern about " the court 's inability to comprehend his arguments , " filed a motion which he called " A picture book for adults " , including images of " swastikas , kangaroos in court , a reproduced dollar bill , cartoon squirrels , Paul Simon , Paul Newman , Ray Charles , a handprint with the word ' slap ' written under it , Bar Governor Benedict P. Kuehne , Ed Bradley , Jack Nicholson , Justice Clarence Thomas , Julius Caesar , monkeys , [ and ] a house of cards . " ( see ) Thompson claimed that the order " wildly infringes " on his constitutional rights and was " a brazen attempt " to repeal the First Amendment right to petition the government to redress grievances . In response , he sent a letter to U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey , referring to the show @-@ cause order as a criminal act done in retaliation for his seeking relief with the court . 
 On March 20 , 2008 , the Florida Supreme Court imposed sanctions on Thompson , requiring that any of his future filings in the court be signed by a member of The Florida Bar other than himself . The court noted that Thompson had responded to the show cause order with multiple " rambling , argumentative , and contemptuous " responses that characterized the show cause order as " bizarre " and " idiotic . " 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In February 2007 , The Florida Bar filed disbarment proceedings against Thompson over allegations of professional misconduct . The action was the result of separate grievances filed by people claiming that Thompson made defamatory , false statements and attempted to humiliate , embarrass , harass or intimidate them . According to the complaint , Thompson accused Alberto Cardenas of " distribution of pornography to children , " claimed that the Alabama judge presiding over the Devin Moore case " breaks the rules , even the Alabama State Bar Rules , because he thinks that the rules don 't apply to him , " and sent a letter to Blank Rome 's managing partner , saying , " Your law firm has actively and knowingly facilitated by various means the criminal distribution of sexual material to minors . " Thompson claims that the complaints violate state religious protections because his advocacy is motivated by his Christian faith . 
 In May 2008 , Miami @-@ Dade Circuit Judge Dava Tunis , after reviewing 2 @,@ 400 pages of transcripts and 1 @,@ 700 pages of exhibits , recommended that Thompson be found guilty of 27 of the 31 violations of which he had been accused , including making false statements to tribunals , disparaging and humiliating litigants and other lawyers , and improperly practicing law outside of Florida . Thompson filed a motion with the Florida Supreme Court the day after the report was issued to strike Tunis ' recommendations as vague for lack of detail . Previously , Thompson had attempted to have Tunis thrown off his case , and filed a complaint against her with the state Judicial Qualifications Commission , which is responsible for investigating judges . 
 On June 4 , 2008 , prosecutor Sheila Tuma recommended ' enhanced disbarment ' for Thompson , saying that Thompson demonstrated continued misconduct , a pattern of misconduct and persistently failed to admit any wrongdoing . Enhanced disbarment lengthens the period before an attorney may reapply for admission to the bar from five years to ten . After being prevented from making a speech to begin the disciplinary hearing , Thompson distributed his written objections to lawyers , a court reporter , and a newspaper reporter , departed the courtroom , and called the proceedings against him a " star chamber " and " kangaroo court " . 
 On July 8 , 2008 , Judge Tunis recommended permanent disbarment and a $ 43 @,@ 675 @.@ 35 fine for Thompson to the Florida Supreme Court , citing " cumulative misconduct , a repeated pattern of behavior relentlessly forced upon numerous unconnected individuals , a total lack of remorse or even slight acknowledgment of inappropriate conduct , and continued behavior consistent with the previous public reprimand ... Over a very extended period of time involving a number of totally unrelated cases and individuals , the Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of conduct to strike out harshly , extensively , repeatedly and willfully to simply try to bring as much difficulty , distraction and anguish to those he considers in opposition to his causes ... He does not proceed within the guidelines of appropriate professional behavior , but rather uses other means available to intimidate , harass , or bring public disrepute to those whom he perceives oppose him . " The court approved the recommendation and fine on September 25 , 2008 , and ordered that Thompson be permanently disbarred effective 30 days from the date of the order so Thompson could close out his practice . He later filed for an emergency stay of the Florida Supreme Court 's order with the U.S. District Court , which was ultimately denied . In an e @-@ mail to media outlets , Thompson responded to the court 's decision by stating , " The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation : This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar , the Supreme Court , and all seven of its Justices . This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit . With enemies this foolish , Thompson needs only the loyal friends he has . " He closed the email — in which he included the court ruling — with , " ... this should be fun , starting now " . 
 On September 19 , 2009 , Thompson announced that he intended to resume practicing law as of October 1 , 2009 , claiming that he was " never disbarred " because all of the orders resulting in his disbarment were legal <unk> . He dared The Florida Bar to get a court order to stop him . 
 = = Other activities = = 
 In 1992 , a complaint from Thompson led Florida Secretary of State Jim Smith to withhold a $ 25 @,@ 000 grant to the Miami Film Festival ; Thompson claimed that the festival was using state money to show pornographic films . In response , Thompson was named an " Art Censor of the Year " by the ACLU . The next month , Thompson faced disbarment over allegations that he lied while making accusations against prominent Dade County lawyer Stuart Z Grossman . Thompson ultimately admitted violating bar rules of professional conduct , including charges that he contacted people represented by an attorney without first contacting their attorneys , and agreed to pay $ 3 @,@ 000 in fines and receive a public reprimand . 
 In 1999 , Thompson represented the parents of Bryce <unk> , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy who committed suicide by hanging himself . Police believed that the death was an accident , and that <unk> was imitating Kenny , a character from the Comedy Central series South Park , which Bryce , according to his parents , had never watched . Thompson called for Comedy Central to stop marketing the show and toys based on the series to children . " You see , the whole show — thrust of the show is it 's — it 's cool for kids to act like the characters in South Park . " 
 Prior to Thompson 's disbarment , attorney Norm Kent filed a personal lawsuit against him , which eventually resulted in Thompson paying Kent $ 50 @,@ 000 for defamation . Thompson reacted to the suit by threatening employees at one of Kent 's clients , Beasley Broadcast Group , with lawsuits and depositions unless they got Kent to drop his case . 
 In January 2005 , Beasley hired attorney Lawrence A. Kellogg of law firm Tew Cardenas , LLP , to manage Thompson 's threats . Because Kellogg delayed arranging a meeting with him , Thompson on March 17 began a campaign targeting the firm 's name partner Al Cardenas , a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida , accusing him of personally being involved in " a statewide racketeering activity " in a letter sent to the media , Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist , and Florida Governor Jeb Bush . Kellogg then filed a complaint to the Florida bar that figured largely in Thompson 's disbarment . 
 On April 30 , Thompson extended his campaign against Cardenas to an attempt at embarrassing him as a trustee of Florida A & M University , a historically black university . In an email sent to FAMU interim president Castell V. Bryant , the media , the FCC , and Governor Bush , he cites racist remarks made by a caller to The Howard Stern Show to suggest that Cardenas put " profit ahead of race relations " , even though Beasley , which owned a station broadcasting Stern 's show , was not among Cardenas 's clients . 
 On February 21 , 2007 , Thompson filed a complaint with the Florida Judicial Qualifications Commission against Judge Larry Seidlin , accusing Seidlin of " violating nearly every judicial canon " in conducting a hearing on the disposition of the body of Anna Nicole Smith . On June 28 , 2007 , Thompson filed a complaint with the State Attorney 's Office , asking for an investigation and possible prosecution regarding accusations that Seidlin inappropriately accepted expensive gifts . 
 In March 2008 , Thompson called for the New York State Supreme Court ’ s Appellate Division to immediately suspend the law license of former state governor Eliot Spitzer , who had resigned from the position amidst reports he was a client of a prostitution ring . Thompson said that the Disciplinary Committee for the Appellate Division 's First Department should stop Spitzer from practicing law until the matter was resolved , noting that Spitzer did not claim innocence in his initial public apology .

 Thompson filed a lawsuit for $ 40 million against Facebook in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on September 29 , 2009 . Thompson claimed that the social networking site had caused him " great harm and distress " by not removing angry postings made by users in several Facebook groups . Thompson quietly dismissed his case less than two months later . According to Parry Aftab , a cyber @-@ law attorney , Thompson would likely not have had any success because the U.S. Communications Decency Act provides that companies such as Facebook have no liability for what users do with their services in most cases . 
 = Walking Liberty half dollar = 
 The Walking Liberty half dollar was a silver 50 @-@ cent piece or half dollar coin issued by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1947 ; it was designed by Adolph A. Weinman . 
 In 1915 , the new Mint Director , Robert W. Woolley , came to believe that he was not only allowed but required by law to replace coin designs that had been in use for 25 years . He therefore began the process of replacing the Barber coinage : dimes , quarters and half dollars , all bearing similar designs by long @-@ time Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber , and first struck in 1892 . Woolley had the Commission of Fine Arts conduct a competition , as a result of which Weinman was selected to design the dime and half dollar . 
 Weinman 's design of Liberty striding towards the Sun for the half dollar proved difficult to perfect , and Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo , whose department included the Mint , considered having Barber create his own design . Mint officials were successful in getting Weinman 's design into production , although it never struck very well , which may have been a factor in its replacement by the Franklin half dollar beginning in 1948 . Nevertheless , art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered the piece to be among the most beautiful US coins . Since 1986 , a modification of Weinman 's obverse design has been used for the American Silver Eagle , and the half dollar is being issued in gold for its centennial in 2016 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 On September 26 , 1890 , the United States Congress passed an act providing : 
 The Director of the Mint shall have power , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury , to cause new designs ... to be prepared and adopted ... But no change in the design or die of any coin shall be made oftener than once in twenty @-@ five years from and including the year of the first adoption of the design ... But the Director of the Mint shall nevertheless have power , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury , to engage temporarily the services of one or more artists , distinguished in their respective departments of art , who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia . 
 The Barber coinage was introduced in 1892 ; dimes , quarter dollars , and half dollars with similar designs by Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber . The new pieces attracted considerable public dissatisfaction . Beginning in 1905 , successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern , beautiful designs to United States coins . Following the redesign of the double eagle , eagle , half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908 , as well as the cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively , advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins ' minimum term expired in 1916 . As early as 1914 , Victor David Brenner , designer of the Lincoln cent , submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins . He was told in response that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters . 
 On January 2 , 1915 , an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record : 
 So far as I know ... there is no thought of issuing new coins of the 50 @-@ cent , 25 @-@ cent , and 10 @-@ cent values . If , however , a change is made we all hope that more serviceable and satisfactory coins are produced than the recent Saint @-@ Gaudens double eagle and eagle and the Pratt half and quarter eagle . The buffalo nickel and the Lincoln penny are also faulty from a practical standpoint . All resulted from the desire by the government to mint coins to the satisfaction of artists and not practical coiners . 
 In January 1915 , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage , noting that " the present silver half dollar , quarter , and dime were changed in 1892 , and a new design may , therefore , be adopted in 1916 . This can be done any time in the year . " In reply , McAdoo wrote " let the mint submit designs before we try anyone else " on the memorandum . 
 In April 1915 , Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director . On April 14 , he asked Joyce to request Engraver Barber , then in his 36th year in office , to prepare new designs . The same day , Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department 's Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916 . On April 17 , the Solicitor 's Office responded that the Mint could change the designs . At the time , the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama @-@ Pacific commemorative coin issue , and immediate action was not taken . In October , Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley , although it is uncertain whether or not he had by then prepared sketches for the new coinage . 
 On December 3 , Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts . Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint 's engraving department . Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members . Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint 's work , they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces . It was Woolley 's intent to have distinct designs for the dime , quarter and half dollar — previously , the three pieces had been near @-@ identical . The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years , it would have to be changed — which numismatic historian David Lange calls a " misinterpretation of the coinage laws " . 
 The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint ( submitted by Barber ) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman , Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins . The sculptors could submit multiple sketches . Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor , the designs were not fully interchangeable — by statute , an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar , but could not appear on the dime . Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece . 
 The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid @-@ February , and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York City to make presentations of their work and answer his questions . After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo , Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected — for the dime and half dollar , and the reverse of the quarter . The same day , Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter 's obverse , and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success . Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist , and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter , subject to the sculptor producing a design satisfactory to Woolley . 
 On March 3 , the new coins were publicly announced , with the Treasury noting , " [ d ] esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25 @-@ year period ends with 1916 . " The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months , once the designs were finalized . The same day , Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber , telling him that his sketches were rejected , and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than May 1 . According to numismatic historian Walter Breen , Barber became " sullen and totally uncooperative " . Lange notes that " numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine @-@ tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber . While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate , they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner . " In his book on Mercury dimes , Lange notes that Barber , by then aged 75 , had been " compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime 's achievements " ; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him . 
 With the new pieces , all American coins would have had a recent change of design ( the Morgan dollar was not then being struck . ) According to a column in The Art World magazine later in 1916 @,@ 
 Since that day [ the 19th century ] much artistic progress has taken place in our coinage . Sculptors of reputation have been employed with admirable results ... And now we are to have a new half dollar and a new dime by Weinman and a new quarter by McNeill [ sic ] . Altogether , in the retrospect , it seems an incredible achievement . 
 = = Design = = 
 According to Secretary McAdoo in his 1916 annual report , 
 The design of the half dollar bears a full @-@ length figure of Liberty , the folds of the Stars and Stripes flying to the breeze as a background , progressing in full stride toward the dawn of a new day , carrying branches of laurel and oak , symbolical of civil and military glory . The hand of the figure is outstretched in bestowal of the spirit of liberty . The reverse of the half dollar shows an eagle perched high upon a mountain crag , his wings unfolded , fearless in spirit and conscious of his power . Springing from a rift in the rock is a sapling of mountain pine , symbolical of America . 
 Weinman 's obverse bears a resemblance to Oscar Roty 's " Sower " design for French coins ; according to numismatic historian Roger Burdette , " Weinman has taken the ideal of a nineteenth century provincial figure and turned it into an American icon . " Burdette ties both the appearance of the head of Liberty and of the branches which she carries to Baltimore 's Union Soldiers and Sailors ' Monument , designed by Weinman . The sculptor may also have drawn inspiration from a 1913 bust he did of his tenant , Elsie Stevens , wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens . Elsie Stevens is generally believed to have been a model for Weinman 's Mercury dime ; her daughter Holly wrote in 1966 that her mother had been the model for both coins . The reverse is similar to Weinman 's medal for the American Institute of Architects , although the sculptor replaced the laurel on the medal with a pine sapling . Weinman 's work on the medal had been widely admired for the power of the depicted eagle . 
 Breen , in his comprehensive volume on US coins , said of the half dollar , " Ms. Liberty wears the American flag , anticipating a rebellious counterculture by half a century . " Though admiring the piece generally , he noted that Liberty is striding towards the east , that is towards war @-@ torn Europe , and wrote , " she points into the sky at nothing visible ( perhaps aiming a warning at German warplanes ? ) " Breen objects to the use of the mountain pine on the reverse , calling it not particularly American nor especially notable except for an ability to thrive near the tree line . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule wrote that the Walking Liberty half dollar " really treat [ s ] the obverse and reverse as a surface sculptural ensemble . The ' Walking Liberty ' design particularly gives the true feeling of breath and sculptural services on the scale of a coin . " Vermeule noted the resemblance of the half dollar to Roty 's " Sower " but states that Weinman 's piece " is an original creation , not a slavish copy " . On the reverse , Vermeule admired the eagle , which dominates but does not overwhelm the design , and stated that the bird 's feathers are " a marvelous tour de force " , showing the influence of Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , under whom Weinman studied . Vermeule characterized the Walking Liberty half dollar to be " one of the greatest coins of the United States — if not of the world " . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 The three sculptors met with Woolley on March 6 , 1916 at the New York Assay Office to be formally told of the outcome of the competition , including the change in the outcome for the quarter , and to receive back rejected models and sketches . Polasek , who received his participation fee of $ 300 on March 10 , never again had any connection with the Mint or coinage design . Until a plaster model of one of his submissions was discovered at the Polasek Museum ( formerly his house ) in 2002 , his participation was known only through the Mint 's records . 
 After Weinman 's success in the competition , he visited the Mint to discuss conversion of his models to finished dies . On his first visit , he found Barber absent , but had a productive talk with long @-@ time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan . Other visits followed , and on March 29 , Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce , " confidentially , the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was . I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends . " Woolley came to New York twice in April to examine MacNeil 's evolving reverse design for the quarter , on May 26 he also visited Weinman 's studio and viewed progress on the models of his designs . A severe case of tonsillitis delayed Weinman 's work , and caused him to request an extension of the May 1 deadline . On May 29 , Woolley wrote Weinman that the designs , both for the dime and half dollar , were accepted by the Mint . 
 During June , the Mint 's engraving department , headed by Barber , reduced the models to coin @-@ sized hubs and prepared dies for experimental pattern coins , which were subsequently struck . Woolley hoped to begin production of the new coins of all three denominations by July 1 , but the grant of time to Weinman required the Mint to act with greater speed . Burdette suggests the haste with which the dies were prepared caused coins struck with them to appear worn and without sharp detail . By June 22 , Weinman had viewed the first patterns , as he wrote to Woolley stating that he did not like the way the word " Liberty " on the obverse had turned out , and asking for the loan of two patterns so he could redo the lettering . On June 24 , Woolley wrote to Joyce , informing him of the loan and stating of the new pieces , 
 The model of the obverse on the half dollar will have to be made over and Mr. Weinman informs me he is now at work on it . The same is true of the quarter dollar . The reverse of both the quarter dollar and the half dollar , as shown on the coins struck from the polished dies , are satisfactory ... Everyone to whom the coins have been shown here thinks they are beautiful . 
 With Woolley 's permission to redo the obverse , Weinman decided to remove the word " Liberty " from above the figure and place it above " In God We Trust " to the right of it . This permitted him to extend Liberty 's head almost to the top of the coin , maximizing the size of the depiction . The letter " L " was placed in the concavity formed by the flag as it drapes under the figure 's left elbow , and the rest of the word extended to the right from there , with the letter T in larger print , actually saving room as the larger size allowed the crossbar of the " T " to extend above the capitalized letters " R " and " Y " . This allowed the letters to be squeezed closer together . When Woolley resigned on July 15 to become director of publicity for the Wilson reelection campaign ( a function he also fulfilled for Democratic candidates in 1912 and 1920 ) , he mentioned in his resignation letter to Secretary McAdoo , " in working over the model for the obverse side of the half dollar Mr. Weinman is making a slight rearrangement of the word ' Liberty ' , and will have it ready for your inspection in a few days . I like it and believe you will . " Weinman wrote to the former director on July 20 that increasing the size of the figure of Liberty improved its appearance . 
 McAdoo accepted Weinman 's revised design on July 26 ; at that time Adjuster of the Bureau of the Mint Fred H. Chaffin was serving as Acting Mint Director until President Wilson could nominate a replacement for Woolley and have him confirmed by the Senate . Weinman decided , on his own initiative , to rearrange the legends on the reverse . On the original pattern , " United States of America " is at the top of the reverse , with " Half Dollar " directly below and " E Pluribus Unum " at the bottom of the coin . Weinman 's revision has the legends in the places they would occupy on the circulation strikes , and was approved by McAdoo on August 10 . On August 18 , Wilson nominated Woolley 's successor , Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken , who was promptly confirmed by the Senate . Von Engelken was supposed to be sworn in on the August 21 ; his swearing in was delayed until September 1 by President Wilson 's failure to sign his commission . 
 = = Modification = = 
 When von Engelken took office as Mint Director on September 1 , 1916 , the half dollar had been approved , and pattern coins had been struck . Actual production of the 50 @-@ cent piece was delayed as the Mint struggled to finalize Weinman 's Mercury dime . On September 6 , production of the dime was halted as companies testing the new 10 @-@ cent piece found that the new pieces would not work in vending machines . The defect was found to be a " fin " , excess metal at the edge of the coin , making it seem too thick when inserted in machines . The fin could also break off , leaving the silver coins underweight . The problem was found on the pattern half dollars as well . On September 6 , von Engelken wrote to Assistant Secretary Malburn , using information that Burdette suggests came from Barber : 
 I am sending you with this letter ten of the new dimes and one of the new half dollars . If you examine these coins carefully , you will find that they are decidedly imperfect . You will note both on the half dollar and the ten cent piece a sharp projection of the metal on the edge , which is the " fin " to which I have referred . You will note also , particularly on the half dollar on account of its size , a variation in the thickness of the coin , specifically noticeable at the edge . I went to Philadelphia yesterday to ascertain whether or not this could be overcome , and I find that we are faced with certain mechanical restrictions which make it impossible to produce a coin of uniform thickness of edge , and to obviate the fin edge , as long as we maintain the high relief of the coin as it is at present . 
 Von Engelken 's letter caused concern in the Secretary 's office — McAdoo feared that if the Mint proved unable to successfully issue new coins , the Republicans might exploit the failure as an issue in the presidential race . The Secretary enquired how long it would take " our Mr. Barber " to produce new designs ; after consultation with officials at the Philadelphia Mint , von Engelken replied that it would take six to eight months . The two officials decided that Weinman must be asked to modify his design for the half dollar — it was hoped that if Weinman shrank the figure of Liberty , and lowered the relief , the piece would prove coinable . 
 Weinman arrived at the Mint on September 11 . He left with two pattern half dollars and instructions to reduce the size of the figure of Liberty . Barber appealed to Joyce for permission to make major changes to Weinman 's design , but this was initially refused . However , when an additional change by Weinman failed to eliminate the fin problem , Joyce gave in and allowed Barber a free hand . Engraver Barber shrank the design , moving the design further from the edge , and creating a wide space between design and rim . Barber insisted that this was the only way to prevent a fin and uneven edge . A beaded border was added within the rim . According to Burdette , patterns struck from the new dies were dull and uninteresting , as the size of the figures had lent them strength . 
 On October 18 , Weinman wrote to Joyce , asking how the Mint was getting on with the dies for the half dollar and dime , and expressing his willingness to come to Philadelphia . Joyce replied two days later , informing him that the design of the half dollar was being reduced in size to prevent recurrence of the edge difficulties , and informing him of the beaded border . Weinman responded hoping that Joyce would prevent the figure of Liberty from being unduly reduced , and rendering his account . As the sculptor and superintendent corresponded , the Mint began the work of converting the Barber @-@ modified designs to working dies from which circulation coins could be struck , but Joyce interceded before coining could begin . The Philadelphia Mint superintendent , who had the support of von Engelken , felt that Barber 's modifications were unnecessary . Joyce believed that coins closer to Weinman 's concept could be struck by lowering the relief slightly , adjusting the force with which the Mint 's presses struck the planchets or blanks , and better preparing the planchets for striking . Joyce 's position prevailed , and Barber and his department prepared working dies for striking of circulation pieces , omitting Barber 's beaded border and wide space between rim and design . Working dies were at the Denver and San Francisco Mints on November 27 , and production began at all three mints soon after . 
 In late December Weinman , who had received no update from the Mint since being told of the Barber modifications , but who had read in the newspapers that the half dollars were being struck , sent a $ 10 money order to Joyce with a request for 20 of the new coins . On January 2 , 1917 , Weinman wrote to Joyce again , telling him the new pieces had been received in time to be given as New Year 's gifts , and wishing the superintendent " every good wish to you for every day of the New Year and with thanks to the Almighty and yourself that the beads are not on the border of the Half Dollar " .

 Although the dime 's debut on October 30 , 1916 had seen considerable publicity , the Mint had little comment on the release of the half dollar and Standing Liberty quarter the following January . There were few newspaper mentions of the new half dollar ; the United States was moving towards war with Germany , and the dime release had exhausted much of the public interest in the novelty of new coins . The quarter dominated what public attention there was with argument over whether the eagle on its reverse was portrayed accurately . Despite the minimal publicity , according to a January 1917 report from Mint Adjuster Chaffin , all three mints initially had trouble keeping up with public demand for the new half dollars . 
 The New York Times noted on January 3 that the new pieces had been received by the Sub @-@ Treasury and would be released two to a customer , starting on January 9 . It stated that the Mint was working as hard as possible to keep up with demand , but that initially quantities would be limited . Banking , the journal of the American Bankers Association stated that " The designs of the new coins have been highly praised by those having expert knowledge of such matters . " A Connecticut newspaper predicted readers would like the new half dollar five times as much as the new dime . 
 The Huntsville ( Alabama ) Mercury , however , expressed its dislike of the new half dollar . In a piece entitled " New half dollar is sick " , it stated : 
 The new coin is radically different from all other monies produced by the government mints . A suffragette is shown sowing small stars in a western field that hasn ’ t been plowed very deeply . The sun is setting and the old girl looks rather tired from her day ’ s labors , in fact perspiration can be seen trickling from her forehead . The lady wears sandals and her feet are rather dusty . She also appears , to have on overalls under her thin dress . She carries a load of firewood in one arm and wears a large napkin around her neck which leads to the belief that she left a small child at the house . The wind is blowing from the north and the sun has a <unk> appearance . In great letters LIBERTY is spelled , extending more than half way around the entire surface . On the other side appears an eagle , grown to enormous size and marching madly toward Mexico , a cactus bush being shown in the background . The eagle has raised his wing , as if to strike ; the old fellow looks like he could put up a good fight if aroused but he has a swell crop of feathers on his legs . 
 = = Production and collecting = = 
 The mint marks had initially been placed on the obverse , the first time that had been done for a regular issue US half dollar since 1839 . On February 14 , 1917 , von Engelken ordered that the mint mark be moved from the obverse to the reverse , stating that the obverse placement had the appearance of a die defect . At that time , Von Engelken had resigned pending appointment to the post of president of the Federal Land Bank for the Third District ; once he left to take that position , he was succeeded by Raymond T. Baker . In April , Joyce asked Baker for written confirmation of von Engelken 's order , and after he obliged , the mint mark was duly moved . The majority of the 1917 half dollars struck at Denver ( 1917 @-@ D ) and San Francisco ( 1917 @-@ S ) bear the mint mark on the reverse . 
 Throughout the time in which the Mint struck the Walking Liberty half dollar , it had difficulty bringing out the design fully . According to Breen , 
 Mint authorities knew well that the Weinman design , despite its great artistic merit , no matter how thorough Barber 's original attempt to reduce relief , was technically unsatisfactory . Areas of highest relief still opposed relief areas on the other side . 
 The San Francisco Mint especially had difficulty with the coins ; many pieces struck there are noticeably weak . In 1918 Morgan , who had succeeded Barber as Engraver after the latter 's death the previous year , modified the design , incising some of the details at Liberty 's neck . According to Breen , " The attempt was a failure . " Morgan 's successor , John R. Sinnock made additional attempts in 1937 and 1938 , with little better results . Breen suggested that the difficulties in striking the piece contributed to the willingness to replace it after World War II . 
 No Walking Liberty half dollar is especially rare , but many dates are scarce in Mint State condition , particularly the 1921 and 1921 @-@ D. The Mint struck proof coins in 1916 – 1917 and 1936 – 1942 , all at Philadelphia . The 1916 pieces were struck in very small numbers — Breen stated that he had seen only four — and only three 1917 proof coins are confirmed , most likely struck for VIPs at a time when proof coins were not sold to the public . A number of the later proof coins lack Weinman 's monogram , apparently lost through <unk> of dies . This is most common with the 1941 proof pieces — much of the year 's production lacks the monogram — but is known for other years . A total of 74 @,@ 400 proof coins were struck for the series . 
 There are few varieties in the series , and they are relatively minor . They principally involve the mint mark : several <unk> , one <unk> of a D over an S in 1942 , and some changes in size . One oddity is the 1943 / 1942 , which is not a true overdate but was formed by a working die struck once from a 1942 @-@ dated master die , and once from one dated 1943 . Some 1946 half dollars show a doubled die on the reverse .

 In 1947 , Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross asked Engraver Sinnock to produce a design for a half dollar featuring Founding Father Benjamin Franklin . Ross had long been an admirer of Franklin , and wanted to see him on a coin . Mint officials had considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941 , but the project was shelved owing to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II . During the war , the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage ; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design in anticipation of a new issue , which did not occur . In 1946 , the Treasury replaced the Mercury dime with a piece depicting the recently deceased president , Franklin Roosevelt , who had been closely associated with the March of Dimes . With the Lincoln cent popular and politically inexpedient to replace , the half dollar was the only piece being struck which was available for redesign without congressional permission . The Treasury approved the new design . Although Sinnock died before the coin was issued , the Franklin half dollar went into production at the start of 1948 , ending the Walking Liberty series . A total of 485 @,@ 320 @,@ 340 Walking Liberty half dollars were struck . 
 Since 1986 , Weinman 's obverse design has been used as the obverse design for the American Silver Eagle bullion coin . In adapting the design , Mint Sculptor @-@ Engraver John Mercanti and other members of the engraving staff strengthened many of the details . Mercanti noted that Weinman 's original plaster was only 6 inches ( 150 mm ) in diameter , and was softly modelled . Mercanti increased the detail so that the design , struck on a larger coin , would be bolder and would have a more even metal flow when struck than Weinman 's original coin . Treasury Secretary James Baker chose a heraldic eagle design , by Mercanti , as the reverse of the American Silver Eagle . 
 In December 2010 , President Barack Obama signed legislation authorizing bullion coins made of palladium . The obverse would be taken from the Mercury dime ; the reverse would follow Weinman 's architectural award medal on which he based the half dollar 's reverse . The Mint was directed to obtain an independent study of whether there would be enough market demand to justify the issuance of the piece ; it voided its first contract for such a study on learning that the contracted firm had ties to the palladium industry . The contract was re @-@ awarded to New York @-@ based CPM Group , which conducted the necessary research between May and July 2012 . On March 1 , 2013 , the Mint submitted a report to Congress based on the study , finding that demand would most likely not be sufficient to sustain a market in palladium bullion coins . 
 The United States Mint in 2015 announced plans to restrike for collectors , in gold , the three silver coins first issued in 1916 . The half dollar will have its weight and fineness inscribed on the reverse . The mockups of the half dollar released by the Mint show the mint mark on the obverse . 
 = Atlantic campaign of 1806 = 
 The Atlantic campaign of 1806 was a complicated series of <unk> and counter @-@ manoeuveres conducted by squadrons of the French Navy and the British Royal Navy across the Atlantic Ocean during the spring and summer of 1806 , as part of the Napoleonic Wars . The campaign followed directly from the Trafalgar campaign of the year before , in which the French Mediterranean fleet had crossed the Atlantic , returned to Europe and joined with the Spanish fleet . On 21 October 1805 , this combined force was destroyed by a British fleet under Lord Nelson at the Battle of Trafalgar , although the campaign did not end until the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805 . Believing that the French Navy would not be capable of organised resistance at sea during the winter , the First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham withdrew the British blockade squadrons to harbour . Barham had miscalculated – the French Atlantic fleet , based at Brest , had not been involved in the Trafalgar campaign and was therefore at full strength . Taking advantage of the reduction in the British forces off the port , Napoleon ordered two heavy squadrons to sea , under instructions to raid British trade routes while avoiding contact with equivalent Royal Navy forces . 
 Departing from Brest on 13 December 1805 , it was 12 days before the Admiralty in London were aware of the French movements , by which time the French squadrons were deep in the Atlantic , one under Vice @-@ Admiral Corentin @-@ Urbain Leissègues intending to cruise in the Caribbean and the other , under Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez , sailing for the South Atlantic . Two British squadrons were hastily mustered and dispatched in pursuit , one under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and the other under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren . These squadrons were joined by a third under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth , who had deserted his station off Cadiz when he learned news of a French squadron to his south and subsequently crossed the Atlantic in pursuit of Willaumez . Although Willaumez managed to escape into the South Atlantic , Leissègues was less successful and was discovered and destroyed at the Battle of San Domingo in February 1806 by a combined force under Duckworth and Rear @-@ Admiral Alexander Cochrane . Other squadrons already at sea became embroiled in the campaign : a smaller squadron that had been raiding the African coast under Commodore Jean @-@ Marthe @-@ Adrien L 'Hermite since August 1805 provided a diversion to the major campaign but failed to draw off significant British forces , while the remnants of a French squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Charles @-@ Alexandre Durand Linois that had been operating in the Indian Ocean since 1803 was intercepted and defeated by Warren in March , after a chance encounter on its journey back to France . 
 Willaumez achieved minor success in his operations in the South Atlantic and Caribbean , but was caught in a summer hurricane on his return journey and his ships were scattered along the Eastern Seaboard of North America . One was intercepted and destroyed by British forces and others were so badly damaged in the storm that they were forced to shelter in American ports . The survivors gradually returned to Brest during the autumn , the last arriving in early 1807 . The campaign was the last significant operation in the Atlantic for the remainder of the war , and no French squadron of any size left any of the Biscay ports until 1808 . The losses suffered by the Brest fleet weakened it so severely that it would not participate in a major operation until 1809 , when an attempt to break out of Brest ended in defeat at the Battle of Basque Roads .

 On 30 March 1805 , the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve successfully broke out of Toulon harbour , avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic , Nelson following several days behind . Villeneuve , joined by a Spanish squadron , crossed the ocean to the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique , while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June . Panicked by the British arrival , Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe , with Nelson again close behind . Villeneuve 's orders had specified that he sail to Brest , the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay , and join there with the fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Honoré Ganteaume . Together this force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain . However , as he passed the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805 , Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Robert Calder . At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre , Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive blow on Villeneuve 's squadron , which later sailed to Cadiz , Spain 's principal Atlantic seaport . Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port . 
 On 21 October 1805 , Villeneuve 's combined Franco @-@ Spanish fleet sailed from Cadiz and was intercepted by Nelson , resulting in the Battle of Trafalgar . Although Nelson was killed at the height of the battle , his squadron inflicted a devastating defeat on the combined fleet , capturing or destroying 17 French or Spanish ships , including Villeneuve 's flagship . The battered remnants of the French Mediterranean and Spanish Atlantic fleets retreated to Cadiz , although four French ships fled north and were intercepted and captured at the Battle of Cape Ortegal two weeks later . In total , the campaign cost Napoleon 13 French and 12 Spanish ships , eliminating any possibility of even regional superiority at sea and therefore preventing the planned invasion of Britain , which had already been indefinitely postponed . The elimination of the French and Spanish fleets and the end of the threat of French invasion was widely celebrated in Britain , and seen by First Lord of the Admiralty Lord Barham , as an opportunity to reduce costs and damage to his ships by withdrawing the Atlantic blockade to Britain during the winter under the assumption that the battered French Navy would be unable and unwilling to operate at sea during the period . He wrote : " It is of little purpose now , to wear out our ships in a fruitless blockade during the winter . " 
 = = = French plans = = = 
 Barham had seriously miscalculated the strength of the Brest fleet , which had been uninvolved in the campaign of 1805 and was therefore at full strength . He also underestimated Napoleon , who had observed that Villeneuve 's brief stay in the Caribbean had acted as a major threat to British trade , delaying convoys and causing panic among the West Indian merchants . The French naval authorities were also inspired by the effect of a raiding squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Zacharie Allemand , which had escaped from Rochefort on 17 July 1805 , caused significant disruption to British trade in the Atlantic and remained at sea off the North African coast . Seeking to repeat these effects , Napoleon sent orders to the commander at Brest , Vice Admiral Honoré Ganteaume , in November 1805 for two strong squadrons to be prepared for service in the Atlantic . These were to leave Brest under cover of darkness on 13 December , with orders to strike deep into the Atlantic and intercept any merchant convoys that they encountered . Subsequently the squadrons were to separate , one to the South Atlantic and the other to the Caribbean , there to cause as much disruption to British intercontinental trade as possible . The orders encouraged the admirals not to engage any Royal Navy force of equivalent size or larger and thus avoid the risk of being captured or destroyed . 
 Ganteaume selected 11 ships of the line for the operation , including the 120 @-@ gun first rate Impérial , flagship of Vice Admiral Corentin @-@ Urbain Leissègues , who was to sail to the Caribbean with four other ships of the line , two frigates and a corvette . His squadron carried over 1 @,@ 000 French soldiers to augment the garrison on Santo Domingo under General Jean @-@ Louis Ferrand , and was then required to spend two months blockading Jamaica before cruising along the American Eastern Seaboard to Newfoundland , returning to France when food supplies ran low . The other squadron was given to Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez in Foudroyant , with orders to cruise the shipping lanes of the South Atlantic before sailing to the Leeward Islands , communicating with the French colonies of Martinique , Guadeloupe and Cayenne and blockading Barbados . When British opposition became too strong , he was to return to the South Atlantic off Saint Helena , also returning to France once food supplies ran low . His squadron consisted of six ships of the line , two frigates and two brigs , and included among its captains Jérôme Bonaparte , the Emperor 's younger brother . Although both squadrons carried six months provisions , they were expected to capture more during their voyages and it was intended that their raiding operations should last as long as 14 months , causing severe indirect damage to the British economy by restricting the movement of trade . 
 = = December 1805 = = 
 On 13 December 1805 , with the majority of the British blockade squadron anchored in Cawsand Bay and the remainder driven far offshore by a winter gale , the French squadrons sailed from Brest into the Bay of Biscay unnoticed . Within two days they had passed nearly 500 nautical miles ( 930 km ) into the Atlantic Ocean and had encountered a British merchant convoy , Willaumez detaching in pursuit . The convoy was sailing to Britain from Gibraltar , escorted by the 64 @-@ gun HMS Polyphemus under Captain Robert Redmill and the frigate HMS Sirius under Captain William Prowse . Heavily outnumbered , the convoy turned away and ran before the wind , Willaumez in close pursuit . Later in the day a second convoy appeared to the north , of 23 ships sailing from Cork to the Caribbean escorted by the frigates HMS Arethusa under Captain Charles Brisbane , HMS Boadicea under Captain John Maitland and the brig HMS Wasp . With Willaumez distracted , Leissègues ordered his squadron in pursuit . 
 Willaumez 's ships captured a number of stragglers from Redmill 's convoy and managed to isolate Sirius , which only just escaped after narrowly avoiding an unequal encounter with four French ships of the line . With the convoy dispersed , Willaumez gathered his scattered forces and despatched the frigate <unk> to the Spanish island of Tenerife with the prizes , before turning the remainder of his squadron southwards for his designated cruising grounds . To the north , Leissègues gradually approached Brisbane 's convoy during the night but did not close with him until the morning of 16 December . In response , Brisbane formed his three warships into a line of battle , accompanied by three of the larger merchant ships . This force could not hope to resist Leissègues ' main force , but would enable the 17 other vessels to escape by blocking the French squadron 's frigates from chasing them . Ignoring the escaping convoy , Leissègues formed his own line of battle and continued to close with Brisbane , whose faster ships steadily pulled away from the French throughout the day . As darkness fell , Leissègues abandoned the pursuit and turned to the south and Brisbane immediately despatched Boadicea to Brest and Wasp to the blockade squadrons along the Atlantic Seaboard with urgent warnings of the French operations in the Eastern Atlantic . Brisbane himself remained in distant contact with Leissègues for another day before the French squadron sheered away . Brisbane continued southwards with the remainder of his convoy , seeking the British blockade squadron at Cadiz . 
 = = = Duckworth 's cruise = = = 
 On 20 November 1805 , the French squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Allemand encountered a British convoy off the Savage Islands . Allemand 's squadron was on its return journey to France when he encountered the convoy , consisting of six merchant ships sailing from Britain to Gorée under the escort of the brig HMS Lark under Commander Frederick Langford . Langford gave orders for his convoy to scatter as the French approached , Lark turning northwards in search of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir John Thomas Duckworth and the Cadiz squadron , reaching it on 26 November . Duckworth immediately sailed in pursuit of Allemand , leaving behind only two frigates to watch Cadiz in his absence . 
 Sailing south from Cadiz , Duckworth 's squadron reached Madeira on 5 December , passing Tenerife ten days later without sighting any French ships . Continuing south to the Cape Verde Islands , Duckworth reluctantly conceded that the French squadron had escaped and he retired northwards until he encountered Brisbane 's reduced convoy on 23 December . Tracking the presumed course of Leissègues ' ships , Duckworth continued northwards on a course that would intercept the French squadron . At 06 : 45 on 25 December , at 30 ° 52 ′ N 20 ° 16 ′ W , approximately 200 nautical miles ( 370 km ) northwest of the Canary Islands , lookouts in Duckworth 's squadron spotted nine sails in the distance . As Allemand 's squadron was estimated to have approximately nine ships , Duckworth initially believed that his enemy was Allemand , possibly accompanied by prizes captured on his cruise . However , as he closed with the French , it became clear that this was a different squadron altogether . In fact his target was Willaumez , and despite the French admiral 's efforts , Duckworth was steadily gaining on him , the ships of the line HMS Superb , HMS Spencer and HMS Agamemnon outstripping the rest of the British squadron . 
 By 13 : 00 on 26 December , the flagship Superb was just 7 nautical miles ( 13 km ) behind the rearmost French ship , with Spencer 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) further back and Agamemnon another 5 nautical miles ( 9 @.@ 3 km ) distant . The rest of the squadron was more than 22 nautical miles ( 41 km ) behind the leaders , almost completely out of sight , with the rearmost ship , HMS Donegal , more than 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) behind Superb . The more compact French squadron was therefore at an advantage . The British were too dispersed to be able to bring a powerful enough force to engage the French in equal battle and the distance between the individual British ships was too great to allow them to provide mutual support if Willaumez turned to face them . Therefore , to the fury of his officers , Duckworth called off the pursuit . This decision was heavily criticised , both at the time and subsequently : historian William James commenting that " had the Superb brought to action , as in the course of a few hours she might , the sternmost French ship . . . the issue , in all reasonable calculation , would have been favourable to the British " . 
 Gathering his scattered squadron , Duckworth despatched the frigate HMS Amethyst to Britain with the news of the French activity in the Eastern Atlantic , his message suggesting that the French were probably destined for the Dutch East Indies . He himself turned southwest towards the Leeward Islands , where he could resupply his ships in preparation for resuming the blockade at Cadiz . On 2 January 1806 he ordered HMS Powerful under Captain Robert Plampin to sail for the Indian Ocean and reinforce the British squadron there , in case Willaumez 's squadron reached Asian waters .

 Word of the French break @-@ out did not reach Britain until 24 December , when a cartel arrived from Gibraltar with the news . The report understated the size of the French forces , claiming seven rather than eleven ships of the line had broken out , with four frigates . Recognising his error in withdrawing the blockade , Barham immediately ordered two squadrons to prepare for sea : one under Vice @-@ Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren gathered at Spithead , including the second rate HMS London and six other ships of the line . The other formed in Cawsand Bay under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Richard Strachan and consisted of the second rate HMS St George and five other ships of the line . Both were ordered to cruise the mid @-@ Atlantic in search of the missing French squadrons , Warren in the vicinity of Madeira and subsequently the West Indies , eventually joining with the squadrons there under Rear @-@ Admiral Alexander Cochrane and Vice @-@ Admiral James Richard Dacres . Strachan was to pass Saint Helena and cruise the West African coast to the Cape of Good Hope , guarding the vital trade route in the Eastern Atlantic that connected Britain with India . If he was unable to discover the French he was instructed to attach his squadron to that under Commodore Home Riggs Popham that had been sent to invade the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope in the autumn of 1805 . 
 = = Battle of San Domingo = = 
 On 12 January 1806 , Duckworth 's squadron anchored in Carlisle Bay , Barbados , sending HMS Acasta to St. Kitts for additional water supplies . On 19 January the whole squadron sailed to Basseterre at St. Kitts , where they anchored and took on fresh food and water . On 21 January two ships of the West Indian squadron joined them : HMS Northumberland under Captain John Morrison and HMS Atlas under Captain Samuel Pym . Northumberland was the flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Alexander Cochrane , who met with Duckworth but had no new information about French movements in the region . In fact , Leissègues had arrived in the Caribbean on 20 January , his passage delayed since departing from Brisbane 's convoy in December and his ships damaged and dispersed by a series of winter storms off the Azores . Disembarking the troops at Santo Domingo , the French admiral made repairs to his ships , awaited the arrival of the missing Alexandre and Brave , and took on supplies over the next two weeks in preparation for raiding operations in the West Indies . 
 On 1 February , the British sloop HMS Kingfisher arrived at St. Kitts with news that three French ships of the line had been spotted off Santo Domingo . Duckworth immediately weighted anchor and sailed for the port , passing St. Thomas on 3 February and though the Mona Passage the following day . On 5 February , the frigate HMS Magicienne under Captain Adam Mackenzie joined the squadron , accompanied by a captured Danish schooner that had recently departed Santo Domingo and whose crew were able to give a precise account of the French squadron at anchor in the harbour . Before the Danish ship had left port , a number of French officers had been concerned that the schooner might reveal details of their presence to the British and had demanded that Leissègues seize and burn the vessel , but the admiral had refused . 
 In the early morning of 6 February 1806 , Duckworth 's scouting frigates sighted Leissègues ' squadron off the port of Santo Domingo . French lookouts reported the British squadron to the admiral , who ordered his ships to sail in a line of battle westwards along the coast , in the direction of Nizao . Duckworth closed with Leissègues ' leading ships in his flagship Superb , followed by Cochrane in Northumberland and Spencer . The rest of the ships formed a second division led by Rear @-@ Admiral Thomas Louis in HMS Canopus , which rapidly fell behind the leading division . At 10 : 10 , Duckworth opened fire on Alexandre , while Northumberland and Spencer engaged the next two French ships in line , Leissègues ' flagship Impérial and Diomède . Within 15 minutes , Alexandre had fallen out of the line , dragging Spencer with her to the south , while Northumberland had suffered severe damage from Impérial 's heavy gun batteries . At 10 : 35 , Louis ' squadron arrived , each ship raking Alexandre as they passed and leaving her dismasted and shattered . Canopus then passed on towards the melee surrounding Impérial while HMS Donegal targeted Brave and HMS Atlas attacked Jupiter , both of which rapidly surrendered , followed shortly afterwards by Alexandre . 
 With the French rear defeated , the remaining British ships focused their attack on Impérial and Diomède , but the intense smoke blocked the British view and caused Atlas to collide with Canopus , while fire from Impérial disabled Northumberland . At 11 : 30 , surrounded by enemies and with escape impossible , Leissègues ' decided to drive his remaining ships on shore rather than surrender . Steering for the beach and closely pursued by Canopus , both Impérial and Diomède were deliberately grounded . With the enemy line destroyed , Duckworth anchored offshore to observe French activity on the grounded ships and conduct hasty repairs . Out of range of British fire , small boats evacuated most of the remaining sailors from Impérial and Diomède , which had lost all their masts and were rapidly filling with water . When Duckworth sent in his frigates on 8 February it was clear that both ships were beyond repair , the British boarding parties removing the remaining 156 crew as prisoners and setting fire to the hulls . British casualties in the engagement had been 74 killed and 264 wounded , while the French total was estimated at 1 @,@ 510 , although accurate counts were not taken in the aftermath of the battle . 
 With his enemy defeated , Duckworth detached Northumberland and HMS Agamemnon to Barbados and took the rest of the squadron to Jamaica with the prizes . There he was acclaimed , and his victory was also celebrated in Britain when the news reached Europe in the brig HMS Kingfisher . Awards were distributed among the officers of the squadron but Duckworth was overlooked : his abandonment of Cadiz and the failure to bring Willaumez to battle in December had earned the enmity of Lord Collingwood , commander in chief of the Mediterranean Fleet , who blocked any awards to his subordinate . Historians William James and William Laird Clowes have both suggested that if Duckworth had not been victorious at San Domingo then he would probably have faced a court martial .

 = = = South Atlantic = = = 
 After outrunning Duckworth on 26 December , Willaumez sailed for the South Atlantic , intending to pass into the Indian Ocean and cruise off the Cape of Good Hope in anticipation of the arrival of the British China Fleet . The China Fleet was a large annual convoy of East Indiamen that originated in Canton and passed through the Malacca Straits , across the Indian Ocean , around the Cape of Good Hope and then north through the Atlantic Ocean , arriving in British waters six to eight months after departure . During the passage , the convoy gathered ships from the various British colonies in the Indian Ocean and by the time it passed the southern tip of Africa it often contained dozens of vessels . By combining the heavy armaments of the East Indiamen with a strong Royal Navy escort , the China Fleet became a formidable target for French raiding squadrons : at the Battle of Pulo Aura in February 1804 , an unescorted China Fleet drove off a powerful French squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Charles @-@ Alexandre Durand Linois after a sharp encounter . 
 Willaumez had planned to resupply his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet , but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting . Turning away from the Cape , Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April , when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies . Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay : Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag in the hope that enemy ships would be lured within range of the port 's gun batteries . On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate <unk> , detached from Willaumez 's squadron in December , anchored in the midst of Popham 's squadron without realising their identity . Hopelessly outnumbered , Captain Bretel had no choice but to surrender , the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold , captured by Willaumez from Redmill 's convoy . 
 = = = Destruction of Linois = = = 
 While Willaumez operated in the South Atlantic , the British squadrons under Strachan and Warren hunted for him hundreds of miles to the north . Warren 's squadron cruised the eastern Atlantic , monitoring the trade routes than ran along the coast of West Africa while Strachan focused on the western Atlantic , particularly the southern approaches to the Caribbean . Although neither was in a position to intercept Willaumez until he began the return journey north , Warren 's position afforded him the opportunity to watch for any French or allied vessels returning to Europe from the East . At 03 : 00 on 16 March 1806 , lookouts on HMS London reported sails to the northeast and Captain Sir Harry Burrard @-@ Neale ordered his ship in pursuit . Although no other ships in the squadron could see anything , Warren gave the order to follow London in case the sails proved to be French . 
 The distant ships were in fact the remains of Linois 's squadron , which had put to sea on 13 March 1803 and operated in the Indian Ocean ever since . There Linois conducted a string of commerce raids that achieved minimal success , hampered by both the lack of naval stores at Île de France and Linois 's hesitation in the face of the enemy . The squadron had missed opportunities at Pulo Aura and the Battle of Vizagapatam in 1804 and against a <unk> escorted by Sir Thomas Troubridge in 1805 . Much reduced by detachments and shipwreck , Linois 's squadron now consisted only of his ship of the line Marengo and the frigate Belle Poule . At 03 : 00 on 13 March , lookouts on Marengo sighted sails to the southwest and despite his officers ' misgivings Linois ordered Marengo to investigate , in the hope that he had discovered another merchant convoy . 
 At 05 : 30 , London and Marengo almost collided in the darkness , Linois recognising the strange ship as a Royal Navy second rate and desperately turning away in an effort to escape . Marengo was too slow and Neale opened fire , rapidly inflicting serious damage to the French flagship . Captain Bruilhac on Belle Poule assisted his admiral for as long as possible , but at 06 : 15 swung away with British frigate HMS Amazon pursuing closely . The fighting continued for another four and a half hours , Linois defending his ship against mounting odds as the rest of Warren 's squadron came into range . To the northeast , Amazon succeeded in catching Belle Poule , the British frigate inflicting serious damage on the French ship as she closed . Unable to escape or continue the fight , both Linois and Bruilhac surrendered at 11 : 00 , although by that time the French admiral had been severely wounded and taken below . French losses were 69 killed and 106 wounded to British casualties of 13 killed and 27 wounded . Following the engagement Warren returned to Britain with his prizes , leaving the eastern half of the Atlantic temporarily unguarded . 
 = = Willaumez in the Caribbean = = 
 At the beginning of April 1806 , Strachan was the only British admiral still hunting for Willaumez 's squadron , following the withdrawal of Duckworth and Warren . Strachan 's squadron was hampered in its movements by the presence of the 98 @-@ gun HMS St George , which was much too slow to operate effectively with Strachan 's fast response force . Returning to Britain in early April to resupply , Strachan detached St George and HMS Centaur ( the new flagship of the Rochefort blockade ) at Plymouth and was joined by three additional ships of the line and two frigates , all fast ships capable of extended operations . In early May , news reached Britain of Willaumez 's stay at Salvador and his subsequent departure in mid @-@ April , and Strachan was again ordered in pursuit , sailing for the West Indies . 
 On leaving Brazil , Willaumez first steered for the French colony of Cayenne , where he divided his ships into three squadrons to increase his raiding operations throughout the West Indies . In May he briefly considered an attack on Carlisle Bay , Barbados , but withdrew claiming that the wind and tide were against him . Cochrane , whose squadron was based at Carlisle Bay , came out in pursuit of the French and almost captured Jérôme Bonaparte in Vétéran with his flagship Northumberland , forcing the French ship to withdraw to Fort @-@ de @-@ France on Martinique on 9 June . Cochrane blockaded the port and was joined by HMS Elephant under Captain George Dundas and HMS Canada under Captain John Harvey , but Northumberland was damaged by a storm and the British temporarily withdrew to Saint Lucia , allowing Éole and Impétueux to reach Fort @-@ de @-@ France on 15 June . Over the following week the rest of Willaumez 's squadron joined Vétéran , ignoring Cochrane 's efforts to intercept his ships as they entered the harbour . 
 On 1 July Willaumez left Fort @-@ de @-@ France with two ships and sailed to Montserrat , seizing three merchant ships in the harbour . The British governor on Montserrat sent urgent messages to Nevis and St. Kitts , where the authorities hastily evacuated a 65 @-@ ship convoy anchored at Sandy Point under the meagre protection of the 28 @-@ gun frigate HMS Carysfort . However , 13 ships from other harbours missed the warning and on 3 July four ships that had detached from Willaumez 's squadron the day before descended on the islands , seizing four vessels on Nevis and attacking the remaining nine that had gathered under Brimstone Hill . There gunfire from the Brimstone Hill batteries drove off the attacking French ships . On 4 July Willaumez rejoined the squadron from Montserrat with news that the annual Jamaica convoy , a large collection of merchant ships that sailed each year from the Caribbean to Britain during the summer , was anchored off Tortola . Cochrane had already recognised the danger to the Jamaica squadron and had overtaken Willaumez while he was at Montserrat , waiting for the French squadron off St. Thomas with four ships of the line and four frigates . On 6 July Willaumez sighted Cochrane south @-@ east of St. Thomas and , heeding his orders from Napoleon not to risk battle , turned away and passed between St. Thomas and the Passage Islands . With the French driven off , Cochrane sailed to Tortola where nearly 300 ships had gathered to prepare the convoy for the journey to Europe . 
 Frustrated in his efforts to intercept the convoy at anchor , Willaumez determined to meet it at sea , sailing to the Bahama Banks . There he waited for the convoy , seizing any ships that came within sight of his squadron , including neutral vessels , in case they revealed his position . For several weeks Willaumez 's lookouts saw nothing , the British holding the convoy back until they obtained some information about the location of the French squadron . During the night of 31 July , bored with waiting for the convoy , Captain Jérôme Bonaparte sailed northwards away from the squadron , acting without orders or even notifying his admiral . When dawn broke on 1 August , Willaumez was panicked by the disappearance of Vétéran and , assuming that the ship had somehow been accidentally separated , began to search for the missing vessel and its important commander . 
 While Willaumez was distracted by his missing ship , Cochrane had finished preparing the convoy . Unable to delay its departure any longer , he sent 109 large merchant ships eastwards under the protection of one small ship of the line , two frigates and two sloops , a significantly inferior force to the one under Willaumez . The convoy passed across Willaumez 's cruising ground during August while the French admiral was to the north searching for Vétéran , and by the time the he returned the convoy was far to the east , was well on its journey to Britain . Willaumez 's absence also meant that he missed a potential encounter with Admiral Warren , who had returned to the Atlantic in search of Willaumez following his victory over Linois in March . Warren had sailed from Spithead on 4 June and by 12 July had anchored at Barbados . During August he searched for Willaumez in the eastern Bahamas but failed to discover the French squadron , which at that time was still searching for Vétéran far to the north . 
 = = Hurricane = = 
 With his squadron unexpectedly depleted , his principal target escaped and food supplies running low , Willaumez decided to begin the final stage of his cruise and sail for Newfoundland , thereby escaping pursuit from Cochrane and Warren and preying on the convoys and fishing fleets that crossed the area . Turning northwards on 18 August , Willaumez was at 22 ° N 63 ° W , 324 nautical miles ( 600 km ) north @-@ east of Puerto Rico , when his squadron was struck by a fierce hurricane . When the storm abated , Willaumez found that his flagship Foudroyant was badly damaged and entirely alone . Rigging jury masts , Foudroyant began slowly limping for the Spanish port of Havana on Cuba , where she could make the repairs needed for the journey back to France . For nearly a month Willaumez encountered nothing , but on 15 September , with Havana in sight , the heavy British frigate HMS Anson under Captain Charles Lydiard appeared . Willaumez sent a boat into Havana for assistance as the frigate approached and at 13 : 15 Lydiard opened fire . Although Foudroyant was far larger than Anson she was significantly damaged and incapable of rapid manoeuvres , which gave Lydiard some hope of capturing her . However the fire of Willaumez 's flagship proved too strong and at 13 : 45 Anson sheered away with two men killed and eight wounded . Spanish ships , including the ship of the line San Lorenzo came out to assist Foudroyant and within a few hours she was safely anchored in the heavily fortified harbour . 
 The rest of Willaumez 's squadron was less successful in their attempts to reach safety . All were badly damaged and most had been blown north @-@ west towards the Eastern Seaboard of the United States . There they encountered Strachan 's squadron , which had passed through the Bahamas while Willaumez searched for Vétéran and been 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ) from Willaumez when they were caught in the same hurricane that had dispersed the French squadron . Less damaged than their opponents , Strachan 's ships began gathering off Chesapeake Bay with the intention of continuing their search once temporary repairs had been completed . On 14 September the ships of the line HMS Belleisle under Captain William Hargood , HMS Bellona under Captain John Erskine Douglas and the frigate HMS Melampus under Captain Stephen Poyntz were cruising off Cape Henry in search of Strachan 's flagship HMS Caesar when they spotted a ship sailing under jury masts to the southwest . Closing to investigate , they discovered that the stranger was the French ship Impétueux , left in a dismasted and leaking state by the hurricane and desperately attempting to reach a harbour in the United States . Commodore Alain @-@ Joseph Le <unk> @-@ Belair immediately steered Impétueux towards the coast to avoid the unequal combat and drove his ship on shore at 08 : 15 . Although Impétueux was now on United States soil , Melampus opened fire , the attack followed at 10 : 00 by boats from Belleisle and Bellona . Boarding parties seized Impétueux but the appearance of two sails on the horizon , later discovered to be British , convinced Hargood to abandon the wreck to Melampus . By 20 : 00 the remaining French crew had been taken aboard the frigate as prisoners and Poyntz gave orders for the wreck to be burnt . 
 The destruction of Impétueux on United States territory prompted complaints from the French consul at Norfolk , Virginia and from the captains of Éole and Patriote , which had sheltered in Annapolis following the storm . Badly damaged by the high winds , repairs on Patriote took over a year , Commodore Joseph @-@ Hyacinthe @-@ Isidore <unk> waiting until 16 December 1807 to make the journey back to France . He arrived at Ile d 'Aix on 17 January 1808 , narrowly avoiding the blockade squadron under Strachan that was temporarily out of position to take on fresh supplies . Éole was never repaired : the difficulty in obtaining the required naval stores proved too great and she was broken up at Annapolis in 1811 . Another ship that never returned to France was the frigate <unk> , which sheltered in the Delaware River following the hurricane but was later forced to sail up river to Philadelphia to avoid attacks by British raiding parties . As with Éole , repairs proved too complex and <unk> was also broken up some years later . The flagship Foudroyant did succeed in returning to France , sailing from Havana late in 1806 and arriving at Brest in February 1807 . 
 Of the original squadron only two ships returned to France immediately : Vétéran had separated before the storm and Captain Bonaparte , assisted by a specially selected veteran crew , managed to intercept a convoy travelling from Quebec to Britain escorted only by the 22 @-@ gun HMS Champion under Captain Robert Howe Bromley on 10 August . Although Bromley made a desperate attempt to draw off the French ship of the line , Vétéran ignored the small escort ship and seized six merchant vessels , setting them on fire . Champion and the transport Osborne escaped , accompanied by nine other merchant ships . On 26 August 26 days after he deserted Willaumez 's squadron , Bonaparte was nearing the French coast when he was chased by the 80 @-@ gun HMS Gibraltar under Captain Willoughby Lake and the frigates HMS Penelope and HMS Tribune under Captains William Robert Broughton and Thomas Baker . Closely pursued , the reliable officers placed under Bonaparte abandoned the intended destination of Lorient and instead used their expert local knowledge to direct Vétéran to the tiny port of <unk> , the first time a ship of the line had ever successfully anchored in the harbour . Although another captain might have been court martialed for abandoning his admiral without orders or permission , the Emperor 's brother was instead praised for intercepting the Quebec convoy and promoted soon afterwards . The other surviving ship of Willaumez 's squadron was <unk> , which passed through the hurricane relatively intact and made its way to Europe alone , arriving at Rochefort several weeks later . 
 = = Minor operations = = 
 In addition to the squadrons of Willaumez , Leissègues and Linois , the French authorities sent several other forces into the Atlantic during the campaign ; either separate operations intended to pass unnoticed under the cover of the major campaign or deliberate diversionary expeditions to draw British forces away from the main theatre of operations . The first of these was L 'Hermite 's expedition , a expedition to West Africa under Commodore Jean @-@ Marthe @-@ Adrien L 'Hermite that had sailed from Lorient towards the end of the Trafalgar campaign with orders to attack undefended merchant shipping off West Africa and await reinforcements under Jérôme Bonaparte . Before Bonaparte could sail , the Battle of Trafalgar changed the strategic situation and the reinforcements were never despatched . L 'Hermite conducted an effective but minor raiding operation of his own , cruising off West Africa and capturing a number of merchant ships and slave ships , eventually sailing for Cayenne and then back to France in September 1806 . A second force was less planned and more opportunistic : Lamellerie 's expedition was drawn from frigates that had survived the Battle of Trafalgar and were sheltering in Cadiz . Duckworth withdrew from the blockade of Cadiz in November 1805 , and inadequate replacements were provided by Collingwood . In February 1806 , a British plan to lure the French squadron out of port by withdrawing all of the available forces except the frigate HMS Hydra and a brig backfired when a storm blew Hydra out of position on 26 February 1806 and La Meillerie escaped with four frigates and a brig . Hydra gave chase , and La Meillerie abandoned the slower brig to avoid combat with the British frigate , eventually escaping with his remaining ships . La Meillerie 's expedition then visited Senegal and Cayenne , failing to make any impact on British merchant shipping despite orders to commerce raid when possible . After four months , La Meillerie decided to return to France , reaching the Bay of Biscay on in July 1806 . 
 As well as the squadrons under Warren and Strachan , the British authorities had deployed additional forces in response to the French operations , in particular with the intention of intercepting and capturing Willaumez during his return journey to France . To this end , Rear @-@ Admiral Louis was given a squadron to patrol in the English Channel and Admiral William Cornwallis maintained a powerful force off Brest , which was so successful in cutting off the seaport that L 'Hermite 's Régulus was the only ship of the line to enter or leave the port during 1806 . Other squadrons were stationed off the remaining French Biscay ports , including a force of five ships of the line under Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats off Rochefort . One of Keats ' ships , HMS Mars under Captain Robert Dudley Oliver was able to intercept La Meillerie 's squadron on his return journey and capture the frigate Rhin on 17 July . 
 In September , Keats was replaced off Rochefort by Commodore Sir Samuel Hood , who achieved a significant success when he intercepted a French squadron of seven frigates and corvettes under Commodore Eleonore @-@ Jean @-@ Nicolas Soleil sailing from Rochefort to the French West Indies with supplies and reinforcements at the Action of 25 September 1806 . Hood , commanding six ships of the line , sighted Soleil 's force at 01 : 00 on 25 September , within hours of it leaving Rochefort . Giving chase , conditions suited Hood 's larger ships and by 04 : 00 Soleil recognised that he would be caught by the advancing British and detached three ships southwards and one to the north , retaining three others to delay the approaching British squadron , which had become separated during the pursuit . Engaging the lead ship , HMS Monarch under Captain Richard Lee , Soleil ordered his frigates to target her rigging in the hope of slowing Monarch 's advance and escaping . Monarch was damaged in the battle , but remained in contact with the French long enough that Hood 's flagship HMS Centaur and later HMS Mars could come up and join the engagement . In all four of the French frigates were captured , including the vessel sent north , which was caught by Mars . British casualties were nine killed and 29 wounded , the latter including Hood , who lost an arm . 
 L 'Hermite 's force had been caught in the same hurricane that had dispersed Willaumez , and as a result his ships were scattered and damaged on 20 August , one frigate joining the remains of Willaumez 's squadron in the United States and the others limping back to France . Most succeeded in slipping through the British blockade independently , including Régulus , which arrived at Brest on 5 October , but one ship was less successful : on 27 September 1806 the frigate Président became the final French casualty of the campaign when it was trapped in the Bay of Biscay by Louis ' squadron . Closed in from all sides , the approach of Louis ' flagship Canopus convinced Captain Labrosse that continued resistance was impossible and he struck his colours without a fight . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Although Allemand led a minor expedition from Brest to Toulon in 1808 , and the Brest fleet under Willaumez made a determined if ineffectual effort to break into the Atlantic in early 1809 which ended at the Battle of Basque Roads , there were no other large scale naval campaigns fought in the Atlantic Ocean during the Napoleonic Wars . Minor operations by individual French ships and small squadrons continued , but the losses of 1805 and 1806 , combined with the barring of Spanish ports after the Dos de Mayo Uprising and the seizure of much of the French West Indies in 1809 , reduced both the need and the ability of the French to operate on a large scale in the Atlantic : Lord Barham recognised this when he commented on hearing the news of the victory at San Domingo that it " puts us out off all fear from another predatory war in the West Indies " . 
 In Britain the campaign emphasised the important lesson previously demonstrated in the Trafalgar campaign of the year before , that it was immensely difficult in the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean to detect and intercept French squadrons at sea : only off their own harbours and in the confined waters of the Caribbean were they vulnerable to detection and attack by British squadrons . The inadequate size and power of convoy escorts and the expense in resources employed in chasing French squadrons at sea meant that British trade was placed at risk by the depredations of independent French squadrons , and the maintenance of a tight blockade was essential . The British grip on French maritime travel was a constant source of irritation to Napoleon , who instigated a massive shipbuilding program with the intention of breaking the blockade : by 1808 he was able to muster over 80 ships of the line against the British blockade squadrons . 
 = Cyrus B. Comstock = 
 Cyrus Ballou Comstock ( February 3 , 1831 – May 29 , 1910 ) was a career officer in the Regular Army of the United States . After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1855 , Comstock served with the Army Corps of Engineers . At the beginning of the American Civil War , he assisted with the fortification of Washington , D.C. In 1862 , he was transferred to the field , eventually becoming chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac . In 1863 during the Siege of Vicksburg , he served as the chief engineer of the Army of the Tennessee . 
 The most significant phase of Comstock 's career began in November 1864 when he was appointed to the staff of Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant , becoming Grant 's senior aide @-@ de @-@ camp . In 1865 , Comstock was appointed the senior engineer in the assault on Fort Fisher , North Carolina , and the assault on Mobile , Alabama , both of which were successful . By the end of the war , Comstock had earned the awards of the honorary grades of brevet major general in the Volunteer Army and brevet brigadier general in the Regular Army . 
 After the close of the war , Comstock served on the military commission for the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln . He was dismissed from the commission for his criticism of the proceedings . Later Comstock continued with the Army Corps of Engineers , took part in several engineering projects , and served on the Mississippi River Commission , of which he was president .

 Born in Wrentham , Massachusetts , to Nathan and Betsy Comstock on February 3 , 1831 , Cyrus Comstock attended the United States Military Academy at West Point . He graduated first in his class in 1855 . Following his graduation , Comstock was assigned to the Army Corps of Engineers and assisted with the design and construction of several fortifications . He also served as an instructor of engineering at West Point .

 At the commencement of the Civil War , Comstock , then holding the rank of first lieutenant in the Regular Army , was transferred from West Point to Washington , D.C. He became an assistant to Brig. Gen. John G. Barnard , the engineer in charge of the fortifications of Washington and later chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac . 
 = = = Army of the Potomac = = = 
 When the Army of the Potomac took the field in the spring of 1862 during Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan 's Peninsular Campaign , Comstock continued to serve as Barnard 's assistant . On June 1 , 1862 , during the Peninsular Campaign , Comstock was appointed chief engineer of the II Corps . He continued with the Army of the Potomac through the remainder of the Peninsular Campaign and through the Maryland Campaign . 
 Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside succeeded McClellan and appointed Comstock the chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac . During the Fredericksburg Campaign , Comstock was faced with the difficult task of constructing pontoon bridges over the Rappahannock River , a debacle which proved to be one of the most challenging of his career . Due to confusion in Washington , D.C. at the War Department , the materials necessary for the construction of the bridges did not arrive at Falmouth , Virginia at the same time as the Army of the Potomac . Despite Comstock 's urgent telegraphs and messages , which went unanswered , it took nearly a month for the pontoons to arrive during which time the Union army had completely lost the element of surprise , the Confederate army had dug in at Fredericksburg , Virginia and morale within the Army of the Potomac had sunk . When the material for the bridges finally did arrive , Comstock personally led men from the 50th New York Engineers in seeing to the task of construction . In piecing together the bridges on the Rappahannock River , Comstock and other soldiers were dangerously exposed to enemy fire . 
 When Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker reorganized the Army of the Potomac in the spring of 1863 , Comstock was removed as chief engineer of that army and placed in command of a battalion of engineers . In that capacity , he played an important role in the Battle of Chancellorsville , overseeing the construction of pontoon bridges over various rivers which first allowed the advance of the Army of the Potomac and later facilitated its retreat after Union forces were defeated . 
 = = = Siege of Vicksburg = = = 
 After the Battle of Chancellorsville , Comstock was transferred to the Army of the Tennessee which was , at that time , involved in the Siege of Vicksburg , Mississippi , under the command of Maj. Gen. Ulysses Grant . Comstock arrived at Vicksburg in June 1863 and set to work on improving the siege works . His efforts earned Grant 's respect . Comstock was soon promoted to major and appointed chief engineer of the Army of the Tennessee . The Siege of Vicksburg was successful , in part due to Comstock 's supervision of the overall siege works , and the city surrendered to Union forces on July 4 , 1863 . This victory marked a major turning point in the war as the Union Army gained control of the Mississippi River . The impression that Comstock made on Grant would have a significant impact on Comstock 's career later in the war . 
 Comstock remained with the Army of the Tennessee into the fall of 1863 . On November 19 , he became assistant inspector general of the Department of the Mississippi and promoted to lieutenant colonel of volunteers . He served in this role until March 1864 . 
 = = = General Grant 's staff = = = 
 On March 12 , 1864 , Grant was appointed general @-@ in @-@ chief of the United States Army and moved his headquarters to the eastern theater in Virginia . Grant asked Comstock to come with him as his senior aide @-@ de @-@ camp . Grant determined to command in the field , following and directing the movements of the Army of the Potomac in a major offensive during the summer of 1864 known as the Overland Campaign . During the campaign , Comstock played a key role in coordinating the movements of the various corps of the army and personally conveying Grant 's orders to the corps commanders . His efforts were particularly successful during the Battle of the Wilderness for which Comstock won a commendation from Grant and a brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army . 
 Comstock was temporarily detached from Grant 's staff and appointed by Grant to the post of chief engineer of the Department of North Carolina in January 1865 . The transfer was prompted by Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler 's failure to take Fort Fisher in December 1864 . The fort was the last Confederate stronghold on the east coast . Serving under the command of Maj. Gen. Alfred Terry , Comstock assisted in planning a second and successful assault on Fort Fisher . Following this victory , Comstock was awarded the grade of brevet colonel in the Regular Army . Comstock also was nominated by President Abraham Lincoln on January 23 , 1865 for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general , U.S. Volunteers , to rank from January 15 , 1865 , for gallant services in the capture of Fort Fisher and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on February 14 , 1865 . He returned to Virginia and to his role as Grant 's senior aide , but did not remain long . 
 In March 1865 , Grant again dispatched Comstock to aid in a key siege operation — this time to Mobile , Alabama , the last Confederate stronghold on the Gulf of Mexico . There Comstock served under Maj. Gen. Edward Canby and assisted in operations leading to the surrender of Mobile after the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakely in April 1865 . While Comstock was serving in Alabama , Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant after the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse , essentially ending the Civil War . On January 13 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson nominated Comstock for the award of the honorary grade of brevet major general , U.S. Volunteers , to rank from March 26 , 1865 , for faithful and meritorious services during the campaign against the city of Mobile and its defenses , and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on March 12 , 1866 . On April 10 , 1866 , President Andrew Johnson nominated Comstock for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general , U.S. Army , ( Regular Army ) , to rank from March 13 , 1865 , for gallant and meritorious services in the campaign ending with the capture of Mobile , Alabama , and the U.S. Senate confirmed the award on May 4 , 1866 .

 In May 1865 , while still serving on Grant 's staff , Comstock was called to serve as one of the nine military commissioners to oversee the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . At first , Comstock was eager to see the prosecution of the conspirators , writing that , for them , " death is too good . " However , as the trial proceeded , Comstock became disturbed by the secrecy of the military proceedings . Concerned about the violation of the defendants ' rights , he began to openly argue for the case to be transferred to a civilian court . President Andrew Johnson removed Comstock from the commission due to Comstock 's protests . The rationale for the removal , as explained to Comstock by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , was that Grant had also been a potential target of the conspirators and the commissioners felt that Comstock , due to his closeness to Grant , could not be counted on to act impartially .

 Comstock served on Grant 's staff until 1866 , then returned to service with the Corps of Engineers and remained on active duty until 1895 when he retired with the rank of colonel .

 = Nuremberg Laws = 
 The Nuremberg Laws ( German : <unk> Gesetze ) were antisemitic laws in Nazi Germany . They were introduced on 15 September 1935 by the Reichstag at a special meeting convened at the annual Nuremberg Rally of the Nazi Party ( NSDAP ) . The two laws were the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour , which forbade marriages and extramarital intercourse between Jews and Germans and the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households , and the Reich Citizenship Law , which declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens ; the remainder were classed as state subjects , without citizenship rights . A supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November , and the Reich Citizenship Law officially came into force on that date . The laws were expanded on 26 November to include Romani people and Afro @-@ Germans . Out of foreign policy concerns , prosecutions under the two laws did not commence until after the 1936 Summer Olympics , held in Berlin . 
 After they seized power in 1933 , the Nazis began to implement their policies , which included the formation of a Volksgemeinschaft ( people 's community ) based on race . Chancellor and Führer ( leader ) Adolf Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses on 1 April 1933 , and the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service , passed on 7 April , excluded most Jews from the legal profession and civil service . Books considered un @-@ German , including those by Jewish authors , were destroyed in a nationwide book burning on 10 May . Jewish citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks . They were actively suppressed , stripped of their citizenship and civil rights , and eventually completely removed from German society . 
 The Nuremberg laws had a serious economic and social impact on the Jewish community . Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned , and ( subsequent to 8 March 1938 ) upon completing their sentences were re @-@ arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps . Non @-@ Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish @-@ owned stores , many of which closed due to lack of customers . As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government @-@ regulated professions such as medicine and education , many middle class , business owners , and professionals were forced to take menial employment . Emigration was problematic , as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country . By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them . Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out , and starting in mid @-@ 1941 , the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe . The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million people , and estimates of the number of Romani killed in the Porajmos range from 150 @,@ 000 to 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the formation of the German Empire in 1871 , the legal status of Jews varied from place to place within the German Confederation and the Kingdom of Prussia . Jews became equal citizens with the creation of the new constitution that soon followed . However , they still faced discrimination and antisemitism . Nationalist sentiments and the idea of Germans as a separate race took hold at the beginning of the 20th century . Jews , with their different culture and ancestry , were viewed ( particularly by proponents of the Völkisch movement ) as being members of a separate and inferior race . Several nationalistic and antisemitic groups ( some with memberships of hundreds of thousands of people ) formed after the First World War . These groups committed acts of violence against Jews and lobbied for their disenfranchisement and removal from German society . 
 The National Socialist German Workers ' Party ( NSDAP ; Nazi Party ) was one of several far @-@ right political parties active in Germany at the time . The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic , rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , radical antisemitism , and anti @-@ Bolshevism . They promised a strong central government , increased Lebensraum ( living space ) for Germanic peoples , formation of a ' Volksgemeinschaft ( people 's community ) based on race , and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews , who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights . The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the Völkisch movement . 
 = = = Nazi eugenics and racial belief = = = 
 Nazi racial beliefs arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of race such as Arthur de Gobineau , who published a four @-@ volume work titled An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races ( translated into German in 1897 ) . In it , de Gobineau proposed that the Aryan race was superior , and urged the preservation of its cultural and racial purity . Houston Stewart Chamberlain 's work The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century ( 1900 ) , one of the first to combine Social Darwinism with antisemitism , describes history as a struggle for survival between the Germanic peoples and the Jews , whom he characterized as an inferior and dangerous group . The two @-@ volume book Foundations of Human Hereditary Teaching and Racial Hygiene ( 1920 – 21 ) by Eugen Fischer , Erwin Baur , and Fritz Lenz , used pseudoscientific studies to conclude that the Germans were superior to the Jews intellectually and physically , and recommended eugenics as a solution . Madison Grant 's work The Passing of the Great Race ( 1916 ) advocated Nordicism and proposed using a eugenic program to preserve the Nordic race . After reading the book , Hitler called it " my Bible " . The Nazis embraced the concept of Nordicism and wished for the Nordic race to dominate Germany , but they did not discriminate against Aryans who did not have Nordic physical characteristics . 
 While imprisoned in 1924 after the failed Beer Hall Putsch , Hitler dictated Mein Kampf to his deputy , Rudolf Hess . The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler 's ideology in which he laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race . In it he outlined his belief in Jewish Bolshevism , a conspiracy theory that posited the existence of an international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people . Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his world view as expounded in Mein Kampf . The NSDAP advocated the concept of a Volksgemeinschaft ( " people 's community " ) with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades , whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a foreign race ( <unk> ) . 
 = = Nazi Germany = = 
 Discrimination against Jews intensified after the NSDAP seized power ; following a month @-@ long series of attacks by members of the Sturmabteilung ( SA ; paramilitary wing of the NSDAP ) on Jewish businesses , synagogues , and members of the legal profession , on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a national boycott of Jewish businesses . By 1933 , many people who were not NSDAP members advocated segregating Jews from the rest of German society . The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service , passed on 7 April 1933 , forced all non @-@ Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service . Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise . In 1934 , the NSDAP published a pamphlet titled " <unk> <unk> ? " ( " Why the Aryan Law ? " ) , which summarized the perceived need for the law . As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life , members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un @-@ German , and a nationwide book burning was held on 10 May . Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country . Legislation passed in July 1933 stripped naturalised German Jews of their citizenship , creating a legal basis for recent immigrants ( particularly Eastern European Jews ) to be deported . Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews . Throughout 1933 and 1934 , Jewish businesses were denied access to markets , forbidden to advertise in newspapers , and deprived of access to government contracts . Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks . 
 Laws promulgated in this period that were not aimed directly at Jews included the Law for the Prevention of <unk> Diseased Offspring ( passed on 14 July 1933 ) , which called for the compulsory sterilisation of people with a range of hereditary , physical , and mental illnesses . Under the Law against Dangerous Habitual Criminals ( passed 24 November 1935 ) , habitual criminals were forced to undergo sterilisation as well . This law was also used to force the incarceration in prison or Nazi concentration camps of " social misfits " such as the chronically unemployed , prostitutes , beggars , alcoholics , homeless vagrants , and Romani people . 
 = = = " The Jewish problem " = = = 
 Disenchanted with the unfulfilled promise of the NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society , SA members were eager to lash out against the Jewish minority as a way of expressing their frustrations . A Gestapo report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the " Jewish problem ... from below that the government would then have to follow " . Assaults , vandalism , and boycotts against Jews , which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934 , increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised at the highest levels of government . Most non @-@ party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety . The Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka argues that there was a disparity between the views of the Alte Kämpfer ( longtime party members ) and the general public , but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935 . The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation . 
 The Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick announced on 25 July that a law forbidding marriages between Jews and non @-@ Jews would shortly be promulgated , and recommended that registrars should avoid issuing licenses for such marriages for the time being . The draft law also called for a ban on marriage for persons with hereditary illnesses . 
 Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , the Economics Minister and Reichsbank president , criticised the violent behaviour of the Alte Kämpfer and SA because of its negative impact on the economy . The violence also had a negative impact on Germany 's reputation in the international community . For these reasons , Hitler ordered a stop to " individual actions " against German Jews on 8 August 1935 , and the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick threatened to take legal action against Party members who ignored the order . From Hitler 's perspective , it was imperative to quickly bring in new antisemitic laws to appease the radical elements in the NSDAP who persisted in attempting to remove the Jews from German society by violent means . A conference of ministers was held on 20 August 1935 to discuss the question . Hitler argued against violent methods because of the damage being done to the economy , and insisted the matter must be settled through legislation . The focus of the new laws would be marriage laws to prevent " racial defilement " , stripping Jews of their German citizenship , and laws to prevent Jews from participating freely in the economy . 
 = = = Events at Nuremberg = = = 
 The seventh annual Nazi Party Rally , held in Nuremberg from 10 – 16 September 1935 , featured the only Reichstag session held outside Berlin during the Nazi regime . Hitler decided that the rally would be a good opportunity to introduce the long @-@ awaited anti @-@ Jewish laws . In a speech on 12 September , leading Nazi physician Gerhard Wagner announced that the government would soon introduce a " law for the protection of German blood " . The next day , Hitler summoned the Reichstag to meet in session at Nuremberg on 15 September , the last day of the rally . Franz Albrecht <unk> and Bernhard <unk> of the Interior Ministry were summoned to Nuremberg and directed to start preparing a draft of a law forbidding sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non @-@ Jews . The two men arrived on 14 September . That evening , Hitler ordered them to also have ready by morning a draft of the Reich citizenship law . Hitler found the initial drafts of the Blood Law to be too lenient , so at around midnight Frick brought him four new drafts that differed mainly in the severity of the penalties they imposed . Hitler chose the most lenient version , but left vague the definition of who was a Jew . Hitler stated at the rally that the laws were " an attempt at the legal settlement of a problem , which , if this proved a failure , would have to be entrusted by law to the National Socialist Party for a definitive solution . " Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels had the radio broadcast of the passing of the laws cut short , and ordered the German media to not mention them until a decision was made as to how they would be implemented .

 The two Nuremberg Laws were unanimously passed by the Reichstag on 15 September 1935 . The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour prohibited marriages and extramarital intercourse between Jews and Germans , and forbade the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households . The Reich Citizenship Law declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens ; the remainder were classed as state subjects , without citizenship rights . The wording in the Citizenship Law that a person must prove " by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich " meant that political opponents could also be stripped of their German citizenship . Over the coming years , an additional 13 supplementary laws were promulgated that further marginalised the Jewish community in Germany . 
 = = = Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour = = = 
 Moved by the understanding that purity of German blood is the essential condition for the continued existence of the German people , and inspired by the inflexible determination to ensure the existence of the German nation for all time , the Reichstag has unanimously adopted the following law , which is promulgated herewith : 
 Article 1 
 Marriages between Jews and subjects of the state of German or related blood are forbidden . Marriages nevertheless concluded are invalid , even if concluded abroad to circumvent this law . 
 Annulment proceedings can be initiated only by the state prosecutor . 
 Article 2 
 <unk> relations between Jews and subjects of the state of German or related blood are forbidden . 
 Article 3 
 Jews may not employ in their households female subjects of the state of German or related blood who are under 45 years old . 
 Article 4 
 Jews are forbidden to fly the Reich or national flag or display Reich colours . 
 They are , on the other hand , permitted to display the Jewish colours . The exercise of this right is protected by the state . 
 Article 5 
 Any person who violates the prohibition under Article 1 will be punished with prison with hard labour [ <unk> ] . 
 A male who violates the prohibition under Article 2 will be punished with prison [ Gefängnis ] or prison with hard labour . 
 Any person violating the provisions under Articles 3 or 4 will be punished with prison with hard labour for up to one year and a fine , or with one or the other of these penalties .

 While both the Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons with three or more Jewish grandparents would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one ( Mischlinge of the second degree ) would not , a debate arose as to the status of persons with two Jewish grandparents ( Mischlinge of the first degree ) . The NSDAP , especially its more radical elements , wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree . For this reason Hitler continued to stall , and did not make a decision until early November 1935 . His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish ; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse . The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November , and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date . Jews were no longer German citizens and did not have the right to vote . Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date . A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state @-@ regulated professions such as medicine and education . 
 While Frick 's suggestion that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would have to prove that they were Aryan was not acted upon , proving one 's racial heritage became a necessary part of daily life . Non @-@ government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an Aryan paragraph excluding both Mischlinge and Jews from employment . Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an Aryan certificate . One form was to acquire an <unk> , which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent . The <unk> could also be acquired by citizens of other countries , as long as they were of " German or related blood " . 
 Under the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour ( 15 September 1935 ) , marriages were forbidden between Jews and Germans ; between Mischlinge of the first degree and Germans ; between Jews and Mischlinge of the second degree ; and between two Mischlinge of the second degree . Mischlinge of the first degree were permitted to marry Jews , but they would henceforth be classed as Jewish themselves . All marriages undertaken between half @-@ Jews and Germans required the approval of a Committee for the Protection of German Blood . Few such permissions were granted . A supplementary decree issued on 26 November 1935 extended the law to " Gypsies , Negroes , and their bastards . " Estimates of the death toll of Romani people in the Porajmos range from 150 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 Persons suspected of having sexual relations with non @-@ Aryans were charged with Rassenschande ( racial defilement ) and tried in the regular courts . Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours , co @-@ workers , or other informants . Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime . Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms , and ( subsequent to 8 March 1938 ) upon completing their sentences were re @-@ arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps . As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement , special courts were convened to allow the death penalty for some cases . From the end of 1935 through 1940 , 1 @,@ 911 people were convicted of Rassenschande . Over time , the law was extended to include non @-@ sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace . 
 For the most part , Germans accepted the Nuremberg Laws , partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race , but also because to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo . Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed . Non @-@ Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish @-@ owned stores . Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors . The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws . Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws , the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics , held in Berlin that August . 
 The Interior Ministry estimated there were 750 @,@ 000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 ( studies done after the war put the number of Mischlinge at around 200 @,@ 000 ) . As Jews became more and more excluded from German society , they organised social events , schools , and activities of their own . Economic problems were not so easily solved , however ; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers . This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process ( the transfer of Jewish firms to non @-@ Jewish owners , usually at prices far below market value ) that the regime had initiated in 1933 , which intensified after the Nuremberg laws were passed . Former middle @-@ class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families , and many were unable to find work at all . 
 Although a stated goal of the Nazis was that all Jews should leave the country , emigration was problematic , as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country . Anyone caught transferring their money overseas were sentenced to lengthy terms in prison as " economic saboteurs " . An exception was money sent to Palestine under the terms of the Haavara Agreement , whereby Jews could transfer their wealth and emigrate to that country . Around 52 @,@ 000 Jews emigrated to Palestine under the terms of this agreement between 1933 and 1939 . 
 By the start of the Second World War in 1939 , around 250 @,@ 000 of Germany 's 437 @,@ 000 Jews had emigrated to the United States , Palestine , Great Britain , and other countries . By 1938 it was becoming almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them . After the 1936 – 39 Arab revolt , the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilize the region . Nationalistic and xenophobic people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants , especially poverty @-@ stricken ones . The Madagascar Plan , a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar , proved to be impossible to carry out . Starting in mid @-@ 1941 , the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe . The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million people .

 Some of the allies of the Nazis passed their own versions of the Nuremberg laws . In 1938 , Fascist Italy passed the Italian Racial Laws , which stripped Jews of their citizenship and forbade marriages between Jewish and non @-@ Jewish Italians . Hungary passed laws on 28 May 1938 and 5 May 1939 banning Jews from various professions . A third law , added in August 1941 , defined Jews as anyone with at least two Jewish grandparents , and forbade sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non @-@ Jews . In 1940 the ruling Iron Guard in Romania passed the Law Defining the Legal Status of Romanian Jews , in 1941 the Codex <unk> was enacted in Slovakia , in 1941 Bulgaria passed the Law for Protection of the Nation , and in 1941 the <unk> in Croatia passed legislation defining who was a Jew and restricting contact with them .

 = Castle Park , Bristol = 
 Castle Park ( sometimes referred to as Castle Green ) is a public open space in Bristol , England , managed by Bristol City Council . It is bounded by the Floating Harbour and Castle Street to the south , Lower Castle Street to the east , and Broad Weir , Newgate and Wine Street to the north . Its western boundary is less obviously defined and has been the subject of controversy , perhaps because the area around High Street and St Mary @-@ le @-@ Port Church , though not part of the park and always intended for development , is often considered at the same time as the park . The park was completed and opened on 30 September 1978 , and occupies most of the site which had contained Bristol 's main shopping area . Much of this area was heavily damaged in the Blitz during the Second World War , and that which remained was subsequently demolished . 
 The ruined tower of St Mary @-@ le @-@ Port church stands to the west of the park , surrounded by derelict financial office buildings . Adjoining the ruins of St Peter 's church in the middle of the park is a sensory herb garden , and five silver birch trees as a memorial to the beaches of the D @-@ Day landings . To the east is a grassy arena , and the partially excavated remains of Bristol Castle with a preserved vaulted chamber . There is also a bandstand and a children 's play area . 
 Tree @-@ lined St Peter 's Square , to the north of St Peter 's church , has been home to various events including German Christmas markets . In recent summers a tethered balloon has been placed near the bandstand , offering ascents to sightseers . 
 Recent attempts to develop the area between the park 's western edge and High Street have proved controversial ; Bristol City Council are keen to replace derelict buildings with a mixed @-@ use development to help reconnect the Old City to Broadmead and raise funds to improve the park ; others would rather see the park extended to High Street . 
 = = History = = 
 The town of Bristol was settled at some time in the Anglo @-@ Saxon period on the northern or Mercian side of a crossing point of the River Avon , at or near to the present Bristol Bridge . The town lay entirely between the Avon and the Frome , which at that time emerged into the Avon just downstream of Bristol Bridge . 
 Archaeological excavations of the area in 1962 @-@ 1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred to the east of St Peter 's Church , with Mary @-@ le @-@ Port on its western limit . The building of Bristol Castle in the latter part of the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west , where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on the crossroads of High Street , Wine Street , Broad Street and Corn Street . The area around Mary @-@ le @-@ Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city . Bristol Castle was home to the Norman garrison , and was a massive structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London . The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today 's Castle park , from just east of St Peter 's Church to Lower Castle Street . 
 In 1612 Robert Aldworth , Mayor of Bristol , rebuilt St Peter 's Hospital on a site between St Peter 's Church and the Floating Harbour . This ' beautiful house with its elaborate carving ' became the Bristol Mint in 1695 , and was considered to be Bristol 's greatest architectural loss of the Second World War . 
 By the 16th century the castle was ' tending to ruin ' , and following his victory in the English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655 , a process which was completed within a fortnight . The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London , and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market . The demolition of Lawford 's Gate at the eastern end of Old Market Street extended this into West Street , creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol . 
 Wine Street and Castle Street became the main shopping streets , where retailers such as Boots , Jones 's ( later to become part of the Debenhams group ) , the Co @-@ op and Marks & Spencer traded . Baker Baker had large stores in Bridge Street , Wine Street and Mary @-@ le @-@ Port Street ; two of these were connected by a high bridge across Mary @-@ le @-@ Port Street . The area also hosted a cinema ( the News Theatre ) and its narrow winding back @-@ streets contained many independent shops , hotels , and pubs . At the corner of High Street and Wine Street stood the ' most loved fragment of Old Bristol ' : The Dutch House . 
 = = = 24 November 1940 = = = 
 On the afternoon of 24 November 1940 , 148 aircraft of the Luftwaffe left airfields in Northern France heading for Bristol . The concentration point was to be the City Docks , and their objective was to destroy Bristol 's industry and port facilities . 135 aircraft reached the target area , and dropped 156 @,@ 250 kg ( 344 @,@ 470 lb ) of high explosives , 4 @,@ 750 kg ( 10 @,@ 470 lb ) of oil bombs and 12 @,@ 500 incendiaries . As the raid progressed , the fires could be seen from 250 kilometres ( 160 mi ) away . Wide areas of the city were struck , but the most concentrated damage occurred in the area between Broad Quay and Old Market where fierce fires burnt through the night . By the morning , 200 Bristolians were dead and 689 injured , four Luftwaffe crewmen were dead , one injured and four captured , two aircraft were lost , and a large part of the historic heart of Bristol was a smouldering ruin . 
 The destruction was not total , however . Post @-@ war photographs show that buildings survived intact on Bridge Street , High Street , Castle Street and Peter Street . The west end of Narrow Wine Street , a ' fantastic little old thoroughfare ' , was more or less intact ; Castle Mill Street and Castle Green received little damage , and Upper , Middle and Lower Terrace survived . More importantly , the irreplaceable mediaeval street plan remained .

 The idea that Bristol 's main shopping area should be moved away from the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation 's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders ' Federation ( MTF ) , representing the larger retailers and chain @-@ stores , in October 1943 . They suggested that the pre @-@ war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space , and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less @-@ constrained site . This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer 's Master Plan of February 1944 , which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall , with underground parking for 2 @,@ 000 cars . The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that had destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by its congested nature , and in any case many of the chain @-@ stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites . 
 The main objection to this plan came from the independent traders who did not wish to relocate because they felt that the proposed new shopping area was ' off the beaten track ' . This objection was not unreasonable , as in its pre @-@ war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east , passed through Old Market into Castle Street , Wine Street , and the City Markets , and then via The Centre and Park Street to Queens Road and Whiteladies Road . Moving the central shopping area would break this axis . There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of ' sterilising ' such a large area in the centre of the city . However , when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation , representing the small traders , produced a poll showing that 13 @,@ 000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved , the local Labour party dismissed the poll describing it as ' undemocratic ' and comparing the Federation 's methods to those of Hitler . 
 By 1966 , the shops had been rebuilt in ' barren ' Broadmead ( at the expense of demolishing an area of Victorian , Georgian and Tudor buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed ) , and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking . The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate , and Old Market , severed from Bristol 's shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass and the destruction of Castle Street , was in serious decline . The plan for Castle Park was crystallising , however . The ruined St Peter 's Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery ; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park . The south @-@ western corner nearest Bristol Bridge would contain a riverside hotel , and the north @-@ western corner would be home to ' a block for cultural , professional and exhibition purposes ' . 
 In the event , the north @-@ western corner was leased to the Bank of England and Norwich Union Insurance ( whose offices now stand derelict ) , and the critical corner site where the Dutch House had stood was replaced by a link road to a short section of dual @-@ carriageway linking High Street with Wine Street . Plans for a civic centre were dropped as being too expensive . 
 Finally , in 1977 , work began on an ' emasculated ' version of the new park . This was designed by Bristol City Council 's parks department and , largely for financial reasons , it contained few of the features intended by earlier plans but was much larger than that originally planned . The last remaining vestiges of the mediaeval street plan , Dolphin Street and Peter Street , were buried .

 In 2006 , Bristol City Council announced its intention to redevelop the area to the west of Castle Park , known as the ' Mary @-@ le @-@ Port ' site . These plans encompassed the by then derelict financial buildings , and the area to the west of St Peter 's church , about 5 % of the park . It was to be a 400 @,@ 000 square feet ( 37 @,@ 000 m2 ) mixed @-@ use development to ' regenerate this historic heart of Bristol ' and to ' improve connections between Broadmead , the Old City and Redcliffe ' and ' enhance the setting of St Mary @-@ le @-@ Port church ' . The council selected Deeley Freed as its preferred developer . The scheme provoked opposition from park users who felt that any reduction in the area of the park was not acceptable . ' Surprised by the extent of feeling ' , Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans . Campaigners then applied to have ' Town Green ' status applied to the park , but this was declined in 2009 .

 Very little of Bristol Castle remains above ground . The most tangible survival is a vaulted chamber of the King 's Hall , formerly on Tower Street near the now @-@ truncated Castle Street . Other than that , the excavated remains of the south wall can be seen near the landing stage , and near St Peter 's Church the sally port and traces of the west wall are visible . The foundations of the keep are on show next to the public toilets on Newgate . 
 The park contains a number of memorials . The ruins of St Peter 's Church are a memorial to the civilians and auxiliary personnel killed in the aerial bombing of Bristol , and a plaque on its wall lists their names . Adjoining the church is a sensory herb garden and The Normandy Garden of Peace , which was opened on 5 November 1995 , with five Silver Birch trees trees , managed by Bristol 's D @-@ Day veterans , in memory of the five D @-@ Day beaches . There are also memorials for trees for Anne Frank and the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

 = Castell Coch = 
 Castell Coch ( Welsh pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; Welsh for Red Castle ) is a 19th @-@ century Gothic Revival castle built above the village of <unk> in South Wales . The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081 , to protect the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge . Abandoned shortly afterwards , the castle 's earth motte was reused by Gilbert de Clare as the basis for a new stone fortification , which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands . This castle was likely destroyed in the native Welsh rebellion of 1314 . In 1760 , the castle ruins were acquired by John Stuart , 3rd Earl of Bute as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South Wales . 
 John Crichton @-@ Stuart , the 3rd Marquess of Bute , inherited the castle in 1848 . One of Britain 's wealthiest men , with interests in architecture and antiquarian studies , he employed the architect William Burges to reconstruct the castle , " as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer " , using the medieval remains as a basis for the design . Burges rebuilt the outside of the castle between 1875 and 1879 , before turning to the interior ; he died in 1881 and the work was finished by Burges 's remaining team in 1891 . Bute reintroduced commercial viticulture into Britain , planting a vineyard just below the castle , and wine production continued until the First World War . The Marquess made little use of his new retreat and in 1950 his grandson , the 5th Marquess of Bute , placed it into the care of the state . It is now controlled by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw . 
 Castell Coch 's external features and the High Victorian interiors led the historian David McLees to describe it as " one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition . " The exterior , based on 19th @-@ century studies by the antiquarian George Clark , is relatively authentic in style , although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette , closer in design to mainland European castles such as Chillon than native British fortifications . The interiors were elaborately decorated , with specially designed furniture and fittings ; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on classical and legendary themes . Joseph Mordaunt Crook wrote that the castle represented " the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect , recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy @-@ tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript . " 
 The surrounding beech woods contain rare plant species and unusual geological features and are protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 11th – 14th centuries = = = 
 The first castle on the Castell Coch site was probably built after 1081 , during the Norman invasion of Wales . It formed one of a string of eight fortifications intended to defend the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge . It took the form of a raised , earth @-@ work motte , about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) across at the base and 25 metres ( 82 ft ) on the top , protected by the surrounding steep slopes . The 16th @-@ century historian Rice Merrick claimed that the castle was built by the Welsh lord Ifor ap Meurig , but there are no records of this phase of the castle 's history and modern historians doubt this account . The first castle was probably abandoned after 1093 when the Norman lordship of Glamorgan was created , changing the line of the frontier . 
 In 1267 , Gilbert de Clare , who held the Lordship of Glamorgan , seized the lands around the town of Senghenydd in the north of Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler . Caerphilly Castle was built to control the new territory and Castell Coch — strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly — was reoccupied . A new castle was built in stone around the motte , comprising a shell @-@ wall , a projecting circular tower , a gatehouse and a square hall above an undercroft . The north @-@ west section of the walls was protected by a talus and the sides of the motte were scarped to increase their angle , all producing a small but powerful fortification . Further work followed between 1268 and 1277 , which added two large towers , a turning @-@ bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north @-@ west walls . 
 On Gilbert 's death , the castle passed to his widow Joan and around this time it was referred to as Castrum <unk> , Latin for " the Red Castle " , probably after the colour of the sandstone defences . Gilbert 's son , also named Gilbert , inherited the property in 1307 . He died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 , triggering an uprising of the native Welsh in the region . Castell Coch was probably destroyed by the rebels in July 1314 , and possibly slighted to put it beyond any further use ; it was not rebuilt and the site was abandoned .

 Castell Coch remained derelict ; the antiquarian John Leland , visiting around 1536 , described it as " all in ruin , no big thing but high " . The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792 , depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower , with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification . Stone from the castle may have been robbed and used to feed the kilns during this period . A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century , showing more trees around the ruins ; a few years later , Robert <unk> recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance in wild garlic . 
 The ruins were acquired by the Earls of Bute in 1760 , when John Stuart , the 3rd Earl and , from 1794 , the 1st Marquess , married Lady Charlotte Windsor , adding her estates in South Wales to his inheritance . John 's grandson , John Crichton @-@ Stuart , developed the Cardiff Docks in the first half of the 19th century ; although the docks were not especially profitable , they opened opportunities for the expansion of the coal industry in the South Wales valleys , making the Bute family extremely wealthy . The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for iron ore at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there . 
 The 3rd Marquess of Bute , another John Crichton @-@ Stuart , inherited the castle and the family estates as a child in 1848 . On his coming of age , Bute 's landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world . He had a wide range of interests including archaeology , theology , linguistics and history . Interest in medieval architecture increased in Britain during the 19th century , and in 1850 the antiquarian George Clark surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings , the first major scholarly work about the castle . The ruins were covered in rubble , ivy , brushwood and weeds ; the keep had been largely destroyed and the gatehouse was so covered with debris that Clark failed to discover it . Nonetheless , Clark considered the external walls " tolerably perfect " and advised that the castle be conserved , complete with the ivy @-@ covered stonework . 
 In 1871 , Bute asked his chief Cardiff engineer , John McConnochie , to excavate and clear the castle ruins . The report on the investigations was produced by William Burges , an architect with an interest in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865 . The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s , and the two men became close collaborators . Burges 's lavishly illustrated report , which drew extensively on Clark 's earlier work , laid out two options : either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer . On receipt of the report , Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style . 
 = = = = Reconstruction = = = = 
 The reconstruction of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875 , because of the demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess 's trustees that he was facing bankruptcy . On commencement , the Kitchen Tower , Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first , followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse , and the Keep Tower last . Burges 's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart . The drawings were supplemented by a large number of wooden and plaster models , from smaller pieces to full @-@ size models of furniture . 
 The bulk of the external work was complete by the end of 1879 . The result closely followed Burges 's original plans , with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret , and some defensive timber hoardings , both of which were not undertaken . Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features , such as the drawbridge and portcullis , against surviving designs at other British castles . 
 Burges 's team of craftsmen at Castell Coch included many who had worked with him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere . John Chapple , his office manager , designed most of the furnishings and furniture , and William Frame acted as clerk of works . Horatio Lonsdale was Burges 's chief artist , painting extensive murals at the castle . His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls , together with another long @-@ time collaborator , the Italian sculptor Ceccardo Fucigna . 
 Stimulated by antiquarian writings about British viticulture , Bute decided to reintroduce commercial grape vines into Britain in 1873 . He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France for training and planted a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ hectare ( 3 @-@ acre ) vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875 . The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles . Punch magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that " it would take four men to drink it — two to hold the victim and one to pour the wine down his throat " . By 1887 , the output was 3 @,@ 000 bottles of sweet white wine of reasonable quality . Bute persevered , commercial success followed and 40 hogsheads of wine , including a red varietal using <unk> grapes , were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews . 
 Burges died in 1881 after catching a severe chill during a site visit to the castle . His brother @-@ in @-@ law , the architect Richard Pullan , took over the commission and delegated most of the work to Frame , who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891 . Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration ; replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to hang on the walls . Clark approved of the result , commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in " excellent taste " . An oratory originally built on the roof of the Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered . 
 The castle was not greatly used ; the Marquess rarely visited after its completion . The property had probably only been intended for limited , informal use , for example as a retreat following picnics . Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings , it had only three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits . The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community , possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late @-@ Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments . 
 = = = 20th – 21st centuries = = = 
 Bute died in 1900 and his widow , the Marchioness , was given a life interest in Castell Coch ; during her mourning , she and her daughter , Lady Margaret Crichton @-@ Stuart , occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter . Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process , and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted . John , the 4th Marquess , acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it . He also began to reduce the family 's investments in South Wales . The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s ; by 1938 , the great majority of the family interests , including the coal mines and docks , had been sold off or nationalised . 
 The 5th Marquess of Bute , another John , succeeded in 1947 and , in 1950 , he placed the castle in the care of the Ministry of Works . The Marquess also disposed of Cardiff Castle , which he gave to the city , removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so . In turn , the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff , the National Museum of Wales providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch . Academic interest in the property grew , with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value . Since 1984 , the property has been administered by Cadw , an agency of the Welsh Government , and is open to the public ; it received 69 @,@ 466 visitors in 2011 . The castle has also been used as a location for filming . 
 The castle 's exposed position causes it to suffer from penetrating damp and periodic restoration work has been necessary . The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972 , a major programme was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute 's Bedroom , where damp had begun to damage the finishings . 
 The original furnishings , many of which the Marquess removed in 1950 , have mostly been recovered and returned to their original locations in the castle . Two stained @-@ glass panels from the demolished chapel , lost since 1901 , were rediscovered at an auction in 2010 and were bought by Cadw for £ 125 @,@ 000 in 2011 .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 Castell Coch occupies a stretch of woodland on the slopes above the village of <unk> and the River Taff , about 10 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 6 mi ) north @-@ west of the centre of Cardiff . The architecture is High Victorian Gothic Revival in style , influenced by contemporary 19th @-@ century French restorations . Its design combines the surviving elements of the medieval castle with 19th @-@ century additions to produce a building which the historian Charles Kightly considered " the crowning glory of the Gothic Revival " in Britain . It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building due to its exceptional architectural and historical interest . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The castle comprises three circular towers — the Keep , the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower — along with the Hall Block , the Gatehouse and a shell wall ; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone . The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red sandstone rubble and grey limestone , the 19th @-@ century additions in more precisely cut red Pennant sandstone . A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road . The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th @-@ century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course . In 1850 , George Clark recorded an " outer court " of which nothing remains ; this may , in fact , have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site . 
 The Gatehouse is reached across a wooden bridge , incorporating a drawbridge . Burges intended the bridge to copy those of medieval castles , which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire in the event of attack . The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive <unk> and , above the entrance , Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna . 
 The Keep is 12 metres ( 39 ft ) in diameter with a square , spurred base ; in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret , on the south @-@ west side , containing latrines , but few traces remain . There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower . The Kitchen Tower is also 12 metres ( 39 ft ) across and rests on a square , spurred base . It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen ; Burgess raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys . The walls of these two towers are around 3 @.@ 0 metres ( 10 ft ) thick at the base , thinning to 0 @.@ 61 metres ( 2 ft ) at the top . The Well Tower at 11 @.@ 5 metres ( 38 ft ) in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower , with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground . The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back , facing onto the courtyard , similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares . 
 The towers contribute to what the architectural writer Charles Handley @-@ Read considered the castle 's " sculptural and dramatic exterior " . Almost equal in diameter , but of differing conical roof designs and heights , and topped with copper @-@ gilt weather vanes , they combine to produce a romantic appearance , which Matthew Williams described as bringing " a Wagnerian flavor to the Taff Valley " . 
 The design of the towers was influenced by the work of the contemporary French architect Eugène Viollet @-@ le @-@ Duc , including his restorations of <unk> and the <unk> of Aigle and Chillon . While the exterior of Castell Coch is relatively true to English 13th @-@ century medieval design — albeit heavily influenced by the Gothic Revival movement — the inclusion of the conical roofs , which more closely resemble those of fortifications in France or Switzerland than Britain , is historically inaccurate . Although he mounted a historical defence ( see box ) , Burges chose the roofs mainly for architectural effect , arguing that they appeared " more picturesque " , and to provide additional room for accommodation in the castle . 
 The three towers lead into a small oval courtyard that sits on the top of the motte , about 19 @.@ 5 metres ( 64 ft ) across lengthways . <unk> galleries and wall @-@ walks run around the inside of the courtyard with neat and orderly woodwork ; the historian Peter Floud critiqued it as " perhaps too much like the backcloth for an historical pageant " . Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north @-@ west side of the courtyard 0 @.@ 99 metres ( 3 ft 3 in ) thick , complete with arrow holes and a battlement . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The Keep , the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments , of which the main sequence , the Castellan 's Rooms , lies within the Keep . The Hall , the Drawing Room , Lord Bute 's Bedroom and Lady Bute 's Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain . Unlike the exterior of the castle , which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century , the interior was purely High Victorian in style . On Burges 's decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch , Handley @-@ Read wrote : " I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand , very largely , of one designer , to equal either in homogeneity or completeness , in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles . For sheer power of intoxication , Burges stand [ s ] unrivalled . " 
 = = = = The Banqueting Hall = = = = 
 The Banqueting Hall is 6 @.@ 1 by 9 @.@ 1 metres ( 20 by 30 ft ) across with an 11 @-@ metre ( 35 ft ) ceiling , and occupies the whole of the first floor of the Hall Block . Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor . His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next to the Drawing Room . Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage , around 1878 / 9 , the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery . 
 The hall is austere ; the architect John Newman critiqued its decoration as " dilute " and " unfocused " , Crook as " anaemic " . It features stencilled ceilings and murals which resemble medieval manuscripts . The murals were designed by Horatio Lonsdale and executed by Campbell , Smith & Company . The furniture is by John Chapple , made in Lord Bute 's workshops at Cardiff . The tapered chimney of the room , modelled on 15th @-@ century French equivalents , contains a statue carved by Thomas Nicholls . Although the architectural historian Mark Girouard suggested that the statue depicts the Hebrew King David , most historians believe that it shows Lucius of Britain , according to legend the founder of the diocese of Llandaff in nearby Cardiff . 
 = = = = The Drawing Room = = = = 
 The octagonal Drawing Room occupies the first and second floors of the Keep . The ceiling is supported by vaulted stone ribs modelled on Viollet @-@ Le @-@ Duc 's work at Château de Coucy and the lower and upper halves of the room are divided by a minstrels ' gallery . The original plans for the space involved two chambers , one on each floor , and the new design was adopted only in 1879 , Burges noting at the time that he intended to " indulge in a little more ornament " than elsewhere in the castle . 
 The decoration of the room focuses on what Newman described as the " intertwined themes [ of ] the fecundity of nature and the fragility of life " . A fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the Three Fates , the trio of Greek goddesses who are depicted spinning , measuring and cutting the thread of life . The ceiling 's vaulting is carved with butterflies , reaching up to a golden sunburst at the apex of the room , while plumed birds fly up into a starry sky in the intervening sections . Around the room , 58 panels , each depicting a unique plant , are surmounted by a mural showing animals from Aesop 's Fables . Carved birds , lizards and other wildlife decorate the doorways . 
 The historian Terry Measham wrote that the Drawing Room and Lady Bute 's Bedroom , " so powerful in their effect , are the two most important interiors in the castle . " The architectural writer Andrew <unk> @-@ Smith considered the Drawing Room to be " Burges 's pièce de résistance " , encapsulating his " romantic vision of the Middle Ages " . The decoration of the ceiling , which was carried out while Burges was alive , differs in tone from the treatment of the murals , and the decoration of Lady Bute 's Bedroom , which were both completed , under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively , after Burges 's death . Burges 's work is distinctively High Gothic in style , while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character of the Aesthetic movement , which had grown in popularity by the 1880s . 
 = = = = Lord Bute 's Bedroom = = = = 
 In comparison to other rooms within the castle , Lord Bute 's Bedroom , sited above the Winch Room , is relatively small and simple . The original plan had Bute 's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double @-@ height room in 1879 required a late change of plan . The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace . Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the <unk> over the gate arch . The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post @-@ dates Burges , although the washstand and dressing table are pared @-@ down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London , The Tower House . 
 This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle , making extensive use of plain , stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls . Crook suggested this provided some " spartan " relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute 's Bedroom but Floud considered the result " thin " and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers . The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use , lacking wardrobes and other storage . 
 = = = = Lady Bute 's Bedroom = = = = 
 Lady Bute 's Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep , with a coffered , double @-@ dome ceiling that rises up into the tower 's conical roof . The room was completed after Burges 's death and , although he had created an outline model for the room 's structure , which survives , he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration . His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the room — " would Mr Burges have done it ? " William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887 — but the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888 , with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife . 
 The room is circular , with the window embrasures forming a sequence of arches around the outside . It is richly decorated , with love as the theme , displaying carved monkeys , nesting birds and pomegranates , images taken from 15th @-@ century manuscripts . Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately " lascivious " . Above the fireplace is a winged statue of Psyche , the Greek goddess of the soul , carrying a heart @-@ shaped shield which displays the arms of the Bute family . The washbasin , designed by John Chapple , has cisterns for hot and cold water , covered with crenellated towers . The Marchioness 's scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room , modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet @-@ le @-@ Duc . Crook described the bed as being " medieval to the point of acute discomfort " . 
 The bedroom is Moorish in style , a popular inspiration in mid @-@ Victorian interior design , and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle and in the chancel at St Mary 's Church at Studley Royal in Yorkshire . <unk> @-@ Smith likened the chamber , with its " Moorish @-@ looking dome , maroon @-@ and @-@ gold painted furniture and large , low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs " , to a scene from the Arabian Nights . Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room , suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical , even pantomime @-@ like , character . The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale 's efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room . 
 = = = = Other rooms = = = = 
 The Windlass Room , or Winch Room , is in the Gatehouse , entered from the Drawing Room . It contains a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis . The equipment was originally intended for the second floor , which Burges considered the most historically authentic location . When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute 's Bedroom into that space , the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor . The Windlass Room includes murder holes , which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers . 
 An oratory , originally fitted to the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891 , was decorated with twenty stained glass windows . Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle , while the other ten are displayed on site ; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011 . Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute 's Bedroom , the servants ' hall and the kitchen .

 Jenna Haze ( born February 22 , 1982 ) is an American director , model and former pornographic actress . Haze has won numerous adult industry awards , including the 2003 AVN Award for Best New <unk> and the 2009 AVN Award for Female Performer of the Year , making her the second performer in history to ever win both awards in the course of her career , after Missy . In 2012 , she was inducted into both the AVN and <unk> Halls of Fame . 
 = = Career = = 
 Haze entered the adult film industry on July 18 , 2001 . Between 2002 and 2005 , she was a contract girl for the film company Jill Kelly Productions . During most of her time at the company , she performed exclusively with women , out of loyalty to her then boyfriend , an industry cameraman . She returned to working with men in the 2006 multi @-@ award winning release Jenna Haze Darkside , produced by Jules Jordan . 
 Her first scene was for The Oral Adventures of Craven Moorehead 8 with her agent Slim Shady ( Dez ) and his best friend , Moorehead . It was intended to only be an oral scene , but in the heat of the moment she had intercourse with both . The next day she shot a scene with Miles Long in Joey Silvera 's Service Animals 4 . A few months later , she realized that she did not need an agent and started to represent herself . 
 In February 2002 , Haze appeared in a scene for Jill Kelly Productions ( JKP ) , directed by Jill Kelly herself . Kelly was impressed by her performance and JKP offered Haze an exclusive performing contract . This was soon followed by offers from other companies , but in April 2002 Haze decided to sign with JKP , as they offered the extra flexibility she needed to make money and build her career . The company to her was more than just a business , but a family too . She also enjoyed the idea of having a group of girls around her and working for a company run by a woman . Soon after signing with JKP , she formed a serious relationship with an industry cameraman and began a three @-@ year period of performing exclusively with women . At the 2003 AVN Awards ceremony , Haze was named Best New <unk> and her masturbation scene in Big Bottom Sadie was awarded Best Solo Sex Scene . In 2004 , she appeared on the HBO show <unk> , a six @-@ part documentary on the pornography industry in California . 
 Haze became a free agent in April 2005 , after deciding not to renew her contract with JKP , partly because Jill Kelly had recently left the company . After leaving JKP and splitting with her boyfriend , Haze returned to working with male performers . The April 2006 release Jenna Haze Darkside featured her first boy @-@ girl scenes in over three years . The film was produced and directed by her new boyfriend Jules Jordan . Later in the year , she began writing a sex advice column for the pornographic magazine , Fox . 
 In 2006 she also started feature dancing , represented by the agency Lee Network .

 = = Plot = = 
 As Chuck Bartowski ( Zachary Levi ) contemplates confronting his sister Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) about her secret research into their late father Stephen 's laptop , Chuck and his fiancée Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) prepare for their bachelor and bachelorette parties . 
 At her bachelorette party , hosted by Ellie , Sarah is notified by General Diane Beckman that Stephen 's laptop is being tracked by Volkoff Industries agents Riley ( Ray Wise ) and Jasmine ( India de Beaufort ) , who , due to the imprisonment of international arms dealer Alexei Volkoff , are now under the leadership of Volkoff 's daughter Vivian . Thinking that Riley and Jasmine are going to arrive at Ellie 's apartment , Sarah tells Ellie that Chuck knows Ellie lied to him and still has the laptop . However , Ellie and Sarah then realize that the laptop has been mistakenly taken by Ellie 's husband Devon Woodcomb ( Ryan McPartlin ) to Chuck 's bachelor party . 
 Meanwhile , despite Chuck and his guests ' belief that Devon was hosting Chuck 's bachelor party in Las Vegas , Nevada , they are taken to Las <unk> National Park . As some of the guests attempt to escape the camping trip , they are ambushed by Riley 's mercenaries , who are tracking the laptop Devon unknowingly brought with him . Chuck and his friends escape , but the laptop is stabbed by Jasmine in the process . 
 When Chuck returns , he and Ellie tell each other the truth , with Ellie revealing that she is still investigating her father 's research , and Chuck revealing that he is still a CIA agent . Chuck then brings Ellie to Castle and demonstrates martial arts skills from the Intersect . When Chuck claims to be Agent X , the first human Intersect , Ellie informs him that , according to the laptop , someone had originally uploaded the Intersect to their brain before Chuck 's birth . After Chuck repairs the computer , they find a redacted file on British scientist Hartley Winterbottom . 
 Chuck , Sarah , and John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) travel to Winterbottom 's home in Somerset , UK , and confront Winterbottom 's mother ( Millicent Martin ) , who blames the CIA for corrupting her son . However , Chuck is revealed to be Stephen Bartowski 's son , earning her trust , as Hartley and Stephen were once colleagues and close friends . When Riley and Jasmine arrive with an assault team , Mrs. Winterbottom sends Chuck and Sarah to retrieve Hartley 's " spy will " while she and Casey fight back the assault team . When they run out of ammunition , Mrs. Winterbottom sets a trap that explodes and kills Jasmine and the assault team . When Ellie , Chuck , Sarah , Casey , and Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez ) return to the Castle , open Hartley 's spy will , they discover a photograph of Volkoff , realizing that Volkoff is actually Agent X - Hartley . 
 Startled , The team reads the files on his last mission ; which was to assist on a complicated cover @-@ up black operation posing as an international arms dealer ; Alexei Volkoff . Stephen Bartowski created the original Intersect prototype and first used it on Hartley , which was updated with the personality , knowledge and identity of Volkoff , a manufactured identity . However , the Intersect was so unstable that it plagued Hartley 's mind and deleting his personality as Hartley Winterbottom , instead he started to believe that he was Alexei Volkoff , an international arms dealer , and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun <unk> . 
 With the realization , Casey closes the spy will and orders everyone to keep quiet about this , since the information about CIA creating its " own worst enemy " was simply hidden and buried to ensure secrecy , and that they will be most likely eliminated if anything is told . However , Ellie objects and dedicates herself to help Volkoff restore his identity , to which Chuck agrees . Casey grudgingly and reluctantly supports them , before sealing the will in a secret safe deep in the Castle .

 " Chuck Versus Agent X " was one of many episodes to be directed by producer Robert Duncan McNeill , and was written by Phil Klemmer and Craig DiGregorio . It originally aired in the United States on May 2 , 2011 , on NBC as the 22nd episode of Chuck 's fourth season and the 76th episode overall . 
 Chuck cast members revealed at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo that the season would include a " funny , camping @-@ themed " bachelor party episode featuring Casey , Big Mike , and the fictional band Jeffster ! . The cast also confirmed that Ray Wise would reprise his role of Alexei Volkoff 's lawyer , Riley . India de Beaufort guest starred as Jasmine , and Millicent Martin as Hartley Winterbottom 's mother . Sarah Lancaster revealed to IGN that the Snakes of Toluca Lake , the strippers which Ellie hires for Sarah , were played by the real @-@ life Hollywood Men . Lancaster enjoyed filming the scene , which took hours to perform , solely due to Yvonne Strahovski 's discomfort . Strahovski stated that the men became " bolder " with each take , gradually moving closer to her . Principal photography for " Chuck Versus Agent X " ended on April 10 . 
 Series co @-@ creator Chris Fedak stated in a later interview that the inspiration for Volkoff 's true identity being a gun @-@ shy British scientist was Timothy Dalton 's portrayal of Gregory Tuttle , Volkoff 's guise as Mary Elizabeth Bartowski 's MI6 handler , in his first appearance on the series . A photograph of Dalton before his portrayal of James Bond is used to represent a young Hartley Winterbottom .

 The episode received positive reviews from critics . Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- on an A + to F scale . He found the episode 's " reconfiguration of previous mythology " successful , and , though he found it obvious that Volkoff was Agent X , McGee wrote that " seeing a pre @-@ Bond Dalton inside that spy will was great payoff all the same . " However , McGee continued , " Much less successful was anything involving Chuck 's bachelor party and Big Mike / Jeffster 's subsequent desire to save their manly weekend . " Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 @.@ 5 out of 10 , writing that " the best element in all of this was the introduction of Volkoff , or make that Hartley Winterbottom 's , mother and the bonding that occurred between her and John Casey . " HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall , however , wrote that the episode " was kind of a hodge podge . It 's a transitional episode setting up the end game with Volkoff that the season 's final two episodes will focus on , but it also felt like an hour comprised of two or three different ideas that nobody could quite flesh out to fill up an entire episode , and so were compressed together . " Like McGee , Sepinwall enjoyed Wise 's return , though he felt that the actor was given little to do .

 = History of the Houston Rockets = 
 The Houston Rockets are an American professional basketball team based in Houston , Texas . The team plays in the Southwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . The team was established in 1967 , and played in San Diego , California for four years , before moving to Houston , Texas . 
 In the Rockets ' debut season , they won 15 games . After drafting Elvin Hayes first overall in the 1968 NBA Draft , they made their first appearance in the playoffs in 1969 . After Hayes was traded , Moses Malone replaced him . Malone won two Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) awards during his time in Houston , and he led the Rockets to the 1978 conference finals in his first year with the Rockets . He also took the Rockets to the NBA Finals in 1981 , but they were defeated in six games by the Boston Celtics . 
 Two years after advancing to the finals , the Rockets traded Malone and had two losing seasons , with the first having a franchise @-@ low 14 victories . This gave Houston two straight first overall picks , used to bring future Hall of Famers Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon , who eventually got the Rockets all the way to the 1986 Finals , where they lost again to Boston . In the next seven seasons , they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times . They did not win their first championship until 1994 , when Olajuwon led them to a franchise @-@ best 58 wins , and the championship . The Rockets repeated the feat in 1995 , but in the following seasons , they did not advance to the finals again . They missed the playoffs from 1999 to 2003 , and did not reach the playoffs again until they drafted Yao Ming in 2003 . However , they would not advance past the first round of the playoffs for 13 years . In the 2007 – 08 NBA season , the Rockets had their most successful campaign in the 2000s , winning 55 games , with 22 of those victories in a row , but still lost in the first round . The following season , the team managed to win a playoff series for the first time since 1997 , defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs and pushed the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2009 Western Conference Semifinals . 
 During the next decade , the Rockets <unk> their roster and were again contenders for the NBA title . In the 2014 – 15 NBA season , led by head coach Kevin McHale and guard James Harden , the Rockets won their first division title in 21 years , and reached the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1997 . 
 = = San Diego Rockets ( 1967 – 1971 ) = = 
 Once National Basketball Association commissioner J. Walter Kennedy visited San Diego in 1966 and saw the passionate support for the Western Hockey League 's San Diego Gulls , he invited Robert Breitbard , owner of the Gulls and their arena , the San Diego International Sports Center , to the next NBA owners ' meeting . The league wanted to add other franchises in the Western United States , by then only represented through the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Francisco Warriors , and the owners liked Breitbard 's input during the meeting . Combining the city economic and population growths with the Gulls ' success , San Diego was chosen to receive an expansion team in 1967 . Breitbard paid an 1 @.@ 75 million dollars entry fee to join the NBA as an expansion team for the 1967 – 68 NBA season , along with the Seattle SuperSonics . The resulting contest to name the franchise chose the name " Rockets " , <unk> San Diego 's theme of " a city in motion " and the local arm of General Dynamics developing the Atlas missile and booster rocket program . Breitbard brought in Jack McMahon , then coach of the Cincinnati Royals , to serve as the Rockets ' coach and general manager . The team then built its roster with both veteran players at an expansion draft , and college players in the 1967 NBA draft , where San Diego 's first ever draft pick was Pat Riley . The Rockets ' inaugural game was held on October 14 , 1967 at the International Sports Center , with 8000 fans seeing the Rockets lose closely to the St. Louis Hawks by 99 @-@ 98 . The Rockets lost 70 games in their inaugural season , which was then an NBA record for losses in a season . Attendance ranked as eighth among the league 's twelve teams , leading to financial losses . The sole bright spot of the inaugural season was forward Don <unk> , whose good numbers earned him a spot at the 1968 NBA All @-@ Star Game . 
 In 1968 , after the Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to determine who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft , they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston . Hayes led the team to the franchise 's first ever playoff appearance in 1969 , but the Rockets lost in the semi @-@ finals of the Western Division to the Atlanta Hawks , four games to two . In 1970 NBA Draft , the Rockets drafted Calvin Murphy and Rudy Tomjanovich , who would both spend their whole careers with the Rockets . 
 Despite being coached by Hall of Fame coach Alex Hannum , the Rockets only tallied a 57 – 97 record and did not make the playoffs in the next two seasons . Because of poor performance and attendance , Breitbard sold the team in 1971 to Texas Sports Investments , which was led by real estate broker Wayne <unk> and banker Billy Goldberg . The group bought the franchise for $ 5 @.@ 6 million , and immediately moved the team to Houston . The franchise became the first NBA team in Texas , and the team 's nickname of " Rockets " took on even greater relevance after the move since Houston is home to NASA 's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center . 
 = = Improving in Houston with Murphy & Rudy @-@ T ( 1971 – 1976 ) = = 
 Upon their arrival , many were in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston . They were coming to a city that did not have a suitable arena , and had not shown much interest in professional basketball . Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969 , where the average attendance was only 200 . The city 's largest indoor arena was 34 @-@ year @-@ old Sam Houston Coliseum , but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis . As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena , the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston 's Hofheinz Pavilion , while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio 's <unk> Arena . 
 Before the start of the 1971 – 72 NBA season , Hannum left for the Denver Rockets ( later renamed Denver Nuggets ) of the American Basketball Association , and Tex Winter was hired in his place . However , Winter , who said that Hayes had " the worst fundamentals of any player " he had ever coached , applied a system that contrasted with the offensive style to which Hayes was accustomed . Because of the differences between Winter and Hayes , Houston traded Hayes , who had led the Rockets in scoring for four straight years , to the Baltimore Bullets for Jack Marin at the end of the 1971 – 72 season . Winter left soon after , being fired in January 1973 following a ten @-@ game losing streak and with the Rockets as the second worst team of the league , and was replaced by Johnny Egan . 
 With a 41 @-@ 41 record , the Rockets would earn their first NBA Playoff berth in the 1975 NBA Playoffs since moving from San Diego as well as winning their first playoff series in franchise history by defeating the New York Knicks led by Walt Frazier and Earl Monroe in a 3 @-@ game mini series , but would ultimately bow to the upcoming champions Boston Celtics in 5 games in the semi @-@ finals . The Rockets would move into their own arena , The Summit , the following season . The arena was located near Greenway Plaza , whose developer Kenneth Schnitzer became the Rockets ' primary owner

 Due to Egan 's failure to qualify for the playoffs , as soon as the season ended he was replaced by coach Tom Nissalke . Nissalke knew the Rockets had firepower but needed a rebounding center and a play @-@ making guard , and he pressed the Rockets management to acquire college standout John Lucas – drafted first overall in the 1976 NBA draft , a pick Houston acquired by sending Gus Bailey , Joe <unk> and the ninth pick to the Atlanta Hawks – and his former player at the ABA 's Utah Stars Moses Malone – while Malone started the 1976 – 77 season with the Buffalo Braves , Houston acquired him by sending Buffalo first @-@ round picks in the next two drafts . After Malone led the Rockets in rebounding for the first of six straight times , and established a then @-@ NBA record for offensive rebounds in a season , the Rockets posted a franchise @-@ best 49 @-@ wins and won the franchise 's first Division Title finishing on top of the Central Division . After a first round bye in the playoffs , Houston defeated the Washington Bullets led by former Rocket Elvin Hayes as well as Wes Unseld in seven games in the Eastern Conference semi @-@ finals , and advanced to the conference finals for the first time in their history , but they lost to the top @-@ seeded Philadelphia 76ers led by former ABA superstar Julius Erving . 4 – 2 . 
 Early into 1977 – 78 season , at a game on December 9 , 1977 , Kevin Kunnert got into a fight with Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers . As Tomjanovich approached the altercation , Washington turned and punched Tomjanovich squarely in the face , causing numerous fractures in his face . Tomjanovich spent the next five months in rehabilitation and returned to appear in the 1978 All @-@ Star Game , but his averages significantly declined after the injury , and Houston finished with just 28 wins in the season . 
 In the following season , Malone , Murphy , and Tomjanovich all played in the 1979 NBA All @-@ Star Game , and Malone received the 1979 MVP Award . The Rockets also sent John Lucas II to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Rick Barry , who went on to set the NBA record at the time for free throw percentage in a season by shooting 94 @.@ 7 % . The Rockets went 47 – 35 in Nissalke 's last season as coach , and finished second in the Central Division , but they lost to Atlanta in a best @-@ of @-@ three first round series . 
 In 1979 George Maloof , a businessperson from Albuquerque , New Mexico , bought the Rockets for $ 9 million . He died the following year , and while the Maloof family expressed interest in selling the team , George 's 24 @-@ year @-@ old son Gavin took over the Rockets . A buyer was eventually found in 1982 as businessman Charlie Thomas purchased the franchise for $ 11 million . The Maloof period of ownership marked the first dominant period of the Rockets , led by new coach Del Harris . In Houston 's 1979 – 80 campaign , the team finished with a 41 – 41 record , tying the San Antonio Spurs for second place in the Central Division . The Rockets defeated the Spurs two games to one in their first round playoff series , they were swept by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semi @-@ finals . 
 In the 1980 – 81 season , after the newly established Dallas Mavericks became the third NBA team in Texas , the NBA restructured the conferences and sent the Rockets , who had previously played in the Eastern Conference , to the Midwest Division of the Western Conference . In Harris 's second season , Houston tied with Kansas City for second place in the Midwest Division behind San Antonio with a 40 – 42 record , and qualified for the playoffs with just one game left . During the season , Murphy set two NBA records , by sinking 78 consecutive free throws to break Rick Barry 's mark of 60 set in 1976 , and achieving a free @-@ throw percentage of .958 , breaking Barry 's record set with the Rockets in 1979 . In the playoffs , Houston began a run that began when they upset Los Angeles two games to one , and then defeated George Gervin 's Spurs four games to three in the Western Conference semifinals . This resulted in a conference finals matchup with the Kansas City Kings , who were led by Otis Birdsong , Scott <unk> , and Phil Ford . When the Kings fell to the Rockets in five games , the Rockets became the only team in NBA history to advanced to the Finals after having a losing record in the regular season . However , after splitting the first four games of the series with Boston , Houston eventually lost in six games . The following season , the Rockets improved their regular season mark to 46 – 36 but were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs . Although Malone won the MVP in that season , and new owner Charlie Thomas expressed interest in renewing his contract , in the following offseason , the Rockets traded him to the Philadelphia 76ers for Caldwell Jones , to avoid paying his salary . When the Rockets finished a league worst 14 – 68 , Celtics coach Bill Fitch was hired to replace outgoing Del Harris , and after winning a coin flip with the Indiana Pacers to obtain the first pick of the 1983 NBA Draft , the Rockets selected Ralph Sampson from the University of Virginia . Sampson had good numbers as the Rockets finished only 29 – 53 in the 1983 – 1984 season , averaging 21 points and 11 rebounds per game and earning the NBA Rookie of the Year award . 
 = = The Hakeem Olajuwon era : 1984 – 2001 = = 
 = = = The Twin Towers era : 1984 – 1987 = = = 
 Houston was again given the first pick of the 1984 NBA Draft , and they used it to select Hakeem Olajuwon from the University of Houston . In his first season , Olajuwon finished second to Michael Jordan in NBA Rookie of the Year balloting , and the Rockets record improved by 19 games , although they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs . 
 In the following season , both Olajuwon and Sampson were named to the Western Conference All @-@ Stars in that year 's all @-@ star game , and the duo was nicknamed the " Twin Towers " . Houston won the Midwest Division title with a 51 – 31 record . In contrast to the other guard @-@ oriented teams of the Western Conference , the Rockets had a high rotation on the position – John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season , Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist , and Robert Reid took over as the starter from the final game of the regular season on . During the playoffs , the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard @-@ fought series with Alex English 's Denver Nuggets , including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile @-@ High City . The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4 – 2 . When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals , the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season . The Rockets , however , were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon 's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson 's alley @-@ oops notwithstanding . Embarrassed by the loss , Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star @-@ studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory , a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers . Sampson 's buzzer beater that won Game 5 was described by him as " the greatest moment of my basketball career " . The Rockets competed in the finals for only the second time in team history , once again facing the Celtics . Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before , yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff @-@ hardened Celtics front court of Bird , McHale and Parish . The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden , only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went back to Houston – a close game 3 under Sampson 's leadership , and a 15 point @-@ leading game 5 without him as he got ejected – while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitch Wiggins . Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtics . After the series , Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets , " the new monsters on the block " with the future looking very bright for the Rockets . During the six @-@ game championship series loss against the Celtics , Sampson averaged 14 @.@ 8 points on .438 shooting , 9 @.@ 5 rebounds and 3 @.@ 3 assists per game . 
 In the next year , the Rockets started poorly , winning only 15 of the first 33 games amidst injuries among the star players and off @-@ court controversies for the rest of the roster , such as Lewis Lloyd and Mitchell Wiggins getting suspended for cocaine use . The team still made the playoffs , and advanced to the second round past favored Clyde Drexler and his Portland Trail Blazers ( eventually proving to be their last playoff victory until 1993 ) , before being eliminated by the Seattle SuperSonics in Game 6 , a double @-@ overtime classic in which Olajuwon scored 49 points in the losing cause . 
 While Sampson signed a new deal prior to the 1987 – 88 NBA season , he was traded early in the season to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Joe Barry Carroll and Sleepy Floyd . Sampson only learned of the trade once he arrived in Houston after a road game . The Twin Towers were split just 18 months after their finals appearance . 
 = = = 1987 – 1992 : Lean Years = = = 
 During the next three seasons , the Rockets were eliminated three straight times in the first round of the playoffs , with the first of those in 1988 leading to Fitch 's dismissal . Don Chaney was hired to replace him . 
 Chaney was named the Coach of the Year for the 1990 – 91 season , after leading the Rockets to a 52 @-@ 30 record despite Olajuwon 's absence due to injury for 25 games . The Rockets were once again eliminated in the first round of the playoffs , 3 – 0 to the Lakers . Midway through the next season , with the Rockets ' record only 26 – 26 , Chaney was fired and replaced by one of his assistants , former Houston player Tomjanovich . Although the Rockets did not make the playoffs , in the next year , the Rockets won @-@ loss record improved by 13 games , as they won 55 games . Olajuwon won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award , and the Rockets clinched the Midwest title . The playoffs started with Houston 's first series victory in 5 years by defeating the Los Angeles Clippers , before an elimination by the SuperSonics during a game 7 overtime loss . 
 = = = Back to Back Championships : 1993 – 1995 = = = 
 On July 30 , 1993 , Leslie Alexander purchased the Rockets for $ 85 million . In Tomjanovich 's second full year as head coach , the Rockets began the 1993 – 94 season by tying an NBA record with start of 15 – 0 . Led by Olajuwon , who was named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year , the Rockets won a franchise @-@ record 58 games . The Rockets recovered from being two games down to the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs , to advance to the finals . Houston was once again down by three games to two to the New York Knicks , but they managed to win the last two games on their home court , and claim their first championship in franchise history . Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP , after averaging 27 points , nine rebounds and four blocked shots a game . 
 The Rockets initially struggled in the first half of the 1994 – 95 season , and ended up winning only 47 games , which was 11 games lower than their previous year 's total . In a midseason trade with Portland , the Rockets obtained guard Clyde Drexler , a former teammate of Olajuwon at the University of Houston , in exchange for Otis Thorpe . Houston entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference , but then started a strong playoff run that earned the nickname " Clutch City " . After pushing the 60 – 22 Utah Jazz to five games , the Rockets were down by seven points with 5 : 40 remaining before Drexler led a comeback . They fell behind 3 – 1 to the 59 – 23 Phoenix Suns in the second round , but won three straight to win the series , and became only the first team in NBA history to overcome both a 2 – 0 and a 3 – 1 series deficit in a seven @-@ game series . The Rocket then beat in the conference finals the 62 – 20 San Antonio Spurs , which included that season 's MVP David Robinson , with Olajuwon , averaging 35 @.@ 3 points and 12 @.@ 5 rebounds . The return to the Finals was against the Orlando Magic , led by Shaquille O 'Neal and Penny Hardaway . When Houston swept the series in four straight games , they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed – still the champion with the lowest seed , and the only without home court in any round – and the first to beat four 50 @-@ win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship . Olajuwon was named the Finals MVP , becoming only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years in a row . 
 During the offseason , the Rockets went for a change of visual identity , making navy blue and silver the new primary colors while adopting a new cartoon @-@ inspired logo and pinstriped jerseys . The Rockets won 48 games in the 1995 – 96 campaign , in which Olajuwon became the NBA 's all @-@ time leader in blocked shots . They beat the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs , but were swept by the Seattle SuperSonics in the second round . 
 = = = The Big Three Era : 1996 – 1999 = = = 
 Before the start of the succeeding season , the Rockets made a dramatic trade that sent four players to Phoenix in exchange for Charles Barkley . The resulting " Big Three " of Olajuwon , Drexler , and Barkley led the Rockets to a 57 – 25 record , and Houston swept Minnesota in the first round . However , after a 7 @-@ game battle with Seattle , the Rockets fell in the Western Conference finals to the Utah Jazz , a team they had beaten on their way to championships in 1994 and 1995 . 
 The 1997 – 98 season was marked by injuries , and the team finished 41 – 41 with the eighth seed in the Western Conference . Houston once again faced the Jazz , this time in the first round , and they lost the series 3 – 2 . Drexler retired after the season , and the Rockets made another bold trade to bring in Scottie Pippen to take his place . In the strike @-@ shortened 1998 – 99 season , the Rocket went 31 – 19 , but lost to the Lakers in the first round 3 – 1 of the playoffs . 
 = = = The End of The Big Three Era = = = 
 After the 1999 draft , the Rockets traded for the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies , in exchange for four players and a first round draft pick . However , after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland ( stating chemistry problems with old rival and now teammate Barkley ) , and Barkley suffered a career @-@ ending injury , the rebuilt Rockets went 34 – 48 and missed the playoffs , for only the second time in 15 years . In the 2000 – 01 season , the Rockets worked their way to a 45 – 37 record , but still did not make the playoffs . In the following offseason , a 38 @-@ year @-@ old Olajuwon requested a trade , and , despite stating their desire to keep him , the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement , sending him to the Toronto Raptors . The proceeding season was unremarkable , as Houston 's first season without Hakeem in almost 20 years was a disappointing 28 – 54 . 
 = = 2002 – 2011 : The Yao Ming era = = 
 However , after Houston was awarded the first overall pick in the 2002 NBA Draft , they selected Yao Ming , a 7 @-@ foot 6 @-@ inch Chinese center . The Rockets ' record improved by 15 games , but they missed the playoffs by one game . 
 In the following season , Houston began playing in their new arena , the Toyota Center , and redesigned their uniforms and logo , as long @-@ time coach Tomjanovich resigned after being diagnosed with bladder cancer , and was replaced by Jeff Van Gundy . The Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 45 – 37 , and earned their first playoff berth since 1999 , but the Lakers again handed the Rockets a loss in the first round . 
 = = = 2004 – 2010 : Ming and McGrady duo = = = 
 In the offseason , Houston saw major changes in the roster as the Rockets acquired Tracy McGrady in a seven @-@ player deal with the Orlando Magic . The 2004 – 05 season saw McGrady and Yao lead the Rockets to their best record in 10 years , finishing at 51 – 31 and seeded fifth in the Western Conference playoffs . However , their season ended in the first round of the playoffs as they lost to their in @-@ state rival , the Dallas Mavericks , in seven games , despite leading the series 2 – 0 . 
 The following season , after an injury @-@ plagued year in which McGrady and Yao missed a total of 70 games , the team finished with only 34 wins , and missed the playoffs . The Rockets improved by 18 games the next year , with 52 wins , but once again lost in the first round after leading 2 – 0 , when they lost in seven games to Utah . After the loss , Van Gundy was fired , and the Rockets hired Rick Adelman to replace him . In the following year , despite Yao suffering a season @-@ ending injury for the third year in a row , the Rockets won 22 consecutive games , which is the second longest winning streak in NBA history . This streak included going 13 @-@ 0 in the month of February , making them the first team since the 1996 Chicago Bulls to finish an entire month undefeated . Houston finished their season 55 – 27 , but were eliminated for the second year in row by the Jazz in the first round of the playoffs , 4 games to 2 . 
 The next off @-@ season , the Rockets acquired Ron Artest from the Sacramento Kings . The new " Big Three " of McGrady , Yao , and Artest barely played any games together due to nagging injuries . McGrady 's knee bothered him for much of the year , hampering his performance , and he eventually opted for mid @-@ season microfracture surgery which would keep him out for the season . Despite this , the team then went on to win 53 games that season and earned themselves a first @-@ round match @-@ up with the Portland Trail Blazers . Houston struck fast , blowing the <unk> out on the road in game one en route to a 4 – 2 series win and their first time advancing from the first round since 1997 . The games against the Blazers were also the last ever of Dikembe Mutombo 's career , as he injured his knee and was forced to retire after 18 seasons in the NBA . However , despite winning the first game of the 2009 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers , the Rockets ended up losing a tough @-@ fought series in seven games , and saw Yao leave with an injury , that eventually sidelined him for the upcoming season . During the off @-@ season , sixth man Von <unk> left for Greece , and Artest left the team after signing with the Lakers , but the Rockets acquired Laker defensive star Trevor Ariza using the Disabled Player Exception granted by the league due to Yao 's injury . 
 On September 23 , 2009 , the Rockets unveiled new alternate uniforms , which were inspired by the 1994 – 95 championship uniforms and featured similar colors . On February 18 , 2010 , hours before the trade deadline , the Rockets acquired Kevin Martin , Jordan Hill , Hilton Armstrong , and Jared Jeffries in a three @-@ team trade that sent Tracy McGrady to the New York Knicks , and Joey Dorsey and Carl Landry to the Sacramento Kings . Despite the stellar play of Martin and Aaron Brooks , with the latter being named the NBA Most Improved Player , the Rockets could not make it to the playoffs , finishing 42 – 40 , 3rd in the Southwest Division . At that time , the Rockets set an NBA record for best record by a team with no All @-@ Stars . 
 The Rockets drafted Patrick Patterson of Kentucky with the 14th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft . On July 15 , the Rockets signed free agent Brad Miller . About one month later , Trevor Ariza was traded to the New Orleans Hornets in a four @-@ team , five @-@ player trade . The Rockets received Courtney Lee from the New Jersey Nets in return . 
 The 2010 – 11 NBA season started badly for the Rockets , who lost the first five games . In the seventh , Yao Ming injured his left ankle in what was just his fifth game that season . After being examined , what was thought to be a mild sprain turned out to be a stress fracture which kept Yao off of the court for another season . In July 2011 , Yao , only 30 , retired after a series of unfortunate injuries cut his career short . 
 By the All @-@ Star break in February 2011 , the Rockets were 26 @-@ 31 . On February 24 , 2011 , the Rockets traded Shane Battier to the Memphis Grizzlies for Hasheem Thabeet and a first round pick . They also traded Aaron Brooks to the Phoenix Suns for Goran Dragić and a first round pick . Afterwards the team won 15 games out of 20 , reaching a winning record and contending for a playoff spot . The team entered April with chances of qualifying for the postseason , but for the second straight season the Rockets failed to make the playoffs after losing to the New Orleans Hornets in Louisiana with three games remaining . The team still finished the year with a 43 @-@ 39 winning record . Head coach Rick Adelman left the Rockets right after the season . On June 1 , 2011 , the Rockets named Kevin McHale their next head coach . With the 14th pick of the 2011 NBA Draft , the Houston Rockets selected Marcus Morris from the University of Kansas . With the 38th pick in that same draft , they selected Chandler Parsons from the University of Florida . 
 During an offseason extended by the 2011 NBA lockout , the Rockets ' front office started to plan a roster overhaul , and after the lockout ended , the team tried to use their cap space to attract many high @-@ profile free agents , including Chris Paul , <unk> and Pau Gasol . 
 Nearing the trade deadline on March 15 , 2012 , the Rockets traded Hasheem Thabeet and Jonny Flynn to the Portland Trail Blazers for Marcus Camby . The Rockets also sent Jordan Hill to the Lakers in return for Derek Fisher ( who was waived shortly after and signed with the Thunder ) and a first round pick in the 2012 NBA Draft . During the strike @-@ shortened 2011 – 12 season , the Rockets were eliminated from playoff contention during the season 's penultimate game against eventual champions Miami Heat . 
 Before the 2012 NBA Draft , the Milwaukee Bucks traded the 12th overall pick , Shaun Livingston , Jon Brockman , and Jon <unk> to the Rockets for the 14th overall pick and Samuel <unk> . The Minnesota Timberwolves also traded the 18th pick in the draft to Houston for Chase <unk> . In the 2012 NBA Draft , Houston drafted Jeremy Lamb of Connecticut , Royce White of Iowa State , and Terrence Jones of Kentucky with the 12th , 16th , and 18th picks , respectively . 
 = = James Harden era ( 2012 – present ) = = 
 During the 2012 NBA offseason , the Rockets made significant changes to their roster . Early in July , they traded Kyle Lowry to the Toronto Raptors , let Goran Dragić return to the Phoenix Suns via free agency , and saw the arrival of 201 pick Donatas <unk> from Lithuania , who was signed to a multiyear deal . On July 13 , the Rockets released veteran forward Luis Scola using their one @-@ time amnesty clause . On July 18 , The Rockets signed Jeremy Lin , a restricted free agent , to a three @-@ year , $ 25 @.@ 1 million contract after the New York Knicks decided not to match the Rockets ' offer sheet . Lin achieved worldwide fame with a 25 @-@ game stretch of high performance basketball play known as " Linsanity " , where he stepped up in place of the Knicks ' injured players . On July 20 , Ömer Aşık , a restricted free agent from the Chicago Bulls , signed a three @-@ year , $ 25 @.@ 1 million offer sheet with the Rockets . The Bulls decided to not match the offer , and on July 24 , <unk> officially joined the Rockets . On October 27 , 2012 , the Rockets traded Kevin Martin , Jeremy Lamb , and two future first @-@ round picks to the Oklahoma City Thunder for reigning sixth man of the year James Harden , along with Cole Aldrich , Daequan Cook , and Lazar Hayward . Harden stepped out of his previous sixth man role and into the starting lineup for the Rockets . He had 37 points , 12 assists , 6 rebounds , 4 steals , and a block in his debut as a Rocket , while Jeremy Lin had 12 points , 4 rebounds , 8 assists , and 4 steals . Harden also signed a 5 @-@ year contract extension with the Rockets worth approximately $ 80 million a few days after the trade was completed . Harden scored a then career @-@ high 45 points in his second game with the Rockets against the Atlanta Hawks . Jeremy Lin tied a career @-@ high of 38 points in an overtime loss to the Spurs while Harden sat out with an ankle sprain . Harden was selected to the 2013 NBA All @-@ Star Game , which was held in Houston . On February 5 , 2013 , the Houston Rockets made 23 3 @-@ point field goals in a game against the Golden State Warriors , equaling the NBA team record . In this game , the Rockets also achieved a home game record for most points scored at the Toyota Center with a 140 @-@ 109 victory . 
 On February 20 , 2013 , the Rockets acquired Thomas Robinson , the fifth overall pick in the 2012 NBA Draft , in a trade with the Sacramento Kings where Houston sent Marcus Morris and Patrick Patterson . On that same night , the Rockets defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 122 @-@ 119 after trailing by 14 with 6 : 58 remaining in the game . James Harden scored a then career high of 46 points in the win over his former team . Despite being the youngest team in the NBA , the Rockets became one of the highest scoring offenses in the NBA . Even more remarkable was that only two players – starting forward Chandler Parsons and backup forward / center Greg Smith ( who rarely played in his rookie season ) – were left from the 2011 – 12 roster . Head coach Kevin McHale ran an up @-@ tempo offense that put emphasis on transition baskets , shooting three @-@ pointers , and playing at a fast pace . As a result , the Rockets became one of the highest scoring offenses in the NBA , leading the league in scoring for the majority of the season . In the post @-@ season , the Rockets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round , losing the series 4 @-@ 2 . In the 2012 – 13 NBA season , James Harden evolved into franchise player for the Rockets , averaging 25 @.@ 9 points a game . 
 = = = 2013 – 2016 : Harden and Howard duo = = = 
 Eager to add another franchise player to their team , the Rockets heavily pursued free agent center Dwight Howard in the 2013 offseason . On July 5 , 2013 , Howard announced via his Twitter account that he intended to sign with the Houston Rockets after the July moratorium period ended . The NBA fined the Rockets $ 150 @,@ 000 for talking about Howard during this moratorium period . Dwight Howard officially signed with the Rockets on July 13 , 2013 . Led by the new inside @-@ out combination of Howard and James Harden , and with a strong supporting cast including Chandler Parsons , Jeremy Lin , and Ömer Aşık , the Rockets were expected to jump into title contention in the upcoming season . However , in the post @-@ season , the Rockets were defeated in the first round by the Portland Trail Blazers , losing the series 4 @-@ 2 . 
 Following a season of ups @-@ and @-@ downs with injury and form , Jeremy Lin was traded to the Lakers on July 13 , 2014 . That same day , the Rockets declined to match the three @-@ year , $ 46 million offer sheet that Chandler Parsons received from the Mavericks , and to compensate for his departure , the Rockets agreed to bring back Trevor Ariza on a four @-@ year , $ 32 million deal in free agency . The deal was officially completed as a three @-@ team trade , in which the Rockets received Ariza in a sign and trade from the Washington Wizards and traded Ömer Aşık to the New Orleans Pelicans . 
 With double @-@ digits wins against the Lakers , Utah , Boston and Philadelphia to start the 2014 – 15 NBA season , the Rockets recorded a 4 @-@ 0 start for the first time since they won their first six games of the 1996 – 97 season . By recording double @-@ digit wins against Miami and San Antonio in their next two games , the Rockets won each of their first six games by 10 points or more , and became the first team to accomplish the feat since the 1985 – 86 Denver Nuggets . In December , the Rockets acquired Corey Brewer and Josh Smith , two veterans who added depth to the roster . While the Rockets had many key players miss time throughout the entire season , James Harden took it upon himself to keep the Rockets near the top of the conference ; turning him into an MVP front @-@ runner . On March 20 , 2015 , James Harden scored a career @-@ high 50 points in a 118 – 108 victory over the Nuggets . Harden became the first Rocket to score 50 points since Hakeem Olajuwon scored 51 against the Celtics in 1996 . On April 1 , Harden scored 51 points in a 115 – 111 win over the Sacramento Kings , becoming the first player in franchise history to record multiple 50 point games in a season . On April 15 , 2015 , the Rockets won their 56th game of the season and finished with the third @-@ best regular season record in franchise history . On that same night , the Rockets claimed their first ever Southwest Division title and first Division crown since 1994 . In the playoffs , the Rockets beat the Mavericks 4 @-@ 1 in the first round . In the Conference Semifinals , the Los Angeles Clippers built a 3 @-@ 1 lead over the Rockets , before the Rockets won the last three games in the series to return to the Conference Finals for the first time in 18 years , this time against the Golden State Warriors . With their win over the Clippers , the Rockets became just the ninth team in NBA history to win a playoff series in which they faced a 3 @-@ 1 deficit . In the Conference Finals , the Warriors won the first three games before Harden scored 45 points to win Game 4 at the Toyota Center . The Warriors then finished the series in Game 5 , winning 4 @-@ 1 . 
 Prior to the 2015 – 16 season , the Rockets drafted Sam Dekker and <unk> Harrell , and acquired Ty Lawson from the Denver Nuggets by sending them Joey Dorsey , Nick Johnson , Kostas Papanikolaou , Pablo <unk> , and a 2016 first round draft pick . Kevin McHale was fired at the beginning of the season , as the Rockets only won 4 of the first 11 games . His assistant J. B. Bickerstaff took over coaching duties . Inconsistent play led to the Rockets struggling to remain in the playoff qualifying zone , and there has been a recent spate of trade rumors , mostly involving Ty Lawson and Dwight Howard . The Miami Heat have been pursuing Howard in trade talks , and have been rumored to offer up Hassan Whiteside plus salary cap filler . Houston only clinched its 2016 playoffs spot by winning its last game against the Kings , finishing the season 41 @-@ 41 to earn an eight seed . The adversary was again the Warriors , who had a record @-@ breaking regular season . The Rockets would once again lose in 5 games , this time in the first round of the Playoffs .

 Shot on location at an orphanage and two factories in central Java , Panggilan Darah was a modest commercial success in the Indies and Singapore . Its soundtrack , which featured nine kroncong songs , received popular acclaim , and the film 's acting received critical praise .

 The sisters decide to run away from Iskak 's home . They make their way to Kudus and find work at the Nitisemito clove cigarette factory with the help of their friend ( S. Poniman ) . Not long after their escape , Iskak receives a guest who reveals that the two were his nieces . This revelation spurs Iskak to take out advertisements in newspapers , looking for the young women and asking them to return to Batavia . 
 Iskak 's search has little success until the sisters receive news that he is looking for them , and they quickly return to Batavia . There , the sisters are greeted with open arms . Iskak 's wife regrets her earlier treatment of the girls and repents , treating them splendidly and supporting Dhalia 's plans to open an orphanage .

 Panggilan Darah was the directorial debut of Sutan Usman Karim , commonly known as Suska , a journalist and former member of the touring theatrical group Bolero under Andjar Asmara . With Panggilan Darah , which he also wrote , Suska became one of several reporters who entered the film industry in the 1940s . He directed the film for the Batavia @-@ based film company Oriental , run by the ethnic Chinese producer Tjho Seng Han . The production house had previously released three films , all directed by Njoo Cheong Seng , but after Njoo departed for Fred Young 's Majestic , Oriental had required a new director . 
 The film was shot in black @-@ and @-@ white by the Indo cameraman J. J. W. Steffens , with editing handled by Soemardjan . Scenes were shot at an orphanage for Muslims owned by S. Z. <unk> ( who played herself in the film ) , as well as at the Nitisemito cigarette factory in Kudus and at a batik factory in Pekalongan owned by Tan <unk> Lin . Writing in 2009 , the Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran suggested that the film may have been partly sponsored by Nitisemito — one of the largest cigarette factories in the Indies in the 1940s — based on the factory 's prominence in the plot . 
 Dhalia , Soerip , and S. Poniman , already known for their singing prowess , starred in Panggilan Darah , which featured nine kroncong songs . Additional roles were taken by Wolly Sutinah and Mochtar Widjaja . The film marked Sutinah 's debut for the company ; the other cast members had previous screen credits with Oriental .

 Panggilan Darah debuted at the Orion Theatre in Batavia on 30 June 1941 . It was reported as a modest success , making most of its money from lower class audiences . It was screened in Surabaya , East Java , by August , and by September it had been shown in Singapore , then part of British Malaya . A novelisation by Roestam Sutan Palindih was published by the Yogyakarta @-@ based Kolff @-@ Buning Publishers that year . 
 Reviews of Panggilan Darah were mixed to positive . The journalist <unk> , writing in the entertainment magazine Pertjatoeran Doenia dan Film , was pleased with the film 's depiction of the Islamic mandate to take care of orphans . An anonymous review in the Surabaya @-@ based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad found the film " something special " and praised Soerip 's spontaneity in her role . Biran wrote that lower @-@ class audiences enjoyed the film 's music , while the intelligentsia scoffed at the idea that a factory supervisor would bring a guitar to work . He found the plot illogical , asking why the sisters would not have worked in their own home village and how the destitute sisters could have made the journey from Batavia to Kudus , over 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) away . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Unable to recoup its expenses , Oriental later merged into the Dutch @-@ owned Multi Film and ceased producing works of fiction . Suska left the company and joined The Teng Chun 's Java Industrial Film , for which he directed Ratna Moetoe Manikam . Most of the cast remained active in cinema for the remainder of their lives . Both Dhalia and Soerip remained in the film industry for the next fifty years ; they acted in their last feature films , Pendekar Jagad Kelana ( Warrior of Jagad Kelana ) and <unk> Cinta <unk> ( Since Love was Created ) respectively , in 1990 . Poniman and Sutinah would remain active in the industry until 1975 and 1986 . Only Widjaja is not recorded as performing in any more films . 
 Panggilan Darah was screened as late as August 1952 , but may now be lost . Movies in the Indies were recorded on highly flammable nitrate film , and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara 's warehouse in 1952 , old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed . The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost . However , J. B. Kristanto 's Katalog Film Indonesia ( Indonesian Film Catalogue ) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia 's archives , and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service .

 On July 7 , 2011 , " Otis " was previewed along with the other songs from Watch the Throne by Jay @-@ Z at a private listening session at the Mercer Hotel in New York City . A select group of reporters , music journalists , and contest winners were present at the listening session . After the listening session , it was confirmed that a song called " Otis " , would appear on the album . It was reported that the song would sample soul music singer Otis Redding 's version of " Try a Little Tenderness " . On July 20 , " Otis " was premiered on Funkmaster Flex 's Hot 97 radio show and subsequently was released for download to the Internet as a way to promote the upcoming album . On July 22 , the song was released to the iTunes Store and was a free download for those who pre @-@ ordered the album . It was sent by The Island Def Jam Music Group to rhythmic contemporary and urban contemporary radio on August 9 . The cover art for " Otis " was designed by Italian fashion designer Riccardo Tisci , who had previously designed the artwork for the " H • A • M " single cover and the Watch the Throne album cover . It features the American flag , both artists names and the name of the song and the album . The artwork was released onto the internet following the song 's release and could be downloaded along with the song . 
 Bu Thiam , Def Jam Vice @-@ President of A & R , was with West and Jay @-@ Z throughout the recording process and saw how the duo came up with several of the Watch the Throne tracks . He recalled the story of the song " Otis " : " [ Kanye ] was late for his flight , we were in the studio working all day and he was late for his flight . As we were leaving he was like , ' Yo hold on for a second . ' So he drops his bags and goes to the MPC ( beat machine ) and his assistant is rushing him and he 's just <unk> with [ the beat ] . What 's so crazy is the whole time he 's doing that Jay is writing his verses in his head . But Jay is watching the NBA playoffs , I think it was the championship ; Miami Heat & Dallas Mavericks . So Jay is watching the playoffs . I 'm not even thinking Jay is paying attention to what ' Ye is doing and by the time he is finished it 's like ' I invented swag ... ' And I 'm like , ' What the f--- just happened ? ' " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Otis " is two minutes and fifty @-@ eight seconds long and is a mid @-@ tempo hip @-@ hop song . The song , which was produced by West , is built upon a sample of Try a Little Tenderness by Otis Redding . Jay @-@ Z and West promptly rap over the sample in style reminiscent to past Kanye productions . Pitchfork Media 's Tom Breihan summarized the composition , writing 
 ... here 's Jay @-@ Z on the " Otis " intro : " It sounds so soulful ! Don 't you agree ? " Well , yeah . If you 're willing to plunk down enough money to sample " Try a Little Tenderness " , that 'll happen . But even if the sample works as a sort of audio money @-@ flaunt , it 's also a tough and hard chop from Kanye — Otis Redding 's magnificent voice mostly limited to a couple of hellfire grunts , the song itself held to a sharp guitar stab . " 
 Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated 
 the single Otis boldly samples Otis Redding 's Try a Little Tenderness , an idea that veers wildly from inspired – at one point the ballad is manipulated into a propulsive sweaty grunt @-@ a @-@ thon – to a <unk> mess . 
 The song ends with sampled screaming . Some people believe the song also includes a part from Datsik 's " Swagga , " which is a dubstep track . The part is included when Jay @-@ Z says , " guess I got my swagga back . " This is a common misconception . Jay @-@ Z is making a reference to one of his earlier songs " All I Need " from The Blueprint which Datsik samples the line from . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The song received highly positive reviews from critics and the style has been compared to that of West 's The College Dropout album . Pitchfork Media 's Tom <unk> praised the song , saying " Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus , each one building on whatever the last one <unk> an old @-@ school rap @-@ collab style you almost never hear anymore . And since these guys are working loose and casual , it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance . Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that " West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding ’ s " Try a Little Tenderness " into a Blueprint @-@ style barrage , setting the stage for some slick collar @-@ popping from Jay @-@ Z ( " Photo shoot fresh , looking like wealth / I ’ m about to call the paparazzi on myself " ) . Jay ’ s performance , in turn , inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ( " Luxury rap , the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance , write my curses in cursive " ) ; the younger star sounds like he pulled an all @-@ <unk> trying to outdo his mentor ’ s rhymes . " Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review , stating that " What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave . For that reason , it 's unquestionably An Event " , though feeling " In all honesty , if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we 'll all be a bit disappointed . " 
 Seattle Weekly 's Joe Williams enjoyed the song , writing " even with the slow , bubbling beat and energetic keyboards , topped with top @-@ notch delivery by Jay and Kay , it 's Redding in the background that gives the single its true life and flair . " Josiah Hughes of Exclaim ! magazine commented that " if the over @-@ the @-@ top aggression of " H • A • M " had you worried that this would be a Waka Flocka ripoff , fear not , as " Otis " makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel @-@ good boom @-@ bap . " Sam Gould ' ' ' The Independent ' ' ' remarked " having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere , Eminem and old partner @-@ in @-@ crime Royce da 5 ' 9 " start work on their own bruising collaborative effort , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren $ y take steps in the same direction , Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged , and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast . " ' ' ' The New York Observer ' ' ' writer Foster Kamer mused , " remember early Kanye ? These guys finally do . ' Otis ' is the perfect anti @-@ single for this album , because it 's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there . Not only do they not need hooks , neither of them need to remind us that they don 't . There was that first line of ' ' ' My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ' ' ' , ' I fantasized ' bout this back in Chicago , ' and then , the relief after it , where you didn 't have to worry about the rest of that album " , and Billboard claimed " Otis gets better with each play " . 
 However , Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot was less enthusiastic about the track , musing that " the references to luxury cars and private jets quickly lose their escapist luster , grossly out of step with a summer in which joblessness and foreclosure are becoming all too common for many Americans " and that " just as disappointing is that the Redding sample – a thrilling burst of agitated vocals , classic Memphis horns , organ and drums – never goes anywhere . " In an interview with Redding 's widow , Zelma Redding , Us Weekly reported that Mrs. Redding approved the song , saying " We are proud that Otis ' legacy continues to inspire some of today 's popular artists . We like ' Otis ' and thank Kanye and Jay @-@ Z for honoring our Otis through their music . " 
 Pitchfork Media named the song the 42nd best song of 2011 . XXL named the song the fifth best of the year , and Spin named the song the 17th . Time 's Claire Suddath placed the song at number four on her best of the year list , writing " the lead single off Watch the Throne mixes and loops Otis Redding 's passionate shouts and screams from " Try a Little Tenderness , " paying homage to his soulful style while mixing it up by adding heavy beats and chopping up the original track 's piano tune . " Complex named the song the 100th best Jay @-@ Z song of all time . At the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012 , " Otis " was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance , winning the latter .
