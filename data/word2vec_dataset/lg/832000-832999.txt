 = Stefan Czarniecki = 
 Stefan Czarniecki [ <unk> t ͡ <unk> ͡ skʲi ] of the <unk> coat of arms ( 1599 – 16 February 1665 ) was a Polish nobleman , general and military commander . In his career he rose from a petty nobleman to a magnate holding one of the highest offices in the Commonwealth , something that was unprecedented in the Commonwealth history . On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the voivode of Kiev and on 2 January 1665 , a few weeks before his death , he was given the office of Field Hetman ( one of top military commanders ) of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom . He is remembered as an accomplished military commander , and regarded as a Polish national hero . His status in Polish history is acknowledged by a mention of his name in the Polish national anthem . 
 Czarniecki made significant contributions fighting the Khmelnytsky Uprising , during the Russo @-@ Polish War , and the Polish – Swedish war ( The Deluge ) . His use of guerrilla warfare against Swedes is credited as one of the main reason for the eventual Polish victory in this war . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Stefan Czarniecki was born in 1599 in the family estate of <unk> by <unk> in southern Poland in a szlachta ( nobility ) Czarniecki family . The date of his birth is only an assumption , as no documents exist to prove it without a doubt ; most historians , as noted by historians Leszek <unk> and Adam Kersten , accept the 1599 date , although historian Zdzisław <unk> argued for 1604 . His father , Krzysztof Czarniecki , was a soldier who participated in several wars in the late 16th and early 17th century , and eventually became a courtier to Polish queen Constance of Austria . Whereas historian <unk> Nagielski notes that the Czarniecki family was not well off , which limited some of Stefan 's life chances , Podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town , and the family wealth was " not small " . However , Stefan had ten siblings ( he himself was the sixth out of nine brothers ) , and divided into that many parts , the family resources would be stretched rather thin . However , involvement with the queen 's court allowed Krzysztof to boost his son 's careers with the court influence , where they were often able to serve as young courtiers themselves . 
 Nothing is known about Stefan 's childhood . His family could not afford to send him to a university abroad ( only one of his brothers would do so ) ; hence he embarked early on a military career . Before that , he attended a <unk> college , either in Kraków or Sandomierz , achieving a solid secondary education . After finishing his schooling , he became a courtier to then @-@ royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa . As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit , he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries , joining them as towarzysz ( companion , a junior cavalry officer ) in the spring of 1621 . Already an officer at the age of eighteen , he took part in the battle of Chocim ( Khotyn ) in 1621 , where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish – Ottoman War ( 1620 – 21 ) . His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years , where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory . 
 The next time he took arms was in 1623 , when his brother Paweł received a nomination as a rotmistrz of light ( cossack ) cavalry of the regular army ( wojsko kwarciane ) , and recruited some of siblings , including Stefan , into his unit . They served under hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski in the campaigns against the Tatars in 1624 ( participating in the battle of <unk> ) . In 1625 they took part in the quelling of a Cossack Zhmaylo Uprising . He fought later against Gustavus Adolphus ( 1626 – 1629 ) ( part of the Polish – Swedish War ) . His light cavalry was used in reconnaissance , diversion , and raiding the enemy territory . In 1627 Stefan , serving in his brother 's chorągiew , was promoted to chorąży . On 6 – 7 August that year he participated in the battle of Tczew , where Gustavus Adolphus was nearly killed . During those years , he learned much from observing a mastery of military arts , hetman Koniecpolski , who often commanded the Polish army in which he served , and from Poland 's Swedish opponents , and earlier from the Cossacks and Tatars they fought . 
 As the Polish – Swedish war ended , in 1630 Czarniecki enlisted in the Habsburg forces and continued to fight against the Swedes , participating in the battle of Breitenfeld . In 1633 he joined the Commonwealth forces again , to fight under the new Polish king , Władysław IV , in the Smolensk War against Muscovy that lasted until 1634 . During the Smolensk War he learned Western tactics used by the foreign mercenary troops . In December 1633 he commanded a raiding unit that successfully raided and pillaged behind the Russian lines , spreading terror , disrupting supply lines , and burned Kozelsk . For his achievements in that war , in which he advanced to a porucznik rank in the light " cossack " cavalry unit under hetman Marcin Kazanowski , he received some land in the Smolensk Voivodeship near Starodub . 
 After that war , he moved to a more prestigious hussar unit ( rota ) , and likely due to a reduction of the royal army , he served in the private formation of Władysław <unk> and later , voivode Stanisław Lubomirski . In 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa , and possibly accompanied the king to Vienna . In 1637 he married Zofia <unk> , and later that year he fought in the <unk> Uprising against the rebellious Cossacks under Pavel <unk> , participating in the battle of <unk> . He led a cavalry charge at <unk> which was instrumental for the Polish victory there . Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm ( parliament ) in Warsaw . 
 = = = Struggles against the Cossacks = = = 
 For the next several years he would serve on the always @-@ virulent south @-@ eastern border , where he made his home in the city of <unk> . In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmatów where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey 's ( <unk> Bej ) Tatars . He served as one of seven <unk> in Koniecpolski 's army , and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle , bringing him much fame . That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit , but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars . 
 He took an active part in the battles against the Cossacks in the Khmelnytsky Uprising . On 16 May 1648 he was one of the many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody , but he was quickly ransomed . He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress , which surrendered on 26 September ; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649 , in the aftermath of the Treaty of <unk> . He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorągiew of hetman Mikołaj Potocki , a military judge deputized by the hetman , and a member of his staff , meeting with the new king of Poland , John Casimir Vasa . He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651 . He received the title of chorąży of Sandomierz , and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652 . According to Nagielski , Czarniecki , while returning from the Sejm , witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh ; This scene made him reject the notions that a compromise with the enemies of the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome . <unk> however notes that another historian , Wojciech Jacek <unk> , questions Czarniecki 's presence there , and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh , The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred ; illustrating that is a letter <unk> wrote soon after the battle , in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him , he will leave few Ruthenians alive . 
 Later that year Czarniecki received territories from the king , along with the office of Crown <unk> . In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine , ransacking much of the Cossack @-@ held lands , although the attrition among the troops was high . During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at <unk> . He continued his suppression campaign in 1654 , and the following January took part in the battle of <unk> . In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw , as the king John Casimir Vasa , respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council , convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden . At that time his reputation was significant ; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine , and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans , then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth . On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev , a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland . 
 = = = The Swedish Deluge = = = 
 When Charles X of Sweden invaded Poland in 1655 , Czarniecki distinguished himself by his defence of Kraków , which he eventually surrendered on good terms , retreating with his army . He remained loyal to the Polish king , even when much of the army , including most of the senators and the hetmans , temporarily joined the Swedes . His vocal support for the wavering king , which at that time found refuge abroad , and was considering abdication , was instrumental . For his continuing support , the Polish king rewarded him with more lands , and the office of the royal army regimentarz . 
 He led guerrilla warfare against Swedish troops of Charles X , a type of a campaign he authored , despite the objections of the hetmans , who by that time returned to serve under John <unk> Vasa . The mobile Swedish forces , even with their significant firepower , proved to be rather vulnerable to Czarniecki 's guerrilla @-@ style warfare . Czarniecki was defeated at the battle of <unk> in mid @-@ February 1656 , but later inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes , notably at the Battle of Warka in April that year . The tide of the war turned several times that year , and he was again defeated at the battle of <unk> and battle of <unk> . His defeats , however , were limited , and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order . Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops in Greater Poland proved highly successful . It was against his advice that the battle of Warsaw was fought , and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat . Despite support from the king , Czarniecki was seen by many older , established noble family as an arrogant newcomer , and they prevented him from getting the hetman office that year ; instead early next year he received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia , and an extraordinary title of the " general and vice commander of the royal forces " , which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman @-@ like authority . The Field Crown <unk> went to Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski , also an accomplished commander , if not so much as Czarniecki – but from a magnate Lubomirski family ; Czarniecki commented famously that " Not of salt , or fields , I am , but from what hurts me " , alluding to the fact that <unk> family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture , whereas his smaller one was built through military service – yet it was money and politics , not military experience , that decided who was to get the hetman 's office . 
 = = = Final battles = = = 
 In 1657 he was instrumental in defeating the forces of George II Rákóczi at the battle of <unk> . In 1658 and 1659 he aided Danes during the Danish – Swedish War , fighting at Als and at the battle of Kolding . 
 On the conclusion of the Peace of Oliwa , which adjusted the long outstanding differences between Poland and Sweden , Czarniecki was transferred to the eastern frontier where the war with Russia reignited . He distinguished himself in the campaign of 1660 , where he won the victories of the battle of <unk> , battle of <unk> , and battle of <unk> . This campaign , however , marked the zenith of his popularity . King John II Casimir Vasa attempted to involve him in the unpopular plan of vivente rege – to bypass the traditions of the royal elections in Poland and instead chose the next successor to the Polish throne ( John II Casimir favored Louis , Grand Condé ) still during the life of the previous king . His reputation among the unpaid and dissenting military took a dive ; and many criticized him for appropriating the entire ransom that the Russians paid for their prisoners from <unk> . During the Sejm of 1662 some military representatives demanded sanctions and punishments to be levied on him . 
 His last campaign took place at the end of 1664 . He led an army against the Russians , but the Siege of <unk> was not successful , and a new Cossack uprising of Ivan <unk> forced the Polish troops to fall back . 
 On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the voivode of Kiev , and on 2 January 1665 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman . Before receiving the news of the nomination he desired for years , he was wounded at <unk> . Called back by the king , who feared that magnate Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski that he just banished might start a rebellion , his recent wound became infected , and he died on 16 February 1665 in <unk> ( now <unk> ) near Lwów , six weeks after receiving this supreme distinction . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Czarniecki received a state funeral in Warsaw , and has been interred in the tomb chapel of the church founded by him in <unk> . He left his estates to a nephew , Stefan Stanisław Czarniecki , but the Czarniecki name did not last long , and the wealth he gathered became instead the foundation of the Branicki family of magnates . 
 Czarniecki is remembered as one of the most able Polish commanders of all times . Podhorecki called him the greatest Polish military expert in " hit @-@ and @-@ run tactics " , and notes that he was the longest @-@ serving of the major Polish military commanders of his era , that he participated in 27 large battles , commanding 17 of them . He is seen as instrumental in defeating the Swedes during the Deluge , although he was even more successful in his battles against the Russians . His career , rising from a simple noble family to the rank of a hetman and a wealthy magnate , was unprecedented in the Commonwealth 's history . 
 His legend had begun growing even during his lifetime , as he became a hero of poems and songs . Few negative rumors about him , popular in the last few years of his life , survived after his death . During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanisław Potocki , Franciszek <unk> , Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski . A biography by Michał <unk> cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion . That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century , where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism , and a reminder of military successes . He appears in the poem <unk> of Zygmunt Krasiński , but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz , particularly the second book , The Deluge . It was during that time that his pursuit of the retreating Swedes to Pomerania and Denmark ( 1658 – 1659 ) , particularly his crossing with his entire army to the Danish isle of <unk> , was commemorated in the song of the Polish Napoleonic Legions that would eventually become the Polish national anthem , the " Dąbrowski 's Mazurka " , with the words commemorating his marine excursion to the island of Als : It was only during the time of the Second Polish Republic when more modern , serious historical work begun analyzing his history that a less hagiographic account begun emerging ; Władysław Czapliński wrote that Czarniecki was " first and foremost a soldier " , and noted his faults such as brutality and greed . Modern historiography of Czarniecki includes works of Czapliński , Stanisław Herbst , Adam Kersten and Zdzisław <unk> ; however Podhorecki notes that while he has been a major figure in the Polish history , and is discussed extensively in Polish historiography , he has never been a subject of much interest to foreign historians , concluding that he was a major persona in Polish , but not European , history . 
 = SS Montanan = 
 SS Montanan was a cargo ship built in 1912 for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company . During World War I service for the United States Army Transport Service , she was known as USAT Montanan . Montanan was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company , and was employed in inter @-@ coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened . 
 In World War I , USAT Montanan carried cargo and animals to France , and was in the first American convoy to sail to France after the United States entered the war in April 1917 . While in another eastbound convoy in August 1918 , USAT Montanan was torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 90 some 500 nmi ( 900 km ) west of Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer , France . Of the 86 men aboard the ship , 81 were rescued by a convoy escort ; five men died in the attack . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 In September 1911 , the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point , Maryland , for four new cargo ships — Minnesotan , Dakotan , Montanan , and Pennsylvanian . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8 % profit for Maryland Steel , but with a maximum cost of $ 640 @,@ 000 per ship . The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5 % down payment in cash , with nine monthly installments for the balance . The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer @-@ term notes or mortgages . The final cost of Montanan , including financing costs , was $ 73 @.@ 62 per deadweight ton , which came out to just over $ 692 @,@ 000 . 
 Montanan ( Maryland Steel yard no . 126 ) was the second ship built under the original contract . She was launched on 25 January 1913 , and delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian in April . Montanan was 6 @,@ 649 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 428 ft 9 in ( 130 @.@ 68 m ) in length and 53 ft 7 in ( 16 @.@ 33 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 9 @,@ 406 LT DWT , and her cargo holds , which had a storage capacity of 438 @,@ 154 cu ft ( 12 @,@ 407 @.@ 1 m3 ) , were outfitted with a complete refrigeration plant so that she could carry perishable products from the West Coast — such as fresh produce from Southern California farms — to the East Coast . Montanan had a single steam engine powered by oil @-@ fired boilers which drove a single screw propeller at a speed of 15 kn ( 17 mph ; 28 km / h ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 When Montanan began sailing for American @-@ Hawaiian , the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii , and vice versa . Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports — Salina Cruz , Oaxaca , for eastbound cargo , and Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz , for westbound cargo — and traversed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , while westbound cargoes were more general in nature . Montanan sailed in this service on the east side of North America . 
 While headed from New York to Coatzacoalcos in October 1913 , Montanan ran aground on <unk> Reef , north of The Bahamas . Answering Montanan 's distress calls , the Standard Oil Company tanker Rayo assisted in freeing Montanan from the reef . Although she was leaking slightly , Montanan continued on to her destination , and put in for repairs after a return trip to New York . 
 Following the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 ( which took place while six American @-@ Hawaiian ships were being held in various Mexican ports ) , the Huerta @-@ led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping . This loss of access , coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open , caused American @-@ Hawaii to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April . With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to the canal route . 
 On 2 December , The Washington Post reported an incident involving Montanan . While headed down the Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods , Montanan was approached by a Japanese warship , which fired a warning shot for Montanan to stop . After doing so , a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan . When the American identity of Montanan was established to the satisfaction of the Japanese , they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan . The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship , which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area . 
 On Montanan 's next trip , the ship collided with a wharf in Los Angeles Harbor . Montanan had arrived in Los Angeles from Puget Sound on 22 January 1915 to complete her load before sailing for New York and Boston . The almost fully loaded ship was slow to respond to the helm and ended up " ploughing through " 50 ft ( 15 m ) of Municipal Pier A on Mormon Island channel before coming to a stop at a stone bulkhead . One hull plate on Montanan was dented , but the ship was otherwise undamaged . Montanan 's captain , who had a local license , did not take on a harbor pilot and American @-@ Hawaiian was liable for the damage , estimated by the harbor engineer to be $ 2 @,@ 500 . 
 Contemporary news reports offer hints at cargoes that Montanan carried during this period . In April 1915 , the Los Angeles Times reported on the sailing of Montanan with a full cargo . The majority of the cargo was rice — from Japan , China , and California — which was destined for the United Kingdom to feed Indian troops fighting in Europe . In June , The Wall Street Journal reported that Montanan and Santa Clara ( of the Grace Line ) had sailed from Tacoma , Washington , with 2 @,@ 500 tons of copper between them . 
 In October 1915 , landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American @-@ Hawaiian ships , including Montanan , returned to the Straits of Magellan route again . Montanan 's exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear . She may have been in the half of the American @-@ Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service , or she may have been in the group of American @-@ Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America , delivering coal , gasoline , and steel in exchange for coffee , nitrates , cocoa , rubber , and manganese ore . 
 = = U.S. Army service = = 
 After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 , the United States Army — needing transports to get its men and materiel to France — had a select committee of shipping executives pore over registries of American shipping . The committee selected Montanan , her sister ship Dakotan , and 12 other American @-@ flagged ships that were sufficiently fast , could carry enough fuel in their bunkers for transatlantic crossings , and , most importantly , were in port or not far at sea . After Montanan discharged her last load of cargo , she was officially handed over to the Army on 29 May . 
 Before troop transportation began , all of the ships were hastily refitted . Of the fourteen ships , four , including Montanan and Dakotan , were designated to carry animals and cargo ; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers . Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry animals . Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard , where the guns were put in place . All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers , Navy gun crews , quartermasters , signalmen , and wireless operators . The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack . 
 The American convoy carrying the first units of the American Expeditionary Force was separated into four groups ; Montanan was in the fourth group with her sister ship Dakotan , Army transports El Occidente and Edward Luckenbach , and escorts consisting of cruiser St. Louis , U.S. Navy transport Hancock , and destroyers Shaw , Ammen , and Flusser . Montanan departed with her group on the morning of 17 June for Brest , France , steaming at an 11 kn ( 13 mph ; 20 km / h ) pace . A thwarted submarine attack on the first convoy group , and reports of heavy submarine activity off of Brest , resulted in a change in the convoy 's destination to Saint @-@ Nazaire where the convoy arrived 2 July . 
 Montanan departed Saint @-@ Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates El Occidente , Dakotan , and Edward Luckenbach . Joining the return trip were Army transport Momus , Navy armed collier Cyclops , Navy oiler Kanawha , and cruiser Seattle , the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves , the head of the Navy 's Cruiser and Transport Force . 
 Sources do not reveal Montanan 's movements over the next months , but on 1 August 1918 , Montanan sailed in Convoy HB @-@ 8 with U.S. Navy cargo ships West Alsek , West Bridge , and 13 others for France . Escorted by armed yacht Noma , destroyers Burrows and Smith , and French cruiser Marseillaise , the convoy was 500 nmi ( 600 mi ; 900 km ) west of its destination of Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer by the end of the day on 15 August . At sundown , shortly before 18 : 00 , German submarine U @-@ 90 launched three torpedoes at Montanan . The first two , spotted by lookouts aboard Montanan , missed , but a third , unseen torpedo struck Montanan amidships on her port side , opening a large hole . Montanan began to settle and was abandoned quickly . Two of Montanan 's Naval Armed Guardsmen drowned when their lifeboat capsized in the heavy seas ; three of her civilian crewmen also died in the attack . Montanan 's 81 survivors were rescued by convoy escort Noma . 
 Shortly after Montanan was attacked , West Bridge , which had previously developed engine trouble and was drifting , was torpedoed by U @-@ 107 and abandoned . By the morning of 16 August both Montanan and West Bridge , with decks awash , were still afloat some 4 nmi ( 4 @.@ 6 mi ; 7 @.@ 4 km ) apart . Montanan 's captain and several officers reboarded the ship the next morning for an attempt to get her under tow , but despite their efforts , the ship sank later that morning .

 " The Rocky Horror Glee Show " is the fifth episode of the second season of the American television series Glee , and the twenty @-@ seventh episode overall . It was written by Ryan Murphy , from a story by Murphy and Tim Wollaston , directed by Adam Shankman , and premiered on Fox on October 26 , 2010 . The episode features the glee club paying tribute to the 1973 musical The Rocky Horror Show , with elements of its 1975 film adaptation The Rocky Horror Picture Show , by staging it as a school musical . While cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) attempts to sabotage the production , glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) dwells on his feelings for guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) , and club members Finn ( Cory Monteith ) and Sam ( Chord Overstreet ) deal with body image issues . Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf who star in the original film appear in cameo roles in this episode . 
 Elements of Rocky Horror were sanitized for the episode , including the costumes and lyrics . Creator Richard O 'Brien expressed disappointment in the dilution of the musical 's themes , and a spokesperson for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation criticized the episode for its use of the pejorative term " tranny " . Watched by 11 @.@ 76 million US viewers , " The Rocky Horror Glee Show " was the fifth consecutive episode of Glee to become the top @-@ rated program on the night of broadcast in the 18 – 49 demographic . It received a mixed response from critics , was alternatively deemed the series ' best ever themed @-@ episode by Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman , and was described as the worst hour in the show 's history by Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club . 
 The episode featured cover versions of seven Rocky Horror songs , which were released on an extended play album . Glee : The Music , The Rocky Horror Glee Show reached number six on the Billboard 200 . It marked the lowest debut and sales for the Glee cast in the US , but the highest position ever reached for a Rocky Horror album . The songs attracted mixed commentary , particularly the performance of " Time Warp " , which was given a grade of " A + " by Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack , but derided by Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine as " very possibly the weakest , most uninspired rendition " he had ever heard .

 The episode opens with the red lips of glee club member Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) against a black background as she sings " Science Fiction / Double Feature " . In the school auditorium , the glee club members rehearse The Rocky Horror Show , performing " Over at the Frankenstein Place " . They are interrupted by Dr. Carl Howell ( John Stamos ) , who accuses club director Will Schuester of trying to steal his girlfriend , school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury . The episode continues in flashback format , with Will recalling the events leading up to Carl 's accusation . 
 Will learns that Emma and Carl attended a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show , which helped to lessen some of her obsessive – compulsive behaviors . As Emma is a fan , Will decides to direct the glee club in a production of the musical , casting co @-@ captains Finn Hudson and Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) in the lead roles of Brad and Janet , Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) as Dr. Frank N. Furter , and Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) as Rocky . While Sam is proud of his physique and secure in his own body @-@ image , Finn feels self @-@ conscious at the prospect of appearing in his underwear , as the role necessitates . 
 Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester is approached by news station managers Tim Stanwick ( Barry Bostwick ) and Barry Jeffries ( Meat Loaf ) about producing an undercover exposé of the play , and convinces Will to involve her in the production . When Mike 's parents refuse to let him play Frank N. Furter , a transvestite , Sue manipulates Carl into saving the musical . He auditions with the song " Hot Patootie " , but feels that it would be more appropriate for him to play Eddie . The role of Frank , traditionally played by a male , is instead claimed by Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) . 
 Will grows increasingly jealous of Carl as he joins the production . When Sam becomes hesitant to wear his skimpy costume , Will decides that he will play Rocky instead , and asks Emma to rehearse the suggestive " Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch Me " with him . Will is later called into Principal Figgins ' ( Iqbal Theba ) office , where he learns that Finn has been suspended for walking through the hallway in his underwear , attempting to become comfortable with his costume . He convinces Figgins to reduce Finn 's punishment , and the episode returns to the opening scene as Carl confronts Will over his private rehearsal with Emma . Alerted to Sue 's planned exposé , Will concedes that his motivations in putting on the production were questionable . He tells Emma that he will cease interfering with her relationship . Though he cancels the play , he has the glee club perform it for themselves , and the episode ends with a group rendition of " Time Warp " .

 When casting Glee , series creator Ryan Murphy required that auditioning actors without theatrical experience demonstrate their ability to sing and dance as well as act . Mays , who was cast as guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury , auditioned with the song " Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch Me " from The Rocky Horror Picture Show . In April 2009 , Murphy told the Los Angeles Times that he would like to have Mays perform the song on Glee . In October 2009 , cast member Chris Colfer deemed " Time Warp " the song he would most like to perform on the show , and suggested a Rocky Horror @-@ themed Halloween episode . Colfer re @-@ iterated his desire to perform " Time Warp " at the 2010 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , which prompted Murphy to reveal that a Glee episode devoted to Rocky Horror was planned for the show 's second season . At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour , Murphy stated he would be directing the episode , and also revealed that Adam Shankman would guest @-@ direct one of the first ten episodes of the season . Shankman later revealed via the social networking website Twitter that he would in fact be directing the Rocky Horror episode , and commented , " Rocky Horror , while really risqué , is perfect for Glee because they all , in theory , feel like misfits . " 
 Elements of Rocky Horror were sanitized for the episode , and Shankman believes that he was sought out in order to make the production more audience appropriate . Stamos was initially set to play Dr. Frank N. Furter , but the role was recast due to network resistance . Costumes used in the episode were inspired by the Rocky Horror musical and film , but were adapted for the Glee cast and cost over $ 30 @,@ 000 . The tight gold lamé underwear worn by Peter <unk> in the 1975 film were replaced by board shorts for Overstreet . In dressing Riley as Frank , series costume designer Lou Eyrich found it challenging to select outfits which would be acceptable for a primetime series , yet would still appeal to all audiences . To appeal to younger viewers , Eyrich updated the costume worn by Colfer as Riff Raff , pairing a tailcoat with jeans and a J.Crew henley shirt . Michele 's costuming as Janet was similar to her regular wardrobe as Rachel , with Eyrich commenting , " That 's why she was the perfect Janet . " Prior to broadcast , cast member Mark Salling claimed that he would play Rocky Horror 's talking lips . In the event , however , Salling did not appear in the episode . He was temporarily absent from the series , reportedly for creative reasons , and returned in November 2010 . The lips were instead played by Rivera . 
 Original Rocky Horror cast members Barry Bostwick and Meat Loaf guest @-@ starred in the episode . Bostwick deemed their roles " stunt casting " , but suggested his character may return to the show in future and become involved with Sue . Susan Sarandon told People she was open to appearing in the episode depending on the role , and stated that she was flattered by the planned Glee tribute , but was not approached about appearing . An advance midnight screening of the episode was previewed on October 21 , 2010 at the Angelika Film Center in New York City .

 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Rocky Horror creator Richard O 'Brien was disappointed that the episode diluted the themes of the musical , and was puzzled that the word " transsexual " was censored . Matt Kane , entertainment media manager for the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation , criticized the use of the pejorative term " tranny " in its place , and found it " particularly alarming " given that the season one episode " Theatricality " presented a negative reaction to the use of a homophobic slur . " Critics had a mixed reaction to the episode . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded it an " F " and said it was " the worst hour this show has ever produced " . He felt that it was overly ambitious , and that in attempting to skirt humorously around the issue of transsexuals , the end result was " more offensive than if the show had simply ignored the whole thing to begin with . " Matt Zoller Seitz of Slant Magazine called it a " travesty " and criticized " the arms @-@ length treatment of the Frank N. Furter character " , and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times deemed the episode flawed through its sanitization , despite initially having found the two shows " a particularly promising match " . 
 " The Rocky Horror Glee Show " received several favorable comparisons to previous themed episodes ; Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone deemed it the best yet . Both Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack and Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post preferred it to the Britney Spears tribute episode " Britney / Brittany " ; Wieselman hailed it as a " run @-@ away success " that would satisfy Rocky Horror fans without being a " homage for homage 's sake " like the Spears episode , and Stack felt that Rocky Horror was a " perfect fit " for Glee , due to thematic similarities between the two . While previous Glee tributes attracted criticism for their focus on musical numbers to the detriment of plot , Jenna Mullins of E ! Online and CBS News ' Jessica Derschowitz appreciated that " The Rocky Horror Glee Show " was more story @-@ driven . 
 Critics generally disliked the focus the episode placed on the adult characters , with many objecting to Will 's characterisation . VanDerWerff wrote that his storyline with Emma " <unk> [ ed ] what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place " , and IGN 's Robert Canning — who otherwise enjoyed the episode , and rated it 8 @.@ 5 / 10 — observed that Will was presented as being selfish and a " terrible educator " , in contrast to his former role as the moral centre of the show . Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post initially found the focus on the adults a welcome change , but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted . Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed , and deemed it overall , " Creepy , vaguely uncomfortable , in slightly poor taste but well @-@ intentioned , and ultimately , thoroughly entertaining to watch for reasons I can 't quite put into words . " CNN 's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma , as well as Finn and his body image issues . While Stack commended the male body image storyline , and found it refreshing for a program to examine the objectification of men , de Moraes derided it , and likened Finn and Sam 's discussion about eating healthily and working out to an " after school special " . 
 The episode 's conclusion — in which Will declares that the original Rocky Horror fans and New Directions members are united by their outcast status — was widely criticized , with VanDerWerff deeming it a " series <unk> " , and " a muddled , terrible message , particularly in an episode that seems to have an uneasy relationship with actual outcasts , transsexuals . " Both Reiter and Aly Semigran of MTV questioned the resolution , with Reiter stating that it was unclear what message the creators were attempting to convey , and Semigran finding it disjointed , suggesting " The Rocky Horror Glee Show " to be a " rare Glee misstep " .

 Seven Rocky Horror songs were covered in the episode . The opening number of " Science Fiction / Double Feature " , performed by Rivera and represented by a disembodied pair of red lips , mirrored the opening to The Rocky Horror Picture Show . The song segued into a rehearsal of " Over at the Frankenstein Place " , which was followed by a rehearsal of " Dammit Janet " — the former with Michele on lead vocals , and the latter featuring Michele , Monteith , Colfer , Agron and Riley . Stamos ' first vocal performance for the series followed , as he gave a rendition of " Hot Patootie " . Stamos reportedly feigned illness in order to work with a private vocal coach and dance instructor on the number , and hired his own studio in which to rehearse . The performance entailed a shot @-@ by @-@ shot recreation of the original choreography . " Sweet Transvestite " featured Riley on lead vocals , and " Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch Me " showcased Mays , in her first lead performance since " I Could Have Danced All Night " in season one . The episode then closed with a group rendition of " Time Warp " . 
 = = = Commentary = = = 
 Musical performances in the episode attracted mixed commentary , particularly " Time Warp " . Stack rated all of the songs a " B " grade or higher , and gave " Time Warp " the highest grade of an " A + " . He called it his favorite moment of the episode , and praised its energy ; he wrote that Quinn made a " surprisingly good " Magenta . Semigran also praised the number , and commended the performances by Morris , Monteith , Agron and particularly Colfer , who , she wrote , " looked and sounded the part so well , you 'd swear you were watching the original Rocky Horror Picture Show " . In a generally negative review of the episode , Reiter commented that despite her dissatisfaction , she found herself singing along to " Time Warp " with " disconcerting enthusiasm " , and was " nostalgically transported against [ her ] better judgment " . In contrast , VanDerWerff stated that he would have increased his review of the episode from an " F " to a " D " had " Time Warp " been better , as he had " never seen a more lifeless version " . Zoller Seitz similarly called it " very possibly the weakest , most uninspired rendition " he had ever seen , and criticized the side @-@ lining of Colfer in favor of Monteith . 
 Semigran said the song " Dammit Janet " was " spirited and spot @-@ on " , and Benigno graded it an " A " , though observed that it was " painfully obvious " Michele and Monteith were lip @-@ syncing . Futterman described the performance as " fully engaged , campy to the max and totally on point " . " Hot Patootie " resulted in praise for Stamos , with Stack grading it an " A " and comparing it favorably to the actor 's singing on Full House , and Semigran recommending that he be cast in a Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Show . Benigno wrote that his voice lacked Meat Loaf 's " rock n ' roll howl " , but praised his charisma and dancing , and graded the performance an " A − " . 
 Critics disagreed over the casting of Mercedes as Frank . Semigran felt that , as sung by a female , " Sweet Transvestite " lost its shock value . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal would have preferred Salling 's Puck in the role , but praised Riley 's vocals , writing that her solo " woke us all up from the timid pacing " . Benigno also enjoyed the number , and found that while Mercedes lacked the stage presence of Tim Curry , Riley did something " completely remarkable " as Frank , giving a largely flawless performance . He named " Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch @-@ a , Touch Me " the best song of the episode , and graded it " A + " . Despite finding the episode " abrupt , uneven [ and ] sanitized " , Flandez felt that it was saved by this performance . Futterman remarked that having Emma in the role of Janet was " ideal " , but preferred the song visually to vocally . Zoller Seitz disliked the change in Emma 's characterization which brought about the number , and while he wrote that " Mays was so charming that she almost , almost saved it " , he ultimately found the " motivational contortions " insulting to the audience .

 The pilot episode of the American animated television series Sit Down , Shut Up originally aired in the United States on April 19 , 2009 on the Fox network . The episode introduced the faculty and staff at Knob Haven High School in the fictional town of Knob Haven , Florida . In the episode , the school is facing a financial crisis and acting principal Sue Sezno has to either fire a teacher or make sure the school wins a football game . Meanwhile , assistant principal Stuart Proszakian becomes addicted to drugs that were found in a student 's locker . 
 The episode was written by series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and directed by Dwayne Carey @-@ Hill . The first draft was written by Hurwitz in 2000 , before he pitched Arrested Development . Hurwitz based Sit Down , Shut Up on the Australian sitcom of the same name . After he had rewritten the script several times , the series was picked up by Fox . The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics . According to the Nielsen ratings , it was watched by 5 @.@ 21 million households in its original airing .

 Acting Principal of Knob Haven High School Sue Sezno finds a case of pills in a student 's locker . Believing them to be drugs , she hands them over to science teacher Miracle <unk> to study . Miracle , however , tells them the pills may be steroids ; Sue decides to test them on her new assistant Principal , Stuart Proszakian . With the assistance of P.E. teacher Larry <unk> , she manages to successfully trick Stuart into taking the pills , telling him that they are vitamins . 
 Meanwhile , Sue informs the staff that the school is in financial trouble , and the only way to raise money is to gain alumni donations from the upcoming football game or face firing a teacher . German teacher Willard <unk> informs English teacher Ennis <unk> that a student may have caught him buying " <unk> " ( porn ) at a newsstand that morning ; because of this , Willard fears that if Sue hears , he may be the one getting fired . At the same time , Larry attempts to ask Miracle out on a date , but finds he cannot stand Miracle 's " stupid " thoughts . As it turns out , she was the one responsible for his students ' poor training in gym : she repeatedly throws out food , in honor of those in third @-@ world countries . 
 At the game , bisexual drama teacher Andrew <unk> attempts to grab the attention of both Larry and Miracle , but the whole school stands in shock as Stuart arrives with two full and augmented breasts ; the pills he had taken were actually librarian Helen Klench 's female hormone replacements . Nonetheless , the school loses the game . Sue finally reveals she was not planning on actually firing any teacher on her watch . Helen arrives to inform them that they did not need to win the game after all ; she had found a rare time capsule with treasures . Upon opening the time capsule , it is revealed that it is full of Willard 's porn magazines that Ennis hid . Sue pitifully looks at Willard and tells him he is fired .

 The pilot episode of Sit Down , Shut Up was written by series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and directed by Dwayne Carey @-@ Hill . It was originally written by Hurwitz in 2000 , but he " kept it in a drawer for a long time " and brought it out when he needed money . The idea for the series was based on the Australian situation comedy of the same name . He pitched his adaption to different networks that were interested in the concept , but they turned it down , because the characters were " way too broad and way too self @-@ centered and oblivious , " and they told him that he had to rewrite it . The Fox network picked it up in April 2008 under the name Class Dismissed , later changed to Sit Down , Shut Up . Hurwitz 's adaption was originally planned to be live @-@ action like its counterpart , but he decided to make it an animated series to " avoid some work " . He chose to use real images as backgrounds after he saw Mo Willems ' <unk> Bunny in a book store . He then contacted Willems to design the characters for Sit Down , Shut Up . The images for the school were taken at a school next door to the Rough Draft Studios , the series ' animation studio . Production of the series halted in June 2008 , when the writers found out that they would be under the jurisdiction of the IATSE Animation Guild , instead of Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) . A month later , the writers and the production company , Sony Pictures , reached an agreement saying that the writers would still be covered by the IATSE , but their contract would be the same as the WGA 's in certain areas . This made Sit Down , Shut Up the only primetime animated series on Fox not to be covered by the WGA . During this process , head writer Bill Oakley left the series . 
 Cast members Jason Bateman , Will Arnett and Henry Winkler , who also starred on Hurwitz 's show Arrested Development , voice Larry <unk> , Ennis <unk> and Willard <unk> , respectively . Will Forte voices Stuart Proszakian , who was also featured in the Australian series . Kristin Chenoweth stars as Miracle <unk> . The part was originally given to Maria Bamford , but she was later replaced with Chenoweth . The executives still allowed Bamford to do some " side voices " on the show , including in this episode . Cheri <unk> was picked as the voice of Helen Klench , a " totally <unk> " librarian , and Nick Kroll was picked as the voice of Andrew <unk> , the drama teacher whose surname translates " he likes both " , referring to his bisexuality . Regina King was replaced with Kenan Thompson , who took over the role as Sue Sezno , the acting principal . Tom Kenny voices <unk> <unk> " Happy " Fa <unk> <unk> , the secretive custodian .

 The episode received generally mixed reviews from critics . Brian Lowry of Variety said : " Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz and many of that program 's stars , Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre . " Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B , saying : " I 'm staying optimistic that the characters are going to get fleshed out in upcoming episodes , because this is obviously going to be a character @-@ based ensemble comedy . " Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode , noting the " familiar aspects " of Arrested Development , such as the " deft wordplay , biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor " . He concluded , saying : " As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter , this should continue to be a very entertaining show . " Kona Gallagher of TV Squad watched the episode twice , and said that it " definitely grows on you . " She concluded , saying : " In all , I think the first time you watch Sit Down , Shut Up , it 's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that 's trying too hard .

 = EarthBound fandom = 
 The 1994 video game EarthBound is known for its cult following and fan community . Multiple video game journalists have written about the dedication of the game 's fans in producing fan art and lobbying Nintendo for further releases in the series . The company has been largely unresponsive to their efforts . Prominent fansites include Starmen.net and EarthBound Central . The former was started in 1999 and became the definitive community website . Their members organized petitions and campaigns to bring English @-@ localized games from the Mother series to North America . One such effort included a full @-@ color , 270 @-@ page EarthBound Anthology as a demonstration of consumer demand for further releases . After nearly a decade , EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013 , whereupon it became a bestseller . 
 The fandom also spun @-@ out other enterprises . When Nintendo did not release a localized version of Mother 3 , fans organized their own fan translation . The video game merchandising business Fangamer grew out of the Starmen.net community , and sells video game @-@ related items online . A full @-@ length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community , EarthBound , USA , is in production . And while the series creator has stated that he is finished with the series , a fan @-@ created sequel , Mother 4 , is also in development . 
 = = Fan base = = 
 EarthBound is known for having a cult following , which developed over time well after its release . Colin Campbell of Polygon wrote that " few gaming communities are as passionate and active " as EarthBound 's , and 1UP.com 's Bob Mackey wrote that no game was as poised to have a cult following . Wired described the amount of EarthBound " fan art , videos , and tributes on fan sites like EarthBound Central or Starmen.net " as mountainous . IGN 's Lucas M. Thomas wrote in 2006 that EarthBound 's " persistent " , " ambitious " , and " religiously dedicated collective of hardcore fans " would be among the first groups to influence Nintendo 's decision @-@ making through their purchasing power on Virtual Console . The Verge cited the two @-@ year fan translation of Mother 3 as proof of the fanbase 's dedication , and Nintendo president Satoru Iwata credited the community response on their online Miiverse social platform as leading to EarthBound 's eventual rerelease on their Virtual Console platform . 
 EarthBound was hard to find before the rerelease . In 2013 , prices for the game 's cartridge alone were more than twice its retail cost at its 1995 release . IGN wrote that the game became a " cult classic " for its unique RPG and psychedelic elements alongside its reflection on American culture , and Eurogamer credited EarthBound 's " cute and funny modern @-@ world styling of the Japanese RPG " . Kotaku hypothesized that fan favorite aspects of the game would include its " feeling of innocence , ... sense of whimsical adventure " , " humor " , " charm " , " wonder " , and " beautiful 2D maps " . Marcus Lindblom , the game 's English localizer , cited its " cuteness , colors , and hallucinatory bits " as fan favorites . Reid Young of Starmen.net and Fangamer credits EarthBound 's popularity to its " labor of love " nature , with a " double @-@ coat of thoughtfulness and care " across all aspects of the game by a development team that appeared to love their work . 
 Digital Trends 's Anthony John Agnello wrote that " no video game fans have suffered as much as EarthBound fans , and cited Nintendo 's reluctance to release Mother series games in North America . IGN described the series as neglected by Nintendo in North America for similar reasons . Aaron Linde of Shacknews felt that Nintendo 's " historic passive @-@ aggression towards EarthBound fans [ seemed ] somehow anachronistic " in response to the outcries from the game 's fan community . He added that while the company is known for providing " the most personal experiences in gaming 's history " , Nintendo lacks the " bedside manner " required of contemporary game companies , and that he could not think of a " more deserving fan base " than EarthBound 's . 
 Marcus Lindblom , who localized the Japanese Mother 2 into the English EarthBound , followed the fan community from afar and , in mid @-@ 2012 , introduced himself at the Penny Arcade Expo Fangamer booth . When the game 's Wii U re @-@ release was announced , the press became interested in Lindblom 's experience . Lindblom had planned a book about the game 's development , release , and fandom as a Kickstarter project before a reply from Nintendo discouraged him from pursuing the idea . He plans to continue to communicate directly with the community about the game 's history . For instance , Lindblom struck down a popular ( " infamous " ) " abortion theory " that the game 's final sequence is a metaphor for an abortion , with Giygas as the fetus . 
 = = Starmen.net = = 
 Reid Young started an EarthBound fansite in 1997 while in middle school . It was one of the first EarthBound fansites on the Internet . By 1999 and with co @-@ founder Clyde " Tomato " Mandelin , the site grew into Starmen.net , named for the game 's " most iconic villain , the Starman . " 1UP.com described the site as " the definitive fan community for EarthBound on the web " and Shacknews called it the fan community 's " one @-@ stop " resource for a decade . Though EarthBound was more obscure at the time , the site quickly grew in popularity and featured " constant updates " and a burgeoning community by 1999 . 1UP.com said the viewership growth was " almost inexplicable " when accounting for the game 's unpopularity , but credited Super NES emulation , which let " thousands " of people experience the game who might not have otherwise . Young credited the site 's growth to the fan content generated by the community . Shacknews described the site 's collection of fan @-@ made media as " absolutely massive " . It also provided a place to aggregate information on the Mother series and to coordinate fan actions . 
 The EarthBound fan community at Starmen.net coalesced with the intent to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series . 1UP.com described their intent as reasonable given the company 's " frequent dismissal " of the series alongside the community 's " monumental efforts to increase American EarthBound awareness " . Young felt that their " underdog status " kept Starmen.net vigilant . He also said that he views the community as " a big group of friends having fun together " and sometimes thinks that it is just happenstance that EarthBound was what brought them together , as opposed to another franchise like Pokémon . As the site started in 1999 , the community started a petition to have Nintendo release Mother for the Game Boy Color , and collected 1850 physical signatures to this end and bound it in a book for Nintendo . The final word from Nintendo was that the package was received . Other petitions include the 2000 10 @,@ 000 @-@ person petition for a North American Mother 3 release on the Nintendo 64 , the 2003 31 @,@ 000 @-@ person petition for a North American Mother 1 + 2 Game Boy Advance release , and letter and phone campaigns . A source internal to Nintendo later told them that the 2003 campaign was almost successful , but fell out of consideration as the phone campaign ended after a week . The community resolved to never let up again . 
 In time , the fan community 's requests shifted from specific demands to no demand at all , wanting only their interest to be recognized by Nintendo . The Starmen.net community launched several campaigns to bring attention to the series . In their 2007 " The EB Siege " project to have Mother 3 receive an official North American localization , community members sent letters and made phone calls to Nintendo . They ultimately created a full @-@ color , 270 @-@ page art book , The EarthBound Anthology , to send to Nintendo and press outlets as demonstration of their interest . They also hoped the volume would mobilize established industry professionals to take up their cause in advance of the 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo . Shacknews wrote that the " folk history " was more of a proposal than a collection of fan art — " the greatest gaming love letter ever created " . Wired 's Chris Kohler used the Anthology 's occasion to explain how Nintendo 's upper management has heard the fan community . The Anthology additionally received mention in Nintendo Power . Upon " little " response from Nintendo , they decided to localize the game themselves . Starmen.net co @-@ founder Tomato led the project , and the complete fan translation was finished in October 2008 . They then printed a " professional quality strategy guide " through Fangamer , a site that spun off from Starmen.net. 
 Other oblique strategies included an attempt to license Mother 3 for North America from Nintendo through a small video game development studio , but Nintendo replied that the property was theirs and would never be developed externally . In 2008 , the site hosted a YouTube contest for videos that raised the visibility for the series in a final effort to get the game on the Wii Virtual Console , but Young found community spirit to be atrophied . A week later , the game appeared on the ESRB website , which signaled success after many years of work . It was finally rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013 via a Nintendo Direct announcement . The game was a " top @-@ seller " on the platform , and Kotaku users and first @-@ time EarthBound players had an " overwhelmingly positive " response to the game .

 After a decade of development hell , the Japanese video game Mother 3 was released in April 2006 . When fan interest in an English localization went unanswered by Nintendo , Starmen.net announced their own fan translation in November 2006 . The project was led by the fansite 's Clyde " Tomato " Mandelin , a professional game translator whose previous work includes games such as Kingdom Hearts II and anime such as Dragon Ball . 
 The dozen fans who worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior localization experience . Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1 @,@ 000 pages of scripted dialogue . They built their own tools for the work . The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch to be used with an emulator , a process of murky legality . The patch was downloaded over 100 @,@ 000 times in its first week . A fan @-@ made , full @-@ color , 200 @-@ page , professional @-@ quality player 's guide was released alongside the fan translation . 1UP.com wrote that " no other game in the history of time garnered such a rabid demand for translation " , and The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base 's dedication .

 In April 2014 , brothers Jeff and Robbie Benson announced the production of their documentary " about how EarthBound fans have fought to popularize the Mother series in North America since the 1990s " , EarthBound , USA . The Bensons had been conducting interviews with EarthBound fans and Starmen.net members for a year prior to the announcement . They had previously begun a feature @-@ length film about the events of EarthBound . Starmen.net " inspired " the documentary , which seeks to explain how the site 's members convened via online message board and the consequent " re @-@ emergence of a cult classic " and birth of Fangamer . The filmmakers had been planning to wait longer before making the announcement , but were preempted in part by interest following a tweet from series creator Shigesato Itoi , which mentioned their interview . The film is planned for release in 2016 with a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign later in 2014 .

 After Mother 3 , Shigesato Itoi declared that he was done with the series . In response to Nintendo 's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel , fans began to develop their own entry , Mother 4 , in October 2010 . As of August 2013 , the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo . In a preview of the game , Jason Schreier of Kotaku said Mother 4 looked " stunning " , as " everything you could possibly want out of a new Mother game " , from the music to the environment design . The fan @-@ made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice . No future release date has been set . Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game , without need for an emulator . 
 The game takes place in a parody of contemporary America , as a boy named Travis leaves his town of <unk> to join three others in a fight against the " mysterious " Modern Men . The game is expected to associate with the stories of the previous series games , and be similar in length . Its music and visuals are similar in style to the rest of the series . Mother 4 features a new soundtrack . Its creators are currently working on a voluntary basis without compensation .

 Hans Philipp ( 17 March 1917 – 8 October 1943 ) was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II . A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down five or more enemy aircraft during aerial combat . He is credited with 206 enemy aircraft shot down in over 500 combat missions . The majority of his victories were claimed over the Eastern Front , with 29 claims over the Western Front . 
 Born in Meissen , Philipp grew up in the Weimar Republic and Third Reich as the only child of a single parent , Alma Philipp . He was raised under challenging financial circumstances , and volunteered for military service in the Wehrmacht in 1936 . Following flight training , he was posted to Jagdgeschwader 76 ( JG 76 — 76th Fighter Wing ) and participated in the invasion of Poland and as a Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) in the Battle of France . His unit was reformed as II . / Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 — 54th Fighter Wing ) in June 1940 . He was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 22 October 1940 during the Battle of Britain . He then fought in the aerial battles of the Balkans Campaign and Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . He received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) after 62 aerial victories on 24 August 1941 and the Swords ( Schwerter ) to his Knight 's Cross on 12 March 1942 , his score now at 86 aerial victories . He claimed his 100th victory on 31 March 1942 , the fourth fighter pilot to achieve this mark , and his 150th aerial victory on 14 January 1943 . Philipp claimed four aircraft shot down on 17 March 1943 taking his total to 203 aerial victories . He thus surpassed Hermann Graf as the leading German fighter pilot at the time , and six months after Graf , became the second pilot to claim more than 200 victories . 
 Philipp was promoted to Major ( major ) and given command as the Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 — 1st Fighter Wing ) on 1 April 1943 , conducting Defense of the Reich operations against the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) . He was promoted to Oberstleutnant ( lieutenant colonel ) on 1 October 1943 and was killed in action a week later on 8 October during an attack on Bremen . It is believed that he was shot down by the P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt pilot Robert S. Johnson . Philipp managed to bail out but his parachute failed to open . 
 = = Childhood and education = = 
 Johannes " Hans " Fritz Philipp was born on 17 March 1917 at 22 : 45 at Gustav @-@ Graf @-@ Straße 5 in Meissen , in the Kingdom of Saxony , part of the German Empire . His mother Alma Philipp was not married . His father was Leopold <unk> whom his mother had met while serving at the hospital at Meissen @-@ <unk> . <unk> had studied medicine at the universities in Erlangen ( 1912 – 14 ) and Freiburg ( 1914 – 16 ) and served as battalion doctor with the heavy artillery on the Western and Eastern Fronts of World War I. He attained his doctorate in the field of radiology in April 1920 and opened his medical practice in Plauen . In the 1920s , his social status as a doctor did not allow him to disclose his relationship with the unmarried mother of his child . 
 Philipp 's mother , who never married , was the eighth child of relatively poor parents . Her father made a living as a driver and as a laborer in the construction business . The financial situation was always tight , and taught everyone in the family discipline and to work hard to survive . To support the family , Alma worked as an accountant and clerk . Philipp 's father paid a monthly alimony of 35 Reichsmark ( RM ) until 1933 . Initially he had to be reminded by his mother of his obligations . Philipp was baptized on 29 July 1917 , taking the name Johannes Fritz , and was confirmed in 1931 . 
 In 1924 , Philipp attended the 4 . Volksschule ( <unk> — 4th elementary school ) in Meissen . Philipp was a very good student . His mother understood that education was essential to Philipp 's future . She worked very hard to raise the funds to pay for higher education in order to send Philipp to a Gymnasium ( secondary school ) . In 1927 , she managed to have Philipp admitted to the <unk> in Meissen , the Realgymnasium — a secondary school built on the mid @-@ level Realschule to achieve the Abitur ( university entry qualification ) — in Meissen . Alma , desperate to secure her son 's schooling , wrote to the city council of Meissen in 1932 asking if the school fees could be waived . 
 Philipp participated in various sporting events organized by the <unk> Verein Junger Männer ( <unk> — the German equivalent of YMCA ) such as hiking , bicycling , skiing , paddling and rowing . He also was a member of the Hitlerjugend ( HJ — Hitler Youth ) and received the HJ @-@ <unk> ( Honor Badge ) . Philipp learned to fly glider aircraft in the Hitler Youth and received his A and B glider license , leading the local HJ @-@ <unk> ( Flying Squad ) in Meissen . Adolf Hitler officially re @-@ established the Luftwaffe in March 1935 . Following this event , Philipp then changed his mind and decided he did not want to become a journalist . He passed his physical examination to become a pilot , observer , aircraft mechanic and or radio operator on 6 September 1935 in Dresden . The financial situation of the Philipp family was always a cause for concern . When Alma 's mother was paralyzed and required nursing care , the financial situation became severe . Alma 's monthly income was 225 RM and the annual school fee of 180 RM was a big burden . She wrote to the city council multiple times asking for the fees to be waived . By early 1935 , the family was behind on their payments which had accumulated to a debt of 390 RM by 31 March 1935 . Philipp 's graduation from school was at risk as he was threatened with expulsion on financial grounds . Philipp 's decision to opt for military service in the Wehrmacht eased the financial tension . He was permitted to graduate , provided that his mother paid back the debt in instalments of 10 RM per month . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Following his graduation from school , Philipp had to complete his compulsory six months in the Reichsarbeitsdienst ( RAD — Reich Labor Service ) . He began his RAD service on 2 January 1936 in Lager 5 / 150 ( Camp 5 / 150 ) in <unk> . He was released early and started his military training as a Fahnenjunker ( cadet ) on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School ( Luftkriegsschule 2 ) at Gatow , on the south @-@ western outskirts of Berlin . Among his classmates were Werner Baumbach , who became a bomber pilot , and Helmut Lent , a <unk> pilot . Philipp , as a member of the 4 . <unk> ( 4th Student Company ) , completed Lehrgang I ( 1st course ) by 4 August 1936 , Lehrgang II ( 2nd course ) by 31 May 1937 , and the final Lehrgang III ( 3rd course ) by 31 August 1937 . He received the Pilot 's Badge after completing these courses . During this training period he was promoted to Fahnenjunker @-@ Gefreiter ( cadet @-@ private ) on 1 October 1936 , Fahnenjunker @-@ Unteroffizier ( cadet @-@ corporal ) on 1 December 1936 , Fähnrich ( ensign ) on 1 April 1937 and Oberfähnrich ( senior ensign ) on 1 December 1937 . Philipp was promoted to the officer rank of Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) on 24 February 1938 , with the effective date was backdated to 1 January 1938 . His commanding officer released him with the words , " I release you with great concern for your own career , but with even greater concern for the Air Force as a whole " — apparently Philipp had been aware that his promotion was at risk for his opposition to the monotony of the training system . Just prior to his promotion he had started looking for an alternative employment with the Maschinenfabrik <unk> ( machine factory <unk> ) in <unk> , which his dance partner , Margarete Strunz , had helped to arrange . 
 Philipp was transferred to the I. Gruppe of Kampfgeschwader 253 ( I. / KG 253 — 1st group of the 253rd Bomber Wing ) on 1 March 1938 . This assignment did not suit Philipp , and on 1 May 1938 he managed to get himself transferred to the Jagdfliegerschule Werneuchen ( fighter pilot school ) in Werneuchen , then under the command of Oberst ( Colonel ) Theodor Osterkamp . The Anschluß , the 1938 occupation and annexation of Austria into the German Reich , spawned the rapid expansion of the Luftwaffe . Philipp 's fighter pilot career benefited from this expansion and he was transferred to the I. / Jagdgeschwader 138 ( I. / JG 138 — 1st group of the 138th Fighter Wing ) stationed in Wien @-@ Schwechat on 1 July 1938 . Here he underwent flight conversion training from the Heinkel He 51 biplane to the then modern Messerschmitt Bf 109 . This posed challenges , and on 21 June and again 19 July 1939 , he damaged his Bf 109 during takeoff and landing . In 1939 , Philipp bought a <unk> <unk> automobile . With this car he went on a tour through Italy where he met his future fiancée Katharina <unk> from South Tyrol . On 1 May 1939 , his unit I. / JG 138 was re @-@ designated I. / Jagdgeschwader 76 ( I. / JG 76 — 1st group of the 76th Fighter Wing ) . 
 = = World War II = = 
 The German invasion of Poland began on 1 September 1939 , and marked the beginning of World War II in Europe . Philipp 's unit was tasked with bomber escort and ground attack as well as combat air patrol missions . He was credited with his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 without firing a single shot . Philipp maneuvered himself into a favorable attack position and aimed carefully . Just as he was about to open fire , the enemy pilot bailed out . Nevertheless , he was given credit for the destruction of the aircraft and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 2 . Klasse ) , which was presented to him on 10 October 1939 . He lost his wingman during the Phoney War air skirmishes with the Armée de l 'Air ( French Air Force ) in late November 1939 . 
 Case Yellow ( Fall Gelb ) , the invasion of France and the Low Countries on 10 May 1940 , marked the beginning of the Battle of France . Philipp claimed four victories in the early phase of the campaign which earned him the Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 1 . Klasse ) on 31 May 1940 . The next day , 1 June , he was promoted to Oberleutnant ( first lieutenant ) and appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) . His unit was tasked with bomber escort missions against the British Expeditionary Force in the Battle of Dunkirk and was relocated to airbases in the vicinity of Paris on 3 June . Following the armistice on 22 June I. / JG 76 was moved to Eindhoven and Schiphol where they were tasked with the aerial defense of the Netherlands . On 6 July 1940 , I. / JG 76 was renamed II . / Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 — 54th Fighter Wing ) and at the same time relocated at Campagne , south of Calais . Here , Philipp served as Staffelkapitän of the 4 . Staffel ( 4 . / JG 54 — 4th squadron of 54th Fighter Wing ) . 
 = = = Battle of Britain = = = 
 Aerial operations in what would become the Battle of Britain began for his unit on 12 July 1940 . The fighting reached a climax on 7 August when Eagle Day was launched ( code name Adlertag ) . Hitler had issued Führer Directive no . 17 ( Weisung Nr. 17 ) on 1 August 1940 ; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) to achieve air supremacy , or at least air superiority , in preparation for Operation Sea Lion ( Unternehmen Seelöwe ) , the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain . From 7 September onwards , the Luftwaffe switched to attack British towns and cities , with London coming under particularly heavy attack , during what was dubbed The Blitz by the British . In total , Philipp flew 130 missions over England . His number of aerial victories increased , including his 12th to 15th on 27 September , which led to the presentation of the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe ( Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe ) on 28 September 1940 . He claimed his 20th victory on 20 October , and was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) . He was the second pilot of JG 54 to receive this award . The first was his Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) Hauptmann Dietrich Hrabak , who received the award one day earlier . 
 The German air offensive against England was a failure , and only resulted in heavy losses . To replenish these , II . / JG 54 was withdrawn from the Channel Front on 3 December 1940 and stationed at Delmenhorst . The pilots were sent on a ski vacation at <unk> and given home leave . Philipp made a public propaganda appearance at his <unk> home school on 16 December , speaking of his actions as fighter pilot . On 15 January 1941 , his unit was moved to Le Mans , southwest of Paris , to protect the airspace over Normandy . Here they stayed until 29 March 1941 when they were ordered to Graz in preparation for the attack on Yugoslavia . 
 = = = Balkans campaign and Operation Barbarossa = = = 
 The Balkans campaign began on 6 April 1941 , with multiple objectives . Operation Marita was the codename for the German invasion of Greece , while JG 54 's Stab , II . Gruppe , and III . Gruppe were committed to the invasion of Yugoslavia . During the early missions , JG 54 engaged the Bf 109s of the Jugoslovensko <unk> Ratno Vazduhoplovstvo ( JKRV — Yugoslav Royal Air Force ) in numerous air battles . Philipp claimed two JKRV Bf 109s shot down during a Stuka escort mission on the second day of operations on 7 April , taking his total to 25 aerial victories . 
 Following the surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April 1941 , while stationed at an airfield at Zemun near Belgrade , the Geschwader received orders on 3 May 1941 to turn over all Bf 109 @-@ Es so they could receive the new Bf 109 @-@ F variant . Transition training was completed at Airfield <unk> @-@ Reitz in Pomerania . Following intensive training , the Geschwader was moved to airfields in Eastern Prussia . On 22 June at 03 : 05 , 120 aircraft of the Geschwader crossed into Soviet airspace in support of Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union . Philipp , like many other German fighter pilots , enjoyed superiority over his Soviet adversaries in the early phase of Barbarossa , both in terms of the training he had received and the aircraft that he flew . He quickly accumulated further victories and on account of his 31st to 33rd victories achieved on 4 July was honorably mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report , the first of five such mentions , on 7 July . 
 Philipp claimed his 62nd victory on 24 August 1941 , an achievement which earned him the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) . He was the 33rd member of the German armed forces to be so honored . The presentation was made on 27 August 1941 by Hitler at the Führer Headquarter Wolfsschanze ( Wolf 's Lair ) in Rastenburg ( now Kętrzyn in Poland ) . Following the loss of Hauptmann Franz Eckerle , who had been reported as missing in action since 14 February 1942 , Philipp , who had claimed his 77th victory , was appointed Gruppenkommandeur of I. / JG 54 on 22 March 1942 . On 23 February , Philipp shot down his 82nd opponent , the 158 IAP 's ( 158th Fighter Aviation Regiment ) Leytenant Mikhail <unk> , who was posted as missing in action . 
 = = = Eastern Front = = = 
 Following his 86th victory claimed on 12 March 1942 , Philipp became the first member of the Geschwader to receive the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub mit Schwertern ) . The Swords had been awarded only seven times before . The presentation on 5 April 1942 was again made by Hitler himself at the Wolfsschanze . By this date his total had increased further . On 31 March 1942 , he became only the fourth Luftwaffe fighter pilot to achieve 100 victories . 
 Following the presentation of the Swords , Philipp went on home leave . Again he was asked to make a number of propaganda appearances . On 1 May 1942 , he spoke before his home school and before the Meissen youth at the Hamburger Hof . He , his mother and his fiancée were also invited to Meissen Town Hall on 30 April . Among other officials , present were the NSDAP @-@ <unk> ( county leader ) Helmut Böhme and the mayor of Meissen , Walter <unk> . Philipp was granted the privilege of signing the Meissen Golden Book ( <unk> Buch ) — a book signed in German communities and cities by special guests of honor . 
 Philipp returned to the Eastern Front at <unk> south of Leningrad and claimed his 101st to 103rd victories on 6 June 1942 , which were mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht on 7 June . His third mention in the Wehrmachtbericht on 27 June came after he achieved his 108th to 110th victories on 26 June . In addition to the references in the Wehrmachtbericht he received the German Cross in Gold ( Deutsches Kreuz in Gold ) on 29 June 1942 . He also received the Croatian Order of the Crown of King Zvonimir ( Red <unk> <unk> <unk> ) 2nd Class with Swords on 15 September 1942 for his work with the Croatian Air Force Legion 's fighter unit commanded by Franjo <unk> . On 14 January 1943 , he claimed his 150th aerial victory . This led to the presentation of the Picture of the Reichsmarschall in Silver Frame ( Bild des <unk> im <unk> ) on 16 February 1943 . His unit received the Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 in February 1943 . He quickly accumulated further victories , and on 17 March 1943 , his 26th birthday , he claimed his 200th to 203rd enemy aircraft shot down , recognized by his fourth mention in the Wehrmachtbericht . He was the second pilot after Hermann Graf to achieve this mark , and at the time was the most successful fighter pilot of the Luftwaffe . 
 = = = Wing commander of JG 1 and death = = = 
 In April 1943 , Philipp was transferred to Defense of the Reich duties as Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 — 1st Fighter Wing ) , flying high altitude interception operations against the USAAF Eighth Air Force over the North Sea and northern Germany . He claimed his 204th victory on 2 May , and his 205th on 18 May before falling ill with appendicitis . This required hospitalization in Meissen . On 4 October 1943 , Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring is said to have issued the following instructions after another attack by the Eighth Air Force . 
 There are no meteorological conditions which would prevent fighters from taking off and engaging in combat . 
 Every fighter pilot returning in a machine not showing any sign of combat , or without having recorded a victory will be prosecuted by a court @-@ martial . 
 In the case of where a pilot uses up his ammunition , or if his weapons are unusable , he should ram the enemy bomber . 
 Philipp 's response was " As far as I 'm concerned , I categorically refuse to allow myself to be held to such advice ; I know what I have to do ! " 
 On 8 October 1943 , the US Eighth Air Force attacked targets in Bremen and Vegesack with 156 bombers . The bombers were escorted by more than 250 Thunderbolts from six different fighter groups . <unk> 's flight was intercepted by P @-@ 47s of the 56th Fighter Group . The Stab Flight of the Geschwader heard Philipp announce a victory over a Thunderbolt . The last transmission from him was , " Reinhardt , attack ! " , Feldwebel Hans @-@ Günther Reinhardt was Philipp 's wingman on this day . He last saw the Kommodore 's aircraft disappear in a cloud . Reinhardt was wounded after colliding with an enemy aircraft , but made a successful forced landing . Later that evening , the Geschwader learned that their Geschwaderkommodore had been shot down and killed in his Fw 190 A @-@ 6 " Red 6 " ( Werknummer <unk> — factory number ) . 
 The report filed by Reinhardt on 10 October 1943 stated that he and Philipp had taken off at 14 : 11 on a mission against enemy bombers in the vicinity of Bremen . The group led by Y @-@ <unk> ( Y @-@ Control ) had sighted a formation of about 30 Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses southwest of Bremen at 15 : 12 . The bombers had already completed their bomb run and were returning to England . Philipp started his attack from the right , driving the attack to pointblank range , flaming one of the B @-@ 17s which crashed at 15 : 32 . Philipp then flew under the formation to the left when he was hit from the defensive fire of a rear gunner on one of the B @-@ 17s which was lagging behind . Philipp then went into a dive and <unk> asked by radio " what has happened ? " His response was " Reinhardt , attack " . Reinhardt , who had seen that Philipp had been hit , followed Philipp down until he disappeared in a lower cloud layer . More recent research has suggested that Philipp may also have been hit by a P @-@ 47 " Thunderbolt " piloted by Robert S. Johnson of the 61st Fighter Squadron . Philipp tried to return to his airfield , but was forced to bail out at low altitude at 15 : 45 between Hardenberg and <unk> ( 52 ° 31 ′ 44 ″ N 06 ° 43 ′ 08 ″ E ) . His parachute failed to open and the jump from an altitude of about 50 meters ( 160 ft ) caused several fatal injuries . His body was recovered and examined in the field hospital in Rheine the next day . The post mortem examination revealed extensive burns , particularly to the face , a laceration on the back of his head , multiple broken bones and flesh wounds as well as a particularly deep injury to his upper abdomen and inner organs . 
 From Rheine , on 10 October 1943 Philipp 's body was transported to Meissen by train where it arrived the next day . The Wehrmachtbericht announced his death on 12 October . The funeral at the <unk> ( Trinitatis Cemetery ) in Meissen , on 14 October 1943 , was dominated by military , public and Nazi officials . His coffin , which was draped in the national flag of the Third Reich along with his honors and decorations on a velvet cushion , was put on display on the entry steps of the town hall in Meissen . Present at the funeral along with his mother , his fiancée and other members of the family , were Oberstleutnant Hannes Trautloft and Generaloberst Alfred Keller , who delivered the eulogy . Philipp 's mother died on 7 May 1973 , her urn was buried next to her son .

 = Kentucky gubernatorial election , 1899 = 
 The Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 was held on November 7 , 1899 , to choose the 33rd governor of Kentucky . The incumbent , Republican William O 'Connell Bradley , was term @-@ limited and unable to seek re @-@ election . 
 After a contentious and chaotic nominating convention at the Music Hall in Louisville , the Democratic Party chose state Senator William Goebel as its nominee . A dissident faction of the party , styling themselves the " Honest Election Democrats " , were angered by Goebel 's political tactics at the Music Hall convention and later held their own nominating convention . They chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee . Republicans nominated state Attorney General William S. Taylor , although Governor Bradley favored another candidate and lent Taylor little support in the ensuing campaign . In the general election , Taylor won by a vote of 193 @,@ 714 to 191 @,@ 331 . Brown garnered 12 @,@ 040 votes , more than the difference between Taylor and <unk> . The election results were challenged on grounds of voter fraud , but surprisingly , the state Board of Elections , created by a law Goebel had sponsored and stocked with pro @-@ Goebel commissioners , certified Taylor 's victory . 
 An incensed Democratic majority in the Kentucky General Assembly created a committee to investigate the charges of voter fraud , even as armed citizens from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky poured into the state capital under auspices of keeping Democrats from stealing the election . Before the investigative committee could report , Goebel was shot by an unknown assassin while entering the state capitol on January 30 , 1900 . As Goebel lay in a nearby hotel being treated for his wounds , the committee issued its report recommending that the General Assembly invalidate enough votes to give the election to Goebel . The report was accepted , Taylor was deposed , and Goebel was sworn into office on January 31 . He died three days later on February 2 . 
 Lieutenant Governor J. C. W. Beckham ascended to the office of governor , and he and Taylor waged a protracted court battle over the governorship . Beckham won the case on appeal , and Taylor fled to Indiana to escape prosecution as an accomplice in Goebel 's murder . A total of sixteen people were charged in connection with the assassination . Five went to trial ; two of those were acquitted . Each of the remaining three were convicted in trials fraught with irregularities and were eventually pardoned by subsequent governors . The identity of Goebel 's assassin remains a mystery . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the 1895 gubernatorial election , Kentucky elected its first @-@ ever Republican governor , William O. Bradley . Bradley was able to capitalize both on divisions within the Democratic Party over the issue of Free Silver and on the presence of a strong third @-@ party candidate , Populist Thomas S. Pettit , to secure victory in the general election by just under 9 @,@ 000 votes . This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true , two @-@ party competition in Kentucky politics . 
 A powerful Democratic foe of Bradley had begun his rise to power in the Kentucky Senate . Kenton County 's William Goebel became the leader of a new group of young Democrats who were seen as enemies of large corporations , particularly the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , and friends of the working man . Goebel was known as aloof and calculating . Unmarried and with few close friends of either gender , he was singularly driven by political power . 
 Goebel was chosen president pro tem of the Senate for the 1898 legislative session . On February 1 , 1898 , he sponsored a measure later called the Goebel Election Law . The law created a Board of Election Commissioners , appointed by the General Assembly , who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky 's counties and were empowered to decide disputed elections . Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic , the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self @-@ serving to Goebel ; it was opposed even by some Democrats . Nevertheless , Goebel was able to hold enough members of his party together to override Governor Bradley 's veto , making the bill law . As leader of the party , Goebel essentially hand @-@ picked the members of the Election Commission . He chose three staunch Democrats — W. S. Pryor , former chief justice of the Kentucky Court of Appeals ; W. T. Ellis , former U. S. Representative from Daviess County ; and C. B. Poyntz , former head of the state railroad commission . Republicans organized a test case against the law , but the Court of Appeals found it constitutional . 
 = = Democratic nominating convention = = 
 Three Democratic candidates had announced intentions to run for governor in 1899 — Goebel , former Kentucky Attorney General P. Wat Hardin , and former congressman William J. Stone . Hardin , a native of Mercer County , had the backing of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad . Lyon County 's Stone had the backing of the state 's agricultural interests . Goebel generally had the backing of urban voters . Going into the party 's nominating convention , Hardin was the favorite to win the nomination . Knowing that combining forces was the only way to prevent Hardin 's nomination , representatives of Goebel and Stone met on June 19 , 1899 , to work out a deal . According to Urey Woodson , a Goebel representative at the meeting , the two sides signed an agreement whereby half of the Louisville delegation , which was committed to Goebel , would vote for Stone . Both men agreed that , should one of them be defeated or withdraw from the race , they would encourage their delegates to vote for the other rather than support Hardin . 
 The Democratic nominating convention began on June 20 , at the Music Hall on Market Street in Louisville . The first order of business was to nominate a convention chairman . Ollie M. James , a supporter of Stone , nominated Judge David Redwine . When Woodson seconded the nomination , the deal between Stone and Goebel became apparent to all . Hardin supporters nominated William H. Sweeney , but the Stone @-@ Goebel alliance elected Redwine . The membership of several county delegations was challenged ; these cases would be decided by the credentials committee . This committee was also stacked against Hardin ; his supporters made up just four of the thirteen members . Prolonged deliberations by the credentials committee caused the delegates to become restless , and hundreds of people — both delegates and non @-@ delegates — entered the Music Hall attempting to disrupt the convention . When Redwine summoned Louisville city police to the hall to maintain order , Hardin supporters accused him of using intimidation tactics . The credentials committee finally issued its report on June 23 . Of the twenty @-@ eight cases where delegates were contested , twenty @-@ six of them were decided in favor of Goebel or Stone supporters . 
 Formal nominations began the following day . Hardin felt as though he had been cheated and withdrew his candidacy , although some loyal delegates continued to vote for him . Delegate John Stockdale Rhea nominated Stone . Stone believed that his agreement with Goebel meant , with Hardin 's withdrawal , Goebel would instruct his delegates to vote for Stone , maintaining a unified party . That understanding vanished when another delegate nominated Goebel . Stone was further incensed when all of the Louisville delegation voted for Goebel instead of being split between Stone and Goebel , as the two men had previously agreed . In retaliation , some Stone supporters began to back Hardin . Seeing the breakdown of the Stone @-@ Goebel alliance , Hardin reversed his withdrawal . After numerous ballots , the convention was deadlocked on the night of June 24 with each candidate receiving about one @-@ third of the votes . No deliberations were held on Sunday , June 25 , and when the delegates reconvened on Monday , June 26 , the hall was filled with police per Redwine 's request . Rhea requested that the police be removed to prevent intimidation , but Redwine ruled the motion out of order . Another delegate appealed Redwine 's decision , and , in violation of parliamentary rule , Redwine ruled the appeal out of order . Angered by Redwine 's obviously biased rulings , delegates for Stone and Hardin then began trying to disrupt the convention by blowing horns , singing , yelling , and standing on chairs . Although voting was attempted , many delegates abstained because they were unable to hear and understand what was going on . When the voting — such as it was — ended , the chair announced that Goebel had a majority of the votes cast , but Goebel sent word to Redwine that he would only accept the nomination if he received an absolute majority of the delegates . Further attempts to vote were likewise disrupted , and the meeting adjourned for the day . 
 On the morning of June 27 , the hall was orderly . Stone and Hardin both called for the convention to adjourn sine die . Again , Redwine ruled this motion and the subsequent appeal of his decision out of order . Leaders for Stone and Hardin announced they would not disrupt the proceedings as they had the previous day and that they would abide by the convention 's decision . As voting proceeded , Stone and Hardin unsuccessfully tried to form an alliance against Goebel , and the balloting was deadlocked for twenty @-@ four consecutive ballots . The delegates agreed to drop the third @-@ place candidate on the next ballot ; that turned out to be Stone . The votes of the urban centers , previously divided between Stone and Goebel , now went entirely to Goebel , while the rural western counties that had supported Stone went to Hardin . The vote remained close , but as the alphabetical roll call proceeded , Goebel secured the votes of Stone 's Union County delegation , giving him the nomination . Following the vote , Hardin and Stone leaders pledged their support to Goebel , though some did so in qualified terms . For lieutenant governor , the Democrats nominated J. C. W. Beckham who , at age 29 , was not yet legally old enough to assume the governorship if called on to do so . Goebel questioned the selection of Beckham because Beckham 's native Nelson County had voted for Hardin and was largely controlled by political boss Ben Johnson , but Goebel 's allies convinced him that Beckham would be loyal to his program . Among the other nominees was ex @-@ Confederate soldier Robert J. Breckinridge , Jr . , for attorney general . This nomination helped placate the numerous ex @-@ Confederates in the party , since Goebel 's father had fought for the Union . It was not enough , however , to persuade Breckinridge 's brother , former congressman W. C. P. Breckinridge , to support the ticket .

 Potential Republican gubernatorial candidates were initially few . Some saw Kentucky 's 18 @,@ 000 @-@ vote plurality for William Jennings Bryan in the 1896 presidential election as a sure sign that the state would vote Democratic in 1899 . Others were not interested in being on the defense against the inevitable Democratic attacks on the Bradley administration . Still others were intimidated by the prospect of being defeated by the machinery of the Goebel Election Law . Party leaders were encouraged , however , by the deep Democratic divisions at the Music Hall Convention . Sitting attorney general William S. Taylor was the first to announce his candidacy and soon secured the support of Republican senator William Deboe . Later candidates included Hopkins County judge Clifton J. Pratt and sitting state Auditor Sam H. Stone . The former was the choice of Governor Bradley , while the latter was supported by Lexington Herald editor Sam J. Roberts . Taylor , like Goebel , was a skilled political organizer . He was able to create a strong political machine amongst the county delegations and seemed the favorite to win the nomination . 
 The Republican nominating convention convened on July 12 in Lexington , Kentucky . Angry that his party had not more seriously considered his candidate , Governor Bradley did not attend . Black leaders in the party threatened to follow Bradley and organize their own nominating convention , as they believed Taylor represented the " lily @-@ white " branch of the party . Taylor attempted to hold the party together by making one of the black leaders permanent secretary of the convention and promising to appoint other black leaders to his cabinet if elected . He also tried to bring Bradley back to the convention by promising to nominate Bradley 's nephew , Edwin P. Morrow , for secretary of state . Bradley refused the offer . In the face of Taylor 's superior organization , Auditor Stone announced that he desired to see a united party and moved that Taylor be nominated unanimously ; Judge Pratt seconded the motion . Other notable nominations were John Marshall for lieutenant governor , Caleb Powers for secretary of state , and Judge Pratt for attorney general . 
 = = " Honest Election Democrats " = = 
 Some Democrats remained unsatisfied with the outcome of the Music Hall Convention . After a period of silence , candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it . Although Goebel 's allies attempted to defend him against the charges , Stone 's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens . Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate , and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could give him the governorship . 
 A group of Louisville Democrats , supporters of U. S. Senator Jo Blackburn , made the first formal calls for a new convention . A short time after , a large meeting at Mount Sterling gave the movement a definite form . They called for a meeting in Lexington on August 2 to organize the details of a new convention . At subsequent mass meetings , it was announced that former governor John Y. Brown would accept the nomination of a second convention , should one be held . As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel , this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats . Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington . Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National Convention and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted . Then , ex @-@ governor Brown addressed the crowd . Finally , the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16 . 
 Representatives from 108 of Kentucky 's 120 counties attended the convention . Among the attendees were the editors of the Lexington Herald , Louisville Evening Post , and Louisville Dispatch , former congressman Owens , former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives Harvey Myers , Jr . , and political bosses William <unk> , John <unk> , and Theodore Hallam . The convention nominated an entire slate of candidates for state office , with former governor Brown at the head . They also put forward a platform condemning the Music Hall Convention , the Goebel Election Law , and the presidential administration of William McKinley . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 Goebel 's campaign staff included Senator Jo Blackburn , former governor James B. McCreary , and political boss Percy Haly . Goebel opened his campaign on August 12 in Mayfield , a city in the heavily Democratic Jackson Purchase region of the state . He attacked the Louisville and Nashville Railroad and charged that wealthy corporate interests from outside the state were attempting to influence the choice of Kentucky 's governor . 
 Taylor opened his campaign on August 22 in London , a Republican stronghold in eastern Kentucky . Among his supporters were Senator Deboe , Congressman Samuel Pugh , Caleb Powers , and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas Z. Morrow ( who was also the brother @-@ in @-@ law of Governor Bradley ) . Taylor stressed the economic prosperity brought about during the McKinley administration . He reminded the crowd that the Republicans had not supported the enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now support what he called the " political enslavement " that would result from electing Goebel . 
 Brown opened his campaign in Bowling Green on August 26 . Because of his age and ill health , he made no more than one speech per week . Nevertheless , he toured the Commonwealth , questioning the sincerity of Goebel 's Free Silver views . He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention , asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took place there . He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy . Brown 's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters . 
 Although ex @-@ Confederates were generally a safe voting bloc for Democrats , Goebel could not heavily rely on them because of his father 's ties to the Union . Also , in 1895 , Goebel had killed John Sanford , an ex @-@ Confederate , in a duel stemming from a personal dispute between the two men . This made him particularly odious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum , a friend of Sanford 's , who said of Goebel at a campaign rally in Bowling Green " [ W ] hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky , in convention assembled , sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for the governorship of this great state , I will support him — but lower than that you shall not drag me . " Goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex @-@ Confederates by courting the black vote , long given to the Republicans , though he had to do so carefully to avoid further alienating his own party base . Unlike other Democrats , Goebel had not voted on the Separate Coach Bill , a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities . Most blacks opposed the bill , and Goebel tried to remain silent on the issue , but when pressed , he admitted in a campaign event in <unk> that he supported the bill and would oppose its repeal . Likewise , Taylor had tried to dodge the issue of the Separate Coach Bill to avoid upsetting the " lily white " branch of his party , but a week after Goebel took a position in favor of the bill , Taylor came out against it . This marked a turning point in the campaign , as blacks , at first cool toward Taylor , now actively supported him . 
 The dying Populist Party had also nominated a full slate of candidates for state offices , eroding some of Goebel 's populist base . Although the Populist Party platform was similar to Goebel 's , it also explicitly condemned the Goebel Election Law . Thomas Pettit , the Populist candidate from the 1895 gubernatorial election , campaigned for Goebel , but many of the other leaders in the party did not . With his support slipping on every side , Goebel appealed to William Jennings Bryan to come to the state and campaign for him . Known as " the Great Commoner " , Bryan was immensely popular with Kentuckians , particularly Democrats and Populists . After refusing initial requests , Bryan finally came to the state and , in three days , crisscrossed the state with Goebel to stir up support . Bryan 's visit helped solidify Democrats behind Goebel and took significant support from the Brown ticket . 
 No sooner had Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley reversed course and began stumping for Taylor . Though he insisted he only wanted to defend his administration from Democratic attacks , Louisville Courier @-@ Journal editor Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor 's support for his anticipated senatorial bid . Bradley kicked off his tour of the state in Louisville , charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state 's best men had deserted him . As evidence , he cited Goebel 's lack of support from Democrat John G. Carlisle , his former ally , as well as Senator William Lindsay , W. C. P. Breckinridge , John Y. Brown , Theodore Hallum , W. C. Owens , Wat Hardin , and William Stone . He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party . He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats ' support of the Separate Coach Bill . Bradley and Republican leader ( and later governor ) Augustus E. Willson toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket , often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor . 
 In the final two weeks of the campaign , Brown was injured in an accident and became a wheelchair user . This was a severe blow to an already faltering campaign , and it became clear that the race would primarily be between Goebel and Taylor . Both men spent the last days of the campaign in Louisville , knowing that , with its sizable population , it would be key to the election . Goebel continued his attack on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad , supporting striking laborers from the railroad and charging that the Republican party was controlled by trusts . Both Republicans and Democrats warned of the possibility that election fraud and violence would be perpetrated by the other side . Louisville mayor Charles P. Weaver , a Goebel Democrat , added 500 recruits to the city 's police force just before the election , leading to charges that voter intimidation would occur in that city . Governor Bradley countered by ordering the state militia to be ready to quell any disturbances across the state . On election day , the headline of the Courier @-@ Journal proclaimed " <unk> Rule " . 
 = = Election and aftermath = = 
 For all the claims about the potential for violence , election day , November 7 , remained mostly calm across the state . Fewer than a dozen people were arrested statewide . Voting returns were slow , and on election night , the race was still too close to call . When the official tally was announced , Taylor had won by a vote of 193 @,@ 714 to 191 @,@ 331 . Brown had garnered 12 @,@ 040 votes , and Populist candidate Blair had captured 2 @,@ 936 . Had Goebel been able to win the votes that went to either of the third party candidates , he could have saved the election for the Democrats . Charges of fraud began even before the official returns were announced . In Nelson County , 1 @,@ 200 ballots listed the Republican candidate as " W. P. Taylor " instead of " W. S. Taylor " ; Democrats claimed these votes should be invalidated . In Knox and Johnson counties , voters complained of " thin tissue ballots " that allowed the voter 's choices to be seen through them . One Democratic political boss even called for the entire Louisville vote to be invalidated because the state militia had intimidated voters there . ( Taylor had won by about 3 @,@ 000 votes in Louisville . ) 
 Republicans gained an early victory when the Court of Appeals ruled that the Nelson County vote should stand . The final result of the election , however , would be decided by the Board of Elections , created by the Goebel Election Law . Newspapers across the state , both Democratic and Republican , called for the Board 's decision to be accepted as final . Tensions grew as the date for the Board 's hearings drew near , and small bands of armed men from heavily Republican eastern Kentucky began to arrive in Frankfort , the state capital . Just before the Board 's decision was announced , the number of armed mountain men was estimated at 500 . Although the Board was thought to be controlled by Goebel , it rendered a surprise 2 – 1 decision to let the announced vote tally stand . The Board 's majority opinion claimed that they did not have any judicial power and were thus unable to hear proof or swear witnesses . Taylor was inaugurated on December 12 , 1899 . Democrats were outraged ; party leaders met on December 14 and called on Goebel and Beckham to contest the election . Goebel had been inclined to let the result stand and seek a seat in the U. S. Senate in 1901 , but he heeded the wishes of his party 's leaders and contested the Board 's decision . 
 Allie Young , chairman of the state Democratic Party , called a caucus of the Democratic members of the General Assembly to be held on January 1 , 1900 . As a result of the caucus , J. C. S. Blackburn was nominated for a seat in the U. S. Senate , Goebel was nominated as president pro tem of the Kentucky Senate , and South Trimble was nominated as speaker of the House . When the General Assembly convened , each Democratic nominee was elected , the party possessing heavy majorities in both houses . Lieutenant Governor Marshall presented a list of committees to the Senate , but that body voted 19 – 17 to set aside this list and approve a list provided by Goebel instead . Similarly , in the House , the list of committees presented by Speaker Trimble and approved by that body enumerated forty committees , none of them with a Republican majority . 
 Goebel 's and Beckham 's challenges to the election results were received by the General Assembly on January 2 . The following day , the Assembly appointed a contest committee to investigate the allegations contained in the challenges , voter fraud and illegal military intimidation of voters among them . The members of the committee were drawn at random , although the drawing was likely rigged — only one Republican joined ten Democrats on the committee . ( Chance dictated that the committee should have contained four or five Republicans . ) The joint committee on the rules recommended that the contest committee report at the pleasure of the General Assembly , that debate was limited once the findings were presented , and that the report be voted on in a joint session of the Assembly . The rules further provided that the speaker of the House would preside over this joint session instead of the lieutenant governor , as was customary . The Republican minority fought these provisions , but the Democratic majority passed them over their opposition . 
 = = = Goebel 's assassination = = = 
 Republicans around the state expected the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor . Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital . Taylor , recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence , ordered the men home , and many of them complied . Still , two or three hundred remained , awaiting the election committee 's findings . Others remained as witnesses set to testify before the contest committee . Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police , who were mostly Goebel partisans . Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them , citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest . To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon , many of the Republican partisans began wearing their guns openly , adding to the tensions in the city , but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police . 
 On the morning of January 30 , as Goebel and two friends walked toward the capitol building , a shot rang out , and Goebel fell wounded . He was taken to a nearby hotel to be treated for his wounds . Soldiers filled the streets and blocked entrance to the capitol . <unk> , the contest committee met in Frankfort 's city hall . By a strictly party @-@ line vote , they adopted a majority report that claimed Goebel and Beckham had received the most legitimate votes and should be installed in their respective offices . 
 A little over an hour after the committee 's meeting , Governor Taylor declared a state of insurrection and called out the state militia . He called the legislature into special session , not in Frankfort , but in heavily Republican London , which he insisted was a safer location . Defiant Democratic legislators refused to heed the call to London , but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort , they found the doors barred by armed citizens . On January 31 , 1900 , they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel , with no Republicans present , and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee , invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor . Goebel was sworn in , and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down . He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort . The Republican militia refused to disband , and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol . Civil war seemed possible . 
 Taylor apprised President McKinley of the situation in Kentucky . He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops , and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky 's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort . Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor 's call to convene in London on February 5 . Meanwhile , in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting , Democratic legislators met at the state house — no longer being denied entrance by the state militia — and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election . Both men again took the oath of office . 
 As a test to see if his gubernatorial authority was still recognized , Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County . The pardon was signed by the proper county officials , but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man . It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner , but no further attempts were made to secure his release . Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office , Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel 's unknown assailant . Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer in the absence of a request to do so by the officials in Franklin County , he offered a $ 500 reward from his own money . 
 Goebel died of his wounds on February 3 . He remains the only American governor ever assassinated while in office . With Goebel , the most controversial figure in the election , dead , tensions began to ease somewhat . Leaders from both sides drafted an agreement whereby Taylor and Lieutenant Governor Marshall would step down from their respective offices ; in exchange , they would receive immunity from prosecution in any actions they may have taken with regard to Goebel 's assassination . The state militia would withdraw from Frankfort , and the Goebel Election Law would be repealed and replaced with a fairer law . Despite the agreement of his allies , Taylor refused to sign the agreement . He did , however , lift the ban on the General Assembly meeting in Frankfort . 
 = = = Legal challenges = = = 
 When the legislature convened on February 19 , two sets of officers attempted to preside . Marshall and Goebel 's lieutenant governor , J. C. W. Beckham , both claimed the right to preside over the state senate . Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate ; Beckham counter @-@ sued for possession of the capitol and executive building . The cases were consolidated , and both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the courts decide the election . On March 10 , a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats . By a 6 – 1 vote , the Kentucky Court of Appeals , the state 's court of last resort at the time , upheld the circuit court 's decision on April 6 , legally unseating Taylor and Marshall . The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States , but the court refused to intervene in the case because it found that there were no federal questions involved . The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan . 
 Sixteen indictments were returned in connection with Goebel 's assassination , including one against deposed governor Taylor . In May 1900 , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , and the governor , James A. Mount refused to extradite him for trial . Three others charged in the assassination turned state 's evidence . Only five of the sixteen went to trial ; two of those were acquitted . Three men were eventually convicted for playing roles in Goebel 's assassination . Taylor 's secretary of state , Caleb Powers , was accused of being the mastermind behind the assassination . Henry Youtsey , a clerk from Northern Kentucky , was said to have aided the assassin . James B. Howard , a participant in a bloody feud in Clay County was charged with being the actual assassin . 
 According to the prosecution 's theory , the assassin shot Goebel from the secretary of state 's office on the first floor of a building next to the state capitol . However , much of the testimony against the accused men was conflicting , and some of it was later proven to be perjured . Most of the state 's judges were Democratic supporters of Goebel and juries were packed with partisan Democrats . The appellate courts , however , were largely Republican , and the convictions returned by the lower courts were often overturned , with the cases being remanded for new trials . Howard was tried and convicted in September 1900 , January 1902 , and April 1903 ; his final appeal failed , and he was sentenced to life in prison . Powers was also convicted three times — in July 1900 , October 1901 , and August 1903 ; a fourth trial in November 1907 ended in a hung jury . In 1908 , Powers and Howard were pardoned by Republican governor Augustus E. Willson . Months later , Willson also issued pardons for former governor Taylor and several others still under indictment . Despite the pardon , Taylor seldom returned to Kentucky ; he became an insurance executive in Indiana and died there in 1928 . Youtsey , the only defendant not to appeal his sentence , was paroled in 1916 and pardoned in 1919 by Democratic governor James D. Black . 
 = Atlantic blue marlin = 
 The Atlantic blue marlin ( Makaira nigricans ) is a species of marlin endemic to the Atlantic Ocean . The Atlantic blue marlin ( hereafter , blue marlin ) feeds on a wide variety of organisms near the surface . It uses its bill to stun , injure , or kill while knifing through a school of fish or other prey , then returns to eat the injured or stunned fish . Marlin is a popular game fish . The relatively high fat content of its meat makes it commercially valuable in certain markets . It is the national fish of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas and is thus featured on its Coat of Arms . 
 Blue marlin are distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic , Indian , and Pacific Oceans . A <unk> fish that spends the majority of its life in the open sea far from land , the blue marlin preys on a wide variety of marine organisms , mostly near the surface , often using its bill to stun or injure its prey . 
 Females can grow up to four times the weight of males . The maximum published weight is 818 kg ( 1 @,@ 803 lb ) and length 5 m ( 16 @.@ 4 ft ) . 
 Adult blue marlin have few predators apart from man . They are sought after as a highly prized game fish by anglers and are taken by commercial fishermen , both as a directed catch and as bycatch in major industrial tuna fisheries . Blue marlin are currently considered a threatened species by the IUCN due to overfishing . 
 Some other historic English names for the blue marlin are Cuban black marlin , ocean gar , and ocean guard . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 The blue marlin is placed in the genus Makaira . This name is derived from the Greek word <unk> , meaning " a short sword or bent dagger " , and the Latin <unk> , " sword " . The specific epithet nigricans is Latin for " becoming black " . The blue marlin is part of the billfish family <unk> and is in the perch @-@ like order Perciformes . In addition , it is in the suborder <unk> and is a member of the subclass Neopterygii , which means " new wings " . It is also in the class of Actinopterygii , which includes ray @-@ finned fishes and spiny @-@ rayed fishes , and the superclass Osteichthyes , which includes all of the bony fishes . 
 The classification of the Atlantic blue marlin ( Makaira nigricans ) and the Indo @-@ Pacific blue marlin ( Makaira mazara ) as separate species is under debate . Genetic data suggest , although the two groups are isolated from each other , they are both the same species , with the only genetic exchange occurring when Indo @-@ Pacific blue marlin migrate to and contribute genes to the Atlantic population . A separate study by V. P. Buonaccorsi , J. R. <unk> , and Graves indicated that both Indo @-@ Pacific and Atlantic show " striking phylogeographic partitioning " of mitochondrial and microsatellite loci .

 The biggest females are more than four times as heavy as the biggest males , which rarely exceed 160 kg ( 350 lb ) in weight . The longest females can reach a length of 5 m ( 16 ft ) with the bill , from eye to tip , constituting about 20 % of the total body length . 
 Body mass in the largest female specimens has been reported from 540 to 820 kg ( 1 @,@ 190 to 1 @,@ 810 lb ) , depending on the source ( few large specimens are scientifically verified ) . The largest blue marlin caught by IGFA angling rules is from Vitoria , Brazil , which weighed 1 @,@ 402 lb ( 636 kg ) . ; fishermen often refer to individual <unk> that reach or exceed 1 @,@ 000 pounds as " <unk> " . 
 Both sexes have 24 vertebrae , of which 11 are precaudal and 13 are caudal . 
 The marlin has two dorsal fins and two anal fins . The fins are supported by bony spines known as rays . Its first dorsal fin has 39 to 43 rays from front to back . Its second dorsal fin has six or seven rays . Its first anal fin , which is similar in shape and size to the second dorsal fin , has 13 to 16 rays , and the second anal fin has six or seven rays . The pectoral fins , which have 19 to 22 rays , are long and narrow and can be drawn in to the sides of the body . The pelvic fins are shorter than the pectorals , have a poorly developed membrane , and are <unk> into ventral grooves . Its first anal fin , along with its pectoral and caudal fins , can be folded into grooves . This streamlines the fish and thereby reduces drag . 
 Blue marlin , like other billfish , can rapidly change color , an effect created by pigment @-@ containing iridophores and light @-@ reflecting skin cells . 
 Most often , however , the body is blue @-@ black on top with a silvery white underside . It has about 15 rows of pale , cobalt @-@ colored stripes , each of which has round dots and / or thin bars , located on both sides of the fish . The first dorsal fin membrane is dark blue or almost black and has no dots or marks . Other fins are normally brownish @-@ black , sometimes with a hint of dark blue . The bases of the first and second anal fins have a hint of silvery white . 
 The body is covered with thick , bony , elongated scales that have one , two , or three posterior points , with one being the most common form . 
 The bill is long and stout . Both the jaws and the palatines ( the roof of the mouth ) are covered with small , file @-@ like teeth . The lateral line system is a group of <unk> rooted in lateral line canals that can sense weak water motions and large changes in pressure . It has the appearance of a net . It is obvious in immature specimens but unclear in adults , becoming progressively embedded in the skin . The anus is just in front of the origin of the first anal fin . 
 = = Range and migration = = 
 Blue marlin are found year @-@ round in tropical oceanic waters of the Atlantic and Indo @-@ Pacific . The range expands into temperate waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres during the warmer months and contracts towards the Equator during colder months . Warm currents such as the Gulf Stream in the western Atlantic and the Agulhas Current in the western Indian Ocean have a major influence on their seasonal distribution . 
 In the Atlantic , the blue marlin 's latitudinal range extends from about 45 ° N to about 35 ° S. It is less abundant in the eastern Atlantic , where it mostly occurs off Africa between the latitudes of 25 ° N and 25 ° S. The largest numbers are usually found in waters warmer than 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) , but blue marlin have been found at surface water temperatures as high as 30 @.@ 5 ° C ( 86 @.@ 9 ° F ) and as low as 21 @.@ 7 ° C ( 71 @.@ 1 ° F ) . 
 Tagging studies , using conventional " spaghetti " tags , and more recently pop @-@ up satellite tags , have given researchers a glimpse into blue marlin migration patterns and habits . <unk> of tagged fish have shown multiple movements between the Caribbean Islands and Venezuela and the Bahamas , as well as between the Caribbean Saint Thomas , U.S. Virgin Islands and West Africa , as well <unk> travel . Most notably , a blue marlin tagged off the coast of Delaware was recovered near the island of Mauritius off the southeast coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean – a voyage of 9 @,@ 254 miles . Blue marlin tagged in the Pacific have also been recovered in the Indian Ocean . Several fish have been recaptured in the same general area where they were tagged , implying reverse migration after / over several years , but the data are insufficient to accurately determine seasonality . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Once blue marlin reach maturity , they have few predators , with the most important probably being large pelagic sharks such as the shortfin mako and great white shark . 
 Blue marlin have many parasites . They include parasites from these groups : Digenea ( flukes ) , <unk> ( tissue flukes ) , Monogenea ( <unk> ) , Cestoda ( tapeworms ) , Nematoda ( roundworms ) , <unk> ( spiny @-@ headed worms ) , copepods , barnacles , and cookiecutter sharks . 
 <unk> are commonly found attached to blue marlin , often inside the opercula . 
 = = Lifecycle = = 
 Growth and maturity 
 Atlantic blue marlin reach sexual maturity at the age of two to four years . Males reach sexual maturity at a weight of 35 – 44 kg ( 77 – 97 lb ) and females at 47 – 61 kg ( 104 – 134 lb ) . Blue marlin breed in late summer and fall . Females may spawn as many as four times in one season . They often release over seven million eggs at once , each about 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 039 in ) in diameter . Few reach sexual maturity . The planktonic young drift freely in the ocean 's pelagic zone . Larvae inhabit the west central Atlantic off Georgia , North Carolina , Florida , Jamaica , Bahamas , the Dominican Republic , and Puerto Rico , and also the southwest Atlantic off Brazil . The larvae may grow as much as 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) in a day . On their sides and dorsal surfaces they are blue @-@ black in color , while ventrally they are white . Both the caudal fin and the caudal peduncle ( the narrow part of the fish 's body to which the caudal or tail fin is attached ) are clear . Two iridescent blue patches occur on the head , and some individuals have darker spots on their backs . In adolescents , the first dorsal fin is large and concave , gradually reducing in proportion to body size with continued growth . Males may live for 18 years , and females up to 27 . 
 Diet and feeding 
 The larvae feed upon a variety of zooplankton along with drifting fish eggs and other larvae . They progress to feeding on a wide range of fishes , particularly <unk> , such as mackerel and tuna , squid , and especially near oceanic islands and coral reefs , on juvenile inshore fish . Studies of stomach contents in both the Atlantic and Pacific have found that smaller schooling <unk> such as frigate mackerel , bullet tuna , and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet . Squid and deep @-@ sea fishes such as <unk> and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas . Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin , as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100 @-@ lb range . Conversely , they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and <unk> . 
 Scientists and fishermen have long debated the extent to which blue marlin and other billfish use their elongated upper jaw in feeding . A 2007 Japanese study of stomach contents of fish captured in a commercial trolling fishery found that 130 undigested prey items obtained from 227 blue marlin had spearing , slashing , and other injuries that were judged to have been inflicted by the bill .

 Marlin has commercial value throughout the world , with landings totalling 3 @,@ 064 metric tons in 2000 . It is particularly valued in Japan for sashimi . In Hawaii , where the fish is known as a 'u , blue marlin meat is sometimes smoked and sold by roadside vendors . 
 Blue marlin are often caught as bycatch in tuna longline fisheries .

 Sport fishermen first encountered blue marlin in the Bahamas in the 1920s and early 1930s , when pioneering big @-@ game fishermen such as Van Campen <unk> and S. Kip Farrington began exploring the waters offshore of Bimini and Cat Cay . In the Pacific , blue marlin ( then known as silver marlin or often misidentified as the related black marlin ) were caught by author / angler Zane Grey in Tahiti in the 1930s . Since then , blue marlin have been renowned as one of the world 's greatest game fishes . The <unk> pursuit of marlin and other billfish has developed into a multimillion dollar industry that includes hundreds of companies and thousands of jobs for boat operators , boat builders , marinas , dealerships , and fishing tackle manufacturers and dealers . 
 The most established sport fisheries for blue marlin are found along the eastern seaboard and the Gulf Coast of the United States , Bermuda , the <unk> and several other Caribbean islands ( notably St Thomas and Puerto Rico ) . Recreational fishing for blue marlin also takes place in Brazil , Venezuela , and the Atlantic coast of Mexico , particularly the Yucatan peninsula . In the eastern Atlantic , blue marlin sport fisheries exist from the Algarve coast of Portugal in the north to Angola in the south and include the islands of the Azores , Canaries , Cape Verde , Madeira , and Ascension Island . 
 The International Game Fish Association all @-@ tackle world record for blue marlin currently stands at 1 @,@ 402 lb 2 oz ( 636 kg ) . This fish was captured in Vitoria , Brazil .

 The blue marlin is under intense pressure from longline fishing . In the Caribbean region alone , Japanese and Cuban fishermen annually take over a thousand tons . All vessels within 200 mi ( 320 km ) of the U.S. coastline are required to release any billfish caught . However , the survival rate of released fish is low because of damage during capture . 
 Makaira nigricans is listed as a threatened species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . In 2010 , Greenpeace International added the blue marlin to its seafood red list . 
 Sport fishermen have been at the forefront of efforts to conserve blue marlin populations . The initial efforts to develop electronic tags for tracking highly migratory fish were carried out on marlin in Hawaii , in collaboration with anglers in the Hawaiian International <unk> Tournament .

 Both Zane Grey and Ernest Hemingway , who fished for blue marlin off the Florida Keys , the Bahamas , and most famously in Cuba , wrote extensively about their pursuit . 
 In Ernest Hemingway 's novella The Old Man and the Sea , a fisherman named Santiago battles a blue marlin for three days off the coast of Cuba .

 Sitakunda ( Bengali : <unk> ্ <unk> <unk> , IPA : [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] ) is an upazila , or administrative unit , in the Chittagong District of Bangladesh . It includes one urban settlement , the Sitakunda Town , and 10 unions , the lowest of administrative units in Bangladesh . It is one of the 14 upazilas , the second tier of administrative units , of the Chittagong District , which also includes 12 thanas , the urban equivalent of upazilas . The district is part of the Chittagong Division , the highest order of administrative units in Bangladesh . Sitakunda is the home of the country 's first eco @-@ park , as well as alternative energy projects , specifically wind energy and geothermal power . 
 Sitakunda is one of the oldest sites of human habitation in Bangladesh . During much of its history , it was ruled alternatively by various Buddhist rulers of Myanmar in the east and Muslims rulers of Bengal in the west . For a brief period in the 8th century , it was ruled by the Buddhist Pala Empire of India . The eastern rulers originated from the Kingdom of Arakan , the Mrauk U dynasty , Arakanese pirates and the Pagan Kingdom . The western rulers came from the Sultanate of Bengal and the Mughal province ( Suba ) of <unk> . European rule of Sitakunda was heralded by Portuguese privateers in 16th and 17th centuries , who ruled together with the pirates ; and the British Raj in 18th and 19th centuries , who unified Sitakunda into the rest of the Chittagong District . 
 Economic development in Sitakunda is largely driven by the Dhaka @-@ Chittagong Highway and the railway . Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area , it also has the largest ship breaking industry in the world . The industry has been accused of neglecting workers ' rights , especially concerning work safety practices and child labor . It has also been accused of harming the environment , particularly by causing soil contamination . Sitakunda 's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation , over @-@ fishing , and groundwater contamination . The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes , cyclones , and storm surges . It lies on one of the most active seismic faults in Bangladesh , the Sitakunda – Teknaf fault . 
 Sitakunda is renowned for its numerous Islamic , Hindu and Buddhist shrines . It has 280 mosques , 8 <unk> , 49 Hindu temples , 4 ashrams , and 3 Buddhist temples . Among its notable religious sites are the Chandranath Temple ( a Shakti Peetha or holy pilgrimage site ) , <unk> Vihara ( founded by the scholar <unk> <unk> ) , and the Hammadyar Mosque ( founded by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah ) . The attraction of Sitakunda as a tourist destination is elevated by these pilgrimage sites along with the hill range and the eco @-@ park . Despite its diverse population , the area has gone through episodes of communal strife , including attacks on places of worship . There have been reports of activity by the Islamic militant group Jama <unk> Mujahideen Bangladesh since the early 2000s . 
 = = History = = 
 The legends of the area state the sage Bhargava created a pond ( kunda ) for Sita to bathe in when her husband Lord Ramchandra visited during his exile in the forests . Sitakunda derived its name from this incident . 
 Sitakunda has been occupied by humans since the Neolithic era ; tools associated with the prehistoric Assam group have been found throughout the area . In 1886 , shouldered celts manufactured from petrified wood were discovered , as reported by Indian archaeologist <unk> Bandyopadhyay in his book <unk> <unk> , or History of Bengal , ( volume I , 1914 ) . In 1917 , British mineralogist Dr. J. <unk> Brown uncovered more prehistoric celts . Large quantities of pebbles have also been found , but archaeologists have not determined whether they were used in the construction of prehistoric tools . 
 During the 6th and 7th centuries CE , the Chittagong region was ruled by the Kingdom of Arakan . In the next century , it was briefly ruled by Dharmapala ( reign : 770 – 810 ) of the Pala Empire . The area was conquered in 1340 by Sultan Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah ( reign : 1338 – 1349 ) of Sonargaon , who founded the first dynasty of the Sultanate of Bengal . When Sultan Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah ( reign : 1533 – 1538 ) of the last dynasty of the Sultanate of Bengal was defeated in 1538 by Sher Shah Suri of the Sur Dynasty , the Arakanese captured the region again . <unk> ( reign : 1459 – 1482 ) of the Mrauk U dynasty took advantage of the weakness of Sultan <unk> Shah of Bengal to lead the invasion . In this period , <unk> ( or <unk> ) , a prince of Arakan , established a monastery in Sitakunda . Between 1538 and 1666 , Portuguese privateers ( known as <unk> or <unk> ) made inroads into Chittagong and ruled the region in alliance with Arakanese pirates . During those 128 years , the eastern coast of Bengal became a home to pirates of Portuguese and Arakanese origins . For a brief period in 1550 , it was taken over by Pagan invaders . In 1666 , Mughal commander <unk> Umed Khan conquered the area . 
 Along with the rest of Bengal , Sitakunda came under the rule of the British East India Company after the company 's defeat of the Nawab of Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . Rapid growth in the Bengali population since then resulted in an exodus of non @-@ Bengali people from Sitakunda and its vicinity to the Chittagong Hill Tracts . During the <unk> Yog movement , a part of the Swadeshi Indian independence movement , the governance of Sitakunda was briefly in the hands of Indian nationalists when , in February 1908 , they took over the central government in Kolkata . In 1910 , Indian Petroleum <unk> Company drilled here for hydrocarbon exploration , the first such activity in East Bengal . In 1914 , the first onshore wildcat well in Bangladesh was drilled at Sitakunda anticline to a depth of 762 metres ( 2 @,@ 500 ft ) . By 1914 , however , all four of the wells drilled had proven to be failures . 
 After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 , the British colonial government ( British Raj ) replaced the governance of the East India Company . When the British withdrew in 1947 , after creating the independent states of India and Pakistan , Sitakunda became a part of East Pakistan . The potential for a ship breaking industry first appeared in 1964 when Chittagong Steel House started scrapping MD <unk> , a 20 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 19 @,@ 684 long tons ) Greek ship that had been accidentally beached near <unk> by a tidal bore four years earlier . During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 , Sitakunda was part of Sector 1 , led by <unk> Rahman and Major <unk> Islam of the Mukti Bahini , the forces fighting for the independence of Bangladesh . The ship breaking industry began in earnest in 1974 when <unk> Metal Works started scrapping Al Abbas , a Pakistani ship damaged in 1971 , and flourished in the 1980s . As of 2007 , Sitakunda had overtaken the ship breaking industries of India and Pakistan to become the largest in the world . 
 In the early 2000s , Islamic militant organization Jama <unk> Mujahideen Bangladesh ( JMB ) leader <unk> Islam ( also known as Bangla Bhai ) ran militant training centers in the upazila at which participants learned to make bombs and handle firearms . One of his followers , <unk> Huq , was captured on 21 February 2006 .

 Sitakunda Upazila occupies an area of 483 @.@ 97 square kilometres ( 186 @.@ 86 sq mi ) , which includes 61 @.@ 61 square kilometres ( 23 @.@ 79 sq mi ) of forest . It is bordered by <unk> to the north , <unk> to the south , <unk> , Hathazari and <unk> to the east , and the Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal to the west . The Sitakunda range is a 32 @-@ kilometre ( 20 mi ) long ridge in the center of the upazila , which reaches an altitude of 352 metres ( 1 @,@ 155 ft ) above sea level at Chandranath or Sitakunda peak , the highest peak in Chittagong District . Part of Sitakunda is covered by the low hill ranges , while the rest is in the Bengal flood plain . To the north , Rajbari Tila at 274 metres ( 899 ft ) and <unk> at 244 metres ( 801 ft ) are the highest peaks in this range , which drops abruptly to a height of less than 92 metres ( 302 ft ) in the vicinity of Chittagong City to the south . About 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) north of Sitakunda Town is the <unk> saltwater hot spring , which has been proposed as a source of geothermal energy . There are two waterfalls in the hills : <unk> ( thousand streams ) and <unk> ( hidden stream ) . Both have been identified as sites requiring special attention for protection and preservation by the National Heritage Foundation of Bangladesh . 
 An area prone to cyclones and storm surges , Sitakunda was affected by cyclones in 1960 , 1963 , 1970 , 1988 , 1991 , 1994 and 1997 ; the cyclones of 29 May 1963 , 12 November 1970 , 29 April 1991 made landfall . The intra @-@ deltaic coastline is very close to the tectonic interface of the Indian and Burmese plates , as well as the active Andaman – Nicobar fault system , and is often capable of generating tsunamis . Cyclone preparedness measures are inadequate for the 200 @,@ 000 residents of Sitakunda who were estimated to be living in high risk areas after the 1991 cyclone . For every 5 @,@ 000 people , Sitakunda has only one cyclone shelter , each of which is capable of holding 50 to 60 people . <unk> Union has eleven , Muradpur eight , <unk> seven , and Kumira five . Sitakunda municipality , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> have four shelters each . <unk> has three and Sonaichhari Union has two shelters . 
 The Chittagong Coastal Forest Department developed the river bars ( char in Bengali ) on the bank of the Sonaichhari channel adjacent to the Sitakunda coast into a kilometer @-@ wide coastal mangrove plantation during 1989 – 90 , to reduce the impact of cyclones . Although the site was initially unstable , rapid sediment accretion stabilised the soil , providing the coast with some protection . The cyclone of 1990 smashed about 25 % of a 2 @-@ kilometre ( 1 mi ) sea @-@ wall built using two @-@ ton steel @-@ reinforced concrete blocks , some of which were carried up to 100 metres ( 328 ft ) inland . In contrast , a mangrove plantation just south of the sea @-@ wall sustained damage to less than 1 % of its trees , most of which recovered within six months . The planted mangrove forest that helped Sitakunda to escape as one of the least damaged areas during the devastating 1991 Bangladesh cyclone is under threat from illegal tree @-@ cutting by ship @-@ breakers in the area . 
 Annual average temperature is between 32 @.@ 5 ° C ( 91 ° F ) and 13 @.@ 5 ° C ( 56 ° F ) , with an annual rainfall of 2 @,@ 687 millimetres ( 106 in ) . Along with Chittagong and Hathazari , in June 2007 Sitakunda was badly affected by mudslides caused by heavy rainfall combined with the recent practice of hill @-@ cutting . The mean annual wind speed recorded in Sitakunda between 1991 and 2001 was 1 @.@ 8 knots ( 2 mph ) , as measured by the wind monitoring station built as part of a wind energy exploration project jointly run by the Local Government Engineering Department and the Bangladesh Center for Advanced Studies . A small 300 @-@ watt wind turbine , built by the government , provides electricity to fish farms . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The geological structure of Sitakunda , 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) long and 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) wide , is one of the westernmost structures of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts , delimited by the Feni River in the north , the <unk> River in the south , the Halda River in the east and the Sandwip Channel in the west . The Sitakunda Range acts as a water divide between the Halda Valley and the Sandwip Channel . The 88 kilometres ( 55 mi ) -long Halda flows from <unk> to the Bay of <unk> , and is one of the six tributaries of <unk> , the major river in the area . Sandwip Channel represents the northern end of the western part of the Chittagong @-@ Tripura Folded Belt . 
 The structure contains a thick sedimentary sequence of sandstone , shale and siltstone . The exposed sedimentary rock sequences except limestone , 6 @,@ 500 metres ( 21 @,@ 325 ft ) thick in an average , provide no difference in overall lithology of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts . The Sitakunda fold is an elongated , asymmetrical , box @-@ type double plunging anticline . Both the gently dipping eastern and steeper western flanks of the anticline are truncated abruptly by the alluvial plain of the Feni River . For a lack of infrastructure in Bangladesh , this anticline is one of the few regularly surveyed structures in the country . The syncline from Sitakunda separates the eastern end of the Feni Structure located in the folded flank of the Bengal <unk> . 
 Local experts consider the Sitakunda – Teknaf fault to be one of the two most active seismic faults in Bangladesh . After the earthquake of 2 April 1762 , which caused a permanent submergence of 155 @.@ 4 square kilometres ( 60 @.@ 0 sq mi ) of land near Chittagong and the death of 500 people in Dhaka , two volcanoes are said to have opened in the Sitakunda hills . During a seismic tremor on 7 November 2007 , fire broke out at the <unk> Gas Systems Limited in the <unk> area of the upazila when a pipeline was fractured . The <unk> Clay Formation runs through Sitakunda at a thickness of 168 metres ( 551 ft ) . In the Sitakunda hills , the Boka Bil Shale Formation contains Ostrea <unk> , Ostrea <unk> and numerous plates of Balanus ( a type of Barnacles ) , fragments of Arca , Pecten , <unk> , Oliva and corals . Both formations were identified and named by early 20th @-@ century British petroleum geologist P. Evans .

As of 2001 , the population density of Sitakunda was 692 inhabitants per square kilometre ( 1 @,@ 792 / sq mi ) . 
 Apart from the Bengali majority , there are a number of small communities of ethnic minorities in the area . Many of the resident Rakhine people are believed to have settled here during the Arakanese rule of Chittagong ( 1459 – 1666 ) , though the event is not historically traceable . The Rakhine population in <unk> District migrated from the surrounding area and built up their permanent abode at Ramgarh in the 19th century . Other ethnic groups include the recently migrated Tripuri people .

 Sitakunda as a <unk> came into existence in 1879 , and was renamed to Sitakunda Upazila in 1983 . It ranks third in area and sixth in population out of the 26 upazilas and thanas of Chittagong . Sitakunda Town , with an area of 28 @.@ 63 square kilometres ( 11 @.@ 05 sq mi ) and a population of 36 @,@ 650 , is the administrative center and the sole municipality ( <unk> ) of Sitakunda Upazila . Shafiul Alam is the mayor of the town , gaining a landslide win over his nearest contender M Abul Kalam Azad in the 2008 mayoral election . The rest of the area is rural and organized into 10 Union Committees ( Union <unk> ) , namely <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Bhatiari , Kumira , Muradpur , <unk> , Sonaichhari , Saidpur and Bhatiari Cantonment Area . The area is divided into 69 <unk> and 59 villages . Along with neighboring towns such as Hathazari , <unk> , Patiya and <unk> , Sitakunda Town was developed as a satellite town to relieve the increasing population pressure on Chittagong , with Bhatiari and Sadar unions selected as zones for industrialization , like South <unk> and <unk> . In the 2009 Upazila elections , Abdullah Al Baker <unk> was elected the Upazila Chairman , while Advocate MN Mustafa Nur and <unk> Nahar were elected vice chairmen . 
 Sitakunda Upazila makes the 280th electoral district in Bangladesh , identified as Chittagong @-@ 3 . In the 2008 general election , <unk> Abul <unk> Master of Bangladesh Awami League ( AL ) was elected as the member of parliament , defeating his nearest opponent Mohammad Aslam Chowdhury of Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) . In the previous election held in 2001 , <unk> had defeated Kasem . M <unk> is the Upazila <unk> Officer , the chief executive of the upazila . The upazila is served by a court presided over by a first @-@ class magistrate . The Power Development Board is responsible for supplying electricity to the upazila , but due to power outages the industries in the area are strictly constrained . <unk> Kabir <unk> , the State Minister for Power , lost his job on 29 September 2006 after hundreds of demonstrators in Sitakunda blocked the Dhaka – Chittagong highway in protest at the lack of electricity ; violence also erupted elsewhere in Bangladesh . In case of fire , the services are brought in from the neighboring city of Chittagong . A proposed Kumira – Sitakunda Hill Water Reservoir Project to supply safe drinking water is to be undertaken by the government .

 The ship breaking industry in Sitakunda has surpassed similar industries in India and Pakistan to become the largest in the world . As of August 2007 , over 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 476 @,@ 310 long tons ) of iron had been produced from the scrapping of about 20 ships in the 19 functional ship yards scattered over 8 square kilometres ( 3 sq mi ) along the coast of Sitakunda 8 – 10 kilometres ( 5 – 6 mi ) from Chittagong , near <unk> . Local re @-@ rolling mills , as well as similar mills , process the scrap iron . Bangladesh , with no local metal ore mining industry of its own , is dependent on ship @-@ breaking for its domestic steel requirements ; the re @-@ rolling mills alone substitute for import of about 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 181 @,@ 048 long tons ) of billets and other raw materials . There are 70 companies registered as ship breakers in Chittagong , employing 2 @,@ 000 regular and 25 @,@ 000 semi @-@ skilled and unskilled workers . Organized under the Bangladesh Ship Breakers Association , ( <unk> ) , these include companies within large local conglomerates that sought ISO certificates . 
 The industry has come under threat , both from a decline in the number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70 – 80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns . There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards . The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well , taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality . A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury ( 0 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 7 ppm ) , lead ( 0 @.@ 5 to 21 @.@ 8 ppm ) , chromium ( 220 ppm ) , cadmium ( 0 @.@ 3 to 2 @.@ 9 ppm ) , iron ( 2 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 6 ppm ) , calcium ( 5 @.@ 2 to 23 @.@ 2 ppm ) and magnesium ( 6 @.@ 5 to 10 @.@ 57 ppm ) . Safety standards in the industry are low ; between 1995 and 2005 , 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured . The main causes of death were fire or explosion , suffocation and inhaling CO2 . These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos , lead paint , heavy metals and PCBs . The workers are paid US $ 1 @.@ 75 a day and have little access to medical treatment . Among the workers , 41 % of are aged between 18 and 22 years , and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age . There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non @-@ ferrous items , such as bronze , aluminum , copper , and bronze @-@ amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh . There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in . 
 Employment of local people is low in the industrial facilities . The main occupations of the local people by industry are service ( 28 @.@ 76 % ) , commerce ( 21 @.@ 53 % ) , and agriculture ( 24 @.@ 12 % ) . Out of 12 @,@ 140 @.@ 83 hectares ( 30 @,@ 000 @.@ 64 acres ) of cultivable land 25 @.@ 46 % yield a single crop , 57 @.@ 95 % yield double and 16 @.@ 59 % a treble crop annually . Bean , melon , rubber and betel leaf are the main agricultural exports . Fishing has traditionally been an industry restricted to low caste Hindus belonging to the fisher class , although since the last decades of the 20th century an increasing number of Muslims have joined the sector . Due to the introduction of engine @-@ powered boats and gill nets , there was a rise in fish catches between the 1970s and 1990s , especially in the major fishing season ( mid @-@ July to mid @-@ November ) . Over @-@ fishing , however , has depleted the fish population and some fish species are facing extinction in the area , leading to seasonal food insecurity ( February to April ) . According to a 2001 survey , 4 @,@ 000 people in Sitakunda were engaged in wild shrimp fry collection , harvesting an average of five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half million fries a year . 
 Sitakunda has a cement factory , 12 jute mills , 6 textile mills , 10 re @-@ rolling mills , and 79 functional and defunct shipyards . Two of the operational jute mills are run by the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation , and one has been sold to a private sector company . To protest against privatization , workers of Hafiz Jute Mill , Gul Ahmed Jute Mill , MM Jute Mill and RR Jute Mill blocked the Dhaka – Chittagong Highway for seven hours in September 2007 . As early as 1953 , Sitakunda was described as the location for one of only five poultry farms in East Pakistan , along with Tejgaon ( Dhaka ) , Narayanganj ( Dhaka ) , Jamalpur ( Bogra ) , and Sylhet . Some mining for sand from agricultural lands is carried out along the eastern side of the Dhaka – Chittagong road . Operators of local brick kilns are engaged in illegal hill cutting , a practice that was responsible along with heavy rainfall for the 2007 Chittagong mudslide . The rural poor are supported by Grameen Bank and NGOs such as CARE , BRAC and ASA .

 The Dhaka – Chittagong Highway runs through Sitakunda , connecting the two largest cities in Bangladesh . A workshop conducted by Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) estimated that improving the highway would increase Bangladesh 's GDP by 1 % and its foreign trade by 20 % . This <unk> between the two cities existed in the pre @-@ railway days and has been identified as a part of the medieval southern Silk Road . In 2006 , ADB and the World Bank announced a plan to help Bangladesh build a second highway between Dhaka and Chittagong , which would be a part of the Asian Highway Network . 
 Historically , the rail transportation system drove developments in Chittagong and the surrounding areas , including Sitakunda . The rail tracks were established as part of the Bengal Assam Railway in 1898 , originally running from Chittagong to Badarpur , with branches to Silchar and <unk> . In September 1878 , Sitakunda was included in the East Bengal Circle of Railway Mail Service ( RMS ) along with rest of the district . By 1904 , the track system was extended to Chandpur to connect river boat traffic between <unk> and Kolkata . Approximately 37 kilometres ( 23 mi ) of railroads stop at six rail stations . Currently , there is no express train service between Sitakunda and Chittagong , though intercity expresses ( Sylhet – Chittagong , Chandpur – Chittagong , and Dhaka – Chittagong ) stop at Sitakunda station and carry a small share of the commuter traffic load . By 2003 , there were a total of 112 kilometres ( 70 mi ) of paved roads in the upazila , along with 256 kilometres ( 159 mi ) of mud roads , as well as five ferry @-@ <unk> or river docks for the use of barge @-@ type ferryboats . The traditional bullock carts are now rarely seen in the upazila . 
 Sitakunda was to be the landing station for a submarine communications cable , but the cable now comes ashore at Cox 's Bazaar . The cable has frequently been severed by miscreants , often in the Sitakunda area , since its installation on 21 May 2006 . Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication ( <unk> ) has brought internet services to the upazila by establishing Rural Knowledge Centres ( RKC ) . <unk> and <unk> run telephone services in the upazila . The telephone area code for Sitakunda is <unk> , which has to be added to Bangladesh area code + 880 when making overseas calls , and the subscriber numbers consist of four digits locally .

 Sitakunda is a major site for pilgrimage in Bangladesh , as it features 280 mosques ( including the Shah Mosque ) 8 <unk> ( including Baro <unk> Mazar , Kalu Shah Mazar , Fakir Hat Mazar , <unk> Shah Mazar ) , 49 Hindu temples ( including <unk> Mandir , Chandranath Mandir , <unk> Mandir ) , 3 ashrams ( including Sitakunda Shankar Math ) , and 3 Buddhist temples . The Hammadyar Mosque , located at the village of <unk> on the banks of a tank known as the Hammadyar <unk> , was built during the reign of Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah , the last Husain Shahi sultan of Bengal , as recorded by the inscription above the central entrance . The Sudarshan Vihara at village <unk> here , as well as the <unk> Vihara at village <unk> in Patiya were both established in 1922 by <unk> <unk> ( 1879 – 1971 ) , an eminent Bangladeshi Buddhist preacher . 
 According to legend , Shiva 's wife Sati immolated herself in the yajna @-@ fire of her father Daksha , as a protest against Shiva 's dishonor . The God became furious and started to dance the <unk> with Sati 's body on his shoulders . Knowing that the dance of destruction was about to annihilate the world , Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram , his celestial weapon , thereby appeasing Shiva . Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth , and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha . The legend goes that Sati 's right arm fell near a now @-@ extinct hot spring at the <unk> peak in Sitakunda . The site is marked by the temple of <unk> just below the Chandranath temple on top of the peak , and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh . 
 According to Rajmala , the temple of Chandranath received considerable endowments from the <unk> Kingdom in the time of king <unk> Manikya , who once attempted to remove the lingam from the temple to his kingdom . Poets from across the ages – from Jayadeva ( circa 1200 AD ) to <unk> Sen ( 1847 – 1909 ) – were said to be devoted to the temple . Chandranath is within the jurisdiction of <unk> Math , which was founded , according to legends , by <unk> , a disciple of Shankaracharya and founder of Vana and Aranya sects of the <unk> Sampradaya . An International Vedic Conference was held from 15 to 17 February 2007 at Sitakunda Shrine ( Tirtha ) Estate in Sitakunda Chandranath Dham , on the occasion of the great Shiva <unk> ( a Hindu festival in worship of Lord Shiva ) . These temples have been subject to repeated attack and violation by Muslims , and Bangladesh Hindu <unk> Christian <unk> Parishad has asked for the pilgrims to be protected .

 While returning to Kolkata after completing a floral survey , Joseph Dalton Hooker ( 1817 – 1911 ) carried out the first survey of Sitakunda 's local flora , as recorded in his Himalayan Journals , in January 1851 ( published by the Calcutta <unk> Survey Office and Minerva Library of Famous Books ; Ward , Lock , Bowden & Co . , 1891 ) . 
 The forests of the region are known to be evergreen type with a preponderance of deciduous species with a levelled distribution . The topmost level consists of <unk> ( Dipterocarpus <unk> ) , <unk> ( Hopea odorata ) , <unk> ( Artocarpus <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> or the Moluccan <unk> ( <unk> moluccana ) . The lower level consists of species of <unk> ( <unk> speciosa ) , Toon ( <unk> ciliata ) , Jam ( Syzygium <unk> ) , <unk> ( Elaeocarpus robustus ) and <unk> . Lianas , epiphytes ( mostly of orchids , <unk> , ferns and leafy mosses ) and herbaceous <unk> are abundant . Savannah formations are found in the open , along the banks of rivers and swamps with common tall grasses like <unk> ( Saccharum <unk> ) , Shon ( Imperata cylindrica and I. <unk> ) and Bena ( Vetiveria <unk> ) . Several species of Bamboo are cultivated that are common in Bangladesh including <unk> <unk> ( which is also common in Assam ) , B. vulgaris , B. <unk> , B. <unk> and B. nutans ; the latter two also being common in the hills of the region . 
 A number of fish species have become endangered in the area due to overfishing . They include <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( Acanthopagrus latus ) , <unk> ( <unk> argenteus ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( Scomberomorus <unk> ) , <unk> ( Labeo <unk> ) , Kata ( <unk> <unk> ) , Chewa ( <unk> <unk> ) , Sundari bele ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> ( Liza <unk> ) , Koral ( Etroplus <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , as well as crustaceans like tiger shrimps . 
 The first eco @-@ park in Bangladesh , Sitakunda Botanical Garden and Eco Park , was established in 2001 along with a botanical garden , under a five @-@ year ( 2000 – 2004 ) development project at a cost of Tk 35 @.@ 7 million on 808 hectares ( 1 @,@ 997 acres ) of the Chandranath Hills in Sitakunda .

 The educational institutions of the upazila include <unk> Cadet College ( founded in 1958 ) , 4 regular colleges ( including Sitakunda Degree College founded in 1968 ) , 24 high schools ( including <unk> Government Model High School founded in 1913 and Madam <unk> Hat <unk> High School founded in 1905 ) , 10 madrasas , and 76 junior and primary schools . All the secondary schools and regular colleges are under the Chittagong Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education split from the Comilla Board in May , 1995 . Dr. Muhammad Shahidullah ( 1885 – 1969 ) , an eminent Bangladeshi linguist , served as the headmaster of the Government High School from 1914 to 1915 . On 24 July 1996 , members of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Bangladesh Islami Chhatra <unk> ( ICS ) in Sitakunda Degree College fought with guns and bombs over a minor dispute . On 29 July 1996 , two ICS members of the college were abducted and killed . <unk> Cadet College and Bangladesh Military Academy are also situated in this upazila . As of 2001 , average literacy of Sitakunda Upazila for people of 7 years of age or more is 54 @.@ 6 % , while the average literacy of Sitakunda <unk> is 53 @.@ 9 % . There has been an overall growth of 32 @.@ 9 % between 1991 and 2001 , which for men was 20 @.@ 5 % and for women 59 @.@ 2 % . 70 @,@ 315 people of the Upazila between the ages of 5 and 24 years attend schools , an overall increase of 35 @.@ 6 % between 1991 and 2001 , which for men was 28 @.@ 1 % and for women 45 @.@ 4 % . The highest school attendance rate is observed in age group 10 – 14 years . 
 The health service centers in the upazila include a health complex , an infectious diseases hospital , a railway TB hospital , 11 family planning centres and a veterinary treatment centre . Bangladesh Railway set up the hospital at Kumira in 1952 with a capacity of 150 beds . The capacity was reduced to 50 beds in 1994 as some focus was redirected to the Railway Hospital at Central Railway Building in Chittagong . Originally built to treat railway employees , the hospital now also treats people from the wider community . Malaria , dengue and other fevers , hepatitis , as well as respiratory infections including tuberculosis are some of the major health threats . The percentage of disabled in Sitakunda is reported to be the highest in Bangladesh , at 17 % compared to the national average of 13 % . 
 <unk> Union has been declared as 100 % sanitized , as all households in the union adopted sanitary latrines , while the upazila has only 16 % sanitation coverage . A survey published in 2006 by the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project found that of the 18 @,@ 843 tube wells surveyed , 24 @.@ 7 % were found to be contaminated .

 = Forestry in the United Kingdom = 
 Forestry is the management of trees and forests for environmental or economic gain . The United Kingdom , being in the British Isles , is ideal for tree growth , thanks to its mild winters , plentiful rainfall , fertile soil and hill @-@ sheltered topography . Growth rates for broadleaved ( hardwood ) trees exceed those of mainland Europe , while conifer ( softwood ) growth rates are three times those of Sweden and five times those of Finland . In the absence of people , much of Great Britain would be covered with mature oaks , except for Scotland . Although conditions for forestry are good , trees do face damage threats arising from fungi , parasites and pests . 
 Nowadays , about 12 @.@ 9 % of Britain 's land surface is wooded and this area is increasing . The country 's supply of timber was severely depleted during the First and Second World Wars , when imports were difficult , and the forested area bottomed out at under 5 % of Britain 's land surface in 1919 . That year , the Forestry Commission was established to produce a strategic reserve of timber . However , the recovery is still very much in progress . Other European countries average from 25 % to 37 % of their area as woodland . 
 Of the 31 @,@ 380 square kilometres ( 12 @,@ 120 sq mi ) of forest in Britain , around 30 % is publicly owned and 70 % is in the private sector . More than 40 @,@ 000 people work on this land . <unk> account for 29 % of Britain 's woodlands , the rest being conifers , but considering only England , the figures are 55 % broadleaf and 45 % conifer . Britain 's native tree flora comprises 32 species , of which 29 are <unk> . Britain 's industry and populace uses at least 50 million tonnes of timber a year . More than 75 % of this is softwood , and Britain 's forests cannot supply the demand ; in fact , less than 10 % of the timber used in Britain is home @-@ grown . Paper and paper products make up more than half the wood consumed in Britain by volume . 
 In October 2010 , the new coalition government of the UK suggested it might sell off around half the Forestry Commission @-@ owned woodland in the UK . A wide variety of groups were vocal about their disapproval , and by February 2011 , the government abandoned the idea . Instead , it set up the Independent Panel on Forestry led by Rt Rev James Jones , then the Bishop of Liverpool . This body published its report in July 2012 . Among other suggestions , it recommended that the forested portion of England should rise to 15 % of the country 's land area by 2060 . 
 = = History = = 
 Throughout most of British history , the trend has been to create farmland at the expense of forest . Furthermore , variations in the Holocene climate have led to significant changes in the ranges of many species . This makes it complex to estimate the likely extent of natural forest cover . For example , in Scotland four main areas have been identified : oak dominated forest south of the Highland Line , Scots Pine in the Central Highlands , hazel / oak or pine / birch / oak assemblages in the north @-@ east and south @-@ west Highlands , and birch in the Outer Hebrides , Northern Isles and far north of the mainland . Furthermore , the effects of fire , human clearance and grazing probably limited forest cover to about 50 % of the land area of Scotland even at its maximum . The stock of woodland declined alarmingly during the First World War and " a Forestry Subcommittee was added to the Reconstruction Committee to advise on policy when the war was over . The Subcommittee , better known as the Acland Committee after its chairman Sir A. H. D. Acland , came to the conclusion that , in order to secure the double purpose of being able to be independent from foreign supplies for three years and a reasonable insurance against a timber famine , the woods of Great Britain should be gradually increased from three million acres to four and three quarter millions at the end of the war " . Following the Acland Report of 1918 the Forestry Commission was formed in 1919 to meet this need . State forest parks were established in 1935 . 
 Emergency felling controls had been introduced in the First and Second World Wars , and these were made permanent in the Forestry Act 1951 . Landowners were also given financial incentives to devote land to forests under the Dedication Scheme , which in 1981 became the Forestry Grant Scheme . By the early 1970s , the annual rate of planting exceeded 40 @,@ 000 hectares ( 99 @,@ 000 acres ) per annum . Most of this planting comprised fast @-@ growing conifers . Later in the century the balance shifted , with fewer than 20 @,@ 000 hectares ( 49 @,@ 000 acres ) per annum being planted during the 1990s , but broadleaf planting actually increased , exceeding 1 @,@ 000 hectares ( 2 @,@ 500 acres ) per year in 1987 . By the mid @-@ 1990s , more than half of new planting was broadleaf . 
 In 1988 , the Woodland Grant Scheme replaced the Forestry Grant Scheme , paying nearly twice as much for broadleaf woodland as conifers . ( In England , the Woodland Grant Scheme was subsequently replaced by the English Woodland Grant Scheme , which operates six separate kinds of grant for forestry projects . ) That year , the Farm Woodlands Scheme was also introduced , and replaced by the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme in 1992 . In the 1990s , a programme of afforestation resulted in the establishment of Community Forests and the National Forest , which celebrated the planting of its seven millionth tree in 2006 . As a result of these initiatives , the British Isles are one of a very few places in the world where the stock of forested land is actually increasing , though the rate of increase has slowed since the turn of the millennium . 
 England Rural Development Programme is the current overarching grants scheme that includes money for forested land within it . 
 = = Ancient woodland = = 
 Ancient woodland is defined as any woodland that has been continuously forested since 1600 . It is recorded on either the Register of Ancient Semi @-@ Natural Woodland or the Register of Planted Woodland Sites . There is no woodland in Britain that has not been profoundly affected by human intervention . Apart from certain native pinewoods in Scotland , it is predominantly broadleaf . Such woodland is less productive , in terms of timber yield , but ecologically rich , typically containing a number of " indicator species " of indigenous wildlife . It comprises roughly 2 @.@ 5 % of the forested area . 
 = = Native and historic tree species = = 
 Britain is relatively impoverished in terms of native species . For example , only thirty @-@ one species of deciduous tree and shrub are native to Scotland , including ten willows , four whitebeams and three birch and cherry . This is a list of tree species that existed in Britain before 1900 . The sheer number of tree species planted subsequently precludes a complete list . 
 = = Threats = = 
 Most serious disease threats to British woodland involve fungus . For conifers , the greatest threat is White Rot Fungus ( <unk> <unk> ) . Dutch Elm Disease arises from two related species of fungi in the genus Ophiostoma , spread by Elm Bark Beetles and acute oak decline has a bacterial cause . Another fungus , Nectria coccinea , causes Beech bark disease , as does Bulgaria polymorpha . Ash canker results from Nectria <unk> or Pseudomonas <unk> , and most trees are vulnerable to Honey Fungus ( Armillaria mellea ) . The oomycete Phytophthora <unk> ( responsible for " Sudden oak death " in the USA ) has killed large numbers of Japanese Larch trees in the UK . 
 Beetles , moths and weevils can also damage trees , but the majority do not cause serious harm . Notable exceptions include the Large Pine Weevil ( <unk> abietis ) , which can kill young conifers , the Spruce Bark Beetle ( <unk> <unk> ) which can kill spruces , and the Cockchafer ( Melolontha <unk> ) which eats young tree roots and can kill in a dry season . Rabbits , squirrels , voles , field mice , deer , and farm animals can pose a significant threat to trees . Air pollution , acid rain , and wildfire represent the main environmental hazards . 
 = = Timber industry = = 
 In 2013 , the UK produced 3 @,@ 582 @,@ 000 cubic metres of sawn wood , 3 @,@ 032 @,@ 000 cubic metres of wood @-@ based panels and 4 @,@ 561 @,@ 000 tonnes of paper and paperboard . The UK does not produce enough timber to satisfy domestic demand , and the country has been a net importer of timber and paper for many years . In 2008 the country imported sawn and other wood to a value of £ 1 @,@ 243 million and exported £ 98 million ; imported £ 832 million of wood @-@ based panels and exported £ 104 million ; and imported paper and paper @-@ based products to a value of £ 4 @,@ 273 million and exported £ 1 @,@ 590 million . In 2012 approximately 15 @,@ 000 people were employed in forestry and 26 @,@ 000 in primary wood production in the country , resulting in a gross value added to the country of £ 1 @,@ 936 million . With the ongoing closure of sawmills , the biomass industry is likely to be a key driver for future growth . 
 = = = Planting = = = 
 Successful forestry requires healthy , well @-@ formed trees that are resistant to diseases and parasites . The best wood has a straight , circular stem without a spiral grain or fluting , and small , evenly spaced branches . The chances of achieving these are maximised by planting good @-@ quality seed in the best possible growing environment . 
 Commercial seed is relatively inexpensive , but some foresters still prefer to collect their own seed . This should be done in dry weather , the seed kept in a well @-@ ventilated place away from damp ; broadleaved seeds do not keep well in long @-@ term storage ( apart from oak , sweet chestnut and sycamore , which can be kept ) . Conifer seed does tend to be storable . Stored seed is best pre @-@ treated by being chilled and moistened before planting . 
 Tree breeding programmes , to ensure the best seed , are hampered by the trees ' long life @-@ cycles . However , particularly since the 1950s , the Forestry Commission among other organisations has been running a programme of breeding , propagation , induced flowering and controlled pollination with the aim of producing healthy , disease @-@ resistant , fast @-@ growing stock . 
 = = = Stewardship and management = = = 
 The Forestry Commission manages almost 700 @,@ 000 hectares ( about 1 @.@ 7 million acres ) of land in England and Scotland , making it the country 's biggest land manager . The majority of the land ( 70 % ) is in Scotland , 30 % of the landholding is in England . Activities carried out on the forest estate include maintenance and improvement of the natural environment and the provision of recreation , timber harvesting to supply domestic industry , regenerating brownfield and replanting of harvested areas . 
 Afforestation was the main reason for the creation of the commission in 1919 . Britain had only 5 % of its original forest cover left and the government at that time wanted to create a strategic resource of timber . Since then forest coverage has doubled and the commission 's remit expanded to include greater focus on sustainable forest management and maximising public benefits . Woodland creation continues to be an important role of the commission , however , and works closely with government to achieve its goal of 12 % forest coverage by 2060 , championing initiatives such as The Big Tree Plant and Woodland Carbon Code . 
 The Forestry Commission is also the government body responsible for the regulation of private forestry ; felling is generally illegal without first obtaining a licence from the Commission . The Commission is also responsible for encouraging new private forest growth and development . Part of this role is carried out by providing grants in support of private forests and woodlands . 
 In contrast , Natural Resources Wales ( Welsh : <unk> Naturiol Cymru ) is a Welsh Government sponsored body , for the management of all the natural resources of Wales . It was formed from a merger of the Countryside Council for Wales , Environment Agency Wales , and the Forestry Commission Wales , and also assumes some other roles formerly taken by Welsh Government . 
 The Forest Stewardship Council , more specifically FSC UK , sets forest management standards for the UK , promotes the system and provides an information service . It looks at the environmental , social and economic impacts of the timber industry . It has issued 2 @,@ 340 Certificates of Conformity encompassing 1 @,@ 609 @,@ 414 ha of forest . 
 Plans featuring " good forestry practice " must always consider the needs of other stakeholders such as nearby communities or rural residents living within or adjacent to woodland areas . Foresters consider tree felling and environmental legislation when developing plans . Plans instruct the sustainable harvesting and replacement of trees . They indicate whether road building or other forest engineering operations are required . 
 = = = Transportation = = = 
 Currently , the vast majority of Britain 's timber uses road haulage . As forests are located in rural areas , the heavy timber vehicles have severely damaged many single lane tracks , especially in the Highlands . In order to combat this , companies are being forced to provide funding for repairs , as well as using alternative transport systems such as rail and coastal shipping . Despite the number of forest railways plummeting after the Beeching Axe , rail 's share of timber transport has risen from 3 % in 2002 with the opening of new lines in Devon , the Pennines , Scotland and South Wales by Colas Rail .

 " Speechless " was written by Lady Gaga and produced by Ron Fair . Gaga explained in a November 2009 interview that her father , Joseph Germanotta , had a heart condition for approximately 15 years . She went on to say , " He has or he had a bad aortic valve , and his body for a very long time was only pumping a third of the blood that you 're supposed to get every time his heart beat . " She added , 
 " My mom called me and I was very depressed . I was on tour and I couldn 't leave , so I went into the studio and I wrote this song ' Speechless , ' and it 's about these phone calls . My dad used to call me after he 'd had a few drinks and I wouldn 't know what to say . I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn 't be there . " 
 The song was written as a plea for Germanotta to have the open @-@ heart surgery he needed for his condition . In October 2009 , Gaga confirmed that Germanotta had undergone the surgery . " My Daddy had open @-@ heart surgery today . And after long hours , and lots of tears , they healed his broken heart , and mine , " she announced through her official Twitter account .

 Musically , " Speechless " is a rock power ballad with influences of 1970s rock , blues rock , glam rock with a slight element of country music as well . The song 's musical style has drawn comparisons to David Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust era , Queen and Pink . It consists of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs which , according to PopMatters , are comparable to the work of Freddie Mercury and Queen . " Speechless " was recorded at Record Plant Studios , Los Angeles , California with all live instruments , such as drums , guitars and bass with Gaga playing piano and she described the recording process as " that really organic , delicious feeling " . Along with the production works , Fair also did the arrangement and conduction for the recording , while Tal Herzberg played bass guitar and did the audio engineering of the track with Frank Wolff . Other musicians included Abraham Laboriel Jr. who played drums and John Goux on guitar . " Speechless " was mixed by Jack Joseph Puig while the audio mastering was done at Oasis Mastering , Burbank , California , by Gene Grimaldi . Personnel assisting the recording included Ryan Kennedy , Tal Oz and Joe Cory . " Speechless " is set in the time signature of common time , with a tempo of 76 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of C major , with Gaga 's vocal range spanning between the high note of C5 to the low note of G3 . The song has a basic sequence of C – G / B – Am – G – F as its chord progression .

 " Speechless " received mixed reviews from critics . Kitty Empire of The Observer gave a negative review of the song , noting that ballads are Gaga 's " weak point " . Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noted similarities between the song and the music of Queen , adding , " Although the resulting tune doesn 't have the same driving oomph of a peak @-@ era Queen number , the imitation is admirable if not just for the fact that it manages to rub shoulders with such sacred company without once feeling like a gimmick . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song the lone " dud " from The Fame Monster , " not because it 's a bad song or poorly performed , but because , like on The Fame , when [ Gaga ] does try to show her softer side , it comes off as a fraud — at least alongside the rest of her material . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the song had a " galvanized Eurotrash finish " to it , comparing the guitar playing in the song to the work of Noel Gallagher , the lead guitarist of Oasis .

Gaga was dressed in a flesh @-@ colored bodysuit wrapped with white piping , embedded with flashing lights imitating ribs and a spine . The performance started with " Bad Romance " ; then she segued into " Speechless " by using her microphone stand to break open a glass box with a piano inside . She sat on the piano bench and began the performance , while her piano caught on fire . Throughout the song , she continued to smash liquor bottles on the piano . Both " Bad Romance " and " Speechless " were performed at The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 25 , 2009 . Gaga performed the song at the Royal Variety Performance , which was attended by Queen Elizabeth II . Gaga wore a red PVC dress inspired by the Elizabethan era , and played a piano suspended ten feet in the air that was supported by stilts . The piano was inspired by the giant elephants in Salvador Dalí 's 1946 painting , The Temptation of St. Anthony . 
 Gaga performed the song during The Monster Ball Tour . On the tour 's first show in Montreal , Quebec , Canada , her father was in attendance , and the song came after a cabaret performance of " Poker Face " with a freestyle rap from Kid Cudi . She wore a dress with black shoulder pads and a black mask . T 'Cha Dunlevy for The Gazette noted that the performance was lacking — " The elements are there but they haven 't all been brought together " — adding that the show never reached its peak until the end , when Gaga performed the " real rendition " of " Poker Face " and " Bad Romance " . " Better late than never , " Dunlevy concluded . However Jane Stevenson from Toronto Star called the performance as the emotional high point of the show . On December 8 , 2009 , Gaga performed the song live at the launch party of Vevo in New York . The musical accompaniment consisted only of Gaga on piano . Gaga opened the 52nd Grammy Awards telecast with a performance of " Poker Face " , immediately followed by a piano duet with Elton John of " Speechless " in a medley with " Your Song " . In May 2011 , Gaga performed a jazz version of the song during Radio 1 's Big Weekend in Carlisle , Cumbria .

 Response towards Weaves from music journalists upon release was generally favorable . Critics from publications like Exclaim ! and Noisey praises included the record 's combination of numerous musical styles to the point where the overall genre the EP could be labeled its own category or could be very hard to pin @-@ point . Noisey said that the EP " experiments and dips across genre lines in a balancing act between of laxity and concentration , without all of the pretension and exclusivity that normally accompanies a buzzing indie band " . A more mixed review came from Liz Fox of Popmatters , finding most of the aspects of Weaves typical of indie music released in the previous fifteen years but praising Burke 's " sultry " vocal performance that " improve the elaborate backdrop , allowing for some simplicity among the chaos " . Now called the EP an " excellent introduction for new fans " , writing that its only downfall was the track " Do You See Past " due to its " more sophisticated , less interesting electro @-@ pop sound " . In a list by another Popmatters journalist of the best indie rock albums of 2014 , Weaves ranked number eight .

 = New York State Route 216 = 
 New York State Route 216 ( NY 216 ) is a short state highway located entirely in Dutchess County , New York , in the United States . At 6 @.@ 22 miles ( 10 @.@ 01 km ) in length , it connects NY 52 and NY 55 between the hamlets of Stormville ( within the town of East Fishkill ) at the east end and Poughquag ( within the town of Beekman ) at the west . The route serves the hamlet of Green Haven and passes by the Green Haven Correctional Facility . 
 Route 216 was originally part of NY 39 in the 1920s . The portion of NY 39 from Stormville to West Patterson was redesignated as part of NY 52 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . At the same time , an alternate route of NY 52 between Stormville and Towners was assigned the NY 216 designation . The alignments of NY 52 and NY 216 between the two locations were largely swapped c . 1937 . In 1970 , Route 216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 216 's western terminus is at an intersection with NY 52 just south of the Trump National Golf Club in Stormville , a hamlet within the town of East Fishkill . It heads northeast into the center of Stormville and intersects with Old Route 52 , a former alignment of NY 52 . The route makes a sharp turn to the north before intersecting with Phillips Road and turning eastward . Proceeding east , NY 216 intersects Green Haven Road ( County Route 8 or CR 8 ) in the hamlet of Green Haven . South of this intersection is the Green Haven Correctional Facility . After intersecting with several local roads , it turns north and intersects Main Street ( CR 7 ) in the Beekman hamlet of Poughquag . South of the Beekman Cemetery , NY 216 terminates at NY 55 .

 In the mid @-@ 1920s , NY 39 was assigned to an alignment extending from Poughkeepsie to Patterson via East Fishkill , Stormville and Poughquag . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the portion of NY 39 between East Fishkill and the western fringe of Patterson was redesignated as part of the new NY 52 while the segment between Patterson and NY 22 was renumbered to NY 311 . At the same time , NY 216 was assigned to a highway extending from NY 52 in Stormville southeast to NY 52 near Towners . NY 216 followed modern NY 52 north of Ludingtonville and Ludingtonville Road south of the hamlet . 
 NY 52 and NY 216 largely swapped alignments c . 1937 as part of a larger realignment of NY 52 through Dutchess and Putnam counties . Route 52 was relocated onto NY 216 between Stormville and Ludingtonville , from where it followed a new roadway south to Lake Carmel . The former alignment of NY 52 between Stormville and Towners became NY 216 , which was also extended eastward along NY 164 to a new eastern terminus at NY 22 east of Towners . The alignment of NY 216 remained unaltered until January 1 , 1970 , when Route 216 was truncated to its current eastern terminus in Poughquag . As part of the truncation , NY 216 's former alignment from West Pawling to Patterson was renumbered to NY 292 while the east – west roadway through Towners became NY 164 .

 = Spotted eagle ray = 
 The spotted eagle ray ( Aetobatus narinari ) is a cartilaginous fish of the eagle ray family , Myliobatidae . It can be found globally in tropical regions , including the Gulf of Mexico , Hawaii , off the coast of West Africa , the Indian Ocean , Oceania , and on both coasts of the Americas at depths down to about 80 meters ( 262 ft ) . The rays are most commonly seen alone , but occasionally swim in groups . Rays are ovoviviparous , the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent . 
 This ray can be identified by its dark dorsal surface covered in white spots or rings . Near the base of the ray 's relatively long tail , just behind the pelvic fins , are several venomous , barbed stingers . Spotted eagle rays commonly feed on small fish and crustaceans , and will sometimes dig with their snouts to look for food buried in the sand of the sea bed . These rays are commonly observed leaping out of the water , and on at least two occasions have been reported as having jumped into boats , in one incident resulting in the death of a woman in the Florida Keys . The spotted eagle ray is hunted by a wide variety of sharks . The rays are considered near threatened on the IUCN Red List . They are fished mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa , the most common market being in commercial trade and aquariums . They are protected in the Great Barrier Reef . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The spotted eagle ray was first described by Swedish botanist Bengt Anders <unk> as Raja narinari in 1790 from a specimen collected at an unknown location ( possibly the coast of Brazil ) during a trip he made to the Antilles , and was later classified as <unk> narinari . Its current genus name is Aetobatus , derived from the Greek words aetos ( eagle ) and <unk> ( ray ) . The spotted eagle ray belongs to the Myliobatidae family , which includes the well known manta ray . Most rays in the Myliobatidae swim in the open ocean rather than close to the sea floor . 
 The spotted eagle ray has many different common names , including white @-@ spotted eagle ray , bonnet skate , bonnet ray , duckbill ray and spotted duck @-@ billed ray . 
 = = Description and behavior = = 
 Spotted eagle rays have flat disk @-@ shaped bodies , deep blue or black with white spots on top with a white underbelly , and distinctive flat snouts similar to a duck 's bill . Their tails are longer than those of other rays and may have 2 – 6 venomous spines , just behind the pelvic fins . The front half of the long and wing @-@ like pectoral disk has five small gills in its underside . 
 Mature spotted eagle rays can be up to 5 meters ( 16 ft ) in length ; the largest have a wingspan of up to 3 meters ( 10 ft ) and a mass of 230 kilograms ( 507 lb ) . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 One male , or sometimes several , will pursue a female . When one of the males approaches the female , he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum . The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins , which are located on either side of her body . Once he is on her ventral side , the male puts a clasper into the female , connecting them venter to venter , with both undersides together . The mating process lasts for 30 – 90 seconds . 
 The spotted eagle ray develops <unk> ; the eggs are retained in the female and hatch internally , feeding off a yolk sac until live birth . After a gestation period of one year the mother ray will give birth to a maximum of four pups . When the pups are first born , their discs measure from 170 – 350 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 7 – 13 @.@ 8 in ) across . The rays mature in 4 to 6 years . 
 = = = Feeding and diet = = = 
 Spotted eagle ray preys mainly upon bivalves , crabs , whelks , benthic infauna they also feed on mollusks , crustaceans , particularly <unk> and also upon hermit crabs , shrimp , octopi , and some small fish . 
 The spotted eagle ray 's specialized chevron @-@ shaped tooth structure helps it to crush the mollusks ' hard shells . The jaws of these rays have developed calcified struts to help them break through the shells of mollusks , by supporting the jaws and preventing dents from hard prey . These rays have the unique behavior of digging with their snouts in the sand of the ocean . While doing this , a cloud of sand surrounds the ray and sand spews from its gills . One study has shown that there are no differences in the feeding habits of males and females or in rays from different regions of Australia and Taiwan . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Spotted eagle rays prefer to swim in waters of 24 to 27 ° C ( 75 to 81 ° F ) . Their daily movement is influenced by the tides ; one tracking study showed that they are more active during high tides . Uniquely among rays they dig with their snouts in the sand , surrounding themselves in a cloud of sand that spews from their gills . They also exhibit two motions in which the abdomen and the pectoral fins are moved rapidly up and down : the pelvic thrust and the extreme pelvic thrust . The pelvic thrust is usually performed by a solitary ray , and repeated four to five times rapidly . The extreme pelvic thrust is most commonly observed when the ray is swimming in a group , from which it will separate itself before vigorously thrusting with its pectoral fins . The rays also performs dips and jumps ; in a dip the ray will dive and then come back up rapidly , perhaps as many as five times consecutively . There are two main types of jump : in one , the ray propels itself vertically out of the water , to which it returns along the same line ; the other is when the ray leaps at a 45 degree angle , often repeated multiple times at high speeds . When in shallow waters or outside their normal swimming areas the rays are most commonly seen alone , but they do also congregate in schools . One form of traveling is called loose aggregation , which is when three to sixteen rays are swimming in a loose group , with occasional interactions between them . A school commonly consists of six or more rays swimming in the same direction at exactly the same speed . 
 = = Human interaction = = 
 The dorsal spots make the spotted eagle ray an aquarium attraction , although because of its large size it is likely kept only at public aquariums . There are no target fisheries for the spotted eagle ray , but it is often eaten after being caught unintentionally as bycatch . There have been several reported incidents of spotted eagle rays leaping out of the water onto boats and landing on people . Nevertheless , spotted eagle rays do not pose a significant threat to humans , as they are shy and generally avoid human contact . Interactions with an individual <unk> in the Caribbean has been reported especially in Jamaica involving one , two and even three spotted eagle rays . The rays may exhibit a behavior similar to human curiosity which allows the <unk> to observe the eagle ray who may slow down so as to share more time with the much slower human observer if the human observer appears to be unthreatening or interesting to the spotted eagle ray . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Spotted eagle rays , in common with many other rays , often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark , the lemon shark , the bull shark , the silver tip shark , and the great hammerhead shark . A great hammerhead shark has been observed attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite out of one of its pectoral fins , thus incapacitating the ray . The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws , head first . Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season , and feed on the newborn pups . 
 As other rays , spotted eagle rays are host to a variety of parasites . Internal parasites include the <unk> nematode Echinocephalus sinensis in the spiral intestine . External parasites include the <unk> monogeneans Decacotyle <unk> , Decacotyle <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the gills .

 Spotted eagle rays are found globally in tropical regions from the Indo @-@ Pacific region from the western Pacific Ocean , the Indian Ocean , and the western Atlantic Ocean . 
 They are found in shallow coastal water by coral reefs and bays , in depths down to 80 meters ( 262 ft ) . Spotted eagle rays are found in warm and temperate waters worldwide . In the western Atlantic Ocean it is found off the eastern coast of United States of America , the Gulf Stream , the Caribbean , and down past the southern part of Brazil . In the Indian Ocean , it is found from the Red Sea down to South Africa and eastward to the Andaman Sea . In the western Pacific Ocean , it can be found from the Red Sea to South Africa and also in northern Japan and Australia . In the Eastern @-@ Pacific Ocean , it is found in the Gulf of California down through Puerto Pizarro , an area that includes the Galapagos Islands . Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen in bays and reefs . They spend much of their time swimming freely in open waters , generally in schools close to the surface , and can travel long distances in a day . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The spotted eagle ray is included in the IUCN 's Red List as " near threatened " . The rays are caught mainly in Southeast Asia and Africa . They are also common in commercial marine life trade and are displayed in aquariums . Among the many efforts to help protect this species , South Africa 's decision to deploy fewer protective shark nets has reduced the number of deaths caused by entanglement . South Africa has also placed restrictions on the number of rays that can be bought per person per day . In the state of Florida in the United States , the fishing , landing , purchasing and trading of spotted eagle ray is outlawed . The spotted eagle ray is also protected in the Great Barrier Reef on the eastern coast of Australia .

 " Holiday " is a song by American singer Madonna from her eponymous debut studio album Madonna ( 1983 ) . Sire Records released it as the album 's third single on September 7 , 1983 . " Holiday " later appeared remixed on the remix compilation You Can Dance ( 1987 ) and the greatest hits compilation The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) , and in its original form on the greatest hits album Celebration ( 2009 ) . Written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of Pure Energy , the track was offered to Madonna by her producer John " Jellybean " Benitez when she was looking for a potential hit track to include in her debut album . After accepting the song , she and Jellybean worked on it and altered its composition by the addition of a piano solo performed by their friend , Fred Zarr . 
 " Holiday " features instrumentation from guitars , electronic handclaps , a cowbell , and a synthesized string arrangement , while its lyrics speak about the universal sentiment of taking a holiday . Universally acclaimed by critics , the song became Madonna 's first mainstream hit single in the United States , reaching the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 . It also became her first top @-@ ten single in several countries , including Australia , Belgium , Germany , Ireland , the Netherlands and the United Kingdom .

 In 1983 , Madonna was recording her eponymous debut album with Warner Bros. Records producer Reggie Lucas , after Sire Records green @-@ lit it when her first single " Everybody " became a club hit . However , she did not have enough material for the album . Lucas brought two new songs to the project and John " Jellybean " Benitez , a DJ at Funhouse disco was called to remix the available tracks . In the meantime , due to conflict of interest , Madonna 's collaborator on " Everybody " , Steve Bray had sold another song " Ain 't No Big Deal " to an act on another label , rendering it unavailable for Madonna 's project . It was Benitez who discovered a new song written by Curtis Hudson and Lisa Stevens of the pop group Pure Energy . The song , titled " Holiday " , had been turned down by Phyllis Hyman and Mary Wilson , formerly of The Supremes . Jellybean and Madonna sent the demo to their friend , Fred Zarr so he could embellish the arrangement and program the song with his synthesizer magic . After the vocals were added by Madonna , Benitez spent four days and tried to enhance the commercial appeal of the track before the April 1983 deadline . Just before it was completed , Madonna and Benitez met Fred Zarr at Sigma Sound in Manhattan where Zarr added the now familiar piano solo towards the end of the track . 
 Initially it was decided that " Lucky Star " would be released as a single ; instead " Holiday " was released in the U.S. when the latter became a dance hit . The original British cover art for " Holiday " did not carry Madonna 's picture since Sire did not want the British people to find out that she was not a R & B artist . Instead it carried the picture of a train station and an engine . " Holiday " was later remixed in dub and groove versions for the 1987 remix album You Can Dance It also appeared in her first greatest hits compilation , The Immaculate Collection , in a remixed and shortened form . During a 2005 interview with CBS News , Madonna said that " Holiday " was her favourite among all her songs . 
 In the United Kingdom , " Holiday " has been released three times as a single ; in January 1984 , reaching number six , re @-@ issued in August 1985 reaching number 2 ( only being kept from number one by her own " Into the Groove " single ) . It was re @-@ released with new artwork in 1991 to promote The Immaculate Collection with a limited edition EP titled The Holiday Collection , which contained tracks omitted from the compilation ; this version reached number five . Although the song was released to promote the greatest hits collection , it did not include the shorter remix from the album , instead it included the original album version from Madonna ( 1983 ) . The photography used for the 1991 release was by Steven Meisel and had previously been used for the February 1991 cover for Vogue Italia .

It was performed as the second song of the tour . The same year she performed the song at the Live Aid benefit concert in Philadelphia in July . 
 The Who 's That Girl World Tour in 1987 had Madonna performing " Holiday " as the last song of the tour . Madonna performed an energetic version of the song , signalling the celebratory and wholesome nature of the song 's theme . She sang the final chorus twice , and on some dates asked the audience for a comb so that she could fix her hair and finished the performance . Two different performances are found in Ciao Italia : Live from Italy tour video filmed at Stadio Communale in Turin , Italy on September 4 , 1987 and the Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan tour video filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo , Japan on June 22 , 1987 .

The performance met with strong reaction in Puerto Rico , when Madonna rubbed the Puerto Rican national flag between her legs in between the performance . For the Drowned World Tour in 2001 Madonna wore a fur coat , velvet fedora and a customised Dolce & Gabbana T @-@ shirt which proclaimed ' Mother ' in the front and ' F * cker ' in the back painted in silver . This demonstrated her ghetto @-@ girl appearance adopted for the song 's performance . 
 In the Re @-@ Invention Tour in 2004 , the song was again performed as the ending song of the tour . The song was given a tribal feeling with Madonna wearing Scottish kilts during the performance .

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that the performance " feels like they could fit the Eurotrash , campy retro @-@ disco feel of Confessions . " 
 The song was added to the 2009 leg of her Sticky & Sweet Tour . It replaced the song " Heartbeat " from Hard Candy and was used as a tribute to singer Michael Jackson who died a week prior to the start of the second leg of the tour . As Madonna sang the song , a picture of a young Jackson appeared on stage , followed by a Jackson impersonator wearing garments in Jackson style . The music then switched to a medley of his songs , like " Billie Jean " and " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , and the impersonator worked through his moves , including the moonwalk as well as the spinning and gyrating . Madonna clapped her hands , swayed from side to side and jumped up and down while images of Jackson over the years flashed on a big screen . After the performance , Madonna told the crowd , " Let 's give it up for one of the greatest artists the world has ever known , " and the crowd applauded . 
 The song was the closing number to Madonna 's Rebel Heart Tour in 2015 .

The story is told by a character identified as the " Central Scrutinizer " narrating the story of Joe , an average adolescent male , who forms a garage rock band , has unsatisfying relationships with women , gives all of his money to a government assisted and insincere religion , explores sexual activities with appliances , and is imprisoned . After being released from prison into a dystopian society in which music itself has been criminalized , he lapses into insanity . 
 The album encompasses a large spectrum of musical styles , while its lyrics often feature satirical or humorous commentary on American society and politics . It addresses themes of individualism , free will , censorship , the music industry and human sexuality , while criticizing government and religion , and satirizing Catholicism and Scientology . Joe 's Garage is noted for its use of xenochrony , a recording technique that takes guitar solos from older live recordings and overdubs them onto new studio recordings . All of the guitar solos on the album are <unk> except for " Crew Slut " and " Watermelon in Easter Hay " , a signature song that Zappa has described as the best song on the album , and according to his son Dweezil , the best guitar solo his father ever played . 
 The album initially received mixed to positive reviews , with critics praising its innovative and original music , but criticizing the scatological , sexual and profane nature of the lyrics . Since its original release , Joe 's Garage has been reappraised as one of Zappa 's best works . This is Official Release # 28 and # 29 .

 After being released from his contractual obligations with Warner Bros. Records , Frank Zappa formed Zappa Records , a label distributed at that time by Phonogram Inc .. He released the successful double album Sheik Yerbouti ( 1979 , recorded 8 / 1977 @-@ 2 / 1978 ) , and began working on a series of songs for a follow @-@ up album . The songs " Joe 's Garage " and " Catholic Girls " were recorded with the intention that Zappa would release them as a single . Throughout the development of Joe 's Garage , Zappa 's band recorded lengthy jams which Zappa later formed into the album . The album also continued the development of xenochrony , a technique Zappa also featured on One Size Fits All ( 1975 ) , in which aspects of older live recordings were utilized to create new compositions by overdubbing them onto studio recordings , or alternatively , selecting a previously recorded solo and allowing drummer Vinnie Colaiuta to improvise a new drum performance , interacting with the previously recorded piece . 
 Midway through recording the new album , Zappa decided that the songs connected coherently and wrote a story , changing the new album into a rock opera . Joe 's Garage was the final album Zappa recorded at a commercial studio . Zappa 's own studio , the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen , built as an addition to Zappa 's home , and completed in late 1979 , was used to record and mix all of his subsequent releases .

 The lyrical themes of Joe 's Garage involve individualism , sexuality , the danger of large government , and " the foolishness of white males " , according to Kelly Fisher Lowe in The Words and Music of Frank Zappa . The album is narrated by a government employee identifying himself as The Central Scrutinizer , who delivers a cautionary tale about Joe , a typical adolescent male who forms a band as the government prepares to criminalize music . The Central Scrutinizer explains that music leads to a " slippery slope " of drug use , disease , unusual sexual practices , prison , and eventually , insanity . According to Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz , Zappa 's narrative of censorship reflected the censorship of music during the Iranian Revolution of 1979 , where rock music was made illegal . 
 The title track is noted as having an autobiographical aspect , as the character of Larry ( as performed by Zappa himself ) sings that the band plays the same song repeatedly because " it sounded good to me " . In real life , Zappa said he wrote and played music for himself , his sole intended audience . The song also takes lyrical inspiration from bands playing in bars like The Mothers of Invention once had , and shady record deals Zappa had experienced in the past . In " Joe 's Garage " , Joe finds that the music industry is " not everything it is cracked up to be " . The song refers to a number of music fads , including new wave , heavy metal , disco and glitter rock , and is critical of the music industry of the late 1970s . 
 " Catholic Girls " is critical of the Catholic Church , and satirizes " the hypocrisy of the myth of the good Catholic girl . " While Zappa was in favor of the sexual revolution , he regarded himself as a pioneer in publicly discussing honesty about sexual intercourse , stating 
 " American sexual attitudes are controlled as a necessary tool of business and government in order to perpetuate themselves . Unless people begin to see through that , to see past it to , what sex is really all about , they 're always going to have the same neurotic attitudes . It 's very neatly packaged . It all works hand @-@ in @-@ hand with the churches and political leaders at the point , where elections are coming up . " 
 This view inspired the lyrical content of " Crew Slut " , in which Mary , Joe 's girlfriend , falls into the groupie lifestyle , going on to participate in a wet T @-@ shirt contest in the following track , " Wet T @-@ Shirt Nite . " 
 " Why Does It Hurt When I Pee ? " was written in the summer of 1978 . Zappa 's road manager , Phil Kaufman , alleged , that the song was written after Kaufman had asked that very question ; within the context of the album 's storyline , it is sung by Joe after he receives a sexually transmitted disease from Lucille , " a girl , who works at the Jack in the Box " . The Central Scrutinizer continues to express the hypothesis that " girls , music , disease , heartbreak [ ... ] all go together . " Halfway through the album 's libretto , Zappa expressed the belief , that governments believe , that people are inherently criminals , and continue to invent laws , which gives states the legal grounds to arrest people , leading to the fictional criminalization of music , which occurs towards the end of the album 's storyline . 
 " A Token of My Extreme " satirizes Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard , as well as new age beliefs and the sexual revolution . It describes an insincere religion , which co @-@ operates with a " malevolent totalitarian regime . " " Stick It Out " contains lyrical references to Zappa 's songs " What Kind Of Girl " , " Bwana Dik " , " Sofa No. 2 " , and " Dancin ' Fool " . " Dong Work For <unk> " was written as a tribute to Zappa 's bodyguard , John Smothers , and features Terry Bozzio imitating Smothers ' dialect and speech . " Keep It Greasy " is a lyrical tribute to anal sex . Following Joe 's imprisonment and release , the libretto describes a dystopian future , accompanied musically by long guitar solos , which Joe imagines in his head . The penultimate song , " Packard Goose " , criticizes rock journalism , and features a philosophical monologue delivered by the character Mary , who had been absent since the first act . In the epilogue song " A Little Green Rosetta , " Joe gives up music , returns to sanity , hocks his imaginary guitar and gets " a good job " at the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen Facility ( a self @-@ reference to Zappa 's own personal studio ) , and the Central Scrutinizer turns off the plastic megaphone that he has been whispering into , sings the last song on the album in his regular voice , and joins in a long musical number with most of the other people that worked with Zappa around 1979 . The lyrics also lampoon Steve Gadd 's status as one of the highest @-@ paid session drummers in popular music . 
 = = = Music and performance = = = 
 The music of Joe 's Garage encompassed a variety of styles , including blues , jazz , doo wop , lounge , orchestral , rock , pop and reggae . " Catholic Girls " makes musical reference to Zappa 's controversial song " Jewish Princess " , as a sitar plays the melody of the earlier song during the fadeout of " Catholic Girls " . " Crew Slut " is performed as a slow blues song , with slide guitar riffs and a harmonica solo . According to Kelly Fisher Lowe , the song is " more Rolling Stones or Aerosmith than it is Gatemouth Brown or Guitar Watson " . The extended three and a half minute , two @-@ part guitar solo in " Toad @-@ O @-@ Line " is taken from Zappa 's earlier song , " Inca Roads . " 
 " A Token Of My Extreme " originated as an instrumental song played during improvised conversations by saxophonist Napoleon Murphy Brock and George Duke on keyboards . It typically opened Zappa 's concerts in 1974 ; a recording of this version of the piece was released under the title " Tush Tush Tush ( A Token of My Extreme ) " on You Can 't Do That on Stage Anymore , Vol . 2 . 
 " Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up " first appeared on Jeff Simmons ' album of the same name , on which its writing is credited to " La Marr <unk> " , one of Zappa 's pseudonyms . The Joe 's Garage arrangement is radically different , and is played in a reggae style . " Stick It Out " originated as part of the Mothers of Invention 's " Sofa " routine in the early 1970s . The Joe 's Garage version is musically influenced by funk and disco , with its lyrics performed first in German , and then in English . " Sy Borg " derives from funk , reggae and R & B. 
 " Keep It Greasy " had been performed by Zappa since 1975 ; the Joe 's Garage album version features a guitar solo from a March 1979 live performance of the song " City of Tiny Lights " . Another March 1979 guitar solo from " City of Tiny Lights " is incorporated into the song " Outside Now " using the same recording technique . " Packard Goose " also uses xenochrony , with its guitar solo taken from a March 1979 performance of " Easy Meat " . 
 The album concludes with a long guitar instrumental , " Watermelon in Easter Hay " , the only guitar solo recorded for the album , in 9 / 4 time ; every other guitar solo on the album was <unk> — overdubbed from older live recordings . In their review of the album , Down Beat magazine criticized the song , but subsequent reviewers have championed the song as Zappa 's masterpiece . Lowe called it the " crowning achievement of the album " and " one of the most gorgeous pieces of music ever produced " . Zappa told Neil Slaven that he thought it was " the best song on the album " . The songs ' title is thought to have come from a saying used by Zappa while recording the album : " Playing a guitar solo with this band is like trying to grow watermelon in Easter hay " . After Zappa died , " Watermelon in Easter Hay " became known as one of his signature songs , and his son , Dweezil Zappa , later referred to it as " the best solo Zappa ever played " . 
 The song is followed by " A Little Green Rosetta " , a song that was originally intended to appear on Zappa 's shelved Läther album , but rerecorded with different lyrics for Joe 's Garage .

 Joe 's Garage was initially released in separate units , beginning with the single LP Act I in September 1979 . For the album artwork , Zappa was photographed in blackface , holding a mop . The gatefold sleeve of Act I was designed by John Williams , and featured a collage , which included a naked Maya , vague technical drawings , pyramids and fingers on the fret of a guitar . The lyric insert featured similar illustrations , which related to the content of the songs and storyline . The title track was released as a single , with " The Central Scrutinizer " as its B @-@ side . It did not chart . 
 Act I peaked at # 27 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart . It was followed by the double album Acts II & III in November . The gatefold of Acts II & III featured collages taken from a medical journal , while the cover for Acts II & III featured a makeup artist applying blackface makeup to Zappa 's face . Acts II & III peaked at # 53 on the Pop Albums chart . 
 Joe 's Garage was reissued in 1987 as a triple album , combining Acts I , II & III into a single box set , and as a double album on compact disc . The song " Wet T @-@ Shirt Nite " received two alternate titles , when the album was released on CD : the libretto referred to the song as " The Wet T @-@ Shirt Contest " , while the back cover referred to the song as " Fembot in a Wet T @-@ Shirt " . In an interview , Zappa explained that the " fembot " was the name given to a female robot in an episode of the TV series The Six Million Dollar Man . The instrumental " Toad @-@ O Line " was renamed " On the Bus " . The Central Scrutinizer monologue at the end of " Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up " , which concludes the story 's first act , was indexed as its own track on the CD reissue , under the title " Scrutinizer <unk> " .

 Joe 's Garage received mixed to positive reviews upon release , with criticisms aimed at its profane lyrical content , but has since been reappraised as a landmark album . AllMusic writer William Ruhlmann gave 3 out of 5 stars for the individual releases Act I and Acts II & III . Ruhlmann wrote of Act I , " although his concern with government censorship would see a later flowering in his battles with the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) , here he wasn 't able to use it to fulfill a satisfying dramatic function . " Ruhlmann also felt that Acts II & III " seems so thin and thrown together , musically and dramatically " . 
 Don Shewey of Rolling Stone magazine wrote , " If the surface of this opera is cluttered with cheap gags and musical mishmash , its soul is located in profound existential sorrow . The guitar solos that Zappa plays in Joe 's imagination burn with a desolate , devastating beauty . Flaws and all , Joe 's Garage is Frank Zappa 's Apocalypse Now . " The collected Acts I , II & III release received 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars from Allmusic 's Steve Huey , who wrote " in spite of its flaws , Joe 's Garage has enough substance to make it one of Zappa 's most important ' 70s works and overall political statements , even if it 's not focused enough to rank with his earliest Mothers of Invention masterpieces . " 
 For his performance on Joe 's Garage , Vinnie Colaiuta was named " the most technically advanced drummer ever " by Modern Drummer , which ranked the album as one of the top 25 greatest drumming performances of all time . On September 26 , 2008 , Joe 's Garage was staged by the Open Fist Theatre Company in Los Angeles , in a production authorized by the Zappa Family Trust .

 Joe 's Garage Act I 
 Joe 's Garage Acts II & III 
 = Dr. No ( novel ) = 
 Dr. No is the sixth novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his British Secret Service agent James Bond . Fleming wrote the novel in early 1957 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica . It was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 31 March 1958 . The novel centres on Bond 's investigation into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives . He establishes that they had been investigating Doctor No , a Chinese operator of a guano mine on the fictional Caribbean island of Crab Key . Bond travels to the island and meets Honeychile Rider and later Doctor No . 
 The novel began as a 1956 screenplay for the producer Henry Morgenthau III for a proposed television show entitled Commander Jamaica . When those plans foundered , Fleming adapted the ideas as the basis for a novel , provisionally titled The Wound Man . The book 's eponymous villain was influenced by Sax Rohmer 's Fu Manchu stories . 
 Dr. No was the first of Fleming 's novels to face widespread negative criticism in Britain ; Paul Johnson of The New Statesman dismissed the book as one of " Sex , Snobbery and Sadism " . When released on the American market it was received more favourably . Dr. No was serialised in The Daily Express , first in an abridged story form and later as a comic strip . The story was adapted in 1962 as the first film in the Bond series , with Sean Connery in the lead role ; in 2008 BBC Radio 4 broadcast a version , with Toby Stephens as Bond . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After recovering from tetrodotoxin poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb ( in From Russia , with Love ) the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior , M , on a rest cure to the British colony of Jamaica . While there he is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways , the head of MI6 's Station J in Kingston , and his secretary . Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No , a reclusive Chinese @-@ German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano mine . The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there . The spoonbills are protected by the American National Audubon Society , two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No 's airstrip . 
 On his arrival in Jamaica , Bond soon realises that he is being watched , as his hotel room is searched , a basket of poisoned fruit is delivered to the room ( supposedly a gift from the colonial governor ) and a deadly centipede is placed in his bed while he is sleeping . With the help of an old friend , Quarrel , Bond surreptitiously visits Crab Key to establish whether there is a connection between No and the disappearance of the MI6 personnel . Bond and Quarrel meet Honeychile Rider , who is there to collect valuable shells . Bond and Rider are captured by No 's men after Quarrel is burned to death by the doctor 's " dragon " — a flamethrowing armoured swamp buggy designed to keep away trespassers . 
 Bond discovers that No is working with the Russians and has built an elaborate underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral . No had previously been a member of a Chinese tong , but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury , he was captured by the organisation . The tong 's leaders had No 's hands cut off as a warning to others , and then shot . Because No 's heart was on the right side of his body ( dextrocardia ) , the bullet missed his heart and he survived . Interested in the ability of the human body to withstand and survive pain , No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility 's ventilation system . Bond is kept under observation as he suffers electric shocks , burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders . The ordeal ends in a fight with a captive giant squid , which he defeats by using improvised weapons . After his escape he encounters Rider , who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs ; they had ignored her and she managed to escape . 
 Bond kills No by taking over the guano @-@ loading machine at the docks and diverting the flow of guano to bury him alive . Bond and Rider then escape from No 's complex in the " dragon " buggy .

 In June 1956 the author Ian Fleming began a collaboration with the producer Henry Morgenthau III on a planned television series , Commander Jamaica , which was to feature the Caribbean @-@ based character James Gunn . When the project foundered , and Fleming could not fashion a new plot for his next Bond novel , he used the idea as the basis for Dr. No . By January 1957 he had published four Bond novels in successive years from 1953 — Casino Royale , Live and Let Die , Moonraker and Diamonds Are Forever . A fifth , From Russia , with Love , was being edited and prepared for production . That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write Dr. No . He followed his usual practice , which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine : " I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour 's work between six and seven in the evening . I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula , you write 2 @,@ 000 words a day . " By the time he returned to London in late February , he had completed a 206 @-@ page first draft , which he initially titled The Wound Man . 
 Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications — have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . Chancellor put the events of Dr. No in 1956 ; Griswold is more precise , and considers the story to have taken place in February and March of that year . 
 As with his previous four novels , Fleming came up with the concept of the front cover design ; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus @-@ like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover . When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover , he instructed that she be shown on a Venus elegans shell . 
 Prior to the release of Dr. No — and unconnected with the book itself — Bernard Bergonzi , in the March 1958 issue of Twentieth Century , attacked Fleming 's work , saying that it contained " a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado @-@ masochism " and that the books showed " the total lack of any ethical frame of reference " . The article also compared Fleming unfavourably to John Buchan and Raymond Chandler in both moral and literary measures . The writer Simon Raven , while appreciating Bergonzi had produced a " quiet and well @-@ argued article " , thought that the critic 's conclusion was naïve , and asked " Since when has it been remarkable in a work of entertainment that it should lack a specific ' ethical frame of reference ' ? " Raven continued , saying Fleming " by reason of his cool and analytical intelligence , his informed use of technical facts , his plausibility , sense of pace , brilliant descriptive powers and superb imagination , provides sheer entertainment such as I , who must read many novels , am seldom lucky enough to find " .

 In March 1956 Fleming and his friend Ivar Bryce accompanied Robert Cushman Murphy ( of the American Museum of Natural History ) and Arthur Vernay ( of the Flamingo Protection Society ) on a trip to a flamingo colony on Great Inagua in the south of the Bahamas . The colony was 100 square miles ( 260 km2 ) of dense mangrove swamp and salt flats , home to flamingos , egrets and roseate spoonbills ; the location inspired Crab Key . Much of the travel overland on Great Inagua was by a swamp vehicle , a Land Rover fitted with over @-@ large tyres that became the model for the " dragon " used in the story . 
 Fleming 's inspiration for the Doctor No character was Sax Rohmer 's villain Dr Fu Manchu , who featured in books Fleming had read and enjoyed in earlier years . Aspects of the plot were influenced by Rohmer 's work , and Winder observes that the use of the centipede was " a straight steal " from a Fu Manchu novel ; other devices from Rohmer 's novels included Doctor No 's secret lair and the use of the mad scientist trope . 
 After Diamonds Are Forever was published in 1956 , Fleming received a letter from Geoffrey Boothroyd , a Bond enthusiast and gun expert , who criticised the author 's choice of firearm for Bond . Boothroyd suggested that Bond should swap his Beretta for a Walther PPK 7 @.@ 65 mm , an exchange that made it to the novel . Boothroyd also gave Fleming advice on the Berns @-@ Martin triple draw shoulder holster and a number of the weapons used by SMERSH and other villains . In thanks , Fleming gave the MI6 Armourer the name Major Boothroyd in Dr. No and M introduces him to Bond as " the greatest small @-@ arms expert in the world " . 
 As he had done in his previous novels , Fleming borrowed names from his friends and associates to use in his book ; Ivar Bryce 's housekeeper , May Maxwell , became Bond 's Scottish " treasure " May . One of Fleming 's neighbours in Jamaica , and later his lover , was Blanche Blackwell : Fleming named the guano @-@ collecting ship in Dr. No as Blanche . His friend Patricia Wilder found that her nickname of Honey Chile was used for the novel 's main female character , and John Fox @-@ Strangways — a friend from the gentlemen 's club White 's — saw part of his surname being used for the name of the MI6 station chief in Jamaica . Fleming also used the physical descriptions of people he knew ; Quarrel , who previously appeared in the novel Live and Let Die , was based on a Jamaican fisherman who often took Fleming shark fishing . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 In Dr. No , for the first time in the Bond novels , there is friction between Bond and M , brought about because Bond was nearly killed by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb in From Russia , with Love . M orders Bond to use a new gun and sends him on a holiday assignment , which Bond resents . The writer Raymond Benson — who later wrote a series of Bond novels — sees M at his most authoritarian in Dr. No , punishing Bond both in terms of stripping him of his gun and then sending him on what both Bond and M considered at first to be a " soft " assignment . 
 Honeychile Rider is one of three women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape . This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow different to the norm , although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others . Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws , and Rider has a broken nose — the result of the rape she suffered . The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett , in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels , consider that Rider is " not archetypically feminine " , but is " constructed according to the formula ' equal but yet subordinate ' . " Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy , which brought a response from Fleming 's friend Noël Coward that " I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile 's bottom was like a boy 's . I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays , but really old chap what could you have been thinking of ? " 
 Fleming 's villain was physically disfigured , similar to many of Bond 's later adversaries ; No is 6 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) tall , with steel pincers for hands and has dextrocardia . Bond describes him as " a giant venomous worm wrapped in grey tin @-@ foil " . Benson considers that No is " a wickedly successful villain " , the best since Hugo Drax in Moonraker , while Time thought No to be " one of the less forgettable characters in modern fiction " . 
 Quarrel was Fleming 's idealised concept of a black person , and the character was based on his genuine liking for Jamaicans , whom he saw as " full of goodwill and cheerfulness and humour " . The relationship between Bond and Quarrel was based on a presumption of Bond 's superiority . Fleming described the relationship as " that of a Scots laird with his head stalker ; authority was unspoken and there was no room for servility " . Winder considers the scenes with Quarrel to be " embarrassingly patronising but nonetheless hypnotic " . 
 = = Style = = 
 In From Russia , with Love Fleming experimented with an unusual narrative structure that saw Bond 's entry into the story delayed until chapter eleven . For Dr. No he returned to the conventional form with which he felt comfortable — that of the thriller writers of the early 20th century . As a result , the story 's villain is closer to the intellectual " gentleman crook " of the golden age of detective fiction , and the novel 's focus is on action at the expense of character development and depth of plot . 
 Benson describes the " Fleming Sweep " as taking the reader from one chapter to another using " hooks " at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader onto the next . He feels that the " Fleming Sweep briskly propels the plot " of Dr. No through chapters that are longer than in previous Bond novels ; the cultural historian Jeremy Black also likes Dr. No 's pacing , despite considering it inconsistent in places . Winder believes that the novel 's plotting is chaotic , although he still feels the book " can be read over and over again with immense pleasure " . 
 Fleming used known brand names and everyday details to produce a sense of realism , which the writer Kingsley Amis calls " the Fleming effect " . Amis describes " the imaginative use of information , whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond 's world ... [ is ] bolted down to some sort of reality , or at least counter @-@ balanced . " The journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees the novel as " the most fantastical , gothic and melodramatic ; and at times frankly , even knowingly , over the top " , while Black considers the fantastic element of Doctor No 's underground lair to be a " weak " and " bizarre " part of the story . When the writer Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel , he thought " that the long sensational business which is the heart of the book not only borders on fantasy . It plunges in with both feet . Ian Fleming 's impetuous imagination has no rules . " Writing in 1963 , Fleming acknowledged his plots were " fantastical while often being based in truth . They go wildly beyond the probable but not , I think , beyond the possible " . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Two main themes run through Dr. No : the meaning of power ; and the concept of friendship and loyalty . Bond talks about the meaning of power with several villains in the series . His conversation with Doctor No reveals that the latter believes it can only be secured through the privacy required to maintain the sovereignty of his island . No quotes Carl von Clausewitz 's first principle — about having a secure base from which to operate — in support of his argument . According to Panek , in his examination of 20th century British spy novels , Dr. No " shows a shift towards emphasizing the intellect and organizing power of the individual " , as opposed to a group or nation . Black considers that although it is American assets that are under threat from the Soviet Union , it is British power , through the British agent , that concludes the issue . This is reinforced at the end of the book , when a modern British warship bearing British soldiers is despatched to the island . In Black and Parker 's views , the display of British power , with no assistance from America , portrayed the British Empire as an enduring force . 
 The concept of friendship and loyalty is the second major theme . The relationship between Bond and Quarrel , the Cayman Islander , is mutually felt . According to Lindner , Quarrel is " an indispensable ally " who had assisted Bond in Live and Let Die . Benson sees no racial discrimination in the relationship between the two men and acknowledges that Bond feels genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel 's death .

 For the first time in the Bond series , Fleming encountered harsh criticism . The most virulent came from Paul Johnson of the New Statesman , who opened his review , " Sex , Snobbery and Sadism " , with : " I have just finished what is , without doubt , the nastiest book I have ever read " . He went on to say that " by the time I was a third of the way through , I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away " . Although he recognised that Bond represented " a social phenomenon of some importance " , he saw this as a negative element , as the phenomenon concerned " three basic ingredients in Dr. No , all unhealthy , all thoroughly English : the sadism of a schoolboy bully , the mechanical , two @-@ dimensional sex @-@ longings of a frustrated adolescent , and the crude , snob @-@ cravings of a suburban adult " . Johnson saw no positives in Dr. No , saying that " Mr Fleming has no literary skill , the construction of the book is chaotic , and entire incidents and situations are inserted , and then forgotten , in a haphazard manner . " 
 Maurice Richardson , of The Observer , considered the novel " the usual sado @-@ masochistic free @-@ for @-@ all , plus octopuses " . The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson 's " sex , snobbery and sadism " complaint . They highlighted the " sinister ... cult of luxury for its own sake " , with Bond 's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products , but disagreed with part of Johnson 's summary that the novel was a sign of moral decay ; rather , " we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety @-@ valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man . " This reviewer also conceded that while " the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual , they are heavy " . In April 1958 , Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work , referring to both that paper 's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century . Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond 's objects , such as cigarettes and food , but defended it on the basis that " I had to fit Bond out with some theatrical props " . These included his cocktail , ( " The Vesper " ) and Bond 's diet . Fleming called these devices " vulgar foibles " which he was saddled with , although maybe , he suggested , " Bond 's luxury meals are simply saying ' no ' to toad @-@ in @-@ the @-@ hole and tele @-@ <unk> . " 
 Writing in The Times Literary Supplement , Philip Stead was more generous to Dr. No . Despite thinking that Fleming was offering " too opulent a feast " with the book , Stead argued that Fleming managed to pull this off , where " a less accomplished writer ... would never have got away with this story . " Raymond Chandler reviewed the novel for The Sunday Times and praised as " masterly " Fleming 's depiction of colonial Kingston in the first chapter . Chandler admired Fleming 's writing , which had " an acute sense of pace . ... You don 't have to work at Ian Fleming . He does the work for you . " 
 The reviewer for Time acknowledged the critical storm around Fleming and Dr. No , but was broadly welcoming of the book , writing that while " not all readers will agree that Dr. No ... is magnificent writing , ... pages of it , at least , qualify for Ezra Pound 's classic comment on Tropic of Cancer : ' At last , an unprintable book that is readable ' . " In The New York Times , Anthony Boucher — described by Fleming 's biographer John Pearson as " throughout an avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " — was again damning of Fleming 's work , saying " it 's harder than ever to see why an ardent coterie so admires Ian Fleming 's tales " . Benson described Boucher 's critique as " true to form " and " a tirade " as Boucher concluded his review by saying : " it is 80 @,@ 000 words long , with enough plot for 8 @,@ 000 and enough originality for 800 . " 
 <unk> Culligan of The Washington Post described the novel as a " thin little whodunit which rocked the British Empire and shook the English Establishment " , adding " Bully for it ! " Culligan admitted that " <unk> though , we enjoyed Dr. No , and if this be sick , sick , sick , gentlemen , make the most of it . " James Sandoe in his book review for The New York Herald Tribune was very positive about Dr. No and thought that it was " the most artfully bold , dizzyingly poised thriller of the decade . You 'd much better read it than read about it . " 
 The writer Simon Winder believes that because Fleming was writing about Jamaica , the result was " perhaps the most attractive of all the Bond books — the most relaxed , the most fiendish , the most confident " . According to the literary analyst LeRoy L. Panek , in his examination of 20th century British spy novels , Fleming knew his outdated view of Jamaica would soon be overtaken by events — as evidenced by the novel 's description of how the Queen 's Club would be lost during independence struggles . According to the cultural historian Michael Denning , this acknowledgement of the end @-@ of @-@ empire leads to a " sense of doom " that is the result of " a shadow of real history hanging over the stories " .

 Dr. No was serialised in The Daily Express from 19 March to 1 April 1958 . In 1960 the novel was adapted as a daily comic strip in the paper and was syndicated worldwide . The strip , which ran from May to October , was written by Peter O 'Donnell and illustrated by John McLusky . It was reprinted in 2005 by Titan Books as part of the Dr. No anthology that also includes Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia , with Love . In 1962 the American men 's magazine Stag serialised the story , renaming it as " Nude Girl of Nightmare Key " .

It was the first Bond film in the Eon Productions series ; Sean Connery portrayed Bond , with Joseph Wiseman as Doctor No and Ursula Andress as Honeychile Rider . Although the story follows the same general storyline , there are some changes : the film shows No to be an operative of the fictional crime organisation SPECTRE and his island fortress is nuclear @-@ powered ; No is killed not by the mountain of guano , but by drowning in reactor coolant . The novel was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in May 2008 . The actor Toby Stephens played Bond , while No was played by David Suchet .

 Robert Henry Maxwell ( Bobby ) Gibbes , DSO , DFC and Bar , OAM ( 6 May 1916 – 11 April 2007 ) was a leading Australian fighter ace of World War II , and the longest @-@ serving wartime commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron RAAF . He was officially credited with 10 ¼ aerial victories , although his score is often reported as 12 , including two shared . Gibbes was also credited with five aircraft probably destroyed , and a further 16 damaged . He commanded No. 3 Squadron in North Africa from February 1942 to April 1943 , apart from a brief period when he was injured . 
 Born in rural New South Wales , Gibbes worked as a jackaroo and salesman before joining the Royal Australian Air Force in February 1940 . Posted to the Middle East in April 1941 , he flew with No. 3 Squadron in the Syria – Lebanon Campaign , and became commanding officer during the Western Desert Campaign , where his leadership and fighting skills earned him the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar . Subsequently posted to the South West Pacific , he served with No. 80 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force , and took part in the " Morotai Mutiny " of April 1945 . After the war he spent many years in New Guinea developing local industry , for which he was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2004 . He continued to fly until the age of 85 , and died five years later in 2007 . 
 = = Family and early career = = 
 The only son of Henry and Cora Gibbes , Robert Henry Maxwell ( Bobby ) Gibbes was born on 6 May 1916 in Young , New South Wales . He came from a family that had long been active in the government and military . His great @-@ grandfather , Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes , built his residence " <unk> " at Kirribilli ; the property was later refurbished to become Sydney 's Admiralty House . Gibbes ' grandfather , Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes , owned Yarralumla station , subsequently the official residence of Australia 's Governor @-@ General . His father was a grazier and his uncle Fred a Sopwith Camel pilot in World War I who was killed in action . Gibbes attended All Saints College in Bathurst , and various schools in Manly , before earning a living as a jackaroo . 
 Gibbes was working as a salesman when he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) on 2 February 1940 . He exaggerated his height , which was below the minimum requirement , to gain entrance . In a 1990 interview , he related that he had undertaken flying lessons at his own expense prior to enlisting , but " when war was declared , I thought I 'd wait for King George to pay for the rest " . He further recalled that he applied to join the Royal Australian Navy at the same time , but was still waiting for a response . After completing flying training at Mascot and Richmond , New South Wales , and Point Cook , Victoria , Gibbes was commissioned a pilot officer on 28 June 1940 . His initial posting was to No. 23 Squadron , which operated CAC Wirraways and Lockheed Hudsons out of Archerfield , Queensland . He was promoted to flying officer on 26 December 1940 . 
 Two of Gibbes ' cousins — both born in 1915 and , like Bobby , only sons — were also pilots in the RAAF . Rodney Gibbes joined the Air Force in July 1936 . Peter Gibbes , an airline pilot before the war , enlisted in December 1940 . Each earned the Distinguished Flying Cross , Rodney in 1940 for his part in a Wellington bomber raid in Europe while serving with the Royal Air Force , and Peter in 1942 for his actions flying a Hudson bomber with No. 1 Squadron RAAF during the Malayan Campaign . Rodney died in action over Italy on 16 May 1943 .

 In April 1941 , Gibbes was posted to the Middle East as adjutant of No. 450 Squadron . The following month he transferred to No. 3 Squadron , which was flying Hawker Hurricanes . In June , after converting to P @-@ 40 Tomahawks , the squadron commenced operations in the Syria – Lebanon Campaign . Gibbes was credited with a probable victory over a Junkers Ju 88 near Bierut on 13 June . On 11 July he claimed his first " kill " , a Dewoitine D.520 fighter of the Vichy French air force , over Aleppo . He shared in its destruction with John Jackson , after which the pair tossed a coin to take full credit for it , and Gibbes won . In September , No. 3 Squadron transferred to the Western Desert Campaign , where it saw action against German and Italian forces . On 20 November , during Operation Crusader , Gibbes took part in the destruction of a Messerschmitt Bf 110 with three other pilots , crash landing back at base with damage to his own aircraft . He had a particularly successful day on 25 November , when he shot down two Fiat G.50s and damaged three more , as well as a Messerschmitt Bf 109 . Five days later he destroyed a G.50 over Tobruk . On 22 January 1942 , he brought down a Junkers Ju 87 and damaged two <unk> He was promoted to acting flight lieutenant the same month . 
 Raised to acting squadron leader , Gibbes was appointed commanding officer of No. 3 Squadron on 26 February 1942 . The unit 's Tomahawks had by this time been replaced by Kittyhawks , and Gibbes emblazoned his with a cartoon depicting a kangaroo kicking a dachshund in the rear . He claimed a Bf 109 ( possibly a misidentified Macchi C.202 ) during the Siege of Tobruk on 7 May . On 26 May , he was shot down while leading an attack on a heavily escorted force of Luftwaffe bombers near El Adem . After firing at and probably destroying a Bf 109 , Gibbes was hit by fire from a Ju 88 and had to bail out . Part of his parachute became entangled with the tailplane of his stricken aircraft and he struggled to escape . He broke his ankle in the landing but within six weeks was flying again , his leg still in a cast . Due to his enforced absence , fellow ace Nicky Barr was given command of No. 3 Squadron until he himself was shot down and taken prisoner on 26 June , at which point Gibbes again took charge of the unit . Barr later noted that although Gibbes was not a brilliant shot , he had the keenest eyesight of any pilot he knew when it came to locating enemy aircraft and alerting his fellows for the attack . Another No. 3 Squadron pilot , Tom Russell , also recalled that Gibbes was particularly adept at finding targets , and that " if we got scattered in a dogfight he had the uncanny ability to get us back into formation in a very short space of time " . 
 Gibbes was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) on 28 July 1942 for his actions on 26 May , the citation noting his " exceptional skill and gallantry " . On 1 September , he destroyed a Bf 109 and damaged two others during the Battle of Alam el Halfa , east of El Alamein . He claimed No. 3 Squadron 's 200th victim , a Bf 109F , during the Battle of El Alamein on 28 October . Air Marshal Sir Peter Drummond , Deputy Air Officer Commanding @-@ in @-@ Chief Middle East , sent him a signal reading " <unk> congratulations to you and all ranks in the squadron on the achievement of your double century — not out " . Around this time Gibbes also managed to fly Bf 109F and G fighters captured from the Germans , and came away impressed . He was credited with another Bf 109 on 17 November . On 21 December , he landed his Kittyhawk in rugged terrain near Hun , Libya , to rescue a fellow pilot who had been forced down . Gibbes threw out his own parachute to make room in the cockpit for his passenger and lost part of his undercarriage taking off , necessitating a one @-@ wheeled landing back at base . Recommended for the Victoria Cross for this action , he was instead awarded the Distinguished Service Order , which was promulgated on 15 January 1943 and cited his " outstanding qualities of leadership and enthusiasm " . Gibbes himself crash landed behind enemy lines on 14 January 1943 , walking 50 miles ( 80 km ) in the desert before being picked up by a British Army patrol . He was awarded a bar to his DFC for this feat , and for his " exceptional leadership , skill and courage , contributing in a large measure to the success of the squadron he commands " . The award made him the most highly decorated pilot in the RAAF . 
 On 22 January 1943 , Gibbes claimed his last kill , a <unk> He was officially credited with a total of 10 ¼ victories , though other estimates gave him a score of 12 , including two shared . He was also credited with five " probables " , and another 16 damaged . During his tour of duty in the Middle East , he flew 274 sorties and became No. 3 Squadron 's longest @-@ serving wartime commanding officer . Squadron member Bob Smith recalled him as lacking somewhat in administrative ability , but an " Errol Flynn " in the air . Gibbes , for his part , later admitted to being in " an absolute state of terror " before missions , only to " sort of become mechanical " once the shooting started . He described his post @-@ combat feelings thus : 
 Man becomes animal when he thinks he is about to die . As you fly back to your base , now safe at last , a feeling of light @-@ hearted exuberance comes over you . It is wonderful to still be alive and it is , I think , merely the after @-@ effect of violent , terrible fear .

 Gibbes handed over command of No. 3 Squadron to Squadron Leader Brian Eaton on 19 April 1943 . With his rank of squadron leader confirmed the same month , Gibbes departed North Africa to serve at RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , until October . While in England he converted to de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and was slated to command No. 464 Squadron RAAF , but was instead posted back to Australia , via Canada . There , according to Gibbes , he gave a series of morale @-@ building lectures on air combat to Empire Air Training Scheme students : " So I , you know , went round and lied like hell . I said that it was all a piece of cake . " In January 1944 , he joined No. 2 Operational Training Unit ( OTU ) at Mildura , Victoria , becoming chief flying instructor in March . He worked with Clive Caldwell , Australia 's top @-@ scoring ace , to improve the success rate at No. 2 OTU by personally selecting the most promising pilots from local service flying training schools . Gibbes was promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 July . In October he was posted to Darwin in the Northern Territory , flying Supermarine Spitfires as wing leader of No. 80 Wing . The role made him deputy to Group Captain Caldwell , the wing 's commanding officer . Gibbes later suffered burns in a crash landing following engine failure . In December he met , in his own words , " a little dark @-@ haired <unk> " named Jeannine Ince , a volunteer with the Red Cross who had nursed him in hospital . They married on 23 January 1945 . 
 No. 80 Wing had begun transferring to the Dutch East Indies in December 1944 , and the main body followed in January 1945 . Gibbes ' injuries prevented him from joining the formation at its base on Morotai , where it came under the control of the Australian First Tactical Air Force ( No. 1 TAF ) , until 9 March . Once there , he took over as temporary commanding officer for a few days when Caldwell was called to Manila . In April , Gibbes was one of eight senior pilots , including Caldwell and fellow aces Wilf Arthur and John Waddy , who tendered their resignations in protest at the relegation of RAAF fighter squadrons to apparently worthless ground @-@ attack missions . The incident became known as the " Morotai Mutiny " . Gibbes later declared that " ... after I myself had been operating for a week or so and had a really good look around and seen the futility of the operations which had been given , I could not see any point in carrying on . I certainly lost all keenness for remaining in the service . " As a former jackaroo , he was especially upset about one sortie that involved attacking cattle : " I felt horrible about it , being an ex bushy ... at about lunch time I went out and darned if I didn 't have to turn butcher . And Heavens , it was butchering too , in every sense of the word . No — not the Japs . Cattle ... If we are to get the Japs out of this area without loss of human lives , starvation will be our main weapon ... God , I hated doing it but could do nothing else . Felt as sick as hell . " No action was taken against the " mutineers " for their attempted resignations ; a subsequent government inquiry found that their protest was justified . In the meantime , Gibbes and Caldwell were court martialled for their involvement in alcohol trafficking on Morotai . Both were reduced to the rank of flight lieutenant ; the Air Officer Commanding No. 1 TAF , Air Commodore Harry Cobby , himself shortly to be dismissed over the " mutiny " , restored Gibbes to squadron leader effective 23 April .

 In July 1945 , Gibbes was assigned to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . Following his discharge from the Air Force on 11 January 1946 , he was initially employed as a stock and station agent in <unk> , New South Wales . He flew a Butler Bat twin @-@ engined aircraft to facilitate his work , reportedly the only New South Welshman in his profession to do so at the time . Gibbes spent much of the next 30 years in New Guinea , pioneering the island 's transport , coffee and hospitality industries . In January 1948 , he formed Gibbes Sepik Airways using , among other types , three German Junkers Ju 52s , one of which was said to have been the personal transport of senior Luftwaffe commander Albert Kesselring . He was joined briefly in this venture , headquartered at Wewak , by Nicky Barr . Gibbes also established a tea and coffee plantation at Mount Hagen , New Guinea , in 1950 , and served as a member of the RAAF Active Reserve , based in Townsville , Queensland , from 1952 until 1957 . In 1958 , he sold his share in Gibbes Sepik Airways to Mandated Airlines , which was later bought out by Ansett Australia . He continued to develop coffee plantations in New Guinea , and built a large chain of hotels beginning with the Bird of Paradise in Goroka . 
 Gibbes sold his interests in New Guinea in 1972 . He spent most of the remainder of the decade in the Mediterranean , aboard his catamaran Billabong . In his 60s , he sailed Billabong from England to Australia by himself , braving heavy seas and Malaysian pirates along the way . By 1979 he was living in Sydney and had begun building his own twin @-@ engined plane , which he eventually took to the air in 1990 . In 1994 , Gibbes published his autobiography , You Live But Once . He continued to fly until forced to give up his civil aviation licence at the age of 85 . In 2002 , he appeared in an episode of the television series Australian Story dedicated to Nicky Barr . Gibbes was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia on 26 January 2004 for " service to aviation and to tourism , particularly in Papua New Guinea " . He died of a stroke at Mona Vale Hospital in Sydney on 11 April 2007 , aged 90 , and was survived by his wife and two daughters . His funeral service at St Thomas ' Church , North Sydney , was attended by 350 mourners , including the Chief of Air Force , Air Marshal Geoff Shepherd , and 40 members of No. 3 Squadron led by the commanding officer . A Spitfire in the " Grey Nurse " livery of one of Gibbes ' World War II aircraft overflew the church , along with four F / A @-@ 18 Hornet jet fighters from No. 3 Squadron in a " missing man " formation .
