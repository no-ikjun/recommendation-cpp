 In January 1968 , during the Vietnam War , the North Vietnamese Army ( still under Giáp 's command ) initiated a siege and artillery bombardment on the U.S. Marine Corps infantry and artillery base at Khe Sanh , South Vietnam . Historians are divided on whether this was a genuine attempt to repeat their success at Điện Biên Phủ by forcing the surrender of the Marine base , or else a diversion from the rest of the Tết Offensive , or an example of the North Vietnamese Army keeping its options open . At Khe Sanh , a number of factors were significantly different from Điện Biên Phủ . Khe Sanh was much closer to an American supply base ( 45 km or 28 mi ) compared to a French one at Điện Biên Phủ ( 200 km or 120 mi ) . 
 At Khe Sanh , the U.S. Marines held the high ground , and their artillery forced the North Vietnamese to use their own artillery from a much greater distance . By contrast , at Điện Biên Phủ , the French artillery ( six 105 mm batteries and one battery of four 155 mm howitzers and mortars ) were only sporadically effective ; Khe Sanh received 18 @,@ 000 tons of aerial <unk> during the 77 @-@ day battle , whereas during the 167 days that the French forces at Điện Biên Phủ held out , they received only 4 @,@ 000 tons . And lastly , the US Air Force dropped 114 @,@ 810 tons of bombs on the Vietnamese at Khe Sanh – roughly as much as on Japan in 1945 during World War II .

 Many of the flights operated by the French Air force to evacuate casualties had female flight nurses on board . A total of 15 women served on flights to Điện Biên Phủ . One , Geneviève de <unk> , was stranded there when her plane was destroyed by shellfire while being repaired on the airfield . She remained on the ground providing medical services in the field hospital until the surrender . She was later referred to as the " Angel of Điện Biên Phủ " . However , historians disagree regarding this moniker , with Martin <unk> maintaining that de <unk> was referred to by this name by the garrison itself , but Michael Kenney and Bernard Fall maintaining it was added by outside press agencies . 
 The French forces came to Điện Biên Phủ accompanied by two <unk> mobiles de campagne , ( " mobile field brothels " ) , served by Algerian and Vietnamese women . When the siege ended , the Viet Minh sent the surviving Vietnamese women for " re @-@ education " .

 = Tanks in the Spanish Army = 
 Tanks in the Spanish Army have over 90 years of history , from the French Renault FTs first delivered in 1919 to the Leopard 2 and B1 Centauro models of the early 21st century . The FT took part in combat during the Rif War and participated in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history , at <unk> . In 1925 , the Spanish Army began to undertake a program to develop and produce a Spanish tank , heavily based on the Renault FT , called the Trubia A4 . Although the prototype performed well during testing , the tank was never put into mass production . Spain also experimented with the Italian Fiat 3000 , acquiring one tank in 1925 , and with another indigenous tank program called the Landesa . However , none of these evolved into a major armor program , and as a result the FT remained the most important tank , in numbers , in the Spanish Army until the beginning of the Spanish Civil War . 
 Between July 1936 and April 1939 , during the Spanish Civil War , the two opposing armies received large quantities of tanks from foreign powers . Spain 's Second Republic received tanks from the Soviet Union , many of which were captured by the Nationalists and pressed into service against their former masters , while the Nationalists were aided by the Germans and Italians . The Spanish Civil War , although the testing grounds for the nations which would ultimately take part in World War II , proved inconclusive with regard to the proof of mechanized warfare . Despite attempts by Soviet , German and Italian advisers and soldiers to use newly devised mechanized theories , the lack of quality crews and the tanks , and the insufficient amount of tanks provided bad impressions on the usefulness of tanks on their own . 
 The Spanish Army ended the Spanish Civil War with a fleet of light tanks . Looking to field more modern and capable tanks , the Spanish government and army approved a venture to design and manufacture a better light tank , known as the Verdeja . Although the tank proved extremely capable , a lack of raw materials and incentives doomed the program to failure . Furthermore , the army 's requirements were temporarily satisfied by the procurement of Panzer IVs in late 1943 . However , the failure to acquire more Panzer IVs led Spain to field a largely antiquated collection of light tanks and an insufficient amount of medium tanks . In 1953 , the United States and Spain signed a military aid program agreement which led to the supply of M47 Patton and M48 Patton tanks . The American decision to not allow Spain to deploy the new equipment during the war with Morocco caused Spain to look elsewhere for a supplement to their fleet of Patton tanks , ending with the procurement of the AMX @-@ 30E , based on the French AMX @-@ 30 . 
 Almost immediately after , the Spanish Army and the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to look for a future Spanish tank . This turned into the Lince tank program . Despite numerous bids the Lince program failed , both for financial reasons and because of the decision to instead modernize the existing fleet of AMX @-@ 30Es , and to procure a large number of American M60 Patton tanks to replace the fleet of older Patton tanks . Over half of the AMX @-@ 30Es were upgraded to a standard known as the AMX @-@ 30EM2 , while the rest suffered a more finite modification known as the AMX @-@ 30EM1 . However , the M60s and modernized AMX @-@ 30Es did not provide Spain with a sufficiently modern tank for the next century . In 1994 , the Spanish Ministry of Defense began to negotiate with the German government over the purchase of the Leopard 2 . Ultimately , 108 Leopard 2A4s were procured and integrated into the Spanish Army , while 219 Leopard 2Es were built in Spain , based on the German Leopard 2A6 . The Leopard 2E and Leopard 2A4 replaced the fleet of M60 Patton tanks , while Spain 's AMX @-@ 30EM2s were replaced by Italian B1 Centauro anti @-@ tank cavalry vehicles . Presently , the Spanish Army possesses 108 Leopard 2A4s and 219 Leopard 2Es .

 = = = Background = = = 
 Before First World War Spanish Army bought a Schneider @-@ Brillié in 1909 to be used in Melilla , where armed conflict with local tribes was going on . This was a French bus platform that was fitted with an armoured body , to be used as troop transport . Although it was big , slow and its performance was not good Spanish Army learnt the value of armored vehicles and bought a second one . Spanish Army officers appreciated the advantages of using advanced weapons technology in Colonial War in Spanish Morocco and followed First World War advances . 
 = = = First purchases = = = 
 The Spanish army 's interest in the tank began near the end of World War I , when a formal petition for one Renault FT light tank was made to the French government on 28 October 1918 . This purchase , however , was not processed until 15 January 1919 . Spain 's Comisión de <unk> , <unk> y <unk> del Material de Guerra ( Experiences , Projects and Confirmation Commission ) issued a formal order for an FT , armed with a 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) cannon , and days later extended the order to include another three cannon armed tanks , and another FT armed with a machine gun . On 5 March the order was authorized and then extended further to include two more FTs , armed with the 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) cannon . On 20 March the French government declared that they could not process the sale , and on 12 April the process to acquire these vehicles began anew . 
 In May 1919 , the French acceded to the sale of a single FT light tank to the Spanish Army , delivered the next month . This particular FT was armed with an 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) Hotchkiss machine gun , and was later re @-@ armed with a Spanish 7 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) machine gun . Upon inspection by the Spanish government , it was decided to procure another ten — including eight armed with machine guns and two armed with cannons . The French government declared that there were no vehicles available for sale , and later added that under no circumstances would they allow Spain to rearm these vehicles with the Spanish 7 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) machine gun , and consequently denied the sale . As a result , Spain began to approach other governments , including Great Britain and the United States , but with no success . 
 = = = Rif War = = = 
 Following Spain 's colonial defeat at the Battle of Annual , on 22 July 1921 , another military envoy was sent to France to petition for more tanks . This time , the French government consented and agreed to the sale of ten machine gun armed FTs and a single command tank . The command tank was an FT chassis , with the turret replaced by a superstructure , carrying a single communications radio . These were presented to the third section of the Escuela Central de Tiro , or the Central Shooting School , on 12 January 1922 , and organized into a company of twelve light tanks . In September 1921 , the Spanish government also procured six Schneider CA1 tanks and deployed these to Morocco as early as 28 February 1922 . On 13 March 1922 , six FTs were unloaded at Melilla , as well . 
 On 18 March 1922 , the company of FT light tanks took part in its first combat operation , during the Rif War . Ordered to operate with the Spanish Legion , the force was to capture the town of <unk> , in Northern Morocco . Surprising the defenders with their appearance , the armored company advanced , and the legionnaires behind , and captured the town of Anvar . Advancing towards <unk> , the tanks began to come under heavy fire , as their advance had isolated them from the legionnaires due to the speed . As a result , the tanks were forced to withdraw to Anvar to fall back on the protection of the infantry . Two FTs were abandoned by their crew because of mechanical problems and were later destroyed by the Moroccan defenders with dynamite . A post @-@ action analysis of the action decided that the poor performance of the tanks company was a direct result of poor cooperation with the infantry , the lack of reliability of the tanks ' machine guns and the lack of prior training before being rushed to the front . Thereafter , Spain 's armored company was used almost continuously in small @-@ scale operations between late 1922 and September 1925 . On 8 September 1925 , Spain 's armor would take part in the first amphibious landing with tanks in history . 
 After being refitted with brand new FTs to replace losses incurred during the three years of operations in Morocco , the tank company was transferred to Ceuta to prepare for the amphibious operations planned to place in and around Al Hoceima Bay . In the days previous to the <unk> landing , the armored company took part in a number of training exercises , with four K @-@ type landing craft , specially modified to allow them to carry three tanks each . However , on the day of the landings the landing craft hit a shoal 50 meters ( 55 yd ) from the beach ; as a result , the armored company was not able to land until the next day , on 9 September 1925 . Upon landing , the vehicles were used to support the left flank of the Spanish attack and aided in the capture of the heights surrounding the beaches and controlling the exit points towards the inland . 
 The Rif War came to an end in May 1926 , and the armored company was relocated to the Spanish mainland in July of that year . 
 = = Early indigenous tank development programs : 1925 – 1935 = = 
 With their experiences in Morocco , the Spanish Army decided to fund a development program for a new Spanish light tank . The new vehicle was to be based on the Renault FT , which was the most numerous armored vehicle in service with the Spanish Army at the time and one of the most widely used by foreign armies . The program was spearheaded by Captain of the Artillery Carlos Ruiz de Toledo , who had first commanded the battery of Schneider CA1 assault tanks in Morocco ; Toledo felt that the tank would become an extremely important asset in future conflicts and felt that the Spanish Army required a Spanish @-@ built model . As a result , he toured a number of European states in an effort to collect information on new trends in tank design and attempt to integrate these into the Spanish tank program . The resulting tank was known as the Carro de Combate Trubia serie A , or the " Series A Trubia Tank " . 
 = = = Trubia light tank = = = 
 The first prototype development began in 1925 . Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory ( Fábrica de Artillería Trubia ) , in Asturias , the tank was powered by a four @-@ cylinder Hispano @-@ Suiza 40 / 50 engine , the same engine the Spanish Army 's military trucks had been equipped with since 1915 . Given the Spanish Army 's opinion that the FT was limited in firepower , the Trubia tank featured a special turret . The turret was designed in two articulated halves , which could traverse independently , each armed with a machine gun . Theoretically , if one of the machine guns jammed , the tank would still have another one to defend itself with . Furthermore , the vehicle 's hull was provided with firing ports , to allow the crew to fire from within the tank . This prototype was put through a series of tests , and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank , leading to an improved Trubia tank design , known as the Modelo Trubia <unk> , <unk> <unk> , serie A ( Model Trubia 75 hp , fast tank , series A ) . 
 While touring Europe for a second time , in an attempt to integrate foreign design trends into the new Trubia , Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany . Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle , the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall , with the roadwheels suspended from the chassis . The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank . Apart from the new tracks , the Trubia was to have a greater velocity ( at least 30 kilometers per hour ( 19 mph ) ) and greater road range than the FT . While a new machine gun was installed on the glacis plate , the tank 's crew was increased from two to three , which caused the hull to be enlarged ; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle , allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field . To refrigerate the engine and the crew , a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the chassis . This solved problems dealing with the crew 's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT , and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic . The original 50 horsepower ( 37 kW ) was replaced with a more powerful 75 horsepower ( 56 kW ) Daimler four cylinder engine . The transmission had four forward gears and four reverse gears . The new tank proved satisfactory — and even bettered the FT in some aspects — and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes . 
 The first prototype was manufactured in 1926 . A total of four prototypes were ordered , but production was slow and by 1928 only one of the tanks had been completed , while the other three prototypes were not armed . The completed vehicle , called the Trubia A4 , was sent to the Firing School where it was put through a series of tests . In 1931 , a second prototype was completed , while the final two were completed in 1934 . The original prototype was returned to the factory in 1935 , to integrate a number of modernizations and to repair any damage which was done to the vehicle during the testing process . The other three tanks were issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment , in Oviedo , where they continued testing . 
 = = = Other tank programs = = = 
 While the Trubia was being developed , the Spanish Army acquired an Italian Fiat 3000A . Ordered in October 1924 , it was received in January 1925 , and assigned to the Central Firing School . There , it went through a series of experiments and tests . The tank was originally developed as a near copy of the Renault FT , of which Italy had previously attempted to procure one hundred units . It had a smaller chassis and was powered through a 50 horsepower ( 37 kW ) engine . The FIAT 3000A had a turret with two 6 @.@ 5 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 26 in ) machine guns ; this was later improved with a 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) cannon and designated the FIAT <unk> . 
 In 1928 , the Trubia Factory , under Major of the Artillery Victor Landesa Domenech , designed and began production of a prototype of a new armored tractor ; these were named after him , as the Landesa . The unarmed tractor finished production in 1930 and went through a series of tests . Between 1931 and 1932 the vehicle went through a series of upgrades in the factory and was later sent to Madrid for further testing , where it passed satisfactorily in April 1932 . Landesa , who had at this time been promoted to Lieutenant Colonel , began a <unk> of three vehicles , motored by the L @-@ 2000 55 horsepower ( 41 kW ) engine , designed by Daimler @-@ Benz . Ultimately , two were produced and set for testing with the Spanish Republican Army , and another nine were ordered with the idea of using them to tow Škoda 76 @.@ 5 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 01 in ) anti @-@ aircraft cannons . All the while , the Trubia Factory began to plan an armored and armed version of the vehicle for the Spanish Army . Two were produced by 1934 , although the Trubia Factory experienced troubles in producing the L @-@ 2000 engines ; as a result , they were not powered by the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 . They were armed with a single 7 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) machine gun .

 At the start of the Spanish Civil War , the Spanish Army counted on a total of ten Renault FTs in working condition distributed equally amongst two light tank regiments ; one in Madrid and the other in Sevilla . The former ( 1st Light Tank Regiment ) fell under the control of the Second Spanish Republic 's army , while the 2nd Light Tank Regiment ( in Zaragoza ) was integrated into the Nationalist army . The lone Fiat 3000A is thought to have been in service at this time , but was cannibalized for parts . Spain 's six Schneider CA1 assault tanks were put into service with the Republican Army , and saw combat around Madrid before and during the Siege of Madrid , and during the Siege of the Alcázar in Toledo . They were destroyed during the Siege of Madrid . The three Trubia A4 prototypes issued to the Milan Infantry Regiment were turned over to the Nationalist uprising , while the fourth prototype located in the Trubia Factory was taken by the factory 's workers and quickly repaired so that it could be pressed into service in the Republican Army . 
 = = = Armor of the Popular Front ( Spanish Republic Government ) = = = 
 Spain 's Republican Forces fabricated a number of different armored vehicles throughout the war . Although serving little military purpose , due to the poor quality of their design and construction , they were important factors in lifting the Popular Front 's military 's morale . Factories in the northern areas of Spain produced a fair number of armored tractors and trucks ; for example , sixteen armored vehicles , denominated Naval @-@ Somua , were manufactured based on the chassis of the French Somua bus . The Trubia Factory , at this time working for the Republic , manufactured between 15 and 20 light tanks known as the Trubia @-@ Naval , which were heavily influenced by the Landesa and the Trubia A4 . However , most construction revolved around the armoring of trucks , known as <unk> for the grey color of their steel armor . Due to the weight of the armor and the low power output of their engines , many were not able to move more than 20 meters ( 22 yd ) without breaking down . These were mostly constructed in the heavily industrialized regions in northern Spain and in Catalonia . The factories of Levante fabricated , under Soviet guidance , what was considered to be one of the best armored trucks of the war — the <unk> @-@ 35 . These vehicles were based on the Soviet ZiS @-@ 5 truck , and were fabricated between early 1937 and March 1939 at a rate of no more than five per month . Also , based on other chassis , such as Ford 's model <unk> , around 120 <unk> @-@ 35s were manufactured . 
 On 15 October 1936 , the first shipment of 50 Soviet T @-@ 26 light tanks arrived at Cartagena . These were put into combat as early as 26 October , under the leadership of Soviet Lieutenant Colonel Semyon Krivoshein , south of Madrid . The first combat operation in Spain for the T @-@ 26 was near the town of <unk> , when a Republican tank company counterattacked against the spearhead of the Nationalist 's drive towards Madrid . The counterattack , although partially successful , did not hinder the Nationalist advance . By the beginning of the operation , the tanks had separated themselves from the infantry , following them . However , the Republican armor successfully surprised a company of Nationalist infantrymen , who had mistaken then for Italian allies , and routed them . The tank company then continued towards the town of <unk> , to the West , where they were counterattacked by cavalry from the Moroccan Legion and finally forced to withdraw . Lacking infantry support , a number of T @-@ 26s were knocked out by Nationalist infantrymen using wine bottles as bomblets . The tank company returned through <unk> , which had been reoccupied by Nationalist infantry , and came under heavy fire . Despite the withdrawal , the counterattack was heavily publicized in Madrid , by the Republic , as a victory . The lack of success is attributed to the lack of coordination between Republican tanks , infantry and artillery . Although it 's commonly mentioned that Spain received 312 T @-@ 26s , this number includes 16 FTs , delivered by Poland , and 15 T @-@ 26s which never actually made it to Spain . Ultimately , 281 T @-@ 26s were delivered to Spain during the Spanish Civil War . 
 The Soviet Union also supplied Spain with 50 BT @-@ 5 tanks . Although slightly heavier than the T @-@ 26 , the BT @-@ 5 was faster ; it was capable of reaching velocities of 65 kilometers per hour ( 40 mph ) with tracks , on road , and 90 kilometers per hour ( 56 mph ) with wheels . However , given the non @-@ ideal nature of Spanish terrain , the BT @-@ 5 was rarely capable of taking advantage of its speed . The loss of many of the Republic 's BT @-@ 5s during the Battle of the Ebro caused them to retire the tank to their reserves . The BT @-@ 5 was a product improvement of J. Walter Christie 's fast tank concept , using Christie suspension , and was armed with a 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) tank gun . 
 It must be taken into account that Soviet T @-@ 26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain , and Soviet Army tank doctrine was really advanced . Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked . This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could . 
 = = = Organization of Popular Front armored forces = = = 
 The first 50 T @-@ 26 tanks which arrived in Spain , under the command of Krivoshein , were crewed by Soviet personnel . Nevertheless , the Soviet lieutenant colonel opened a training school in the town of <unk> , near Cartagena , recruiting mainly truck and bus drivers from cities such as Madrid and Barcelona . The next month , he opened a second school in Alcalá de Henares , north of Madrid . However , only Communist soldiers were allowed to crew Soviet tanks , and as a result the pool of soldiers to recruit from was narrow and often less adept drivers were picked over better ones , due to their political ideologies . For example , in one instance a tank commander broke contact with the enemy because he had not learned how to fire his main gun . Furthermore , at first , the Soviet trainers did not have interpreters to communicate with their Spanish students . 
 With training underway , and the tanks quickly put into combat , the first 50 vehicles were organized into the Popular Army 's first tank battalion . The battalion was equipped with three tank companies ( each company containing ten tanks ) and a headquarters company ; each company had three platoons , with three tanks a piece , and a command tank . By mid @-@ November a second battalion was organized . Later that month , Krivoshein and his deputy ( Major <unk> ) were recalled to the Soviet Union and replaced by General Dmitry Pavlov . In December 1936 , General Pavlov organized new Soviet armored vehicles into an armored brigade , made up of four tank battalions and a reconnaissance company . This brigade , known as Brigada de Carros de Combate ( Tank Brigade ) , was composed of 56 tanks and 68 other armored vehicles , and immediately saw combat around Madrid , including in the battles of Jarama and Guadalajara . However , the brigade was used to support Republican infantry forces and not as a mobile armored group , and as a result its strategic role during the war was limited by its misuse . In July 1937 , the brigade took part in the Battle of Brunete , the largest tank battle to that date in the war , with some 150 Republican tanks taking part . The battle was also one of the few examples during the Spanish Civil War of the use of tanks to exploit a penetration along the front . However , the battle cost the Popular Army around 159 armored fighting vehicles . 
 After the Battle of Brunete , the brigade was reorganized into a new Spanish division , known as the División de <unk> <unk> ( Armored Vehicles Division ) . This was composed of a tank brigade and an armored brigade ; the latter was made up of lighter armored fighting vehicles , such as the BA @-@ 6 . It was put under the command of Spanish Colonel Sánchez Paredes . By this time , most of the Soviet tankers had returned to the Soviet Union to provide information on mechanized warfare in Spain . The only Soviet unit left was the heavy tank regiment , armed with brand new BT @-@ 5s which had not been used in combat yet . This regiment was crewed by both Soviet and veteran Spanish tankers , and was put under the command of Soviet Colonel <unk> . Finally , the division also disposed of an infantry brigade and an anti @-@ tank artillery company . However , by this time the Republican military command had relegated the tank to the role of merely infantry support , dissuaded by the poor performance of Republican armor to that date . The last major battle Republican armor would take part in was the Battle of the Ebro , in 1938 . 
 The Soviets deduced that although tank formations in Spain were not large enough to perform an ideal mechanized penetration of an enemy 's lines , too large tank formations were also not ideal due to uneven terrain preventing their use en masse . As a result , armored commanders like Pavlov considered the tank 's best role to be infantry support . The Republican use of armor during the Spanish Civil War was not a good demonstration of deep mechanized battle . 
 = = = Armor of the Nationalists ( Spanish <unk> Army ) = = = 
 During the Spanish Civil War , the Nationalist Army only developed a single tank , the Carro de <unk> <unk> 1937 ( Infantry Tank model 1937 ) . Taking advantage of the capture of the Trubia Factory in the north , in 1937 , the Nationalists @-@ based it on the Republican Trubia @-@ Naval , the German Panzer I , the T @-@ 26 and the Italian CV @-@ 33 . It was designed to unite the best of all three major light tanks used by the Nationalist Army during the war . However , it did not perform as well as expected , and it was not put into mass production . The Nationalist Army did manufacture a small number of armored trucks and tractors , as well as beginning the development of the Verdeja light tank , but none of these contributed with distinction to the Nationalist effort against the Popular Army . 
 The first foreign tanks to enter service with the Nationalists were five Italian CV @-@ 33s , which arrived at the city of Vigo on 26 August 1936 . These arrived with ten crewman , whom would serve as instructors . The tanks were armed with two 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine guns and had a maximum of 15 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) of steel armor . On 10 December 1936 , Italian dictator Benito Mussolini decided to send combat troops to Spain , in a bid to end the war as early as possible . These men were organized into the Corpo Truppe Volontarie ( CTV ; Volunteer Corps ) , and by the end of the year their ranks had swelled to an estimated 47 @,@ 000 men ; 20 @,@ 000 of which came from the Italian Army , and 27 @,@ 000 of which originated from the Blackshirts . The corps was put under the command of Italian General Mario Roatta . The first major battle for the CTV came in March 1938 , when it decided to engage Republican forces during the Battle of Guadalajara . A force of some 35 @,@ 000 men , including 81 tanks , attacked on 8 March 1937 . Failing to take into account the meteorological conditions of the battlefield , by the following day the Italian troops found themselves attacking over ground that had turned into mud due to the heavy rains . The slow speed of the advance allowed the Republican Air Force to persistently raid advancing Italian forces , dispersing entire columns off the main roads and forcing them to stall in the mud . A Republican counterattack on 18 March , led by Pavlov 's armored brigade , forced the Italians to withdraw . Nationalist air support failed to provide close air support for Italian troops because runways had become water @-@ logged , while Italian armor proved no match against the heavier and faster T @-@ 26 and BT @-@ 5 tanks . Officially , the Italians lost an estimated 2 @,@ 700 soldiers during the campaigning around Guadalajara ; the Republican Army lost an estimated 4 @,@ 000 . According to other sources , the CTV lost an estimated 5 @,@ 000 casualties during the battle . However , armor losses were relatively low , as the Republicans lost 7 T @-@ 26s and the Italians lost 19 CV @-@ 33s . Despite this initial setback , the Italian government continued the supply of personnel and equipment to the CTV in Spain , and by late 1938 the Italian volunteer 's corps was equipped with three tank battalions . By the end of the war , a total of 155 CV @-@ 33s were delivered to Spain . 
 The Germans delivered a total of 122 Panzer I light tanks to the Spanish Army over the course of the war . The first shipment arrived in October 1936 , consisting of 41 tanks . These tanks would see combat as early as 30 October , around Madrid , when they engaged a column of Republican armored cars , which were able to knock out the German tanks at ranges of 500 meters ( 550 yd ) , with their larger guns . Although the use of armor penetrating ammunition fired from the Panzer I 's 7 @.@ 92 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 312 in ) machine guns could penetrate the armor of the T @-@ 26 at ranges of up to 150 meters ( 160 yd ) , Republican tankers simply began to engage from ranges of up to 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) , using their heavier 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) tank guns . Furthermore , the sights on the T @-@ 26 were calibrated for ranges far longer than those calibrated on German equipment . This disadvantage in firepower led the Nationalist Army to experiment with the adoption of the Italian 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Breda anti @-@ aircraft gun for its fleet of Panzer Is . Firing a 140 @-@ gram ( 4 @.@ 9 oz ) <unk> projectile , this cannon could penetrate up to 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) of steel armor at a range of 250 meters ( 270 yd ) . The installation of the gun required the top of the tank 's turret to be cut off and extended upwards , increasing the vehicle 's profile and decreasing the visibility of the crew . Furthermore , the new gun 's sights were located within an open crease to the front of the new turret extension , forcing the gunner to aim and fire from a relatively unsafe position . Although originally the Nationalists were aiming to equip at least one Panzer I in each platoon of each battalion with the larger gun , only four prototypes were completed . The capture of Republican T @-@ 26s and their return to service with the Nationalist Army made the modification of the Panzer I unnecessary , while later attempts to up @-@ gun the German light tank failed because of the lack of available 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Breda guns . There were also attempts to mount a 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ tank gun and a 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) tank gun , taken from a captured Soviet vehicle , but these failed before any prototypes were completed . 
 The Nationalist 's tank disparity with Republican forces caused Nationalist commanders to offer Spanish soldiers up to 500 pesetas for each captured T @-@ 26 . Due to the number of T @-@ 26s captured and put back into service against their previous masters , the Soviet Union also inadvertently became the largest provider of armored fighting vehicles of the Nationalist Army . An estimated total of 178 T @-@ 26s were captured during the Spanish Civil War , including 98 put back into service , 30 irreparable vehicles used for spare parts , and 50 T @-@ 26s not pressed into service with the Nationalist Army . In May 1939 , France turned over 10 T @-@ 26s , which had been interned after they had retreated across the border , to Nationalist Spain . The number of captured BT @-@ 5s amounted to much less . By May 1938 , the Nationalist tank force had only put into service 4 BT @-@ 5s , as opposed to 39 T @-@ 26s . The first Nationalist tank company outfitted with T @-@ 26s entered combat during the Battle of Brunete , between 18 – 23 July 1937 . Ultimately , the amount of captured equipment caused the Nationalists to organize a recuperation unit , designed to recuperate Soviet armor off the field and repair them so that they could return to combat .

 At the end of the Spanish Civil War , the Spanish Army could count on 144 Panzer Is and CV @-@ 33s , and 139 T @-@ 26s . Panzer Is and CV @-@ 33s were organized as " light tanks " , denominated Type Is , while the T @-@ 26s were considered " medium " tanks and categorized as Type IIs . These were organized into four armored regiments , including the 1st Tank Regiment ( based in Madrid ) , the 2nd Tank Regiment ( in Sevilla ) and the 3rd and 4th Tank Regiments . The 3rd 's organization was based upon that used by Nationalist forces during the Spanish Civil War , while the 4th 's was based on that used by the Italian CTV . In 1941 , a fifth regiment was created in North Africa . 
 = = = Verdeja tank program = = = 
 Between late 1937 and 1938 , Captain Félix Verdeja <unk> began to privately develop the concept for a new light tank . The new tank would take into consideration all the qualities and problems with existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army , including the Panzer I and T @-@ 26 , and combine a number of characteristics which would make it the best light tank in service at the time . His ideal light tank included a 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) tank gun , with 360 @-@ degree traverse and an elevation of 72 degrees . At the same time , the vehicle was to have the lowest possible silhouette , and no less than 15 millimeters ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) of all @-@ around armor , and 30 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) on the front . Furthermore , the armor was to be sloped to maximize its efficiency and chance of an incoming projectile ricocheting . With a maximum velocity of 70 kilometers per hour ( 43 mph ) , the light tank was to be powered by a 120 horsepower ( 89 kW ) engine . Furthermore , the vehicle 's mechanical reliability was to improve upon that of the existing tanks in service with the Nationalist Army . Despite initial obstacles , including opposition to an indigenous Spanish tank program from German General Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma , the first prototype was delivered in late 1938 ; this prototype was built from spare parts taken from a number of different tanks . The prototype performed well in testing and a new prototype was ordered . 
 The new prototype was much closer to what Captain Verdeja had originally planned . The chassis was enlarged , and the engine was moved to the left side of the front compartment of the hull . The volume of the fuel tanks and the thickness of the armor was also increased , while the height of the turret was decreased by sloping the turret 's sides . One of the most unusual — at the time — developments for the tank were the tracks , designed to eliminate the possibility of having them slide off when the tank was moving . The tank had a sprocket to the front of the hull , on each side , and a tensioner to the rear . The tracks were guided by four return rollers and four roadwheels . The tracks had previously been tested on the original prototype ; they were designed to fit around the roadwheel , and consequently lock themselves into place , avoiding the possibility of slipping off . The construction of the prototype was postponed until May 1940 , due to a shortage of funds , and the tank was finally delivered to the proving grounds of Carabanchel for testing . The prototype was denominated the Verdeja 1 , and competed against a T @-@ 26B in a number of different tests . Ultimately , the Verdeja scored a total of 243 points , as compared to 205 scored by the T @-@ 26 . The testing resulted in a number of modifications , including higher suspension to allow climbing over taller obstacles , the increase in armor thickness , increase of the body width and the creation of an empty space at the rear , to allow for the future installation of a communications radio . After two months work , the Verdeja 1 was returned for testing and this time scored a total of 261 @.@ 98 points . Although the success of this prototype persuaded the Spanish government to issue an order for the construction of 1 @,@ 000 tanks , ultimately lack of incentives to develop the relevant industrial infrastructure ; the poor economic situation after the Spanish Civil War and absence of foreign clients , soon caused the production program to collapse . 
 As the Verdeja 1 program dissolved , Captain Verdeja began to design a successor , taking into consideration the lessons learned during the opening campaigns of the Second World War . The new design featured a reorganized engine bay at the rear of the chassis , which meant moving the drive sprocket to the rear as well . The movement of the engine 's location allowed for better cooling of the vehicle 's motor and the fighting compartment , as well as allowing the turret to be moved forward . The vehicle 's armor was also increased substantially . This new tank was not approved for production or further development , due to continued postponement of the production of the Verdeja 1 for reasons which included offers by the German government to supply the Panzer IV 's engine for the Verdeja 1 . Although production of the new vehicle finally began in 1942 , it was not until August 1944 that the Verdeja 2 prototype was delivered . The decision to purchase a number of German armored vehicles delayed the decision to begin production of the Verdeja 2 ; ultimately the vehicle was left untouched until 1950 , when there was a failed attempt to mount a new engine . 
 Beginning in 1945 , the now @-@ Major Verdeja was ordered to begin designing an artillery piece using a rapid @-@ firing 75 millimeter L / 40 howitzer designed by Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval , based on the Verdeja 1 chassis . The chassis ' roof and rear wall were eliminated , and instead a gun shield placed over the front . A mechanical brake was installed next to the idler wheel , stopping rearwards movement of the artillery piece during the firing process . The availability of the required parts and the lack of complicated changes meant that the vehicle was quickly prepared and tested extensively . The fate of the self @-@ propelled piece was much the same as that of the Verdeja 2 , and the vehicle was left untouched at the proving grounds in Carabanchel until 1973 , when it was moved to the Spanish base Alfonso XIII , housing the then Mechanized Infantry Regiment Wad Rass nº 55 . It was soon moved to another base , and finally delivered to the base of El <unk> , outside of Madrid , as a part of an armored vehicles museum . 
 = = = German armor in service with the Spanish Army = = = 
 In 1943 , the Spanish Army and government decided to replace much of its armor , after studying war in Europe and North Africa . Tanks such as the Panzer I and T @-@ 26 were obsolete , as compared to newer tanks such as the Soviet T @-@ 34 and German Panther tank . As a result , on 15 March 1943 Spain began to negotiate with the Wehrmacht over the acquisition of modern materiel . The petition asked for 250 Panzer IIIs and 100 Panzer IVs . In return , the Germans instead offered a sale of 20 Panzer IVs and 10 Sturmgeschütz IIIs . On 29 April , Spain accepted Germany 's offer . The Panzer IVs sold were of the Ausf . H variant , and arrived in Spain on 6 December 1943 . The Panzer IV Ausf . H included the longer 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) tank gun , and the homogeneous 80 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) steel plate on the glacis . 
 As early as January 1944 , Spain again began to negotiate with Germany for more equipment . The new program revolved around the sale of 33 Panzer IVs , three of which would be of the command variant . Another offer was made for 67 more Panzer IVs at a later date ; a result , the two programs together summed up to a potential procurement of 100 Panzer IVs . Spain also suggested the purchase of a number of Tiger tanks , although this offer never amounted to anything serious . Regardless , the program to acquire another 100 Panzer IVs never materialized . The 20 Panzer IVs received in late 1943 were organized into two companies , distributed among two battalions in the armored regiment of the Brunete Armored Division . 
 At the end of World War II , the Spanish Army counted on a tank force composed of 20 Panzer IVs , 10 StuG IIIs , 116 T @-@ 26s , 93 Panzer Is ( including command vehicles ) , 60 CV @-@ 33s and 80 armored cars . In 1949 the armored regiment was reorganized into two battalions of 60 T @-@ 26s , with two command Panzer Is , six combat versions of the Panzer I and two CV @-@ 33 , which were used for reconnaissance , each . A third battalion was composed of the 20 Panzer IVs , plus six Panzer Is . The regiment numbered an estimated 1 @,@ 500 personnel and 100 tanks . 
 = = American military aid : 1954 – 1970 = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1950s , the state of the Spanish Army 's tanks was deteriorating . Spain 's armored force composition remained the same until February 1954 , when the United States delivered the first twelve M47 Patton tanks to the Spanish Army . These were a product of a military aid program the United States had signed with Spain in 1953 . By 1957 , the Spanish Army had received a total of 29 M47 tanks . Over the course of the 1950s , Spain received a total of 389 M47 Patton tanks . Throughout the 1960s , Spain received 65 M48 Patton tanks and 66 <unk> . The M47 and M48 tanks were an important modernization of Spain 's armored firepower . For example , while the T @-@ 26 was armed with a 45 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) cannon , the American tanks were armed with the much more powerful 90 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) tank gun . While a Panzer IV 's ( Ausf . G ) 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 43 tank gun could penetrate 77 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) of steel armor at 1 @,@ 800 meters ( 2 @,@ 000 yd ) ( using the <unk> 39 ) , the M47 ( using the <unk> HEAT warhead ) could penetrate 190 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) from its 90 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) tank gun . Furthermore , the M47 's armor was 110 millimeters ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) thick on the glacis plate , and 178 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 0 in ) thick on the turret front . Spain also received a number of M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks . These were organized into the Villaviciosa Light Armored Cavalry Regiment , while four were also organized into the Alcázar de Toledo Armored Infantry Regiment as reconnaissance tanks . 
 Between 1953 and 1968 , the Spanish Army received a total of 446 medium battle tanks ( M47s and M48s ) , 123 light tanks ( <unk> and <unk> ) , as well as 30 armored recovery vehicles ( the M74 ) . In 1970 , the United States agreed to extend the military aid program by another five years , giving Spain another 66 <unk> tanks and 17 <unk> . 
 The vehicles received were organized based on a reorganization of the Brunete Armored Division in 1965 . This included the General Staff , based at El Pardo , and the <unk> de <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Troop Nucleus ) . The latter was formed by the Villaviciosa Light Armored Cavalry Regiment , the Campaign Artillery Regiment , the 1st Anti @-@ Air Artillery Group , the 1st Engineering Regiment and the <unk> Logistics Group . Also in the division was the XI Mechanized Infantry Brigade , which included the 6th <unk> Motorized Infantry Regiment , the 55th Uad Ras Mechanized Infantry Regiment , the XI Self @-@ Propelled Artillery Group , the XI Engineering Battalion and the XI Logistics Group . Finally , the division also made use of the XII Armored Brigade , which was formed by the 61st Alcázar de Toledo Armored Infantry Regiment , the 31st Asturias Mechanized Infantry Regiment , the XII Self @-@ Propelled Artillery Group , the XII Engineering Battalion and the XII Logistics Group . The majority of the division 's armor was located in the Alcázar de Toledo Armored Infantry Regiment , which contained two regiments of 48 M48s and 54 M47s , respectively .

 = = = Western Sahara crisis and Purchase of French tanks = = = 
 The United States ' ban on the usage of American ordnance supplied as military aid to Spain during the 1957 – 58 <unk> War pushed Spain to look for alternative equipment which could be freely employed in the Spanish Sahara . Throughout the 1960s , the Spanish government had approached the governments of France and West Germany , hoping to procure either the AMX @-@ 30 or the Leopard 1 , respectively . Ultimately , the Germans were unable to sell the Leopard tank on account of the gun system being British ; at the time , the British Labour Party had decided not to sell to the government of Francisco Franco in Spain . As a result , in May 1970 Spain and France agreed to the sale of 19 AMX @-@ 30 main battle tanks . The first six AMX @-@ 30s were delivered in November 1970 , and these were immediately issued to a new armoured company of the Spanish Legion , stationed in Spanish Sahara . All 19 AMX @-@ 30s purchased from France in 1970 were delivered to the Spanish Legion , in the Spanish Sahara . Beginning in 1974 , Spain began to manufacture the AMX @-@ 30 ( now denominated the AMX @-@ 30E ) , with production of the first batch of 180 tanks ending on 25 June 1979 . The second batch , this time of 100 AMX @-@ 30Es , were produced between 1979 and 1983 . This gave the Spanish Army a total of 299 AMX @-@ 30Es . 
 The AMX @-@ 30E was armed with the 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) <unk> F1 tank gun , and was powered by the HS @-@ 110 680 horsepower ( 510 kW ) diesel engine . With a fuel tank of 970 liters ( 210 imp gal ) , the tank had a road range of 600 kilometers ( 370 mi ) and the fuel was , on average , sufficient for 18 hours of travel . The tracks had a life of at least 5 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 3 @,@ 100 mi ) . However , Spain 's new tanks began to suffer a number of mechanical problems , dealing with the reliability of the original engine and transmission . Therefore , the Spanish Army and Santa Bárbara Sistemas ( the vehicle 's manufacturer in Spain ) began to look into a series of modifications to improve the AMX @-@ 30 . By this time , the Spanish Army had already begun upgrading its M47 and M48 Patton tanks to the <unk> and <unk> models , which made them equivalent to the M60 Patton tank in capabilities . 
 = = = Lince Programme ( Lynx ) = = = 
 While the army was studying a possible modernisation of its brand @-@ new AMX @-@ 30E fleet , the Spanish Ministry of Defense had set aside 120 billion pesetas ( 1 @.@ 1 billion dollars ) for a future tank programme and attracted interest from five foreign companies . A bid by Krauss @-@ Maffei 's , known as the Lince , provided the clearest technical designs . The tank would be 49 metric tons ( 54 short tons ) and equipped with a 120 @-@ millimeter main gun . It could fire this gun on the move and aim at targets with effectiveness in day and night operations . Fitted with a 1 @,@ 200 horsepower ( 894 @.@ 84 kW ) engine , the Lince could travel as fast as 70 kilometers per hour ( 43 @.@ 50 mph ) on the roads . Although heavily based on the Leopard 2A4 , the Lince was smaller and lighter , trading protection for mobility . Specifically , the Lince prioritised enhanced mobility over the irregular Spanish terrain . Furthermore , size restrictions were imposed due to the existing capabilities of Spain 's railroad and highway network . Although the reduced armor conflicted with the problems that the Spanish had with AMX @-@ 30E 's thin armour , the Lince used a multi @-@ layer armor similar to that of the German Leopard 2A4 , providing greater protection than standard armour for a similar weight . The protection was further enhanced by the low profile turret , again similar to that of the Leopard 2A4 . Despite the offer and ongoing collaboration with the Italians , Spanish investment in the German @-@ Spanish Lince programme grew up to 200 billion pesetas ( 1 @.@ 8 billion dollars ) . However , the Spanish government did not announce any winner for the contract . This indecision led Krauss @-@ Maffei to freeze their bid for the Lince . Krauss @-@ Maffei also cited the loss of millions of dollars due to failures on part of Santa Bárbara Sistemas , who would manufacture the Lince . In 1987 , the Lince program was pushed aside and postponed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense 's decision to instead go on with the modernisation of the Spanish Army 's AMX @-@ 30E fleet . Ultimately , the purchase of a number of M60 Patton tanks , the modernisation of the AMX @-@ 30E and the continued fiscal problems finally caused the Spanish Ministry of Defense to cancel the Lince programme in 1989 . 
 = = = 1990s modernization = = = 
 Between 1989 and 1993 , 150 AMX @-@ 30Es were modernised to what would become known as the AMX @-@ 30EM2 . The modernisation entailed the introduction of a new armour piercing discarding sabot round , the modification of the turret hatch to allow the installation of a larger anti @-@ aircraft machine gun , and a brand new fire control system . Besides these modernisations of the tank 's firepower , the mobility of the tank was improved through the exchange of the old engine and transmission for the more reliable MTU 833 Ka @-@ 501 diesel engine , producing 850 horsepower ( 630 kW ) , coupled with the German German ZF LSG @-@ 3000 . A new smoke machine , linked to the tank 's new engine , was also installed . The other 149 AMX @-@ 30Es went through a less expensive and extensive modification , known as the AMX @-@ 30EM1 . These received the American Allison CD @-@ 850 @-@ 6A three speed transmission ( two forward and one reverse ) ; however , the new transmission caused extensive overheating in the engine compartment . These 149 AMX @-@ 30EM1s would eventually be replaced by US surplus M60A3 Patton tanks , purchased from the United States , in the early 1990s . 
 = = Modern Spanish armor : 1992 – present = = 
 In the early 1990s , the Spanish Army received 244 M60 tanks to replace its aging fleet of <unk> and <unk> , and its troublesome AMX @-@ 30EM1s . However , these did not represent a great improvement over the existing fleet , and as a result as early as 1994 the Spanish government had already begun to negotiate for a future Spanish tank , which would replace the M60 . Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German Army after the reunification of Germany , the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for the Leopard 2 . In March 1994 , the Spanish Ministry of Defense created Programa Coraza 2000 ( Programme Armour 2000 ) , which focused on the procurement and integration of new armament for the Spanish Army 's modernisation . The program included the procurement and integration of a Spanish derivative of the German Leopard 2 , known as the Leopard 2E into the Spanish Army . The programme 's scope extended to the integration of 108 Leopard 2A4s , which were leased to Spain in late 1995 . Apart from procurement , Programa Coraza was meant to prepare the Spanish Army logistically for the introduction of new matériel . 
 A memorandum of understanding was signed on 9 June 1995 between the German and Spanish governments , setting the foundations for an acquisition of up to 308 brand @-@ new Leopard 2Es . These were to be assembled in Spain by Santa Bárbara Sistemas , with 60 – 70 percent of the components manufactured by Spanish companies , and production taking place between 1998 and 2003 . Furthermore , the German government agreed to lend the Spanish Army 108 Leopard 2A4s for training purposes for a period of five years . These vehicles were delivered between November 1995 and June 1996 . In 1998 , Spain agreed to procure the ceded Leopard 2A4s and reduce production of the brand @-@ new Leopard 2E to 219 vehicles . In 2005 it was declared that the 108 Leopard 2A4s were to cost Spain 16 @.@ 9 million euros , to be paid by 2016 . The Leopard 2Es , based on the German Leopard 2A6 , were produced between 2003 and 2008 . 
 While the M60s were replaced by the Leopard 2s , the AMX @-@ 30EM2s were replaced by the Italian B1 Centauro anti @-@ tank vehicle in the early years of the 2000s ( decade ) . 
 = Coeur Alaska , Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council = 
 Coeur Alaska , Inc. v. Southeast Alaska Conservation Council , 557 U.S. 261 ( 2009 ) , is a United States Supreme Court case that was decided in favor of Coeur Alaska 's permit to dump mine waste in a lake . The case addressed tailings from the Kensington mine , an underground mine located in Alaska . The gold mine had not operated since 1928 , and Coeur Alaska obtained a permit in 2005 from the United States Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) to dispose of up to 4 @.@ 5 million tons of tailings in Lower Slate Lake , which is located in a National Forest . 
 The suit was filed by three environmental non @-@ governmental organizations and brought before the United States District Court for the District of Alaska who found in favor of Coeur Alaska . The District Court 's decision was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals before being brought before the Supreme Court , who also found in favor of Coeur Alaska . 
 The ruling was praised by the National Mining Association for the economic benefit it provided . Environmental groups criticised the decision for the impact it would have on Lower Slate Lake , and the opportunity for its use as a precedent in the future . In March 2009 proposed legislation , the Clean Water Protection Act , was introduced in Congress to remove mining waste from the definition of " fill material . " 
 = = Background = = 
 In 2005 Coeur Alaska Inc . , a subsidiary of Coeur d 'Alene Mines , successfully applied for a tailings disposal permit from the USACE . The permit allowed Coeur Alaska to dispose of 4 @.@ 5 million tons of tailings from the Kensington gold mine , 45 mi ( 72 km ) north of Juneau , into Lower Slate Lake . The mine operated in the early 20th century , but had been inactive since 1928 . The lake is 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the mine , within the Tongass National Forest . 
 The discharge of material into waters of the United States is regulated under the Clean Water Act by either the USACE or the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , depending on what the material is . Discharge of " fill material " falls under the jurisdiction of the USACE ; discharge of other pollutants falls under the jurisdiction of the EPA . In 2005 Coeur was granted a permit to dispose of tailings into Lower Slate Lake by the USACE under section 404 of the Clean Water Act . The decision was based on the definition of " fill material " which had been revised in 2002 under the administration of George W. Bush . This new definition allowed some contaminants to be included in mine waste and still be classified as fill . The permit allowed Coeur to dump 4 @.@ 5 million tons of a combination of waste rock and tailings into Lower Slate Lake over a period of ten years , causing the floor elevation of the lake to rise by 50 ft ( 15 m ) . 
 After the USACE issued the permit , the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council , the Sierra Club , and Lynn Canal Conservation Inc. filed suit . The suit claimed that the permit was issued in violation of sections 301 ( a ) , 301 ( e ) , and 306 ( e ) of the Clean Water Act . The United States District Court for the District of Alaska found that the USACE was correct in its application of section 404 of the act , because the permit was for " fill material " , and therefore not covered under or in violation of sections 301 ( e ) and 306 ( e ) . 
 In May 2007 the District Court 's 2006 decision was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . The Circuit Court found in favor of the non @-@ governmental organizations , ruling that discharge of tailings was not permitted under the EPA 's New Source Performance Standard . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 The Supreme Court found in favor of Coeur Alaska by a vote of 6 @-@ 3 , agreeing that the USACE is indeed the appropriate body to issue a permit to discharge mine waste into Lower Slate Lake . In her dissent , Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated that currently discharging pollutants into a lake is permitted provided there is enough material to raise the lake 's floor elevation , thereby turning it into a waste disposal site . Ginsburg voiced concern about the potential for pollution regulation to not apply to several industries ( mining included ) on the basis of this loophole . 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 The decision was praised by the National Mining Association , which stated that it would " provide employment and greater economic certainty for all those involved in the project " . Alaska Governor Sarah Palin also welcomed the ruling , calling it a " green light for responsible resource development " . The environmental groups that originally filed suit against Coeur Alaska were unhappy with the decision . Environmental groups stated that the proposed material includes aluminum , lead , and mercury ( among other metals ) , and that discharging into Lower Slate Lake will have a detrimental effect on the lake and surrounding waters . A representative from <unk> warned of the ruling being used as a precedent , allowing other companies to discharge pollutants into other rivers and lakes . Following the court 's decision share prices of Coeur d 'Alene Mines rose over 5 % . 
 In March 2009 a bill , the Clean Water Protection Act , was introduced in Congress by Frank <unk> and Dave Reichert . The Clean Water Protection Act would have changed the definition of " fill material " in the Clean Water Act . Under the new definition " fill material " would have excluded mine waste . 
 = Loves of a Blonde = 
 Loves of a Blonde ( Czech : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a 1965 Czechoslovakian feature film directed by Miloš Forman . It is also known under the alternate title of A Blonde in Love . 
 The fiction film tells the story of a young woman who has a routine job in a shoe factory in provincial Czechoslovakia . When the army holds maneuvers near her home town , the factory supervisor organizes a mixer for the largely female workforce and the all @-@ male soldiers . This dance proves a mixed success , with many of the soldiers , who are middle @-@ aged reservists , and many of the factory workers , who are inexperienced young women with idealized views of romance , being confused by and disappointed with their potential dancing partners . The film 's protagonist , though , does meet an attractive young man who plays in the dance band and has a one @-@ night fling with him . When she travels to the capital city where he lives in order to resume their romance , she meets his parents and comes to the realization that there is no future in this relationship . 
 Forman based his story on a real @-@ world incident from his past and the filmmakers focused much of their attention on trying to create a real @-@ life look and feel by filming on location in a small Czech town with a shoe factory of its own , utilizing a largely non @-@ professional cast , relying on a considerable amount of dialogue improvisation , and employing documentary @-@ style cinematographic techniques . 
 Upon its release , Loves of a Blonde was a popular success in its home country and was shown at some major film festivals , where it was well @-@ received , garnering a number of nominations and awards . Critical response was largely positive , although some reviewers were less enthusiastic than others . The film is now considered one of the most significant examples of a film movement called the Czech New Wave , which took advantage of a temporary relaxation of totalitarian control over creative artists to use cinema as a means to explore new narrative strategies while making pointed critiques of social and political conditions behind the iron curtain . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Andula is a working @-@ class young woman living in a fading Czech factory town , where , due to an oversight in central state planning , women outnumber men 16 @-@ 1 . The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe @-@ factory @-@ worker friend as they lie in bed in their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger , which is shown in flashback . 
 The factory supervisor belatedly realizes that the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity , so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town in order for the factory to sponsor a big dance , at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery . “ They need what we needed when we were young , ” he explains to a sympathetic officer . Anticipation runs high on both sides , with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams , while the recruits , many of whom are actually middle @-@ aged reservists , out @-@ of @-@ shape and already married , look forward to a night of revelry and seduction . The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups ; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers , whom they call " old buffers " , and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas , like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide , only to watch it roll across the floor and land at the feet of the young women who are the objects of their lust . For these people , the mixer is a huge flop , with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses ( one points out that " you can only get it [ sex ] free at home " ) and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ( " Imagine , in this weather ! " ) . For others , however , the dance is a success : the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor , one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance , while an obese , balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall , thin brunette , both clearly having the time of their lives . 
 Andula strikes up a flirtation with Milda , the big @-@ city pianist of the band providing the music . He reads her palm and instructs her in how to rebuff unwanted advances with a kick in the shins . After the party she goes to bed with Milda , although the comic frustrations continue , with Milda fighting a battle with a window shade that won 't close , before he feels secure in making love . Afterward , as they lie in bed together , Andula asks what Milda meant when he said she was " angular " . He replies that a woman is shaped like a guitar : " And you , you look like a guitar too , " he tells her , " but one painted by Picasso . " Before they part , he offhandedly invites her to come to Prague and pay him a visit sometime . 
 Although she hears nothing from Milda after their night together , she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly , so she breaks off with Tonda , who storms the dormitory demanding his ring back . After listening to a speech by the <unk> on the virtues of fidelity and commitment , she packs up her suitcase and arrives on <unk> 's doorstep in the big city , ready to resume their romance . Milda is not home , and she meets his parents , who have never heard of her and don 't know what they should do with her . Milda comes home very late , and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty , his parents decide it 's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa , requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety . Forman has described this famous scene : " It ’ s a tight fit . The old man wants to sleep ; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch , but the mother runs the show and won ’ t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof . “ Andula , kneeling outside the door of their bedroom , overhears the family squabbling , and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least , she breaks down in tears and , the next morning , returns to her home . She tells her friends about her " wonderful " trip to the capital and how nice Milda 's parents were to her , especially his father , and then she returns to work at the factory .

 Miloš Forman 's first feature film <unk> Petr ( Black Peter ) was released in 1964 and was not viewed favorably by Czech governmental authorities until it was selected for competition at that year 's Locarno Film Festival , where it won the top prize , thereby gaining the approval of Czechoslovakia 's communist bureaucracy and making it possible for Forman to pursue further projects with relative freedom . Unsure of what the next project should be , Forman recalled an experience he 'd had driving around Prague late one evening when he 'd encountered a young woman struggling to cross a bridge while carrying a heavy suitcase . He gave her a lift and learned her story : she had come to the big city from <unk> , where she had been seduced by a young engineer , who had given her a phony address in Žižkov and promised to take her away from her dreary life . After confirming that she had been duped , Forman interviewed the girl for much of the rest of the night , before putting her on a train back to her home town . Commentators have noted that Forman was particularly sensitized to such situations because when he was 10 , his mother had been taken away by the Gestapo , never to be seen again , which led to years of Forman traveling around searching for security with nothing but a suitcase . In Forman 's words : " I guess I 'll always be moved by the sight of a young person with a suitcase seeking a connection in a strange city " . 
 Forman recounted this memory to fellow film enthusiasts and colleagues Ivan Passer and Jaroslav <unk> and asked them if it might be the basis for a good film . " Maybe , " replied Passer , " but it still needs one more thing -- a billiards table " . The trio had a passion for billiards and felt that they could make a success of even the weakest idea if they had ready access to a pool table . Having found a good one at <unk> Castle , the three , along with Václav <unk> , wrote a screenplay that fleshed out Forman 's encounter with the young woman from <unk> . 
 When the finished script was submitted to the <unk> @-@ Bor production company , it was approved at first , only to have the chief of the script department pronounce it the dullest thing he 'd read in years and urge Forman not to proceed with the project , since it would spoil the good reputation the director had established with Black Peter . In Forman 's words : " It wasn 't arty enough , but , on the other hand , it didn 't have enough commercial appeal either . It would offend and irritate the public , he told me , because it made fun of the common man , who would be disgusted by it " . Despite this objection , Vlastimil <unk> , the head of the studio , approved proceeding with the film in part because , due to the political and cultural thaw in Czechoslovakia at the time , decision makers were anxious to avoid the appearance of overt administrative interference in the creative process . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Forman and his colleagues were committed to the strategy of casting non @-@ professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible . Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives , friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew , to the point where Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a " home movie " . For the title role , Forman selected his 18 @-@ year @-@ old ex @-@ sister @-@ in @-@ law , Hana Brejchová , not because , as was rumored at the time , he wanted revenge on his ex @-@ wife , movie @-@ star Jana Brejchová , but because he had known Hana a long time , trusted her , and had great respect for her natural talents : " She had an amazing ability of free expression , but with the risk that she didn ’ t recognize the extent . However , Vlada Pucholt [ who played Milda ] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene , in a professional position . ” The character of Milda 's father was played by the uncle of Forman 's cameraman , and Milda 's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and <unk> had met on a streetcar , and who struck them as someone who " seemed so interested in things around her , no matter how silly " . The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou , where location shooting took place . For the main trio of reservists , Forman wanted to use non @-@ professionals , including the writer Josef Škvorecký , but found that , while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs , they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot . So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir <unk> . In Škvorecký 's words : " To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen @-@ play writing . Milos is a very considerate person . The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde " . Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional : " While <unk> keep the actors honest and real , the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the <unk> don 't feel . A <unk> inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn 't able to view it from the outside , to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose . <unk> are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on , so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation . " . 
 Ironically , the least self @-@ confident performer in the film was one of the few professional actors : Vladimir Pucholt , who played the pianist . According to Forman : " This great actor , who had tremendous artistic intuition , completely mistrusted his talent . I think this was because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see , much less measure , the result of his acting . ' Was it good , Mr. Forman ? ” he asked me after every perfect shot . ' It was excellent ! ' ' Really ? ' ' Really . ' He never believed me and all of us loved him . ” 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Since he was working with a largely non @-@ professional cast , Forman 's operating procedure was never to share the script with any of the performers , because if he had given them the screenplay , " they ’ ll take it home to read , and their wives will end up directing your movie " . Instead , he chose to explain each scene in great detail just before starting to shoot takes , reciting the dialog from memory only one time , so that when the camera was rolling the actors had to try to remember as much as they could of what he had told them and then improvise to the best of their ability what they had forgotten or only half @-@ understood . His cameraman was later to say that , as a result , all the performers were playing Miloš Forman playing their roles . 
 The cinematographer for Loves of a Blonde was Miroslav Ondříček , like Forman a graduate of the national Czech film school . Ondříček and Forman had met at Czechoslovakia 's Barrandov Studios in the early 1960s when Ondříček was just learning to shoot feature films and Forman was struggling to create his own early projects . Ondříček was in full accord with Forman 's reliance on non @-@ professional actors , adopting a cinéma @-@ vérité style compatible with orthodox socialist realism . Ondříček was schooled in documentary filmmaking and , as a result , he insisted on performing all photographic tasks , like focus , lighting and composing , <unk> while refusing access to the set by all film editors , saying : " The editor can only edit what I am filming . He can 't use a master shot if he doesn 't have it . He can 't make a close @-@ up if he doesn 't have it . This is our [ his and Forman 's ] job . " Critics have often admired Ondříček 's success in sustaining low @-@ contrast lighting throughout the film , rendering " a sweetly mysterious softness , as if a principle of compassion existed in the world alongside its cruelty " . 
 The big dance was the film 's most sustained and elaborate sequence , so two cameras were used , with frequent recourse to hand @-@ holding and telephoto zooming in order both to sustain the documentary @-@ style look and feel and to take pressure off the performers , who were not always sure whether they were being included in the shots . 
 During filming , the set was visited by British director Lindsay Anderson , whose film This Sporting Life was greatly admired by Forman . Anderson was so impressed by Ondříček 's work , that he brought the cameraman to England to film The White Bus and if .... , announcing that he had found a person with a new sensibility , “ a new pair of eyes ” . 
 Ironically , the storyline of the film was replayed in real life . One of the nonprofessional actresses , a blonde factory worker , had a torrid affair with a technician who was part of the film crew . Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child , he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city . After waiting for a long time to hear from him , and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest , she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague , only to be spurned in no uncertain terms . The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film ; the girl was embarrassed to return home , became a prostitute , went to jail , attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia , where there was a shortage of women , especially among Czech emigres . 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 Once principal photography was finished , Forman found himself with miles of raw material , so he and his editor , Miroslav <unk> , spent many long hours organizing the footage into a series of situations , like the " big dance " situation and the " meeting the parents " situation . In turn , each of these situations are constructed out of sequences of gags in which the characters improvise , in the words of commentator Constantin <unk> , " like various instruments of a band " : " Many of these situations can be broken down into gags . There are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in Loves of a Blonde : the soldiers @-@ getting @-@ off @-@ the @-@ train gag ; the wine @-@ bottle gag ; the wedding @-@ ring gag ; the palm @-@ reading gag ; the roll @-@ up @-@ blinds gag ; and the three @-@ guys @-@ in @-@ two @-@ beds gag . " Interspersed with these gags are extended character improvisations , such as Milda 's discussion of Picasso , his mother 's rants at the dining table , and the factory supervisor 's appeal for the army 's support . 
 = = = Additional scenes = = = 
 Once the film had been released in Czechoslovakia , Forman sought an international distributor , who informed him that the film was too short for American audiences and that it didn 't have enough nudity in it ; so Forman was coerced into shooting some additional scenes that were never shown for domestic consumption . One of these scenes , which was included in the US version , involved a slapstick sequence in which Milda , the pianist , tries to pick up a buxom girl on the streets of Prague , only to have her trick him into entering the wrong bedroom of the four @-@ story building in which she lives , disturbing the sleeping residents . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Film scholar Peter Hames has summarized three themes of Loves of a Blonde that have been discussed repeatedly in critical writings on the film , themes that have been something of a constant throughout Forman 's career : " the impermanence of young love , the confusion and despair of middle age , and the gulf between the generations " . Another theme that is often identified involves the awkwardness and confusion surrounding sex in a repressed society . Most critics have also commented on the confluence of comedy and sadness in the film 's depiction of everyday life in a totalitarian state , although while some consider Loves of a Blonde Forman 's most pointed critique of Czech society under communism , others point out that the grim conditions are not solely due to misguided public policy , but that individuals create their own isolation as well . 
 = = Reception = = 
 When Loves of a Blonde was first released , there was a sense of betrayal on the part of the Zruč nad Sázavou shoe factory that had hosted the filmmakers on location and considerable consternation among authorities at the Ministry of Light Industry , with both organizations feeling that the comically unlovely depiction of social conditions in Czech factory towns would make it even harder to recruit workers than it already was . To everyone 's surprise , though , the movie functioned as a " great big classified ad " , in that hundreds of Czech boys traveled to Zruč nad Sázavou and camped out in the woods in hopes of hooking up with the female factory workers , who responded appropriately by sneaking out of their dorms at night for assignations with the campers . 
 Loves of a Blonde sold out in theaters throughout Czechoslovakia , and its extraordinary success has been attributed , at least in part , to its being one of the first eastern European films to include an extended sex scene that involved nude performers . The film was the recipient of the Order of Klement Gottwald , an award that recognized exemplary works " for building of socialist homeland " . Forman was later to say : " The award from the first communist president of the land and a legendary boozer was more of an embarrassment than anything else . The only good thing about it was the fat envelope that came with the ribbon . It contained 20 000 CZK ( 800 EUR ) , nearly a year ’ s salary " . 
 Loves of a Blonde was submitted to a number of the major film festivals of the day : it was the opening film of the 1966 New York Film Festival , was an invited entry in that year 's London Film Festival and was nominated for the highest prize at the Venice Film Festival . Shortly after it was completed , it was purchased by a Czech distribution company called <unk> , only to be re @-@ sold as part of a multi @-@ picture package to a firm called <unk> , which proceeded to air it on television through a number of 24 @-@ hour movie channels . 
 The film was nominated for the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1967 . It was ranked # 89 in Empire magazine 's " The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema " in 2010 . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critical reaction within Czechoslovakia tended to focus on the film 's perceived negativity with regards to social and political conditions in the country , and , for that reason , it was not distributed at all within the Soviet Union . 
 On the whole , international critics of the time praised Loves of a Blonde , with positive reviews published by Saturday Review , The New Yorker , America , Sight and Sound , Harper 's , and the New York Times . One of the film 's most influential champions was Jean Collet , writing in Cahiers du cinéma that , by capturing the momentary indiscretions of his characters on the screen , Forman forces the audience into a voyeuristic situation that induces embarrassment and laughter . There were dissenting voices , however : Phillip J. Hartung , writing in Commonweal , compared the film unfavorably with Ivan Passer 's contemporaneous Intimate Lighting , while Robert Hatch , in The Nation , felt that Loves of a Blonde was an " endearing but artless " film , with its long central section of the big dance having little to do with the main plot . In a lengthy article in Film Comment , Kirk Bond compared the " ordinariness " of Loves of a Blonde unfavorably with other Czech films of the period that he believed displayed greater mastery of narrative technique . 
 More recent retrospective reviews of the film have been equally mixed , with some critics , like Dennis Schwartz , writing that , " its simple but meaningful story has captured the emotions of its subject in a timeless and real fashion " , while others , like David Nusair , find fault : " Presumably , the film 's supposed to be a quirky and revealing slice of life - but since the central character is never developed beyond the superficial , it 's impossible to care about her " . 
 It holds a 93 % rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 15 reviewers who , on average , scored it 8 @.@ 1 on a scale of 10 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Loves of a Blonde has often been identified as one of the most significant and ambitious productions of the Czech New Wave , a movement in which a group of young filmmakers , many of whom were educated by the national film academy in Prague , including Forman , Ján <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Jiří Menzel , among others , took significant political risks by using cinema to protest the hypocrisy and absurdity of the Communist state . This movement has been attributed to a period of cultural and political reform , starting in 1962 , during which filmmakers were given state support but were also allowed a certain amount of relative artistic freedom , enabling them to create movies with the stated objective of making " the Czech people collectively aware that they were participants in a system of oppression and incompetence which had brutalized them all . " 
 In particular , Forman , Ivan Passer and Jaroslav <unk> have collectively become known as the " Forman school " of filmmaking , which combines an interest in documentary realism , including consistent focus on the quotidian , with a surrealistic tendency to " uncover the hidden side of reality , its comical or monstrous quality which lies just beneath everyday mishaps , stutters and <unk> " . Diane <unk> has noted that , once Forman came to America and created his high @-@ profile Hollywood productions , such as One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , Hair and Amadeus , he was able to introduce into commercial cinema the same qualities that characterized his early films like Loves of a Blonde : " An acute observation of the ironic details of mundane life ; an intimate understanding of emotions , both projected and silenced ; a keen sensitivity to the moment when solemnity melts into farce , " 
 English director Ken Loach has stated that the mixture of professional and non @-@ professional actors in Loves of a Blonde had a significant influence on him and other international filmmakers , by creating an atmosphere in which non @-@ professionals who live in the milieu depicted by the film bring an expertise and authenticity which serves as " a touchstone for everyone else in the film " , while professionals bring knowledge of film craft , which can be helpful to their inexperienced colleagues . Although some performers who , at the time , were not professional later became so , one of the professional actors , Vladimír Pucholt , who played a major role , Milda the pianist , soon gave up acting , relocated to Canada and became a dentist .

 = Mahan @-@ class destroyer = 
 The Mahan @-@ class destroyers of the United States Navy were a series of 18 destroyers of which the first 16 were laid down in 1934 . The last two of the 18 , Dunlap and Fanning ( this pair laid down in 1935 ) , are sometimes considered as a separate ship class . All 18 were commissioned in 1936 and 1937 . Mahan was the lead ship , named for Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan , an influential historian and theorist on sea power . 
 The Mahans featured improvements over previous destroyers , with 12 torpedo tubes , superimposed gun shelters , and generators for emergency use . Standard displacement increased from 1 @,@ 365 tons to 1 @,@ 500 tons . The class introduced a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine , proving simpler and more efficient than the Mahans ' predecessors — so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers . 
 All 18 ships saw action in World War II , entirely in the Pacific Theater , including during the Guadalcanal Campaign , and the battles of the Santa Cruz Islands , Leyte Gulf , and Iwo Jima . Their participation in major and secondary campaigns included the bombardment of beachheads , amphibious landings , task force screening , convoy and patrol duty , and anti @-@ aircraft and submarine warfare . Six ships were lost in combat and two were expended in the postwar Operation Crossroads nuclear tests . The remainder were decommissioned , sold , or scrapped after the war ; none remain today . Collectively , the ships received 111 battle stars for their World War II service . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Mahan @-@ class destroyers emerged as improved versions of the Farragut class , incorporating the most up @-@ to @-@ date machinery available . The Navy 's General Board had been wrestling with proposed design changes , first considering 12 torpedo tubes with one fewer 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 caliber gun , and then proposing to retain all five guns with the twelve torpedo tubes , but configuring those guns only for surface targets , not air targets . The Chief of Naval Operations objected , recommending against " subordinating the gun to the torpedo " , and a compromise was struck that included a new engineering plant and a new battery arrangement for the Mahan class and others . In the final design , No. 3 gun was moved to the aft deckhouse ( just ahead of No. 4 ) to make room for the third quadruple torpedo tube ; the two middle torpedo tubes were moved to the sides , releasing the centerline space for extension of the aft deckhouse . All five 5 in / 38s were kept and remained dual purpose guns , able to target aircraft as well as ships , but only No. 1 and No. 2 had gun shields . The traditional destroyer machinery was replaced with a new generation of land @-@ based machinery . This change ushered in a new steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight steam turbine , which proved simpler and more efficient to operate . Double reduction gearing also reduced the size of the faster @-@ turning turbines and allowed cruising turbines to be added . These changes led to a ten percent increase in displacement over the Farraguts . 
 The Mahans typically had a tripod foremast with a pole mainmast . To improve the anti @-@ aircraft field of fire , their tripod foremast was constructed without nautical rigging . In silhouette , they were similar to the larger Porter @-@ class destroyers that immediately preceded them . The Mahans were fitted with the first emergency generators , replacing the storage batteries of earlier classes . Gun crew shelters were built for the superimposed weapons , one shelter before the bridge and one atop the shelter deck aft . 
 The Mahans displaced 1 @,@ 500 long tons ( 1 @,@ 524 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 725 long tons ( 1 @,@ 753 t ) at deep load . The overall length of the class was 341 feet 3 inches ( 104 @.@ 0 m ) , the beam was 35 feet 6 inches ( 10 @.@ 8 m ) , and the draft 10 feet 7 inches ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) . They were powered by General Electric geared steam turbines , driving two shafts that developed a total of 46 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 34 @,@ 000 kW ) for a maximum speed of 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . Four Babcock & Wilcox or four Foster Wheeler water @-@ tube boilers generated the superheated steam needed for the turbines . The Mahans carried a maximum of 523 long tons ( 531 t ) of fuel oil , with a range of 6 @,@ 940 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 850 km ; 7 @,@ 990 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Their peacetime complement was 158 officers and enlisted men . The wartime complement increased to approximately 250 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = = Engineering = = = 
 The Mahans ' propulsion plant was considerably improved over that of the Farraguts . Steam pressure was raised from 400 psi ( 2 @,@ 800 kPa ) to 465 psi ( 3 @,@ 210 kPa ) in some ships , and superheated steam temperature was raised from 648 ° F ( 342 ° C ) to 700 ° F ( 371 ° C ) in all ships . Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing , allowing smaller , faster @-@ turning turbines to be used ; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted , which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds . Boiler economizers , as in previous ships , further improved fuel economy . The ships ' range was extended to 6 @,@ 940 nmi ( 12 @,@ 850 km ; 7 @,@ 990 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , 1 @,@ 000 nmi ( 1 @,@ 900 km ; 1 @,@ 200 mi ) farther than the Farraguts . Design shaft horsepower was increased from 42 @,@ 800 shp ( 31 @,@ 900 kW ) to 48 @,@ 000 shp ( 36 @,@ 000 kW ) in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts . The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans ' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement . The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse @-@ type , also called Curtis turbines . Each main turbine was divided into a high @-@ pressure ( HP ) and a low @-@ pressure ( LP ) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft , in a similar manner to the machinery illustrated at the following reference . Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine , which exhausted to the LP turbine , which exhausted to a condenser . The cruising turbines were geared to the HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed ; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement , thus improving fuel economy . This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam @-@ powered surface ships of the US Navy , although not all of these had cruising turbines . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main battery of the Mahan class consisted of five dual purpose 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 caliber guns , equipped with the Mark 33 gun fire @-@ control system . The anti @-@ aircraft battery had four water @-@ cooled .50 caliber machine guns ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) . The class was fitted with three quadruple torpedo tube mounts for twelve 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes , guided by the Mark 27 torpedo fire control system . The class was initially equipped with the Mark 11 torpedo or Mark 12 torpedo , which were replaced by the Mark 15 torpedo beginning in 1938 . Depth charge roll @-@ off racks were rigged on the stern . 
 In early 1942 , the Mahan @-@ class destroyers began a wartime armament refitting process , but most of the class was not fully refitted until 1944 . The notable refits to the Mahan class included the removal of one 5 @-@ inch / 38 gun , typically replaced with two twin Bofors 40 mm guns ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) and between four and six 20 mm Oerlikon ( 0 @.@ 9 in ) guns to increase the ships ' light anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament . 
 In January 1945 , removal of two quadruple torpedo tubes was authorized to permit substitution of two 40 mm quad mounts . In June , removal of the third centerline tube was authorized to make way for two 40 mm twin mounts abreast of the aft stack . All ships receiving these AA modifications were to have directors installed with their new 40 mm mounts ; these Mark 51s were to be replaced by new blind @-@ firing <unk> Mark 63 installations with radar . 
 = = Dunlap class = = 
 The Dunlap class was a two @-@ ship destroyer class based on the Mahan design , listed as a separate class in some sources . The ships were USS Dunlap ( DD @-@ 384 ) and USS Fanning ( DD @-@ 385 ) , the last two Mahans . Unlike the Mahans , the <unk> had the new Mark 25 enclosed mounts for the two forward 5 @-@ inch / 38 caliber guns , with base rings housing projectile hoists that rotated with each of the guns ; their ammunition was fed from a handling room below each mount . Dunlap and Fanning were the first US destroyers to use enclosed forward gun mounts rather than shields ; their light pole foremast and lack of a mainmast visibly distinguished them from the Mahans . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The building of the first sixteen vessels was all authorised under the NIRA Executive Order on 16 June 1933 ; the last two were authorised under the Vinson @-@ Trammell Act on 27 March 1934 ( as part of a batch of 95 destroyers authorised on that date - covering DD @-@ 380 to DD @-@ 436 and DD @-@ 445 to DD @-@ 482 ) . Contracts for the first six Mahans were awarded to three shipbuilders , but none of the builders had what the US Navy judged as an acceptable in @-@ house design structure . On the strength of their reputation , the New York firm of Gibbs & Cox was named as the design agent . The firm had no experience in the design of warships , but had successfully designed passenger @-@ cargo liners with better propulsion systems than any available to the US Navy . The decision was made to design the Mahan class and future classes around a new generation of machinery , including a cheaper , faster and more efficient propulsion system that combined increases in steam pressure and temperature with a new type of lightweight , fast @-@ running turbine and double reduction gears .

 USS Mahan was commissioned on the east coast in September 1936 and served in the Atlantic area until July 1937 . She sailed to the Southern California coast for fleet training before moving on to Pearl Harbor . At sea when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , Mahan participated in the initial post @-@ attack efforts in search of the strike force . The ship joined Task Force 17 in February 1942 , which conducted raids on several atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands . Late in March , she returned to Pearl Harbor and proceeded to the west coast for overhaul . By August 1942 , Mahan was back operating out of Pearl Harbor . 
 In October 1942 , Mahan was assigned to Task Force 61 and took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands .

 USS Fanning was occupied with sea trials and minor repairs for the first six months of her naval service . In April 1938 , she escorted the light cruiser Philadelphia from Annapolis , Maryland , to the Caribbean with Roosevelt aboard . Fanning sailed to New York for overhaul the following month ; in September she moved on to her new base in San Diego , California . Over the next three years , her duties took her to the east coast and eventually to Hawaii . The ship was at sea when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor ; she returned the following day . Underway for Tutuila in January 1942 , Fanning encountered a blinding rainstorm and collided with Gridley . Both destroyers suffered bow damage and were forced to return to Pearl Harbor . In April 1942 Fanning became part of Task Force 16 , which supported the Doolittle Raid on the air strike against Tokyo . After the mission , she returned to Pearl Harbor . 
 For the first nine months of 1943 , Fanning deployed against the Japanese on Guadalcanal , supported an occupation force on the Russell Islands , participated in patrol duty , and assisted in the protection of troops occupying Munda , Solomon Islands . In September , she had an overhaul on the west coast , then finished the year operating off the Aleutian Islands . By January 1944 , Fanning was operating with Task Group 58 @.@ 4 in the Marshall Islands . In March she reported to the Eastern Fleet ( British units , reinforced with Australian , Dutch and French warships ) , participating in strikes against Sabang , Indonesia , the next month . Detached from the Eastern Fleet in May , Fanning sailed to the west coast . In July she left San Diego , escorting the heavy cruiser Baltimore to Alaska with Roosevelt on board . Her next assignment was with Task Group 30 @.@ 2 , shelling Marcus Island in October 1944 to create a diversion and destroy enemy installations . During January 1945 , Fanning took part in the shelling of Iwo Jima , Haha @-@ jima , and Chichi @-@ Jima . For the remainder of the war , she was occupied with patrol and escort activities . In September 1945 , she sailed for the United States , and was decommissioned at Norfolk , Virginia , in December 1945 ; she was sold for scrap in 1948 . Fanning received four battle stars for her World War II service . 
 = Kaycee Nicole = 
 Kaycee Nicole , aka Kaycee Nicole Swenson , was a fictitious persona played by an American woman named Debbie Swenson ( born Deborah Marie Dickman 1960 ) , in an early case of Münchausen by Internet . Between 1999 and when the hoax was discovered in 2001 , Swenson , playing the role of Kaycee , represented herself on numerous websites as a teenager suffering from terminal leukemia . Kaycee was reported to have died on May 14 , 2001 and her death was publicized on May 16 ; shortly thereafter , members of the online communities that had supported her unraveled the story and discovered that Kaycee had never actually existed . Debbie Swenson confessed on her blog to the hoax on May 20 , 2001 . 
 = = Creation = = 
 In 1998 , Debbie Swenson 's real daughter , Kelli Burke ( born Kelli Jo Swenson 1985 ) , who was in middle school at the time in <unk> , Oklahoma , created the online persona of " Kaycee Nicole " with a group of her friends . The group created a webpage for the nonexistent girl and used photos of a high school basketball player from their town to represent her , but do not seem to have played the role of Kaycee beyond that or given her an active persona . That came when Debbie Swenson discovered what the girls had done and , rather than forcibly discontinue the hoax , she adopted the persona and began playing the role of Kaycee . In August 1999 , the Swenson family moved from Oklahoma to Kansas . 
 = = Persona = = 
 After it came into Debbie Swenson 's possession , the Kaycee Nicole persona appeared on <unk> in 1999 , as a " sunny blonde " teenaged basketball star in Kansas who shared thoughts and photos with others on the website . She made friends easily with both users and staff at the site , even volunteering to help with administrative work and sending gifts to CollegeClub employees . " Kaycee " was interviewed by telephone by The New York Times in 2000 , under the name " Kaycee Swenson " . She described herself in the resultant article as a high school senior who was taking college courses and planned to start college full @-@ time the next year . 
 = = Blogging , illness , and death = = 
 In 2000 , Kaycee revealed to an online friend of hers , Randall van der Woning , that she suffered from leukemia , which was then in remission . Shortly afterward , she told him that the cancer was back . Sympathetic , Van der Woning offered to set up and host a blog for her to chronicle her struggles ; Kaycee accepted the offer and the two created " Living Colours " in August 2000 . 
 Kaycee 's blog recounted , in sometimes vivid detail , her struggles with the disease , including multiple hospitalizations . The near @-@ daily entries were presented as having been written by Kaycee or , in cases where she was too weak or ill , by her " mother " , Debbie . She maintained an upbeat writing style despite her apparent hardships – her first entry said , " I 'm beginning a new exciting journey . . . into my survival . I want to win ! I 'll fight to the finish ! " and readers of her blog became devoted to the inspirational young girl . <unk> of the blog became widespread , with millions of readers visiting the site in the two years it was active and many readers recommending the blog to their own social networks Some sent cards , gifts , and well @-@ wishes to Kaycee by mail ; still others spoke to " Kaycee " on the phone , some , such as the administrator of her blog , many times . 
 In April 2001 , it was revealed that Kaycee 's liver was failing . Concerned about losing a " friend " without ever having met her , Van der Woning insisted that Kaycee allow him to visit her ; Kaycee told him that he was welcome to visit , but not until after she returned from a trip she would be taking to see the ocean . 
 However , before Van der Woning could make his trip to see Kaycee , he received a call on May 15 , 2001 from Kaycee 's mother . Sobbing , Debbie informed him that Kaycee had died , unexpectedly , of an aneurysm the day before . News of Kaycee 's death was immediately posted on her blog : 
 " Thank you for the love , the joy , the laughter and the tears . We shall love you always and forever . Kaycee Nicole passed away May 14 , 2001 , at the age of 19 . " 
 Readers of the blog mourned Kaycee 's death , many posting obituaries short and long on their own blogs , and news of her loss became widespread and much @-@ discussed throughout the internet . 
 = = Unraveling of hoax = = 
 After Kaycee 's ' death ' , mourners who requested an address to send condolence gifts , cards , or flowers to were told that , despite previous acceptance of gifts by Kaycee , there was no longer a post @-@ office box mailing address for her in Newton , Kansas . Debbie Swenson also informed Van der Woning when she told him of her death that there had already been a memorial service and Kaycee had been cremated . 
 On May 17 , blogger <unk> Mitchell posted an entry to her blog mocking people who faked illnesses on the internet . Though she did not initially name Kaycee Nicole , the next day she published another commentary which did explicitly name her and suggested that in fact , Kaycee Nicole had never existed . She cited the nearly impossible haste with which Kaycee had been interred , noting that even if Kaycee had not been autopsied – which was dependent upon the manner of her death and whether there was a doctor attending – the two days that Debbie claimed that gathering of mourners , memorial service , and cremation had been accomplished in was unlikely ; Mitchell also noted a number of inconsistencies in the backstory about Kaycee 's cancer . Mitchell , working off Kaycee 's " internet address " , traced the girl 's location to Peabody , Kansas . She called around the town , asking if anyone knew of someone of Kaycee 's description who had died recently . No one did . 
 On May 18 , a user on the weblog Metafilter posted a thread entitled " Is it possible that Kaycee did not exist ? " , which posited , largely on the basis of <unk> Mitchell 's writings , that Kaycee Nicole might have been a hoax . <unk> in the often @-@ heated thread ( even the creator of the thread stated that " I mean , I want it NOT to be true . I hate the thought that a bunch of people are grieving over somebody who did not <unk> ! [ sic ] " ) made a number of observations about the story of Kaycee , among them that no one had ever met Kaycee in person – not even the internet denizens who had been closest to her – and that no obituary was available in a newspaper , anywhere , for a 19 @-@ year @-@ old girl named Kaycee Nicole . 
 As the Metafilter thread progressed , users discovered that Kaycee 's CollegeClub account was tied to the CollegeClub account of Debbie Swenson 's teenaged daughter , and that records showed that someone had logged into Kaycee 's account days after she was supposed to have died . A user investigated the photographs that Kaycee had shared on her blog , identified a school mascot pictured , and traced it back to a particular high school , then traced the jersey number that " Kaycee " was wearing to an actual player . Investigation of the player showed that the only connection she had to Kaycee Nicole was that her family had once been acquainted with the Swenson family ; she was not ill , was not named Kaycee Nicole , and had no idea her photo was being used by someone else . 
 = = = Confession = = = 
 On May 19 , Debbie Swenson placed a call to her biggest supporter , Randall van der Woning . She told him that Kaycee had not actually been her own child , but rather a foster daughter . She requested that he keep Kaycee 's identity secret . Van der Woning did as requested and kept the information to himself ; however , this had the side effect of allowing the Metafilter investigation to continue . As more and more evidence mounted that the story of Kaycee had been cobbled together using misdirection and borrowed facts , Swenson emailed the truth to him , and he , in turn , posted it to the In Living Colours blog on May 20 : Kaycee Nicole had never existed . " I didn 't know the reactions would be so strong " , Swenson said . " I knew it was wrong and every day it ate at me and I couldn 't take it . " She now claimed that Kaycee was a composite of three people she had known with cancer , none of whom were her daughter . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Internet anger at the hoax was swift , with Van der Woning and many other supporters disclaiming Kaycee and Debbie Swenson . The local police in Peabody , Kansas were notified and soon handed off the case to the FBI as a possible fraud . The FBI declined to further investigate after its initial acceptance of the case , stating that it had not been able to find evidence that Debbie Swenson 's accepting of gifts for " Kaycee " constituted a dollar amount above their threshold for financial crimes . 
 Swenson was apologetic for the hoax , but said that she believed the Kaycee character had also done some good . " A lot of people have problems " , she told the New York Times . " I know I helped a lot of people in a lot of different ways . " 
 = 1939 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1939 Pacific typhoon season has no official bounds ; it ran year @-@ round in 1939 , but most tropical cyclones tend to form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean between May and November . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean . 
 The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the international date line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 1939 Pacific hurricane season . Storms in the season were tracked by the United States Weather Bureau and released in the Monthly Weather Review under the header " Typhoons and Depressions over the Far East " . The Monthly Weather Review only covers tropical cyclones west of 150 ° E. Due to lack of satellites and ship reports due to the Pacific Theatre of World War II , it is possible other tropical cyclones existed , especially if they were short @-@ lived or of minor intensity . 
 There were 29 known tropical cyclones , including 24 of typhoon status , of which several of the storms were deadly . A typhoon in November was the deadliest cyclone of the season , causing 49 deaths as it crossed the Philippines . The same typhoon later struck Hong Kong , where the Hong Kong Observatory recorded the first period of calm during the eye of a cyclone . At least 151 people were killed during the season , with 12 missing and unconfirmed of their status during some point during the season .

 A depression was first observed on February 3 while located about 250 miles ( 400 km ) of Yap . It tracked steadily westward until February 7 when it stalled about 200 miles ( 320 km ) east of the Philippine island of Mindanao . The depression remained nearly stationary for two days until turning to a steady northwest motion . It approached the island of Samar Island on February 12 , where a pressure of 1 @,@ 006 @.@ 0 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 71 inHg ) was reported , and subsequently turned to the north and later to the northeast . The depression was last observed on February 16 accelerating towards the Aleutian Islands . The system produced heavy rainfall in the Philippines , with extensive flooding reported in Surigao del Norte . It is unknown if the system intensified into a tropical storm . 
 = = = Typhoon Two = = = 
 On April 29 , an area of low pressure was located about 300 miles ( 480 km ) south of Yap . It moved westward , northward , and ultimately to the west @-@ northwest before developing into a tropical depression on May 2 to the east of the Philippines . Early on May 3 , after intensifying into a tropical storm the system struck the Philippine island of Samar Island , and the next day it hit Masbate before turning northward . After passing over northern Luzon on May 5 , the storm accelerated northeastward as it moved through the Luzon Strait , and intensified into a typhoon on May 7 . While the typhoon was off the southern coast of Japan , a ship located 290 miles ( 465 km ) south of Nagoya reported a minimum central pressure of 986 @.@ 0 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 12 inHg ) . The typhoon weakened as it paralleled about 100 miles ( 160 km ) off the coast of Japan , and was last observed on May 9 accelerating northeastward . 
 The storm produced strong winds throughout the eastern portions of the Philippine archipelago . 90 fishermen were caught in the storm , with one person drowning and eleven missing at one estimate made one month after the storm passed the area . Winds reached tropical storm force in southern Japan .

 On November 18 a tropical depression was first observed to the east of Mindanao . The depression steadily intensified as it tracked west @-@ northwestward , and intensified into a typhoon before striking Samar Island and Leyte Island on November 19 . It continued westward until reaching the western region of the South China Sea on November 22 . An approaching cold front turned the typhoon to the northeast , resulting in a rare occurrence of a typhoon recurving northeastward in the western portion of the South China Sea . On November 24 the typhoon passed over Macau , and two hours later the eye crossed directly over Hong Kong . The calm of the center of the eye lasted for fifteen minutes at the Hong Kong Observatory , the first time on record that the calm of a typhoon was recorded there . The typhoon began to become extratropical after making landfall , and continued northeastward through southern China . It gradually weakened while passing through the Taiwan Strait and possibly over Taiwan before dissipating on November 26 . 
 While crossing over the Philippines , a station in Capiz on Panay Island recorded a pressure of 981 @.@ 0 hectopascals ( 28 @.@ 97 inHg ) as well as winds in excess of 55 mph ( 88 km / h ) . The passage of the typhoon sunk a motor boat on Masbate island , killing 48 of the 50 occupants aboard . One person was reported missing and presumed dead in <unk> in Eastern Samar , believed to be caused by drowning . Property damage was great in Samar , Leyte , and Capiz provinces . In Hong Kong , wind gusts reached 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) during a rainband ahead of the storm .

The storm struck southeastern Luzon and turned to the north and north @-@ northeast . After passing near Manila it reached open waters on December 20 . For the following two days , it drifted eastward , possibly executing a loop , and after accelerating to the northeast it was last observed on December 24 . A station at Sorsogon recorded a pressure of 998 @.@ 0 hectopascals ( 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) . While passing through the northern Philippines , the typhoon produced heavy rainfall , killing 19 on Masbate and 14 in northern Luzon .

 = HMS Grasshopper ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Grasshopper was a Dragonfly @-@ class river gunboat built for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s . After completion was sent to the China station where she was deployed on the <unk> River to relieve the Insect @-@ class gunboat , HMS Gnat . She remained there until the declaration of war by the Empire of Japan in December 1941 . She was subsequently transferred to Singapore Naval Base and participated in the Malayan Campaign in early 1942 . Near the end of the Battle of Singapore , she evacuated the base on 11 February together with her sister ship HMS Dragonfly . Three days later she was attacked and sunk by Japanese aircraft off the island of <unk> . Most of the ship 's survivors were later captured on Sumatra by Japanese troops . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the Dragonfly @-@ class ships was based on that of the earlier HMS Scorpion with that ship 's flagship accommodations replaced by a low @-@ angle director @-@ control tower . Grasshopper displaced 585 long tons ( 594 t ) at standard load and 685 long tons ( 696 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 196 feet 6 inches ( 59 @.@ 9 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 6 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 9 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 3 @,@ 800 shaft horsepower ( 2 @,@ 800 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by two Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Grasshopper carried a maximum of 90 long tons ( 91 t ) of fuel oil . 
 The ship mounted two quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns 4 @-@ inch Mk V guns in single mounts , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 30 degrees . She also carried a single QF 3 @.@ 7 @-@ inch howitzer . For anti @-@ aircraft defence , Grasshopper had eight single mounts for .303 @-@ inch ( 7 @.@ 7 mm ) anti @-@ aircraft machine guns . She had a crew of 74 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = Service = = 
 The ship was ordered on 9 August 1937 as one of the intended replacements for the existing river gunboats stationed on the Chinese rivers . Grasshopper was laid down on 29 December 1937 by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston , Southampton , and launched on 19 January 1939 . 
 In April 1939 she sailed to the China Station under her own power and was expected to arrive on 24 May . Grasshopper was commissioned on 1 June 1939 in Hong Kong and completed on 13 June . She was deployed to the <unk> River where she replaced the Insect @-@ class gunboat HMS Gnat later that month . Part of Gnat 's crew transferred to Grasshopper , including the ship 's mascot , a dog called Judy . Following Japan 's entry into the Second World War in December 1941 , she was transferred from China to Singapore . During January 1942 , Grasshopper supported retreating Allied troops during the Malayan Campaign . Starting on 27 January , Grasshopper and Dragonfly rescued almost 3 @,@ 000 soldiers from the British 53rd Infantry and 15th Indian Infantry Brigades from the swamps south of Batu Pahat after they had been cut off by the advancing Japanese forces . 
 After the Japanese captured the Malayan Peninsula , both ships moved to Singapore harbour . On 8 February , the Japanese launched an amphibious assault across the Strait of Johore and following heavy fighting , many ships began evacuating from the harbour . By 11 February Gnat and Grasshopper were the largest vessels left . The two ships left Singapore for Batavia at 21 : 00 on 13 February , having taken on other personnel to evacuate them . Amongst these was Commander Ian Forbes , formerly of the battleship Prince of Wales , which had been sunk by the Japanese just over two months earlier . By the following morning they could hear the attacks by Japanese aircraft on other vessels in the distance . As they were sailing south , they were attacked by Japanese bombers . During the initial pass , Grasshopper was hit by a single bomb . When the planes returned , Dragonfly was hit three times and sank quickly . Grasshopper was hit twice and was set on fire . The order to abandon ship was given as the fire spread to compartments adjacent to an ammunition store . 
 The crew were ferried across to the nearby island of <unk> by the ship 's boats while the Japanese aircraft strafed them , where they joined some survivors from the Dragonfly . However the ship did not sink initially and after the planes departed , several crewmen were sent back on board to scavenge supplies . Among the survivors were six captured Japanese airmen and two pregnant women who had their babies delivered by the ship 's coxswain . Both boys were named after him by their mothers . Whilst on board , Petty Officer George White found Judy , who would later find a source of fresh water for the crew on the island . On 19 February , the remaining crew managed to commandeer a Chinese <unk> and using that and the ship 's boat , they reached Singkep in the Dutch East Indies . After two days , the crew departed for Sumatra on a Chinese junk , leaving their injured in the care of the Dutch Empire . They eventually reached Sumatra and sailed through the Strait of Malacca and up the <unk> River . The river narrowed too much for the junk to go any further , leaving the crew 200 miles ( 320 km ) from Padang . They trekked through the jungle but entered a Japanese @-@ held area and were captured 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) outside their destination . 
 Two of the crew elected not to travel with the others to Sumatra . They were Petty Officer George White and Able Seaman " <unk> " Lee , who were joined by one of the evacuees from the Royal Naval Reserve and two British Army soldiers who were already on Singkep . To prevent trouble with the incoming Japanese forces , they were transferred to the smaller Selayar Island . They were subsequently offered a boat by the island 's administrator , and a map of the Indian ocean torn from a child 's atlas . They decided that they would aim to sail to Madras , India , as there were concerns that the Japanese were working their way through the islands . Their departure timetable was brought forward after the island was visited by a boat containing a Japanese officer and five soldiers . They were told by the Japanese to remain on the island and await collection . That evening they prepared the boat and put supplies on board . They departed on 11 April , only travelling by night until they were clear of the islands . During the day , they landed on nearby islands and hid . After four days , the engine broke and could not be turned off . As they travelled through the islands , they passed two Japanese transport ships and were buzzed by a Japanese bomber . Once out of sight of the islands , they navigated using the position of the stars during the night and the sun during the day . After seventeen days of travelling , they landed in India , a distance of 2 @,@ 680 miles ( 4 @,@ 310 km ) , only 23 miles ( 37 km ) away from their intended destination . 
 = Coenwulf of Mercia = 
 Coenwulf ( also spelled Cenwulf , <unk> , or <unk> ) was King of Mercia from December 796 until his death in 821 . He was a descendant of a brother of King Penda , who had ruled Mercia in the middle of the 7th century . He succeeded Ecgfrith , the son of Offa ; Ecgfrith only reigned for five months , and Coenwulf ascended to the throne in the same year that Offa died . In the early years of Coenwulf 's reign he had to deal with a revolt in Kent , which had been under Offa 's control . Eadberht Præn returned from exile in Francia to claim the Kentish throne , and Coenwulf was forced to wait for papal support before he could intervene . When Pope Leo agreed to <unk> Eadberht , Coenwulf invaded and retook the kingdom ; Eadberht was taken prisoner , was blinded , and had his hands cut off . Coenwulf also appears to have lost control of the kingdom of East Anglia during the early part of his reign , as an independent coinage appears under King Eadwald . Coenwulf 's coinage reappears in 805 , indicating that the kingdom was again under Mercian control . Several campaigns of Coenwulf 's against the Welsh are recorded , but only one conflict with Northumbria , in 801 , though it is likely that Coenwulf continued to support the opponents of the Northumbrian king Eardwulf . 
 Coenwulf came into conflict with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury over the issue of whether laypeople could control religious houses such as monasteries . The breakdown in the relationship between the two eventually reached the point where the archbishop was unable to exercise his duties for at least four years . A partial resolution was reached in 822 with Coenwulf 's successor , King Ceolwulf , but it was not until about 826 that a final settlement was reached between Wulfred and Coenwulf 's daughter , Cwoenthryth , who had been the main beneficiary of Coenwulf 's grants of religious property . 
 He was succeeded by his brother , Ceolwulf ; a post @-@ Conquest legend claims that his son Cynehelm was murdered to gain the succession . Within two years Ceolwulf had been deposed , and the kingship passed permanently out of Coenwulf 's family . Coenwulf was the last king of Mercia to exercise substantial dominance over other Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms . Within a decade of his death , the rise of Wessex had begun under King Egbert , and Mercia never recovered its former position of power . 
 = = Background and sources = = 
 For most of the eighth century , Mercia was dominant among the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber . Æthelbald , who came to the throne in 716 , had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo @-@ Saxons by 731 . He was assassinated in 757 , and was briefly succeeded by Beornred , but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself . Offa 's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789 , and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter . In Kent , Offa intervened decisively in the 780s , and at some point became the overlord of East Anglia , whose king , Æthelred , was beheaded at Offa 's orders in 794 . 
 Offa appears to have moved to eliminate dynastic rivals to the succession of his son , Ecgfrith . According to a contemporary letter from Alcuin of York , an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade as a chief advisor at Charlemagne 's court , " the vengeance of the blood shed by the father has reached the son " ; Alcuin added , " This was not a strengthening of the kingdom , but its ruin . " Offa died in July 796 . Ecgfrith succeeded him but reigned for less than five months before Coenwulf came to the throne . The surviving sources do not record whether Ecgfrith died of natural causes or was assassinated , though Alcuin 's letter seems to imply the latter . 
 A significant corpus of letters dates from the period , especially from Alcuin , who corresponded with kings , nobles , and ecclesiastics throughout England . Letters between Coenwulf and the papacy also survive . Another key source for the period is the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , a collection of annals in Old English narrating the history of the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The Chronicle was a West Saxon production , however , and is sometimes thought to be biased in favour of Wessex . Charters dating from Coenwulf 's reign have survived ; these were documents granting land to followers or to churchmen and were witnessed by the kings who had the authority to grant the land . A charter might record the names of both a subject king and his overlord on the witness list appended to the grant . Such a witness list can be seen on the Ismere Diploma , for example , where Æthelric , son of king Oshere of the Hwicce , is described as a " subregulus " , or subking , of Æthelbald . 
 = = Mercia and southern England at Ecgfrith 's death = = 
 According to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days . Offa is known to have died in 796 , on either 26 July or 29 July , so Ecgfrith 's date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year . Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king . Coenwulf 's father 's name was <unk> , who may have been the same person as an ealdorman of that name who witnessed charters during the reign of Offa . Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa 's reign . According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh , of whom there is no other record . It is possible that this refers to Cenwealh of Wessex , who was married to ( and later repudiated ) a sister of Penda . 
 Coenwulf 's kin may have been connected to the royal family of the Hwicce , a subkingdom of Mercia around the lower river Severn . It appears that Coenwulf 's family were powerful , but they were not of recent Mercian royal lineage . A letter written by Alcuin to the people of Kent in 797 laments that " scarcely anyone is found now of the old stock of kings " . Eardwulf of Northumbria had , like Coenwulf , gained his throne in 796 , so Alcuin 's meaning is not clear , but it may be that he intended it as a slur on Eardwulf or Coenwulf or on both . Alcuin certainly held negative views of Coenwulf , regarding him as a tyrant and criticizing him for putting aside one wife and taking another . Alcuin wrote to a Mercian nobleman to ask him to greet Coenwulf peaceably " if it is possible to do so " , implying uncertainty about Coenwulf 's policy towards the Carolingians . 
 Coenwulf 's early reign was marked by a breakdown in Mercian control in southern England . In East Anglia , King Eadwald minted coins at about this time , implying that he was no longer subject to Mercia . A charter of 799 seems to show that Wessex and Mercia were estranged for some time before that date , though the charter is not regarded as undoubtedly genuine . In Kent , an uprising began , probably starting after Ecgfrith 's death , though it has been suggested that it began much earlier in the year , before Offa 's death . The uprising was led by Eadberht Præn , who had been an exile at Charlemagne 's court : Eadberht 's cause almost certainly had Carolingian support . Eadberht became king of Kent , and Æthelheard , the archbishop of Canterbury at that time , fled his see ; it is likely that Christ Church , Canterbury was sacked . 
 = = Reign = = 
 Coenwulf was unwilling to take military action in Kent without acknowledgement from Pope Leo III that Eadberht was a pretender . The basis for this assertion was that Eadberht had reportedly been a priest , and as such had given up any right to the throne . Coenwulf wrote to the Pope and asked Leo to consider making London the seat of the southern archbishopric , removing the honour from Canterbury ; it is likely that Coenwulf 's reasons included the loss of Mercian control over Kent . Leo refused to agree to moving the archiepiscopate to London , but in the same letter he agreed that Eadberht 's previous ordination made him ineligible for the throne : 
 And concerning that letter which the most reverend and holy Æthelheard sent to us ... as regards that apostate cleric who mounted to the throne ... we excommunicate and reject him , having regard to the safety of his soul . For if he should still persist in that wicked behaviour , be sure to inform us quickly , that we may [ write to ] princes and all people dwelling in the island of Britain , exhorting them to expel him from his most wicked rule and procure the safety of his soul . 
 This authorization from the Pope to proceed against Eadberht was delayed until 798 , but once it was received Coenwulf took action . The Mercians captured Eadberht , put out his eyes and cut off his hands , and led him in chains to Mercia , where according to later tradition he was imprisoned at Winchcombe , a religious house closely affiliated with Coenwulf 's family . By 801 at the latest Coenwulf had placed his brother , Cuthred , on the throne of Kent . Cuthred ruled until the time of his death in 807 , after which Coenwulf took control of Kent in name as well as fact . Coenwulf styled himself " King of the Mercians and the Province of Kent " ( rex Merciorum atque <unk> <unk> ) in a charter dated 809 . 
 Offa 's domination of the kingdom of Essex was continued by Coenwulf . King Sigeric of Essex left for Rome in 798 , according to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , presumably abdicating the throne in favour of his son , Sigered . Sigered appears on two charters of Coenwulf 's in 811 as king ( rex ) of Essex , but his title is reduced thereafter , first to subregulus , or subking , and thereafter to dux or ealdorman . 
 The course of events in East Anglia is less clear , but Eadwald 's coinage ceased , and new coinage issued by Coenwulf began by about 805 , so it is likely that Coenwulf forcibly re @-@ established Mercian dominance there . The resumption of friendly relations with Wessex under Beorhtric received a setback when Beorhtric died and the throne of Wessex passed to Egbert , who , like Eadberht , had been an exile at Charlemagne 's court . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle records that on the same day that Egbert came to the throne , an ealdorman of the Hwicce named Æthelmund led a force across the Thames at <unk> but was defeated by the men of Wiltshire under the leadership of Weohstan , also an ealdorman . Egbert may also have had a claim on the Kentish throne , according to the Chronicle , but he made no move to recover it during Coenwulf 's reign . Egbert appears to have been independent of Mercia from the beginning of his reign , and Wessex 's independence meant that Coenwulf was never able to claim the overlordship of the southern English that had belonged to Offa and Æthelbald . He did , however , claim the title of " Emperor " on one charter , the only Anglo @-@ Saxon king to do so before the 10th century . 
 In 796 or 797 the Welsh engaged Mercian forces at Rhuddlan . By 798 Coenwulf was in a position to invade in return , killing <unk> ap Meirion , the King of Gwynedd . A civil war in Gwynedd in the 810s ended with the succession of Hywel ap <unk> in 816 or 817 , and Coenwulf invaded again , this time ravaging Snowdonia and taking control of <unk> , a small Welsh territory near Rhos . It is not clear if the Mercians were involved in a battle recorded in Anglesey in 817 or 818 , but the following year Coenwulf and his army devastated Dyfed . 
 The Northumbrian king , Æthelred , was assassinated in April 796 , and less than a month later his successor , Osbald , was deposed in favour of Eardwulf . Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800 ; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria , who had reigned from 765 to 774 . Alhmund 's death was regarded as a martyrdom , and his cult subsequently developed at Derby , in Mercian territory , perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian politics at the time . Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf 's enemies , who had been exiled from Northumbria , and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801 . The invasion was inconclusive , however , and peace was arranged on equal terms . Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne , and he likely continued to support Eardwulf 's enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808 . 
 = = Relations with the church = = 
 In 787 , Offa had persuaded the Church to create a new archbishopric at Lichfield , dividing the archdiocese of Canterbury . The new archdiocese included the sees of Worcester , Hereford , Leicester , Lindsey , Dommoc , and Elmham ; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories . Canterbury retained the sees in the south and southeast . Hygeberht , already Bishop of Lichfield , was the new archdiocese 's first and only archbishop . 
 Two versions of the events that led to the creation of the new archdiocese appear in the form of an exchange of letters in 798 between Coenwulf and Pope Leo III . Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jaenberht , the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division ; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia . The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan , as each had his own reasons for representing the situation as they did : Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese , while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa . Coenwulf 's desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent , where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn . Coenwulf would have wished to retain control over the archiepiscopal seat , and at the time he wrote to the pope Kent was independent of Mercia . 
 Æthelheard , who had succeeded Jaenberht in 792 , had been the abbot of a monastery at Louth in Lindsey . On 18 January 802 Æthelheard received a papal privilege that re @-@ established his authority over all the churches in the archdiocese of Lichfield as well as those of Canterbury . Æthelheard held a council at Clovesho on 12 October 803 which finally stripped Lichfield of its archiepiscopal status . However , it appears that Hygeberht had already been removed from his office ; a Hygeberht attended the council of Clovesho as the head of the Church in Mercia but signed as an abbot . 
 Archbishop Æthelheard died in 805 and was succeeded by Wulfred . Wulfred was given freedom to mint coins that did not name Coenwulf on the reverse , probably indicating that Wulfred was on good terms with the Mercian king . In 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind : a letter from Pope Leo to Charlemagne mentioned that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with Wulfred . After this no further discord is mentioned until 816 , when Wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses . The council , held at Chelsea , asserted that Coenwulf did not have the right to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries , although both Leo and his predecessor , Pope Hadrian I , had granted Offa and Coenwulf the right to do so . Coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter , Cwoenthryth , to the position of abbess of Minster @-@ in @-@ Thanet . Leo died in 816 , and his successor , Stephen IV , died the following January ; the new pope , Paschal I confirmed Coenwulf 's privileges but this did not end the dispute . In 817 Wulfred witnessed two charters in which Coenwulf granted land to <unk> , bishop of Worcester , but there is no further record of Wulfred acting as archbishop for the rest of Coenwulf 's reign . One account records that the quarrel between Wulfred and Coenwulf led to Wulfred being deprived of his office for six years , with no baptisms taking place during that time , but this may have been an exaggeration , with four years being the more likely term of the suspension . 
 In 821 , the year of Coenwulf 's death , a council was held in London at which Coenwulf threatened to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king . Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms , but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf 's death , with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf 's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827 . However , Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf 's brother and heir , Ceolwulf , on 17 September 822 , so it is evident that some accommodation had been reached by that time . Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year . 
 = = Coinage = = 
 The coinage of Coenwulf follows the broad silver penny format established under Offa and his contemporaries . His very first coins are very similar to the heavy coinage of Offa 's last three years , and since the mints at Canterbury and in East Anglia were under the control of Eadbert Praen and Eadwald respectively , these earliest pennies must be the product of the London mint . Before 798 the new tribrach type appeared , with a design consisting of three radial lines meeting at the centre . The tribrach design was introduced initially at London alone but soon spread to Canterbury after it was reconquered from the rebels . It was not struck in East Anglia , but there are tribrach pennies in the name of Cuthred , sub @-@ king of Kent . Around 805 a new portrait coinage was introduced to all three of the southern mints . After around 810 a range of reverse designs was introduced , though several were common to many or all of the moneyers . From this date there is also evidence of a new mint , at Rochester in Kent . 
 A recent development in the coinage of Coenwulf came with the discovery in 2001 of a gold coin bearing the name Coenwulf at <unk> in Bedfordshire , England , on a footpath beside the River Ivel . The 4 @.@ 33 g ( 0 @.@ 15 oz ) mancus , worth about 30 silver pennies , is only the eighth known Anglo @-@ Saxon gold coin dating to the mid @-@ to @-@ late Anglo @-@ Saxon period . The coin 's inscription , " DE <unk> <unk> " , indicates that it was minted in London . Initially sold to American collector Allan Davisson for £ 230 @,@ 000 at an auction held by Spink auction house in 2004 , the British Government subsequently put in place an export ban in the hope of saving it for the British public . In February 2006 the coin was bought by the British Museum for £ 357 @,@ 832 with the help of funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund and The British Museum Friends making it the most expensive British coin purchased until then , though the price was exceeded the following July by the third @-@ known example of a Double Leopard . The coin is now on display in the museum 's money gallery . 
 = = Family and succession = = 
 A charter of 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named <unk> ; the charter is forged , but this detail is possibly accurate . Ælfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf 's wife , again from charter evidence ; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817 . Coenwulf 's daughter , Cwoenthryth , survived him and inherited the monastery at Winchcombe which Coenwulf had established as part of the patrimony of his family . Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged in a long dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery . Coenwulf also had a son , Cynehelm , who later became known as a saint , with a cult dating from at least the 970s . According to Alfred the Great 's biographer , the Welsh monk and bishop , Asser , Alfred 's wife <unk> was descended from Coenwulf through her mother , Eadburh , though Asser does not say which of Coenwulf 's children Eadburh descends from . 
 Coenwulf died in 821 at <unk> near Holywell , Flintshire , probably while making preparations for a campaign against the Welsh that took place under his brother and successor , Ceolwulf , the following year . A mid @-@ 11th century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child and was then murdered by his tutor <unk> at the behest of Cwoenthryth . This version of events " bristles with historical problems " , according to one historian , and it is also possible that Cynehelm is to be identified with an ealdorman who is found witnessing charters earlier in Coenwulf 's reign , and who appears to have died by about 812 . The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point : Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father 's reign . Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm 's legend , there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf 's reign : a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf " much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings , nobles , bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business " . 
 Coenwulf was the last of a series of Mercian kings , beginning with Penda in the early 7th century , to exercise dominance over most or all of southern England . In the years after his death , Mercia 's position weakened , and the battle of Ellendun in 825 firmly established Egbert of Wessex as the dominant king south of the Humber .

Ryder 's father is an atheist and her mother is a Buddhist ; they encouraged their children to take the best part of other religions and use them to make their own belief systems .

Shot in the summer of 1985 , the film co @-@ starred Charlie Sheen and Kerri Green with Ryder playing Rina , one of Lucas 's friends at school .

 Before each segment , there are trailers advertising fake films , as well as vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys . According to Rodriguez , it was Tarantino 's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse . " I didn 't even know about it until I read it in the trades . It said something like ' Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there 's gonna be fake trailers . ' And I thought , ' There are ? ' " Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film 's fake trailers themselves . According to Rodriguez , " We had so many ideas for trailers . I made Machete . I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin , and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real . He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright , and they said , ' Can we do a trailer ? We have an idea for a trailer ! ' We were like , ' Hey , let them shoot it . If we don 't get around to shooting ours , we 'll put theirs in the movie . If theirs come out really great , we 'll put it in the movie to have some variety . ' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said , ' I have a trailer : Werewolf Women of the SS . ' I said , ' Say no more . Go shoot it . You got me . ' " Each trailer was shot in two days . While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen , Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half @-@ hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down . Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest @-@ winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun . 
 = = = Machete = = = 
 Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 as a full feature for Danny Trejo . " I had cast him in Desperado and I remember thinking , ' Wow , this guy should have his own series of <unk> movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean @-@ Claude Van Damme . ' So I wrote him this idea of a <unk> from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don 't want to get their own agents killed on , they 'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $ 25 @,@ 000 . I thought , ' That 's Machete . He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it 's peanuts . ' But I never got around to making it . " The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010 ; a sequel , Machete Kills ( 2013 ) , followed .

 Rob Zombie 's contribution , Werewolf Women of the SS , starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu ; Udo Kier as Franz Hess , the commandant of Death Camp 13 ; Zombie 's wife , Sheri ; and Sybil Danning as SS officers / sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp ( The She @-@ Devils of <unk> ) . Professional wrestlers Andrew " Test " Martin and Oleg " Vladimir Kozlov " <unk> also featured , plus <unk> <unk> , <unk> Nelson , and <unk> New as the Werewolf Women . According to Zombie , " Basically , I had two ideas . It was either going to be a Nazi movie or a women @-@ in @-@ prison film , and I went with the Nazis . There 're all those movies like Ilsa , She Wolf of the SS ; Fräulein Devil ; and Love Camp 7 — I 've always found that to be the most bizarre genre . " Zombie is also quoted as saying " I was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it . [ ... ] A lot of times these movies would be made like , ' Well , you know , I 've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms , but I got this Chinese set too . We 'll put ' em together ! ' They start jamming things in there , so I took that approach . " 
 = = = Don 't = = = 
 Edgar Wright 's contribution , Don 't , was produced in the style of a 1970s ' Hammer House of Horror film trailer . The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs , Matthew Macfadyen , singer Katie Melua , Lee Ingleby , Georgina Chapman , Emily Booth , Stuart Wilson , Lucy Punch , Rafe Spall , Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost , and a voice @-@ over by Will Arnett . Mark Gatiss , <unk> <unk> , Peter Serafinowicz , Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham ( who played the zombie " Mary " in Shaun of the Dead ) , among others , made uncredited cameo appearances . To get the necessary 1970s look , Wright used vintage lenses and old @-@ style graphics . During editing , he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists . According to Wright , " In the ' 70s , when American International would release European horror films , they 'd give them snazzier titles . And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film : In the UK , it 's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue . In Spain and in Italy , I think it 's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead . But in the States , it was called Don 't Open the Window . I just loved the fact that there isn 't a big window scene in the film — it 's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the hell is going on in the film . " On the Charlie Rose talk show , Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced — none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer , as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British . 
 = = = Thanksgiving = = = 
 Eli Roth 's contribution is a promo for the slasher opus Thanksgiving . Produced in the style of holiday @-@ themed slasher films like Halloween , Silent Night , Deadly Night , April Fool 's Day and My Bloody Valentine , the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim ; Jordan Ladd , Jay Hernandez , and Roth himself as his intended victims ; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff . The design for the titles in Thanksgiving was based on a Mad magazine slasher parody titled Arbor Day . Excerpts of the score from Creepshow were used in the faux trailer . 
 According to Roth , " My friend Jeff , who plays the killer pilgrim – we grew up in Massachusetts , we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the Thanksgiving slasher movie . We had the whole movie worked out : A kid who 's in love with a turkey , and then his father killed it , and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on the town . I called Jeff and said , ' Dude , guess what , we don 't have to make the movie , we can just shoot the best parts . ' " " Shooting the trailer was so much fun , " Roth has stated , " because every shot is a money shot . Every shot is decapitation or nudity . It 's so ridiculous , it 's absurd . It 's just so wrong and sick that it 's right . " 
 Roth 's fake trailer contained elements that almost earned Grindhouse an NC @-@ 17 rating , including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping , bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in the vulva , and three decapitations , one of which occurs as the victim 's girlfriend performs fellatio on him . According to Roth , " Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature , watching it all jammed together non @-@ stop makes it more shocking . But we had a great discussion with the ratings board . They got it . Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it . " Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend 's Eric Eisenberg that he and co @-@ writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film . 
 = = = Hobo with a Shotgun = = = 
 Some screenings of Grindhouse ( mainly in Canada ) also featured a fake trailer for a film titled Hobo with a Shotgun . The trailer , created by Dartmouth , Nova Scotia filmmakers Jason <unk> , John Davies , and Rob Cotterill , won Robert Rodriguez 's South by Southwest Grindhouse trailers contest . In the trailer , David Brunt plays a vagabond with a 20 @-@ gauge shotgun ( changed to a 12 @-@ gauge for the actual movie ) who becomes a vigilante . In the trailer , he is shown killing numerous persons , ranging from armed robbers to corrupt cops to a pedophilic Santa Claus . The trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in the United States and Canada . 
 In 2010 , the trailer was made into a full @-@ length feature film starring Rutger Hauer as the hobo , with David Brunt playing a dirty cop . Hobo With a Shotgun was the second of Grindhouse 's fake trailers to be turned into a feature film , the first being Machete . The film was released March 25 , 2011 in Canada , April 1 , 2011 on American Video On Demand and May 6 , 2011 in U.S. theatres . 
 = = History and development = = 
 The idea for Grindhouse came to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino when Tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house , complete with trailers before and in between the films . During one screening in 2003 , Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films <unk> Girl and Rock All Night . Rodriguez asked Tarantino , " I always wanted to do a double feature . Hey , why don 't you direct one and I 'll do the other ? " Tarantino quickly replied , " And we 've got to call it Grindhouse ! " 
 The film 's name originates from the American term for theaters that played " all the exploitation genres : kung fu , horror , <unk> , sexploitation , the ' good old boy ' redneck car @-@ chase movies , blaxploitation , spaghetti Westerns — all those risible genres that were released in the 70s . " According to Rodriguez , " The posters were much better than the movies , but we 're actually making something that lives up to the posters . " 
 Rodriguez first came up with the idea for Planet Terror during the production of The Faculty : " I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett , all these young actors , that zombie movies were dead and hadn 't been around in a while , but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they ’ d been gone for so long . I said , ' We 've got to be there first . ' I had [ a script ] I ’ d started writing . It was about 30 pages , and I said to them , ' There are characters for all of you to play . ' We got all excited about it , and then I didn 't know where to go with it . The introduction was about as far as I 'd gotten , and then I got onto other movies . Sure enough , the zombie [ movie ] invasion happened and they all came back again , and I was like , ' Ah , I knew that I should 've made my zombie film . ' " The story was <unk> when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse . 
 As Planet Terror took shape , Tarantino developed the story for Death Proof , based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would " death @-@ proof " their cars . As long as they were driving , stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) and survive . This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his " death @-@ proof " car . Tarantino remembers , " I realized I couldn 't do a straight slasher film , because with the exception of women @-@ in @-@ prison films , there is no other genre quite as rigid . And if you break that up , you aren 't really doing it anymore . It 's inorganic , so I realized — let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do . My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed , but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film , hopefully against you . " 
 According to Rodriguez , " [ Tarantino ] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it . He started to tell me the story and said , ' It 's got this death @-@ proof car in it . ' I said , ' You have to call it Death Proof . ' I helped title the movie , but that 's it . " Of the car chases , Tarantino stated , " CGI for car stunts doesn 't make any sense to me — how is that supposed to be impressive ? [ ... ] I don 't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in ' 92 — to me , the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2 . And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece . In between that , not a lot . Every time a stunt happens , there 's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing , but I don 't feel it in my stomach . It 's just action . "

 = = = Direction = = = 
 According to actress Marley Shelton , " Rodriguez and Tarantino really co @-@ directed , at least Planet Terror . Quentin was on set a lot . He had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while . Of course , he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof . So it 's really both of their brainchild . " Tarantino has stated , " I can 't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him . So much so that we didn 't actually see each other 's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened . It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down , and then put them together and watched it all play , and then made a couple of little changes after that , and pretty much that was it . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Many of the cast members had previously worked with both directors . Before appearing in Grindhouse , Marley Shelton had auditioned for The Faculty , but Rodriguez chose not to cast her . She was eventually cast in the role of a customer in the opening sequence of Sin City . Bruce Willis had appeared in both Tarantino 's Pulp Fiction and Rodriguez 's Sin City , in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment Tarantino directed for the anthology film Four Rooms . Tom Savini had previously acted in From Dusk Till Dawn , which was written by Tarantino and directed by Rodriguez . Michael Parks reprises the role of Earl McGraw in Planet Terror and Death Proof . Parks first portrayed the role in From Dusk Till Dawn . His son , James , appears in Death Proof as Edgar McGraw , a character that first appeared in From Dusk Till Dawn 2 : Texas Blood Money . The first time the two characters appeared together was in Tarantino 's Kill Bill . Tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of Grindhouse , and director Eli Roth , who contributed the fake trailer Thanksgiving and whose film Hostel was produced by Tarantino , has a cameo in Death Proof . 
 Tarantino attempted to cast both Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof , but both were unable to work due to prior commitments . In an interview , Tarantino revealed that he decided to cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because " for people of my generation , he 's a true hero ... but now , there 's a whole audience out there that doesn 't know what Kurt Russell can do . When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says ' Kurt Russell in Dreamer , ' or ' Kurt Russell in Miracle , ' I 'm not disparaging these movies , but I 'm thinking : When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again ? " 
 = = = Cinematography = = = 
 Rodriguez and Tarantino each acted as cinematographer on their segments . Although Rodriguez had previously worked as the cinematographer on six of his own feature films , Death Proof marked Tarantino 's first credit as a cinematographer . The director of photography for Rob Zombie 's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the SS was Phil Parmet , whom Zombie had first worked with on The Devil 's Rejects . The director of photography for Eli Roth 's fake trailer Thanksgiving was Milan <unk> , whom Roth had previously worked with on Hostel . 
 = = = Special effects = = = 
 Though set in the modern day , the film uses various unconventional techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s . Throughout both feature @-@ length segments and the fake trailers , the film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s , which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape . To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror , five of the six 25 @,@ 000 @-@ frame reels were edited with real film damage , plug @-@ ins , and stock footage . 
 Planet Terror makes heavy use of digital effects throughout the film . Perhaps the most notable effect is Cherry 's ( Rose McGowan ) fake leg . To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident , during post @-@ production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan 's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer @-@ generated props — first a table leg and then an M16 rifle . During shooting for these scenes , McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion , and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post @-@ production . 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 During editing , Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting " missing reels " into the film . " [ Quentin ] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed , " Rodriguez recalls , " and he was saying , ' Oh , it 's got a missing reel in it . But it 's really interesting because after the missing reel , you don 't know if he slept with a girl or he didn 't because she says he did and he says that he didn 't . It leaves you guessing , and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it . ' I thought , ' Oh , my God , that 's what we ’ ve got to do . We 've got to have a missing reel ! ' I 'm going to use it in a way where it actually says ' missing reel ' for 10 seconds , and then when we come back , you 're arriving in the third act . [ ... ] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring , that 's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy , and the bad guy is really good , and the couple becomes friends . Suddenly , though , in the third act , all bets are off and it 's a whole new story anyway . " 
 On the editing of Death Proof , Tarantino stated " There is half @-@ an @-@ hour 's difference between my Death Proof and what is playing in Grindhouse . [ ... ] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence . I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist , and it worked . " An extended , 127 @-@ minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d 'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival . Tarantino is quoted as saying " It works great as a double feature , but I 'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see Death Proof unfiltered . [ ... ] It will be the first time everyone sees Death Proof by itself , including me . " 
 Grindhouse is rated R in the United States for " strong graphic bloody violence and gore , pervasive language , some sexuality , nudity , and drug use " . On March 15 , 2007 , The New York Post reported that the film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an NC @-@ 17 rating . Shortly after , the film officially received an R @-@ rating from the MPAA . Ain 't It Cool News reported that according to Tarantino , only minimal cuts were made which ended up totaling 20 seconds .

 The music for Planet Terror was composed by Rodriguez . Inspiration for his score came from John Carpenter , whose music was often played on set .

 Grindhouse did not perform well at the box office , surprising box office analysts and fans alike given the strong reviews and favorable media buzz . Costing $ 53 million to produce , Grindhouse opened poorly with " a disappointing $ 11 @.@ 5 million " in the United States , making a per @-@ theater average of $ 4 @,@ 417 ; box office analysts originally predicted an opening weekend total of at least $ 20 – $ 30 million . 
 The opening weekend box office total stood below not only the second weekends of Blades of Glory and Meet the Robinsons , but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the widely panned Are We Done Yet ? . In an attempt to explain the film 's disappointing opening weekend , box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that Grindhouse " suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted Snakes on a Plane and Slither among others : too funny to be scary , too scary to be funny . " Box office analyst Lee <unk> of tracking website Lee 's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino 's Kill Bill saga had been released as one film , instead of two separate volumes . " Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back @-@ to @-@ back $ 60 million grosses ? " he asked . Others attributed the film 's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend , noting that the weekend is more tailored for family @-@ oriented films or light @-@ comedy , not exploitative horror films . The film 's length — running more than three hours — also hurt , keeping away casual theater @-@ goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day . 
 Quentin Tarantino was quoted as saying about the film 's box office results , " It was disappointing , yeah . But the movie worked with the audience . [ ... ] People who saw it loved it and applauded . [ ... ] I 'm proud of my flop . " Harvey Weinstein said that he was so " incredibly disappointed " with the film 's opening weekend that he was considering re @-@ releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the " missing " scenes . The film altogether earned $ 25 @,@ 422 @,@ 088 in ticket sales . Grindhouse was separated and released internationally . Death Proof grossed $ 30 @,@ 663 @,@ 961 , while Planet Terror grossed $ 10 @,@ 871 @,@ 224 . , bringing Grindhouse 's total gross to $ 67 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 .

 Grindhouse was embraced by critics ; review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 83 % of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 191 reviews , with an average score of 7 @.@ 4 / 10 . The site 's consensus reads , " Grindhouse delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache , improving upon its source material with feral intelligence . " At the website Metacritic , which utilizes a normalized rating system , the film earned a favorable rating of 77 / 100 based on 36 reviews by mainstream critics . 
 Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a " B + " rating , praising it as a " crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films " that " will leave you laughing , gasping , thrilled at a movie that knows , at long last , how to put the bad back in badass . " Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review , commenting that " by stooping low without selling out , this babes @-@ and @-@ bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again . " Critic James Berardinelli also enjoyed the film but was not as positive as other critics . Awarding the film three stars ( out of four ) , Berardinelli found the film to be " cinema as an expression of pulp with attitude ... [ Rodriguez and Tarantino ] are speaking from the hearts ... but that doesn 't mean everyone sitting in the theater will get it . " 
 The critics who did not like the film were not amused by the film 's graphic and comical violence , with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express @-@ News noting that " this ambitious , scratched and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses . " Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating , but noted that " the Rodriguez segment is terrific ; the Tarantino one long @-@ winded and juvenile . " Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment . Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that " [ a ] t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear , and you find yourself watching not an arch , clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie . " Chicago Sun @-@ Times critic Roger Ebert was divided . He gave Grindhouse as a whole two and a half stars out of four , awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars . Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big @-@ budget R @-@ rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence . 
 Critics generally enjoyed the fake trailers . Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star wrote that the use of the trailers helps the film establish " its credibility as both mock @-@ artifact and geeky fetish object even before the opening feature . " Todd McCarthy of Variety claimed that the trailers were " excellent candidates for exploitation immortality . " Jeff Vice of Deseret News , who gave the feature films negative reviews , called the trailers " ... the strongest aspect of the entire presentation . " Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide added , " With the exception of Werewolf Women , which tries a little too hard , they 're all spot @-@ on pastiches . " 
 The double feature appeared at number six on Jack Mathews and Owen Gleiberman 's respective top ten lists for New York Daily News and Entertainment Weekly , and at number seven on Stephanie Zacharek 's list for Salon . Marc Savlov listed Death Proof at number ten on his list for The Austin Chronicle .

 Outside the US and Canada , Planet Terror and Death Proof were released separately in extended versions , approximately two months apart . The poster artwork for each film 's release in the Netherlands claimed that Death Proof would feature " coming attractions " from Rodriguez , while Planet Terror would feature " coming attractions " from Tarantino . While the separated version of Planet Terror includes the Machete trailer , none of the other fake trailers were included when the features were released individually . 
 In reaction to the possibility of a split in a foreign release , Tarantino stated " Especially if they were dealing with non @-@ English language countries , they don 't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is , they don 't even have the double feature tradition . So you are kind of trying to teach us something else . " Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States . 
 In the United Kingdom , Death Proof was released on September 21 , 2007 . The release of Planet Terror followed on November 9 with an eventual , theatrical , limited run of the entire Grindhouse feature the following year . Death Proof was screened in Europe in the extended version that was presented in competition at the Cannes film festival . The additional material includes scenes that were replaced in the American theatrical release version with a " missing reel " title card , such as the lap dance scene . A total of about 27 minutes were added for this version . In Australia , the edited version of Death Proof was first screened on November 1 , 2007 as a separate film . However , from January 17 , 2008 , Grindhouse had limited screenings . In April 2008 , Grindhouse was screened by Dendy Cinemas in one venue at a time across the country , through the use of a traveling 35 mm reel . In South America , Planet Terror was released in January 2010 , while Death Proof was released in July 2010 at least in Brazil .

 Death Proof and Planet Terror were released separately on DVD in the United States . The trailers were omitted from Death Proof , with the exception of Machete which was from Planet Terror . Death Proof was released on September 18 , 2007 , with Planet Terror following on October 16 , 2007 . Both were two @-@ disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films . Robert Rodriguez stated in his 10 @-@ Minute Film School that a box set of the two films would be available soon , and that his 10 @-@ Minute Cook School would appear on it .

 Planet Terror and Death Proof were released individually on Blu @-@ ray Disc on December 16 , 2008 in North America . The Blu @-@ ray edition of Planet Terror also contained a " scratch @-@ free " version of the film that removed much of the damage effects , while the Blu @-@ ray edition of Death Proof only contained the " damaged " version of the film . The theatrical version of Grindhouse was released on Region 2 DVD and the stand @-@ alone version of Death Proof HD DVD was released in Germany on December 31 , 2009 . 
 A two @-@ disc Blu @-@ ray " Special Edition " of Grindhouse was released on October 5 , 2010 in the US by Vivendi Entertainment and has exclusive bonus features . This release marks the first time that US viewers can view the full Grindhouse " Double Feature Presentation " experience at home as it was originally released in theaters . The first disc of the 2 @-@ disc set contains Death Proof and Planet Terror , along with the faux trailers , including the " trailer " for Machete . The theatrical cut was released on DVD in Canada from Alliance Atlantis . All of the extras from the previous individual DVD releases were included , however none of the extras from the Special Edition Blu @-@ ray were included .

 = = Adaptations of the fake trailers = = 
 In 2010 , Rodriguez wrote and co @-@ directed a feature @-@ length adaptation of his fake trailer , Machete . Many of the original actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it . Machete screened September 1 at the Venice Film Festival and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3 , 2010 . 
 Machete turned out to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse , grossing $ 44 million internationally against a just @-@ over $ 10 million budget . At the end of the film , the announcer says that there would be two sequels : Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again . Soon afterward , Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place , and that once everyone was free , they could begin shooting . 
 The director of a trailer that played in some theaters in the United States and Canada ( mainly the latter ) , Hobo with a Shotgun , Jason <unk> , also made a feature @-@ length adaptation of it . Rutger Hauer replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character , though Brunt does make a cameo as a corrupt cop . 
 These two adaptations received mainly positive reviews , with the general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being . Although Hobo with a Shotgun was not as big a box office success in the U.S. as it was in Canada , it has since gained a cult following there . 
 Many of the other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films , including Edgar Wright and Eli Roth . 
 Both Rodriguez and Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a sequel to Grindhouse . Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an " old @-@ school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries , and release a shorter , dubbed cut in others " for his segment . It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don 't into a feature film . According to Eli Roth , he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don 't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel . Roth is quoted as saying " We 're talking to Dimension about it . I think they 're still trying to figure out Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2 , but I 've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat . " 
 Electra and Elise Avellan , Rodriguez 's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films , originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both Machete and The Babysitter Twins , but the latter concept did not materialize with the former 's release . " Robert mentioned something about the end of the world and Hollywood action films , where we 'd be trained in Mexico to come back here and fight , " Electra Avellan told bloody @-@ <unk> 
 A third feature @-@ length film based on the trailers , the Robert Rodriguez @-@ directed Machete Kills , was released at the end of 2013 . 
 = Muskrat = 
 The muskrat ( Ondatra zibethicus ) , the only species in genus Ondatra and tribe <unk> , is a medium @-@ sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America , and is an introduced species in parts of Europe , Asia , and South America . The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats . It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands and is a resource of food and fur for humans . 
 The muskrat is the largest species in the subfamily <unk> , which includes 142 other species of rodents , mostly voles and lemmings . Muskrats are referred to as " rats " in a general sense because they are medium @-@ sized rodents with an adaptable lifestyle and an omnivorous diet . They are not , however , members of the genus Rattus . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The muskrat 's name probably comes from a word of Algonquian ( possibly Powhatan ) origin , <unk> ( literally " it is red " , so called for its colorings ) , or from the Abenaki native word <unk> , as seen in the archaic English name for the animal , <unk> . Because of the association with the " musky " odor , which the muskrat uses to mark its territory , and its flattened tail the name became altered to musk @-@ beaver ; later it became muskrat due to its resemblance to rats . 
 Similarly , its specific name zibethicus means ‘ musky ’ , being the adjective of <unk> ‘ civet musk ; civet ’ . The genus name comes from the Huron word for the animal , <unk> , and entered New Latin as Ondatra via French . 
 = = Description = = 
 An adult muskrat is about 40 – 70 cm ( 16 – 28 in ) long , half of that is the tail , and weighs from 0 @.@ 6 – 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 4 lb ) . That is about four times the weight of the brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) , though an adult muskrat is only slightly longer , and are almost certainly the largest and heaviest members of the diverse family Cricetidae , which includes all voles , lemmings and most mice native to the Americas . Muskrats are much smaller than beavers ( Castor canadensis ) , with whom they often share their habitat . 
 Muskrats are covered with short , thick fur which is medium to dark brown or black in color , with the belly a bit lighter ( countershaded ) ; as the age increases , it turns a partly gray in color . The fur has two layers , which helps protect them from the cold water . They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair and , to aid them in swimming , are slightly flattened vertically , which is a shape that is unique to them . When they walk on land , their tails drag on the ground , which makes their tracks easy to recognize . 
 Muskrats spend much of their time in the water and are well suited for their semiaquatic life . They can swim under water for 12 to 17 minutes . Their bodies , like those of seals and whales , are less sensitive to the buildup of carbon dioxide than those of most other mammals . They can close off their ears to keep the water out . Their hind feet are <unk> , although in swimming , their tails are their main means of propulsion . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Muskrats are found over most of Canada and the United States and a small part of northern Mexico . They were introduced to Europe in the beginning of the 20th century and have become an invasive species in northwestern Europe . They mostly inhabit wetlands , areas in or near saline and freshwater wetlands , rivers , lakes , or ponds . They are not found in the state of Florida , where the round @-@ tailed muskrat , or Florida water rat ( Neofiber alleni ) , fills their niche . 
 Their populations naturally cycle ; in areas where they become abundant , they are capable of removing much of the vegetation in wetlands . They are thought to play a major role in determining the vegetation of prairie wetlands in particular . They also selectively remove preferred plant species , thereby changing the abundance of plant species in many kinds of wetlands . Species commonly eaten include cattail and yellow water lily . Alligators are thought to be an important natural predator , and the absence of muskrats from Florida may in part be the result of alligator predation . 
 While much wetland habitat has been eliminated due to human activity , new muskrat habitat has been created by the construction of canals or irrigation channels , and the muskrat remains common and widespread . They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines . Fish and frogs perish in such streams , yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands . Muskrats also benefit from human persecution of some of their predators . 
 The muskrat is classed as a " prohibited new organism " under New Zealand 's Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 , preventing it from being imported into the country . 
 Trematode Metorchis conjunctus can also infect muskrats . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Muskrats normally live in groups consisting of a male and female pair and their young . During the spring , they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates . Many are injured or killed in these fights . Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators . In streams , ponds or lakes , muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance . These entrances are 6 – 8 in ( 15 – 20 cm ) wide . In marshes , push @-@ ups are constructed from vegetation and mud . These push @-@ ups are up to 3 ft ( 91 cm ) in height . In snowy areas , they keep the openings to their push @-@ ups closed by plugging them with vegetation , which they replace every day . Some muskrat push @-@ ups are swept away in spring floods and have to be replaced each year . Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands . They help maintain open areas in marshes , which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds . 
 Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk . They feed on cattails and other aquatic vegetation . They do not store food for the winter , but sometimes eat the insides of their push @-@ ups . While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored , more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist , as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife documentary The Life of Mammals . Plant materials make up about 95 % of their diets , but they also eat small animals , such as freshwater mussels , frogs , crayfish , fish , and small turtles . Muskrats follow trails they make in swamps and ponds . When the water freezes , they continue to follow their trails under the ice . 
 Muskrats provide an important food resource for many other animals , including mink , foxes , coyotes , wolves , lynx , bears , eagles , snakes , alligators , and large owls and hawks . Otters , snapping turtles , and large fish such as pike prey on baby muskrats . Caribou and elk sometimes feed on the vegetation which makes up muskrat push @-@ ups during the winter when other food is scarce for them . In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union , the muskrat 's greatest predator is the golden jackal . They can be completely extirpated in shallow water bodies , and during the winter of 1948 – 49 in the Amu Darya ( river in central Asia ) , muskrats constituted 12 @.@ 3 % of jackal faeces contents , and 71 % of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals , 16 % of which froze and became unsuitable for muskrat occupation . Jackals also harm the muskrat industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry . 
 Muskrats , like most rodents , are prolific breeders . Females can have two or three litters a year of six to eight young each . The babies are born small and hairless , and weigh only about 22 g ( 0 @.@ 78 oz ) . In southern environments , young muskrats mature in six months , while in colder northern environments , it takes about a year . Muskrat populations appear to go through a regular pattern of rise and dramatic decline spread over a six- to 10 @-@ year period . Some other rodents , including famously the muskrat 's close relatives the lemmings , go through the same type of population changes . 
 = = In human history = = 
 Native Americans have long considered the muskrat to be a very important animal . Some predict winter snowfall levels by observing the size and timing of muskrat lodge construction . 
 In several Native American creation myths , it is the muskrat that dives to the bottom of the primordial sea to bring up the mud from which the earth is created , after other animals have failed in the task . 
 Muskrats have sometimes been a food resource for Americans . In the southeastern portion of Michigan , a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat on Ash Wednesday and on Lenten Fridays ( when the eating of meat , except for fish , is prohibited ) ; this tradition dates back to at least the early 19th century . 
 Muskrat fur is warm , becoming prime at the beginning of December in northern North America . In the early 20th century , the trapping of the animal for its fur became an important industry there . During that era , the fur was specially trimmed and dyed to be sold widely in the US as " Hudson seal " fur . Muskrats were introduced at that time to Europe as a fur resource , and spread throughout northern Europe and Asia . 
 In some European countries , such as Belgium , France , and the Netherlands , the muskrat is considered an invasive pest , as its burrowing damages the dikes and levees on which these low @-@ lying countries depend for protection from flooding . In those countries it is trapped , poisoned , and hunted to attempt to keep the population down . Muskrats also eat corn and other farm and garden crops growing near water bodies . 
 Royal Canadian Mounted Police winter hats are made from muskrat fur . 
 = Yorktown campaign = 
 The Yorktown or Virginia campaign was a series of military maneuvers and battles during the American Revolutionary War that culminated in the decisive Siege of Yorktown in October 1781 . The result of the campaign was the surrender of the British Army force of General Charles , Earl Cornwallis , an event that led directly to the beginning of serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war . The campaign was marked by disagreements , indecision , and miscommunication on the part of British leaders , and by a remarkable set of cooperative decisions , at times in violation of orders , by the French and Americans . 
 The campaign involved land and naval forces of Great Britain and France , and land forces of the United States . British forces sent to Virginia between January and April 1781 joined with Cornwallis 's army in May , which came north from an extended campaign through the southern states . These forces were first opposed weakly by Virginia militia , but General George Washington sent first the Marquis de Lafayette and then Anthony Wayne with Continental Army troops to oppose the raiding and economic havoc the British were wreaking . The combined American forces , however , were insufficient in number to oppose the combined British forces , and it was only after a series of controversially confusing orders by General Sir Henry Clinton , the British commander @-@ in @-@ chief , that Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in July and built a defensive position that was strong against the land forces he then faced , but was vulnerable to naval blockade and siege . 
 British naval forces in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the combined fleets of France and Spain , and , after some critical decisions and tactical missteps by British naval commanders , the French fleet of Paul de Grasse gained control over Chesapeake Bay , blockading Cornwallis from naval support and delivering additional land forces to blockade him on land . The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this control , but Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated in the key Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5 . American and French armies that had massed outside New York City began moving south late in August , and arrived near Yorktown in mid @-@ September ; deceptions about their movement successfully delayed attempts by Clinton to send more troops to Cornwallis . 
 The Siege of Yorktown began on September 28 . In a step that probably shortened the siege , Cornwallis decided to abandon parts of his outer defenses , and the besiegers successfully stormed two of his redoubts . When it became clear that his position was untenable , Cornwallis opened negotiations on October 17 and surrendered two days later . When the news reached London , the government of Lord North fell , and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations . These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783 , in which King George III recognized the independent United States of America . Clinton and Cornwallis engaged in a public war of words defending their roles in the campaign , and British naval command also discussed the navy 's shortcomings that led to the defeat . 
 = = Background = = 
 By December 1780 , the American Revolutionary War 's North American theaters had reached a critical point . The Continental Army had suffered major defeats earlier in the year , with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in the loss of Charleston and the Battle of Camden in the south , while the armies of George Washington and the British commander @-@ in @-@ chief for North America , Sir Henry Clinton watched each other around New York City in the north . The national currency was virtually worthless , public support for the war , about to enter its sixth year , was waning , and army troops were becoming mutinous over pay and conditions . In the Americans ' favor , Loyalist recruiting in the south had been checked with a severe blow at Kings Mountain in October . 
 = = = French and American planning for 1781 = = = 
 Virginia had largely escaped military notice before 1779 , when a raid destroyed much of the state 's shipbuilding capacity and seized or destroyed large amounts of tobacco , which was a significant trade item for the Americans . Virginia 's only defenses consisted of locally raised militia companies , and a naval force that had been virtually wiped out in the 1779 raid . The militia were under the overall direction of Continental Army General Baron von Steuben , a prickly Prussian taskmaster who , although he was an excellent <unk> , alienated not only his subordinates , but also had a difficult relationship with the state 's governor , Thomas Jefferson . Steuben had established a training center in Chesterfield for new Continental Army recruits , and a " factory " in Westham for the manufacture and repair of weapons and ammunition . 
 French military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign . After a series of unsuccessful attempts at cooperation with the Americans ( leading to failed assaults on Newport , Rhode Island and Savannah , Georgia ) , they realized more active participation in North America was needed . However , they also needed to coordinate their actions with Spain , where there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of Jamaica . It turned out that the Spanish were not interested in operations against Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar , and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet . 
 As the French fleet was preparing to depart Brest in March 1781 , several important decisions were made . The West Indies fleet , led by the Comte de Grasse , after operations in the Windward Islands , was directed to go to Cap @-@ Français ( present @-@ day Cap @-@ Haïtien ) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations . Due to a lack of transports , France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops . The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander , the Comte de Barras . De Barras was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland , and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington 's army outside New York . In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington , De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap @-@ Français . The French general , the Comte de Rochambeau was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse might be able to assist , without making any commitment . ( Washington learned from John Laurens , stationed in Paris , that de Grasse had discretion to come north . ) 
 The French fleet sailed from Brest on March 22 . The British fleet was busy with preparations to resupply Gibraltar , and did not attempt to oppose the departure . After the French fleet sailed , the packet ship Concorde sailed for Newport , carrying the Comte de Barras , Rochambeau 's orders , and credits for the six million livres . In a separate dispatch sent later , de Grasse also made two important requests . The first was that he be notified at Cap @-@ Français of the situation in North America so that he could decide how he might be able to assist in operations there , and the second was that he be supplied with 30 pilots familiar with North American waters . 
 = = = British planning for 1781 = = = 
 General Clinton never articulated a coherent vision for what the goals for British operations of the coming campaign season should be in the early months of 1781 . Part of his problem lay in a difficult relationship with his naval counterpart in New York , the aging Vice Admiral Marriot Arbuthnot . Both men were stubborn , prone to temper , and had prickly personalities ; due to repeated clashes , their working relationship had completely broken down . In the fall of 1780 Clinton had requested that either he or Arbuthnot be recalled ; however , orders recalling Arbuthnot did not arrive until June 1781 . Until then , according to historian George Billias , " The two men could not act alone , and would not act together " . Arbuthnot was replaced by Sir Thomas Graves , with whom Clinton had a somewhat better working relationship . 
 The British presence in the south consisted of the strongly fortified ports of Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , and a string of outposts in the interior of those two states . Although the strongest outposts were relatively immune to attack from the Patriot militia that were their only formal opposition in those states , the smaller outposts , as well as supply convoys and messengers , were often the target of militia commanders like Thomas Sumter and Francis Marion . Portsmouth had most recently been occupied in October 1780 by a force under the command of Major General Alexander Leslie , but Lieutenant General Charles , Earl Cornwallis , commanding the British southern army , had ordered them to South Carolina in November . To replace General Leslie at Portsmouth , General Clinton sent 1 @,@ 600 troops under General Arnold ( recently commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier ) to Virginia in late December . 
 = = British raiding in Virginia = = 
 Part of the fleet carrying General Arnold and his troops arrived in Chesapeake Bay on December 30 , 1780 . Without waiting for the rest of the transports to arrive , Arnold sailed up the James River and disembarked 900 troops at Westover , Virginia , on January 4 . After an overnight forced march , he raided Richmond , the state capital , the next day , encountering only minimal militia resistance . After two more days of raiding in the area , they returned to their boats , and made sail for Portsmouth . Arnold established fortifications there , and sent his men out on raiding and foraging expeditions . The local militia were called out , but they were in such small numbers that the British presence could not be disputed . This did not prevent raiding expeditions from running into opposition , as some did in skirmishing at Waters Creek in March . 
 When news of Arnold 's activities reached George Washington , he decided that a response was necessary . He wanted the French to send a naval expedition from their base in Newport , but the commanding admiral , the Chevalier Destouches , refused any assistance until he received reports of serious storm damage to part of the British fleet on January 22 . On February 9 , Captain Arnaud de <unk> de Tilley sailed from Newport with three ships ( ship of the line <unk> and frigates Surveillante and Gentile ) . When he arrived off Portsmouth four days later , Arnold withdrew his ships , which had shallower drafts than those of the French , up the Elizabeth River , where de Tilley could not follow . De Tilley , after determining that the local militia were " completely insufficient " to attack Arnold 's position , returned to Newport . On the way he captured the HMS Romulus , a frigate sent by the British from New York to investigate his movements . 
 Congress authorized a detachment of Continental forces to Virginia on February 20 . Washington assigned command of the expedition to the Marquis de Lafayette , who left Peekskill , New York the same day . His troops , numbering about 1 @,@ 200 , were three light regiments drawn from troops assigned to Continental regiments from New Jersey and New England ; these regiments were led by Joseph Vose , Francis Barber , and Jean @-@ Joseph <unk> de <unk> . Lafayette 's force reached Head of Elk ( present @-@ day Elkton , Maryland , the northern navigable limit of Chesapeake Bay ) on March 3 . While awaiting transportation for his troops at Annapolis , Lafayette traveled south , reaching Yorktown on March 14 , to assess the situation . 
 = = = American attempts at defense = = = 
 De Tilley 's expedition , and the strong encouragement of General Washington , who traveled to Newport to press the case , convinced Destouches to make a larger commitment . On March 8 he sailed with his entire fleet ( 7 ships of the line and several frigates , including the recently captured Romulus ) , carrying French troops to join with Lafayette 's in Virginia . Admiral Arbuthnot , alerted to his departure , sailed on March 10 after sending Arnold a dispatch warning of the French movement . Arbuthnot , whose copper @-@ clad ships could sail faster than those of Destouches , reached Cape Henry on March 16 , just ahead of the French fleet . The ensuing battle was largely indecisive , but left Arbuthnot free to enter Lynnhaven Bay and control access to Chesapeake Bay ; Destouches returned to Newport . Lafayette saw the British fleet , and pursuant to orders , made preparations to return his troops to the New York area . By early April he had returned to Head of Elk , where he received orders from Washington to stay in Virginia . 
 The departure of Destouches ' fleet from Newport had prompted General Clinton to send Arnold reinforcements . In the wake of Arbuthnot 's sailing he sent transports carrying about 2 @,@ 000 men under the command of General William Phillips to the Chesapeake . These joined Arnold at Portsmouth on March 27 . Phillips , as senior commander , took over the force and resumed raiding , targeting Petersburg and Richmond . By this time , Baron von Steuben and Peter Muhlenberg , the militia commanders in Virginia , felt they had to make a stand to maintain morale despite the inferior strength of their troops . They established a defensive line in Blandford , near Petersburg ( Blandford is now a part of the city of Petersburg ) , and fought a disciplined but losing action on April 25 . Von Steuben and Muhlenberg retreated before the advance of Phillips , who hoped to again raid Richmond . However , Lafayette made a series of forced marches , and reached Richmond on April 29 , just hours before Phillips .

 To counter the British threat in the Carolinas , Washington had sent Major General Nathanael Greene , one of his best strategists , to rebuild the American army in North Carolina after the defeat at Camden . General Cornwallis , leading the British troops in the south , wanted to deal with him and gain control over the state . Greene divided his inferior force , sending part of his army under Daniel Morgan to threaten the British post at Ninety Six , South Carolina . Cornwallis sent Banastre Tarleton after Morgan , who almost wiped out Tarleton 's command in the January 1781 Battle of Cowpens , and almost captured Tarleton in the process . This action was followed by what has been called the " race to the Dan " , in which Cornwallis gave chase to Morgan and Greene in an attempt to catch them before they reunited their forces . When Greene successfully crossed the Dan River and entered Virginia , Cornwallis , who had stripped his army of most of its baggage , gave up the pursuit . However , Greene received reinforcements and supplies , recrossed the Dan , and returned to Greensboro , North Carolina to do battle with Cornwallis . The earl won the battle , but Greene was able to withdraw with his army intact , and the British suffered enough casualties that Cornwallis was forced to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement and resupply . Greene then went on to regain control over most of South Carolina and Georgia . Cornwallis , in violation of orders but also in the absence of significant strategic direction by General Clinton , decided to take his army , now numbering just 1 @,@ 400 men , into Virginia on April 25 ; it was the same day that Phillips and von Steuben fought at Blandford . 
 Phillips , after Lafayette beat him to Richmond , turned back east , continuing to destroy military and economic targets in the area . On May 7 , Phillips received a dispatch from Cornwallis , ordering him to Petersburg to effect a junction of their forces ; three days later , Phillips arrived in Petersburg . Lafayette briefly cannonaded the British position there , but did not feel strong enough to actually make an attack . On May 13 , Phillips died of a fever , and Arnold retook control of the force . This caused some grumbling amongst the men , since Arnold was not particularly well respected . While waiting for Cornwallis , the forces of Arnold and Lafayette watched each other . Arnold attempted to open communications with the marquis ( who had orders from Washington to summarily hang Arnold ) , but the marquis returned his letters unopened . Cornwallis arrived in Petersburg on May 19 , prompting Lafayette , who commanded under 1 @,@ 000 Continentals and about 2 @,@ 000 militia , to retreat to Richmond . Further British reinforcements led by the <unk> Colonel von Voigt arrived from New York shortly after , raising the size of Cornwallis 's army to more than 7 @,@ 000 . 
 Cornwallis , after dispatching General Arnold back to New York , then set out to follow General Clinton 's most recent orders to Phillips . These instructions were to establish a fortified base and raid rebel military and economic targets in Virginia . Cornwallis decided that he had to first deal with the threat posed by Lafayette , so he set out in pursuit of the marquis . Lafayette , clearly outnumbered , retreated rapidly toward Fredericksburg to protect an important supply depot there , while von Steuben retreated to Point of Fork ( present @-@ day Columbia , Virginia ) , where militia and Continental Army trainees had gathered with supplies pulled back before the raiding British . Cornwallis reached the Hanover County courthouse on June 1 , and , rather than send his whole army after Lafayette , detached Banastre Tarleton and John Graves Simcoe on separate raiding expeditions . 
 Tarleton , his British Legion reduced by the debacle at Cowpens , rode rapidly with a small force to Charlottesville , where he captured several members of the Virginia legislature . He almost captured Governor Jefferson as well , but had to content himself with several bottles of wine from Jefferson 's estate at Monticello . Simcoe went to Point of Fork to deal with von Steuben and the supply depot . In a brief skirmish on June 5 , von Steuben 's forces , numbering about 1 @,@ 000 , suffered 30 casualties , but they had withdrawn most of the supplies across the river . Simcoe , who only had about 300 men , then exaggerated the size of his force by lighting a large number of campfires ; this prompted von Steuben to withdraw from Point of Fork , leaving the supplies to be destroyed by Simcoe the next day . 
 Lafayette , in the meantime , was expecting the imminent arrival of long @-@ delayed reinforcements . Several battalions of Pennsylvania Continentals under Brigadier General Anthony Wayne had also been authorized by Congress for service in Virginia in February . However , Wayne had to deal with the aftereffects of a mutiny in January that nearly wiped out the Pennsylvania Line as a fighting force , and it was May before he had rebuilt the line and begun the march to Virginia . Even then , there was a great deal of mistrust between Wayne and his men ; Wayne had to keep his ammunition and bayonets under lock and key except when they were needed . Although Wayne was ready to march on May 19 , the force 's departure was delayed by a day because of a renewed threat of mutiny after the units were paid with devalued Continental dollars . Lafayette and Wayne 's 800 men joined forces at Raccoon Ford on the Rappahannock River on June 10 . A few days later , Lafayette was further reinforced by 1 @,@ 000 militia under the command of William Campbell . 
 After the successful raids of Simcoe and Tarleton , Cornwallis began to make his way east toward Richmond and Williamsburg , almost contemptuously ignoring Lafayette in his movements . Lafayette , his force grown to about 4 @,@ 500 , was buoyed in confidence , and began to edge closer to the earl 's army . By the time Cornwallis reached Williamsburg on June 25 , Lafayette was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away , at Bird 's Tavern . That day , Lafayette learned that Simcoe 's Queen 's Rangers were at some remove from the main British force , so Lafayette sent some cavalry and light infantry to intercept them . This precipitated a skirmish at Spencer 's Ordinary where each side believed the other to be within range of its main army . 
 = = Allied decisions = = 
 While Lafayette , Arnold , and Phillips maneuvered in Virginia , the allied leaders , Washington and Rochambeau , considered their options . On May 6 the Concorde arrived in Boston , and two days later Washington and Rochambeau were informed of the arrival of de Barras as well as the vital dispatches and funding . On May 23 and 24 , Washington and Rochambeau held a conference at Wethersfield , Connecticut where they discussed what steps to take next . They agreed that , pursuant to his orders , Rochambeau would move his army from Newport to the Continental Army camp at White Plains , New York . They also decided to send dispatches to de Grasse outlining two possible courses of action . Washington favored the idea of attacking New York , while Rochambeau favored action in Virginia , where the British were less well established . Washington 's letter to de Grasse outlined these two options ; Rochambeau , in a private note , informed de Grasse of his preference . Lastly , Rochambeau convinced de Barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation , rather than taking it out on expeditions to the north as he had been ordered . The Concorde sailed from Newport on June 20 , carrying dispatches from Washington , Rochambeau , and de Barras , as well as the pilots de Grasse had requested . The French army left Newport in June , and joined Washington 's army at Dobb 's Ferry , New York on July 7 . From there , Washington and Rochambeau embarked on an inspection tour of the British defenses around New York while they awaited word from de Grasse . 
 De Grasse had a somewhat successful campaign in the West Indies . His forces successfully captured Tobago in June after a minor engagement with the British fleet . Beyond that , he and British Admiral George Brydges Rodney avoided significant engagement . De Grasse arrived at Cap @-@ Français on July 16 , where the Concorde awaited him . He immediately engaged in negotiations with the Spanish . He informed them of his intent to sail north , but promised to return by November to assist in Spanish operations in exchange for critical Spanish cover while he sailed north . From them he secured the promise to protect French commerce and territories so that he could bring north his entire fleet , 28 ships of the line . In addition to his fleet , he took on 3 @,@ 500 troops under the command of the Marquis de St. Simon , and appealed to the Spanish in Havana for funds needed to pay Rochambeau 's troops . On July 28 , he sent the Concorde back to Newport , informing Washington , Rochambeau , and de Barras that he expected to arrive in the Chesapeake at the end of August , and would need to leave by mid @-@ October . He sailed from Cap @-@ Français on August 5 , beginning a deliberately slow route north through a little @-@ used channel in the Bahamas . 
 = = British decisions = = 
 The movement of the French army to the New York area caused General Clinton a great deal of concern ; letters written by Washington that Clinton had intercepted suggested that the allies were planning an attack on New York . Beginning in June he wrote a series of letters to Cornwallis containing a confusing and controversial set of ruminations , suggestions , and recommendations , that only sometimes contained concrete and direct orders . Some of these letters were significantly delayed in reaching Cornwallis , complicating the exchange between the two . On June 11 and 15 , apparently in reaction to the threat to New York , Clinton requested Cornwallis to fortify either Yorktown or Williamsburg , and send any troops he could spare back to New York . Cornwallis received these letters at Williamsburg on June 26 . He and an engineer inspected Yorktown , which he found to be defensively inadequate . He wrote a letter to Clinton indicating that he would move to Portsmouth in order to send troops north with transports available there . 
 On July 4 Cornwallis began moving his army toward the Jamestown ferry , to cross the broad James River and march to Portsmouth . Lafayette 's scouts observed the motion , and he realized the British force would be vulnerable during the crossing . He advanced his army to the Green Spring Plantation , and , based on intelligence that only the British rear guard was left at the crossing , sent General Wayne forward to attack them on July 6 . In reality , the earl had laid a clever trap . Crossing only his baggage and some troops to guard them , he sent " deserters " to falsely inform Lafayette of the situation . In the Battle of Green Spring , General Wayne managed to escape the trap , but with significant casualties and the loss of two field pieces . Cornwallis then crossed the river , and marched his army to Suffolk . 
 Cornwallis again detached Tarleton on a raid into central Virginia . Tarleton 's raid was based on intelligence that supplies might be intercepted that were en route to General Greene . The raid , in which Tarleton 's force rode 120 miles ( 190 km ) in four days , was a failure , since supplies had already been moved . ( During this raid , some of Tarleton 's men were supposedly in a minor skirmish with Peter Francisco , one of the American heroes of Guilford Court House . ) Cornwallis received another letter from General Clinton while at Suffolk , dated June 20 , stating that the forces to be embarked were to be used for an attack against Philadelphia . 
 When Cornwallis reached Portsmouth , he began embarking troops pursuant to Clinton 's orders . On July 20 , with some transports almost ready to sail , new orders arrived that countermanded the previous ones . In the most direct terms , Clinton ordered him to establish a fortified deep @-@ water port , using as much of his army as he thought necessary . Clinton took this decision because the navy had long been dissatisfied with New York as a naval base , firstly because sand bars obstructed the entrance to the Hudson River , damaging the hulls of the larger ships ; and secondly because the river often froze in winter , imprisoning vessels inside the harbour . Arbuthnot had recently been replaced and to show his satisfaction at this development , Clinton now acceded to the Navy 's request , despite Cornwallis 's warning that the Chesapeake 's open bays and navigable rivers meant that any base there " will always be exposed to sudden French attack . " It was to prove a fatal error of judgement by Clinton , since the need to defend the new facility denied Cornwallis any freedom of movement . Nevertheless , having inspected Portsmouth and found it less favourable than Yorktown , Cornwallis wrote to Clinton informing him that he would fortify Yorktown . 
 Lafayette was alerted on July 26 that Cornwallis was embarking his troops , but lacked intelligence about their eventual destination , and began maneuvering his troops to cover some possible landing points . On August 6 he learned that Cornwallis had landed at Yorktown and was fortifying it and Gloucester Point just across the York River .

 Admiral Rodney had been warned that de Grasse was planning to take at least part of his fleet north . Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet ( he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested , for example ) , he assumed that de Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap @-@ Français , and that part of his fleet would escort it to France as Admiral Guichen had done the previous year . Rodney made his dispositions accordingly , balancing the likely requirements of the fleet in North America with the need to protect Britain 's own trade convoys . <unk> of his twenty @-@ one battleships , therefore , were to sail with Hood in pursuit of de Grasse to the Chesapeake before proceeding to New York . Rodney , who was ill , meanwhile took three other battleships back to England , two as merchant escorts , leaving his remaining two in dock for repairs . Hood was well satisfied with these arrangements , telling a colleague that his fleet was " equal fully to defeat any designs of the enemy , let de Grasse bring or send what number of ships he might in aid of Barras . " What neither Rodney or Hood knew was de Grasse 's last minute decision to take his entire fleet to North America , thus ensuring a French superiority of three to two in battleship strength . <unk> unaware of this development , Hood eventually sailed from Antigua on August 10 , five days after de Grasse . During the voyage , one of his smaller ships carrying intelligence about the American pilots was captured by a privateer , thus further depriving the British in New York of valuable information . Hood himself , following the direct route , reached the Chesapeake on August 25 , and found the entrance to the bay empty . He then sailed on to New York to meet with Admiral Sir Thomas Graves , in command of the New York station following Arbuthnot 's departure . 
 On August 14 General Washington learned of de Grasse 's decision to sail for the Chesapeake . The next day he reluctantly abandoned the idea of assaulting New York , writing that " [ m ] <unk> having now come to a crisis and a decisive plan to be determined on , I was obliged ... to give up all idea of attacking New York ... " The combined Franco @-@ American army began moving south on August 19 , engaging in several tactics designed to fool Clinton about their intentions . Some forces were sent on a route along the New Jersey shore , and ordered to make camp preparations as if preparing for an attack on Staten Island . The army also carried landing craft to lend verisimilitude to the idea . Washington sent orders to Lafayette to prevent Cornwallis from returning to North Carolina ; he did not learn that Cornwallis was entrenching at Yorktown until August 30 . Two days later the army was passing through Philadelphia ; another mutiny was averted there when funds were procured for troops that threatened to stay until they were paid . 
 Admiral de Barras sailed with his fleet from Newport , carrying the French siege equipment , on August 25 . He sailed a route that deliberately took him away from the coast to avoid encounters with the British . De Grasse reached the Chesapeake on August 30 , five days after Hood . He immediately debarked the troops from his fleet to assist Lafayette in blockading Cornwallis , and stationed some his ships to blockade the York and James Rivers . 
 News of de Barras ' sailing reached New York on August 28 , where Graves , Clinton , and Hood were meeting to discuss the possibility of making an attack on the French fleet in Newport , since the French army was no longer there to defend it . Clinton had still not realized that Washington was marching south , something he did not have confirmed until September 2 . When they learned of de Barras ' departure they immediately concluded that de Grasse must be headed for the Chesapeake ( but still did not know of his strength ) . Graves sailed from New York on August 31 with 19 ships of the line ; Clinton wrote Cornwallis to warn him that Washington was coming , and that he would send 4 @,@ 000 reinforcements . 
 On September 5 , the British fleet arrived at the mouth of the Chesapeake to see the French fleet anchored there . De Grasse , who had men ashore , was forced to cut his cables and scramble to get his fleet out to meet the British . In the Battle of the Chesapeake , de Grasse won a narrow tactical victory . After the battle , the two fleets drifted to the southeast for several days , with the British avoiding battle and both fleets making repairs . This was apparently in part a ploy by de Grasse to ensure the British would not interfere with de Barras ' arrival . A fleet was spotted off in the distance on September 9 making for the bay ; de Grasse followed the next day . Graves , forced to scuttle one of his ships , returned to New York for repairs . Smaller ships from the French fleet then assisted in transporting the Franco @-@ American army down the Chesapeake to Yorktown , completing the encirclement of Cornwallis .

 On September 6 , General Clinton wrote a letter to Cornwallis , telling him to expect reinforcements . Received by Cornwallis on September 14 , this letter may have been instrumental in the decision by Cornwallis to remain at Yorktown and not try to fight his way out , despite the urging of Banastre Tarleton to break out against the comparatively weak Lafayette . General Washington , after spending a few days at Mount Vernon for the first time in years , arrived in the camps outside Yorktown on September 17 . That same day , the British military leadership in New York held a council , in which they agreed that Cornwallis could not be reinforced until they had regained control of the Chesapeake . Historian Richard Ketchum describes the decision of the council as leaving Cornwallis " dangling in the wind . " One day earlier , Cornwallis wrote a desperate plea for help : " I am of the opinion that you can do me no effectual service but by coming directly to this place . " Before dispatching the letter on the 17th , Cornwallis added , " If you cannot relieve me very soon , you must prepare to hear the worst . " 
 Washington , Rochambeau , and de Grasse then held council aboard de Grasse 's flagship Ville de Paris to finalize preparations for the siege ; de Grasse agreed to provide about 2 @,@ 000 marines and some cannons to the effort . During the meeting , de Grasse was convinced to delay his departure ( originally planned for mid @-@ October ) until the end of October . Upon the return of the generals to Williamsburg , they heard rumors that British naval reinforcements had arrived at New York , and the French fleet might again be threatened . De Grasse wanted to pull his fleet out of the bay as a precaution , and it took the pleas of Washington and Rochambeau , delivered to de Grasse by Lafayette , to convince him to remain . 
 The siege formally got underway on September 28 . Despite a late attempt by Cornwallis to escape via Gloucester Point , the siege lines closed in on his positions and the allied cannons wrought havoc in the British camps , and on October 17 he opened negotiations to surrender . On that very day , the British fleet again sailed from New York , carrying 6 @,@ 000 troops . Still outnumbered by the combined French fleets , they eventually turned back . A French naval officer , noting the British fleet 's departure on October 29 , wrote , " They were too late . The fowl had been eaten . "

 The negotiations for surrender were complicated by two issues . When American forces surrendered at Charleston in 1780 , they were not granted customary terms of capitulation that included flying colors and the playing of an enemy tune . Washington insisted that these terms be applied to the surrender of the British army at Yorktown , his negotiators pointing out that the defenders had in both instances acted with valor . The second issue concerned the disposition of Loyalists in the British camp . This issue was finessed with the addition of a clause to the terms that allowed one British vessel , the sloop Bonetta , to be sent without any sort of inspection to carry dispatches from Cornwallis to New York ; Americans , suspecting that either runaway slaves or Loyalists might be aboard , were prevented from searching the vessel . 
 When the British garrison marched out of their positions on October 19 , it was with colors cased , possibly playing the British tune " The World Turned Upside Down " . Cornwallis , claiming illness , did not attend the ceremony , sending his deputy General O 'Hara to deliver his sword . O 'Hara at first sought to deliver it to a French officer , but he was finally directed to one of Washington 's officers , Benjamin Lincoln , the defeated commander at Charleston . Lincoln briefly held the proferred sword and then returned it to O 'Hara . 
 Over the following weeks , the army was marched under guard to camps in Virginia and Maryland . Cornwallis and other officers were returned to New York and allowed to return to England on parole . The ship on which Cornwallis sailed in December 1781 also carried Benedict Arnold and his family .

 The local militia that supported the siege were dismissed from service . Some of the American Continental forces were returned to the New York City region , where Washington continued to stand against the British presence until the end of the war ; others were sent south to assist in General Greene 's efforts in the Carolinas . Issues of pay and condition were an ongoing problem until the war ended , but Washington fought no more battles . 
 The French forces that came with de Grasse were reembarked , and he sailed for the West Indies , with the fleet of de Barras , in early November . After recapturing a number of British @-@ held targets there , de Grasse was preparing to join with the Spanish for an assault on Jamaica when Admiral Rodney defeated him in the April 1782 Battle of the Saintes , capturing him and his flagship . The forces of General Rochambeau wintered in Virginia , and marched back to Rhode Island the next summer .

 General Washington 's aide , Lieutenant Tench Tilghman , was dispatched to deliver the news to Congress . Arriving in Philadelphia on October 22 , he was two days behind the first notice of the surrender , which had been expressed from Baltimore ahead of him . The news electrified Congress and the populace . Church bells <unk> , and the Liberty Bell was reportedly rung , actions that were repeated as the news traveled through the colonies . Some Congressmen introduced a resolution calling on General Washington to arrest and hang General Cornwallis ; after " [ t ] he debate continue 'd several Day 's " , the resolution was voted down . 
 The news put British @-@ occupied New York City into mourning . At first met with some skepticism , the news was finally confirmed on October 27 , although the city still awaited news of Clinton 's abortive relief effort . Clinton was recalled to London , and left the city in March 1782 . He was replaced by General Guy Carleton , who was under orders to suspend offensive operations . 
 When the news reached London on November 25 , Lord Germain described the reaction of Lord North to the news : " he would have taken a ball on his breast . For he opened his arms exclaiming wildly as he paced up and down the apartment , during the few minutes , ' Oh God ! It is all over ! ' " King George was reported to receive the news with calmness and dignity , although he later became depressed as the news sank in , and even considered abdication . The king 's supporters in Parliament were depressed , and the opposition elated . A resolution calling for an end to the war was introduced on December 12 , and failed to pass by a single vote . Lord Germain was dismissed in early 1782 , and the North administration fell shortly afterward . Peace negotiations followed , and the war was formally ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on September 3 , 1783 . 
 General Cornwallis , despite being the commander who surrendered , was not blamed for the defeat . He was well @-@ received on his return to London , and one writer echoed a common sentiment that " Lord Cornwallis 's army was sold . " General Clinton spent the rest of his life defending his own reputation ; he was " laughed at by the rebels , despised by the British , and cursed by the loyalists . " In 1783 , he published a Narrative of the Campaign of 1781 in North America in which he attempted to lay the blame for the 1781 campaign failures on General Cornwallis . This was met with a public response by Cornwallis , who leveled his own criticisms at Clinton . The highly public debate included the publication of much of their correspondence . 
 Admiral Graves also did not suffer due to his defeat by de Grasse ; he was eventually promoted to full admiral and given a peerage . However , many aspects of the Battle of the Chesapeake have been the subject of both contemporary and historical debate , beginning right after the battle . On 6 September , Admiral Graves issued a memorandum justifying a confusing use of signals , indicating that " [ when ] the signal for the line of battle ahead is out at the same time with the signal for battle , it is not to be understood that the latter signal shall be rendered ineffectual by a too strict adherence to the former . " Hood , in commentary written on the reverse of his copy , observed that this eliminated any possibility of engaging an enemy who was disordered , since it would require the British line to also be disordered . Instead , he maintained , " the British fleet should be as compact as possible , in order to take the critical moment of an advantage opening ... " Others criticise Hood because he " did not wholeheartedly aid his chief " , and that a lesser officer " would have been court @-@ martialled for not doing his utmost to engage the enemy . " 
 The Comte de Rochambeau dispatched two messengers to deliver the news to Paris in a move that had unusual consequences in French military politics . The Duc de Lauzun and the Comte de Deux @-@ Pontes , both of whom had distinguished themselves in the siege , were sent on separate ships to bring the news . Deux @-@ Pontes was accompanied by a favorite of the French naval minister the Marquis de Castries , the Comte de Charlus , who Lauzun had urged Rochambeau to send in his stead for political reasons . King Louis XVI and his ministers received the news warmly , but Castries and the snubbed Charlus ensured that Lauzun and Rochambeau were denied or delayed in the receipt of rewards for the success . Deux @-@ Ponts was rewarded with the Order of Saint Louis and command of a regiment .

 Historian John Pancake describes the later stages of the campaign as " British blundering " and that the " allied operations proceeded with clockwork precision . " Naval historian Jonathan Dull has described de Grasse 's 1781 naval campaign , which encompassed , in addition to Yorktown , successful contributions to the French capture of Tobago and the Spanish siege of Pensacola , as the " most perfectly executed naval campaign of the age of sail " , and compared the string of French successes favorably with the British Annus Mirabilis of 1759 . He also observes that a significant number of individual decisions , at times against orders or previous agreements , contributed to the success of the campaign : 
 French ministers <unk> and Vergennes convinced the French establishment that decisive action was needed in North America in order to end the war .
