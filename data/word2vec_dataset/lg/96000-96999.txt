 Josh Grier , Wilco 's lawyer , was able to negotiate a buy @-@ out of the band from Reprise . The band would keep the rights to the album if they paid Reprise $ 50 @,@ 000 . Before Wilco could accept the deal , Reprise called the band and changed their offer to give the band the rights to Yankee Hotel Foxtrot for free . Despite Reprise 's efforts to accommodate Wilco 's departure , the process marred public relations after an article in the Chicago Tribune described what had happened . 
 Wilco had planned on releasing Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11 , 2001 , but Tweedy did not want a change in record labels to significantly delay the release of the album . Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band , MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on file sharing networks . In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed , on September 18 , 2001 , Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website . The <unk> website registered over 50 @,@ 000 hits that day , eight times as much as typical daily traffic . Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months . The following tour was a success financially , and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album . 
 = = Release on Nonesuch Records = = 
 Both independent and major record labels bid for the right to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , including Artemis Records and Nonesuch Records . Tweedy denied the bids of record labels that did not have a roster of signed artists that matched his liking . He also decided to ignore small independent companies because he wanted to be able to put the album out for a large audience and felt that they would be unable to produce more than 100 @,@ 000 records . Wilco decided to sign with AOL Time Warner subsidiary Nonesuch Records in November 2001 , basing the decision on the label 's small size and artist @-@ friendly atmosphere . In the end , Wilco recorded and produced Yankee Hotel Foxtrot with Reprise , received the rights to the album for free , and then sold it back to a different AOL Time Warner affiliate . 
 Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was commercially released by Nonesuch Records on April 23 , 2002 . The album sold 55 @,@ 573 copies during its first week of release , peaking on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 13 . The album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and has sold over 590 @,@ 000 units . 
 The More Like the Moon EP ( also called Bridge and Australian EP ) was originally released as a bonus disc to the Australian version of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . The EP comprised six songs that were recorded but not released during the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sessions including a re @-@ working of " Kamera " . On the one @-@ year anniversary of the release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Wilco uploaded the EP onto their official website , and offered it for free to anyone who purchased the album . The band would later allow anyone to download the EP for free off the website , regardless of whether they had purchased the full @-@ length album . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The album received widespread acclaim upon release , including positive reviews from media outlets such as Rolling Stone and BBC Music . Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics poll . Brent Sirota of Pitchfork Media gave the album a perfect 10 rating , noting that the album was " simply a masterpiece . " David Fricke of Rolling Stone praised its resemblance to psychedelia while Allmusic writer Zac Johnson lauded its musical complexity . 
 There are more favorable reviews : E ! Online gave the album an A and said that its " rich , exotic flavor gets more intense the longer you chew on it . " Stylus Magazine called it " a great album , and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start . " <unk> gave it nine stars out of ten and called it " a fierce record " . Almost Cool gave it a score of 8 @.@ 75 out of ten and said , " I 'm not sure if it 's the work by O 'Rourke or the progression of the group ( or a little of both ) , but this disc is so multi @-@ layered that it 's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen . " Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it " a more adventurous and rewarding release " . The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that " After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- it becomes clear that these songs are not only fully realized , they 're damn near brilliant . " Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it " The most worth @-@ the @-@ wait long @-@ awaited album in the world ... ever ? Could be ... " Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said , " The most common description of this much @-@ discussed album over the past few months is that <unk> is Americana 's Kid A. In truth , it 's more successful than that . " Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated : " Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo @-@ fi . " Q likewise gave it four stars and called it " battered , bonkers and bewitching in equal parts " and that it " at last finds Wilco 's ' interesting ' phase become downright fascinating . " Yahoo ! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said , " Tweedy takes conventional <unk> birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely , reassembled into fractured , dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O 'Rourke . " 
 Shortly after its online release , Peter Buck of R.E.M. acclaimed the album as " their best yet . " 
 Trouser Press was one of the few major media outlets that did not give the album a good review , instead giving it an average review and stating that " more time spent in the songwriting lab might have yielded material more suitable to the evident studio effort invested and brought Wilco closer to making a truly great album . " Robert Christgau gave the album a one @-@ star honorable mention rating , describing the music as " <unk> " but stating that he found the lyrics and vocals in general to be boring . 
 Though Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was recorded before the September 11 , 2001 attacks , critics perceived references in the album to the attacks . For example , Jeff <unk> of Entertainment Weekly compared the two towers of Marina City to the World Trade Center towers . Also containing similar themes are the songs " War on War " and " Ashes of American Flags " which contains the line " I would like to salute the ashes of American flags . " The song " Jesus , Etc . " also contains these lyrics : " Tall buildings shake , Voices escape singing sad sad songs ... Voices whine , Skyscrapers are scraping together , your voice is smoking . " 
 The album was voted as the 100th " Greatest Album Ever " in a 2006 Q Magazine poll . In 2008 , Rolling Stone critic Tom Moon listed Yankee Hotel Foxtrot among the 1 @,@ 000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die . 
 Yankee Hotel Foxtrot found a place on many lists of the greatest albums of the 2000s . Rolling Stone ranked the album at number three on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the Decade . Pitchfork Media put the album at number four on the Top 200 Albums of the 2000s . The alternative music website also named " Poor Places " and " Jesus , Etc . " as the 147th and 61st best songs of the decade , respectively . Paste named the album the second @-@ best album of the decade .

 = 1948 Summer Olympics torch relay = 
 The 1948 Summer Olympics torch relay was run 17 – 29 July 1948 , prior to the 1948 Summer Olympics , held in London , United Kingdom . The relay was nicknamed the " relay of peace " . It was only the second occasion that a torch relay was held for the Olympics ; the first was at the 1936 Summer Olympics . 
 There were three types of torches designed for use on the relay : a standard solid fuel powered torch made of aluminium , a special butane gas torch used onboard HMS Whitesand Bay , and a final torch used to enter Empire Stadium that was made of stainless steel and powered by a magnesium candle . 
 The route itself was initially designed to be a direct one from Olympia to Wembley , taking in Italy , Switzerland and France . Belgium and Luxembourg were added to the route after those countries requested it . It was expected that the Greek part of the relay would be 750 kilometres ( 470 mi ) , but was reduced to 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) due to concerns over security . After the 12 @-@ day journey , the torch arrived at the Empire Stadium only thirty seconds later than expected . 
 = = Background = = 
 Despite hosting the 1908 Summer Olympics , the 1948 Games was the first London @-@ based games to have a torch relay after it was introduced at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . Former British athlete David Cecil , 6th Marquess of Exeter , and the rest of the organising committee for the 1948 Games agreed to continue the tradition begun by the previous games , and run a torch relay for a second time . 
 = = Relay elements = = 
 = = = Torch = = = 
 Each of the torches contained a solid fuel tablet made of <unk> and 6 % naphthalene ( following torch running tests in May 1947 ) that fuelled the flame itself . The solid fuel increased the distance each runner could run to 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) over flat terrain , decreasing the number of torches needed to be produced , which in turn reduced the cost of the relay . There were eight tablets loaded into each torch , with the bottom tablets pushed up by the use of a spring . The design increased the burning time of each torch up to around fifteen minutes , an increase from the four @-@ minute torches of the 1936 Olympics . The torch itself was designed by Ralph Lavers , with the brief that it should be " inexpensive and easy to make , of pleasing appearance and a good example of British craftmanship " . The torches were made from aluminium , with a long shaft holding a cup that contained the burner . " With thanks to the bearer " was written on the cup of the torch itself , along with the Olympic rings . The torches for the Greek leg of the relay were shipped to the Mediterranean aboard HMS Liverpool , along with a purpose built torch for the leg aboard a Royal Navy vessel from Corfu to Italy . 
 A differently designed torch was used for the final leg . It was made of stainless steel and was fueled by magnesium in order to ensure that the flame showed up properly during the opening ceremony . It was also designed by Ralph Lavers , with the frame for the torch created by EMI , and the magnesium candle supplied by Wessex Aircraft Engineering . Neither the suppliers nor designer charged a fee for the final torch .

 = = = Torch route = = = 
 While the general negotiation with other countries and the specific route were handled by the Organising Committee for the Games , the detailed organisation was delegated to a subgroup led by F.W. Collins . Due to cost implications , the extensive route conducted by the 1936 Games was ruled out . Instead , the simplest route from Olympia to London was to be used , going by sea to Italy and then run through Switzerland and France . The route was modified only when Luxembourg and Belgium both requested that the torch travel their territories . A longer Greek route was planned , but reduced from an expected 750 kilometres ( 470 mi ) down to 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) due to concerns over instability in the country and a lack of security . 
 The torch lighting ceremony took place on 17 July 1948 in Olympia , Greece . As with the 1936 Summer Olympic relay , the torch relay was begun by focusing the sun 's rays onto kindling using a parabolic reflector , which then lit the first torch . The kindling was conducted by a Girl Guide leader from Pyrgos , Elis . She was only chosen the previous evening due to the unsettled state of the country ; the Athenian girl who was trained for the ceremony was unable to travel to Olympia . In a symbolic gesture , the first runner , Corporal <unk> of the Greek Army , laid down his arms and removed his military uniform before taking his torch in hand . The kindling material for the first torch was handed over as a gift from the Chairman of the Greek Olympic Committee to Collins , for Princess Elizabeth . It was then run to the Greek coast at Katakolo , where at 7 pm it boarded the Greek destroyer Hastings bound for the island of Corfu . It stayed overnight in the city of Corfu , and boarded HMS Whitesand Bay at 1 : 30 pm the following day where the flame was switched to a specially equipped butane gas torch in order to ensure that there was a 48 @-@ hour lifespan available for the flame , despite the crossing only being expected to take 22 hours . 
 The ship dropped the torch off in Bari at 12 : 30 pm on 19 July . It was run north through several Italian cities before crossing the Simplon Pass into Brig , Switzerland on 23 July . From there it was run west until leaving the country at <unk> @-@ <unk> , and entering France at Saint @-@ Julien @-@ en @-@ Genevois . The route then detours from the direct route to take in Luxembourg and into Belgium before re @-@ entering France at Lille on 28 July , finally departing the country at Calais . HMS Bicester carried the torch across the English Channel to Dover , arriving at 8 : 25 pm on 28 July . It travelled through several towns in the South East of England until it arrived at Wembley , where it arrived only thirty seconds late after the entire journey . That delay may have only been in the final few hundred yards of the relay down Olympic Way outside of Empire Stadium as the pressure of the crowds on the torch carrier and their escorts reduced the pace to walking speed . Special celebrations were held at each border crossing , and at Pierre de Coubertin 's tomb in Lausanne , Switzerland . 
 It was agreed for a secondary Olympic Flame to be lit in Torquay during the games , and a secondary torch relay was conducted to take the flame from Wembley south to the coast to Torquay . The arrangements were the same as from Dover to Wembley but in reverse . 
 = 2011 – 12 Washington Capitals season = 
 The 2011 – 12 Washington Capitals season was the franchise 's 38th season in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . Washington finished the year as the seventh place team in the Eastern Conference . In the opening round of the playoffs , they matched up with the defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins . Due to injuries , the Capitals were forced to play rookie goaltender Braden Holtby . Washington 's defeat of the Bruins marked the first time in NHL history in which all seven games of a series were decided by one goal . Facing the East 's top seed in the Conference Semifinals , Washington was defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers . Holtby was lauded for his playoff performance , where he recorded a <unk> save percentage and was credited with putting Washington in a position to win each game . 
 Washington won their first seven games , setting a franchise record for consecutive victories to start a season . Shortly after , however , an early season slump prompted the benching of offensive star players Alexander Ovechkin and Alexander Semin in separate games . The moves failed to produce results , and Head Coach Bruce Boudreau was eventually replaced by Dale Hunter . Boudreau 's firing came seven days after he won his 200th game as an NHL head coach , achieving the feat faster anyone in NHL history . Under Hunter , the Capitals battled the Florida Panthers for the Southeast Division title , ultimately losing out on their fifth @-@ straight division title on the final day of the season . Two days after Washington 's playoff elimination , Hunter stepped down as head coach ; Adam Oates was hired as his replacement . 
 Individually , Alexander Ovechkin and Dennis Wideman were named to the All @-@ Star Game . Due to a suspension for a reckless hit , however , Ovechkin elected not to attend the game to avoid being a distraction . Four Capitals were named one of the NHL 's weekly three stars – a total of five times throughout the season . Three players made their NHL debut , while Mike Knuble played in his 1,000th game . 
 = = Off @-@ season = = 
 During the off @-@ season , the Capitals made several player changes . One of the players that was not retained by the team , Matt Bradley , started a controversy with his comments from a radio interview in Ottawa . In the interview , Bradley said his former team was " a little bit too nonchalant and guys weren ’ t disciplined the way they should have been , " which he claimed were the two biggest reasons why the team was not able to advance past the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs . He later stated that Head Coach Bruce Boudreau did not give the most ice time to players who were playing well , but went with his star players . He further noted that Boudreau was a " great coach " who had been put in a tough position . When asked to point out examples , Bradley stated that Alexander Semin " could easily be the best player in the league , " but he " just doesn ’ t care , " further noting , " When you 've got a guy like that , you need him to be your best player , or one of your best players , and when he doesn 't show up , you almost get the sense that he wants to be back in Russia . " Semin 's agent came to his client 's defense , stating he " always cares . " Teammate Mike Knuble noted that because Semin speaks limited English , the language barrier affects the way that he is perceived , further noting that the interview comments were something Bradley regretted . When asked about the comments , former Capitals forward David Steckel stated that , " It 's not like he went out and told lies . " Bradley later apologized for his comments in an interview with the Sun Sentinel . 
 Including Bradley , the Capitals lost six players who played for them in the playoffs , as well as back @-@ up goaltender Semyon Varlamov . [ note 1 ] To replace some of the departed players , Washington traded its 2011 first round draft pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for veteran winger Troy Brouwer , who was a member of the Blackhawks ' Stanley Cup championship team in 2010 . They then signed Joel Ward as a free agent , adding grit and the hopes that he could duplicate his 2011 playoff success . Ward scored seven goals and 13 points in 12 playoff games with the Nashville Predators , after scoring 10 goals and 29 points in 80 regular season games . In net , they added veteran Tomas Vokoun , who was considered to be one of the top goaltenders in the 2011 free agent class . He signed a one @-@ year , $ 1 @.@ 5 million contract , well below his believed market value , to have a chance at winning the Stanley Cup . After making these and other off @-@ season moves , the Capitals were over the NHL salary cap . The expectation was that defenseman Tom Poti would not be able to play due to injury and Washington would be forced to place him on long @-@ term injured reserve , where his $ 2 @.@ 9 million salary would not count against the cap total . Unexpectedly , Poti told the Capitals that he would be ready to play by training camp . Poti , however , failed his medical exam prior to training camp and was placed on long @-@ term injured reserve . 
 = = Regular season = = 
 = = = October – November = = = 
 In the season opener against the Carolina Hurricanes , Boudreau made a " surprise " decision to start goaltender Michal Neuvirth . Boudreau stated that the reason behind his decision was a reward for Neuvirth 's hard work in training camp . Prior to the Capitals ' second game , Neuvirth sustained a bruised foot and was unable to play . In his Capitals debut , Vokoun struggled , allowing five goals on 28 shots , but nevertheless Washington won the game 6 – 5 in a shootout . In the post @-@ game interview , Vokoun blamed himself for the high number of goals and thanked his teammates for getting him the win in a game he should have lost . Vokoun rebounded in his second game , making 39 saves in a 3 – 2 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins . He continued his strong play and was named the NHL 's third star of the week ending October 23 and helped the Capitals to a franchise @-@ record seven game winning streak to start a season . 
 After losing two straight games , Washington was down 4 – 3 to the Anaheim Ducks in the final minutes of the game . With the goaltender pulled , Boudreau decided to play the third line of Joel Ward , Brooks Laich and Jason Chimera with Nicklas Backstrom as the extra attacker . Boudreau stated that he was " playing a hunch " by leaving star forward Alexander Ovechkin on the bench . The move paid off , however , as Backstrom scored to force overtime . He also scored the game winner in overtime assisted by Ovechkin . When asked about being left on the bench in a post @-@ game interview , Ovechkin stated that Laich 's line deserved to be on the ice – though the video showed Ovechkin visibly upset about being left on the bench . The following day , Ovechkin stated that he was upset about not being on the ice in the final minutes , but that he understood Boudreau 's decision . The Hockey News ' Ken Campbell applauded the benching of Ovechkin stating that in the past Boudreau had shown a willingness to continually put his star players out on the ice despite how they were playing and accepted the consequences . Campbell noted the move was Boudreau " addressing his most glaring problem as a coach " . 
 Following the benching incident , the Capitals went 2 – 5 – 0 leading up to their November 21 game against the Phoenix Coyotes . [ note 2 ] For the game , Boudreau again made headlines for not playing one of his star players , this time making Alexander Semin a healthy scratch ( a non @-@ dressing player ) . Semin led the team in penalties @-@ in @-@ minutes ( PIMs ) , as well as being tied for second in the NHL with 14 minor penalties . Boudreau previously benched Semin for the second half of a game against the New Jersey Devils after the winger had taken two minor penalties and was deemed not focused . Washington defeated Phoenix in the game 4 – 3 . NBC 's Mike Halford echoed Campbell 's statement when discussing the benching of Semin , commenting that it was a " bold move " and the latest in a series of messages sent by Boudreau . Halford further questioned if the new stance would eventually cost Boudreau his job . 
 The <unk> did not produce the desired results , however , as the Capitals lost six of eight games , with Ovechkin scoring only one goal during the same stretch . As a result , Washington fired Boudreau on November 28 and replaced him with former Capitals captain Dale Hunter . Hunter was the head coach of the Ontario Hockey League 's ( OHL ) London Knights when he was hired . During his time with London , he set an OHL record for fastest coach to 300 and 400 career wins . The Capitals lost Hunter 's coaching debut 2 – 1 to the St. Louis Blues . The following day , Boudreau spoke to the media about being fired , stating that General Manager George McPhee made the " right decision at the time " and that despite speculation , he did not feel that Ovechkin was a problem , stating that he " worked as hard and tried as hard as he could . " 
 = = = December – January = = = 
 The Capitals did not give Hunter his first NHL win until his third game , a 3 – 2 win over the Ottawa Senators that broke a four @-@ game losing streak . Brooks Laich scored the game @-@ winning goal just 12 seconds into the overtime period . The goal would prove to be the fastest overtime goal scored during the 2011 – 12 NHL regular season . In the rematch four days later , Ovechkin appeared to spear Senators forward Chris Neil . Following a Neil hit on Ovechkin , the pair skated up the ice , whereupon Neil fell to the ice following the alleged spear . Neil was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for diving . A spearing penalty , if called , would have resulted in a five @-@ minute major penalty and a game misconduct . Later in the game , Ovechkin scored the eventual game @-@ winning goal , his first goal in six games . When asked about the incident after the game , Neil described it as a " pitchfork in the gut , " while Ovechkin stated he was " not the type of guy who spears players . " The following day , a league spokesman stated that Ovechkin would not be suspended or fined for the incident . 
 The December 28 game against the New York Rangers marked the return of fourth line forward Jay Beagle , who previously missed 31 games with a concussion suffered in a fight against the Pittsburgh Penguins ' Arron Asham . The fight itself had generated a minor controversy , as Asham , an experienced fighter , made celebratory gestures after knocking out Beagle , who was in his first career NHL fight . Several Capitals expressed their displeasure with Asham after the game , while Asham himself later called his actions " classless . " Beagle 's work ethic in his return was called contagious by teammate Matt Hendricks , and he helped the Capitals to a 4 – 1 victory . 
 In late December , Ovechkin went on a seven @-@ game point streak that featured the two @-@ point games in the final four games of the streak . In conjunction with the point streak , he scored eight goals in nine games . [ note 3 ] Washington went 5 – 1 – 1 during the streak , which was eventually snapped in a 5 – 2 loss to the San Jose Sharks on January 7 . In the game prior to the streak being snapped , Capitals ' defenseman Mike Green returned from a groin injury that had kept him out of the lineup for 23 games . Washington defeated the Calgary Flames 3 – 1 in the contest , which moved their record to 9 – 0 – 0 with Green in the line @-@ up . However , the news coming out of the game was not all good . During the game , the Capitals ' leading scorer , Nicklas Backstrom , was elbowed in the head by the Flames ' Rene Bourque . Backstrom underwent concussion testing , which proved inconclusive ; he suffered from what was described as " concussion @-@ like symptoms " and was eventually placed on the injured reserve . For his actions , Bourque was suspended five games for delivering the elbow . Compounding the Capitals ' injury problem was the loss of Mike Green in just his second game back ; he re @-@ injured his groin during the contest and was placed on the long @-@ term injured reserve . During a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins , Ovechkin delivered a hit to Pittsburgh defenseman <unk> Michalek . On the hit , Ovechkin launched himself into Michalek 's shoulder , where the force of the hit caused Ovechkin to make contact with Michalek 's head . Later in the game , Michalek delivered an elbow to the back of Matt Hendricks ' head , driving it into the glass . The following day , it was announced that Ovechkin was suspended for three games for the reckless hit despite not receiving a penalty on the play during the game . Vice President of Player Safety Brendan Shanahan stated the length of the suspension took into account that Ovechkin was a repeat offender , having been suspended twice before and fined twice as well . It also took into consideration that Michalek was not injured on the play . Despite his own actions , Michalek avoided a fine or suspension . Without Ovechkin , Backstrom or Green , Washington nonetheless defeated defending Stanley Cup champion Boston Bruins in the final game before the All @-@ Star break to move into first place in the Southeast Division . 
 Washington had two players named to the NHL All @-@ Star Game . Despite having a poor season by his standards , Alexander Ovechkin was named to the Game . However , due to his suspension , Ovechkin announced that he did not want to be a distraction at the game ; he was " not comfortable " going , and declined to attend the All @-@ Star weekend . Dennis Wideman was the Capitals ' other All @-@ Star representative . He recorded 34 points heading into the break while averaging over 24 minutes of ice time per game . 
 = = = February – April = = = 
 Washington started the second half of the season with a 2 – 2 – 1 record . In their next game , against the Winnipeg Jets , the Capitals lost a two @-@ goal lead late in the game , eventually losing in a shootout . The loss knocked the Capitals out of first place in their division and they dropped from third to ninth in the conference . Washington lost their next two games before defeating the Southeast Division @-@ leading Florida Panthers 2 – 1 . The game marked goaltender Tomas Vokoun 's first game in Florida after leaving the team as a free agent in the off @-@ season . With the win , Washington moved two points behind the Panthers . Despite being close , however , Washington could not build any momentum , later losing their next three games before closing out the month of February on a three @-@ game win streak . 
 Washington continued its inconsistent play into the month of March , losing three games before going on a four @-@ game winning streak leading up to another game against the Winnipeg Jets . During the loss to the Jets , Vokoun re @-@ aggravated a reoccurring groin injury ; he had been dealing with the injury since late February , and it forced him out of the lineup . Braden Holtby was recalled to serve as the team 's back @-@ up . During Vokoun 's absence , Ovechkin began a goal @-@ scoring streak , notching nine goals in seven games , culminating in a two @-@ goal performance during a 3 – 0 victory over the Minnesota Wild . The scoring steak helped Ovechkin to be named NHL 's third star of the week . The win moved the Capitals into the eighth and final playoff spot . They did not remain there long , however , as their next game was a lost 5 – 1 to the Buffalo Sabres , who passed Washington for eighth place . The following game , against the Boston Bruins , Vokoun returned to action , but played only 18 : 25 before the same injury forced him from the game . Although the Capitals won the game , it was Vokoun 's final game of the season as well as his last as a Capital , with Vokoun later describing the injury as a " pretty severe [ groin ] tear . " Washington 's final game of March marked the return of Nicklas Backstrom , who had missed 40 games with a concussion . The Capitals won the game 3 – 2 in a shootout , moving them back into eighth place . 
 Entering April , the Capitals had a chance to clinch a playoff spot against the Tampa Bay Lightning . The game was tied 2 – 2 with 1 : 03 remaining when Steven Stamkos scored , leading Tampa to the eventual 4 – 2 victory . Facing the Division @-@ leading Panthers in their next game , Washington succeeded in clinching a playoff spot with a 4 – 2 win of their own . The victory also gave the Capitals a chance at winning their Division in their final game . During the game , Neuvirth was hurt when former Capital Marco Sturm fell on top of him while he was making a save . Neuvirth left after the incident and did not return . Neuvirth suffered a lower body injury and was not ready to return for the final game or the start of the playoffs . Washington won its final game of the year behind a 35 @-@ save performance from Holtby , clinching at least the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference pending the outcome of Florida ’ s game . A win by the Panthers in their final game , however , prevented Washington from winning their fifth @-@ straight Division title and moving into the third playoff seed . 
 = = Playoffs = = 
 Finishing the regular season as the seventh seed , Washington was matched up with the defending champion Boston Bruins . As Tomas Vokoun and Michal Neuvirth were still injured , the Capitals were forced to start Braden Holtby in Game 1 . Through the first two periods , Boston was in control of the game , out @-@ shooting Washington 26 – 7 . Despite the disparity in shots , the game remained tied 0 – 0 after regulation . Washington lost the game shortly into overtime . They rebounded to tie the series when Nicklas Backstrom scored in double overtime of game two . Through the first two games of the series , Holtby stopped 72 of 74 Bruins ' shots . In Game 3 , the two teams again looked to be heading to overtime tied 3 – 3 late in the third when Backstrom took a penalty . Zdeno Chara scored on the man advantage with under two minutes remaining , giving Boston the win . After the game ended , Backstrom was given a match penalty for intent to injure following a cross @-@ check to Rich <unk> . Backstrom received a one @-@ game suspension for his actions . Without Backstrom in Game 4 , the Capitals evened the series with a 2 – 1 victory that featured a 44 @-@ save performance from Holtby . The Capitals took their first lead in the series thanks to a Troy Brouwer power @-@ play goal with 1 : 27 left in regulation of game five .

Ovechkin noted that he was excited to play under a coach he believed would bring more offense back to Washington 's system . Oates ' hiring came on the same day that he was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player .

 Entering the season , Boudreau had amassed 189 wins in 309 NHL games . The win total put him on track to surpass Don Cherry as the fastest head coach to reach 200 NHL victories . After reaching 199 wins , Washington went on a four @-@ game losing streak before finally earning Boudreau the milestone win . Despite the losing streak , Boudreau registered his 200th win in 326 games , eclipsing Cherry 's previous mark of 341 games . While Boudreau set the record , he had the advantage of overtime and shootout victories , which did not exist during Cherry 's coaching career . Boudreau was fired seven days after setting the record . 
 Besides Ovechkin 's March and Vokoun 's third star award , Washington had players named NHL weekly stars three other times .

 Going into the off @-@ season , there was concern over the future of goaltender Semyon Varlamov . Washington had given the restricted free agent a qualifying offer , giving the Capitals the right to match any other NHL offers or receive draft pick compensation if they did not match . Though Washington had control of his negotiating rights , Varlamov indicated that he would leave the NHL to play in the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) . He stated that while he wanted to play in the NHL , he did not want to be a back @-@ up . If Varlamov left the League , Washington would not receive any compensation but would retain his NHL rights . In the KHL , a war for Varlamov 's services was developing . Lokomotiv Yaroslav claimed to retain Varlamov 's KHL rights and wanted to sign him to a contract around $ 2 million a season . Alternatively , SKA Saint Petersburg filed a complaint with the KHL , stating his rights were not owned because his original contract with Yaroslav predated the formation of the KHL and was therefore invalid . Before the situation could be resolved , the Capitals traded Varlamov 's rights to the Colorado Avalanche for a first round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft , along with a conditional second @-@ round selection 2012 or 2013 . Following the trade , team owner Ted Leonsis noted that Varlamov " wanted assurances that we couldn ’ t make to him . " He was disappointed , but wished Varlamov well with Colorado . The Avalanche then signed the goaltender to a three @-@ year , $ 8 @.@ 5 million contract , thus keeping him in the NHL .

 The 2011 NHL Entry Draft was held in St. Paul , Minnesota , on June 24 and 25 . Heading into the draft , the Capitals had only five picks due to a variety of trades , which was tied for the fewest in franchise history . Believing that they had prospect depth in their organization and not seeing an available player who could help immediately , Washington traded their first round pick for Troy Brouwer . With just late round selections remaining , the Capitals decided to take players that required time to develop . Three of their four picks were in , or set to attend , college . Fourth @-@ round pick Steffen <unk> , the lone player not attending college , played in the GET @-@ ligaen , Norway 's highest level of competition . At the 2011 IIHF World U18 Championships , he posted the second @-@ highest save percentage in the tournament and was considered one of Norway 's top three players , though no Norwegian goaltender has ever played an NHL game .

 = Cris and Cru Kahui homicides = 
 The deaths of brothers Christopher <unk> and Cru Omeka Kahui ( 20 March 2006 – 18 June 2006 ) , two New Zealand infants from a Māori family who died in Auckland 's Starship Children 's Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries , highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than twice as likely to die as a result of abuse than non @-@ Māori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report . 
 Their family initially refused to cooperate with police in the homicide investigation into the children 's deaths . The father , 21 @-@ year @-@ old , Christopher Sonny Kahui was charged with their murder . His defence was that the mother was responsible for the deaths . After a six @-@ week trial , the jury took just one minute to acquit him . 
 A coroner 's report released in July 2012 concluded that the children 's injuries occurred " whilst they were in the sole custody , care and control of their father " . 
 = = Before deaths = = 
 Chris and Cru Kahui were the two survivors of triplets born prematurely at 29 weeks on 20 March 2006 at the National Women 's Hospital in Grafton , New Zealand . They spent six weeks at the Kidz First neonatal intensive care unit at <unk> Hospital . During this time , nurses and social workers at the facility had informally raised concerns with a Department of Child , Youth and Family Services worker , as the parents , Chris Kahui and Macsyna King , did not spend a lot of time with the babies . According to the hospital , parents not visiting is not considered child abuse , but was a " cause for concern " . 
 Because the infants were still technically patients of <unk> Hospital , hospital workers regularly visited the family home . During their last visit to the hospital , Chris and Cru were reported to be healthy and well @-@ fed . However , an autopsy showed that the infants had suffered fractured ribs in an incident prior to the fatal injuries . 
 = = Deaths = = 
 On 13 June , the infants ' mother , Macsyna King , returned to the house after being away overnight . She found that the boys suffered extensive bruises , and that their grandfather , William " Banjo " Kahui , had performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on them . Police said the grandfather was not the only person in the house at the time . According to former MP John <unk> , a member of the Kahui extended family had said " a young relative " was caring for the babies the day they were fatally injured . King and her husband took their children to the family G.P. , who ordered immediate hospitalisation for the infants . The Coroner made a finding that Chris Kahui refused to take the children to hospital , running away from the family car and leaving a distraught Macsyna King carrying two babies in their carriers into the hospital on her own . Doctors immediately discovered that the infants had serious brain injuries . After the infants were transferred to Starship Hospital , hospital workers notified the police . The Kahui infants were ultimately taken off life support , with Cru being the first to die at 5 a.m. on 18 June . Chris died at 6 : 45 p.m. later in the day . The deaths resulted in an initial serious assault investigation by the New Zealand Police before charges were upgraded to homicide . 
 Both infants had suffered skull fractures from blunt force trauma and Chris Kahui had a broken femur . An orthopaedic specialist told The Sunday Star @-@ Times that in order to break the femur of a baby , the bone would have to bend at a 90 degree angle , ruling out an accidental cause of the injury . 
 The bodies were released to the family on 21 June and taken to the <unk> marae for a <unk> ( funeral rites ) . They were buried at the Manukau City cemetery on 24 June . 
 While the infants were in hospital , Child , Youth and Family removed a 12 @-@ month @-@ old brother Shane and their female cousin Cayenne , aged six months from two rented Housing New Zealand homes — one in Clendon , the other in <unk> — where the Kahui babies had lived . Police said they were treated in hospital for injuries resulting from " neglect " . They had been found to be malnourished and " dirty " . According to the Herald on Sunday newspaper , the two children were to be returned to the family in September 2006 . But neither the parents or so @-@ called " Tight 12 " of family members who initially refused to cooperate with police , would be their caregivers . 
 = = Homicide investigation = = 
 The police believe that , while the infants were in hospital prior to their deaths , the family was uncooperative with any investigation . Pita Sharples , the co @-@ leader of the Māori Party , said the family had agreed to talk to police on 26 June , but this did not happen . Following the deaths , Sharples said he was disgusted by the Kahui family 's behaviour . He claimed some members of the family were more interested in going " to the pub and have a drink " than coming forward to police . Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was " absolutely shocking " for the family to hide behind the funeral while everyone in the country was " shocked and revolted " by the injuries . There were even reports that gang members were threatening the Kahui family in <unk> ( or revenge ) over their refusal to speak . 
 After refusing to speak to police in the week after the death , police went to family homes on 27 June . At least four family members , including the children 's mother and aunt , were escorted to police stations . By 4 July , at least 20 extended family members were questioned , as well as 90 medical practitioners and staff who were in contact with the babies . Forensic scientists removed items such as clothing from the Kahui homes . By September , police said that the family was no longer " stone @-@ walling " their inquiries , but a prima facie case had yet to be established . Sunday News reported on 17 September that the list of suspects was down to three and an arrest was imminent . This was followed by a police statement nine days later stating that they now knew who was responsible for the deaths . However , other family members could still be charged with related crimes . 
 Two half @-@ sisters of the infants ' mother Macsyna King , appeared on TVNZ 's Sunday 23 July episode . They claimed that Macsyna and her brother , Robert King , had told them the name of the killer . TVNZ censored the name when one of the women said it , but the gender was revealed to be male . The infants ' paternal grandmother , who appeared the next day on TV3 's Campbell Live , contradicted this information , stating that the killer was female . 
 The homes where the babies lived were also home to at least nine adult occupants , eight of whom were on some form of social welfare . They may have been receiving payments totalling between $ 845 and $ 1395 a week , depending on their age and circumstances . Work and Income New Zealand launched an investigation to see whether all the payments were legitimate . Two instances of substantiated benefit fraud were found for one individual . The Clendon house had been occupied for two to three months , but neighbours had not noticed that babies were living there . According to the neighbours , Tuesday and Thursday nights were " party nights , " as this was when benefit payments were received . Loud music and fighting were often heard . One neighbour said that a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old female appeared on their doorstep at 3 : 30 a.m. one morning after she said an older man at the Clendon house attempted to sexually assault her . 
 = = = Murder arrest = = = 
 The 1 October edition of the Sunday Star @-@ Times newspaper published an interview with the infants ' father , Chris Kahui . Kahui said that he did not kill his sons , but if Police could not find anyone else , " I go down for something I didn 't do " . Investigators called Kahui 's interview with the police on 3 October a " major development " . 
 On 26 October , a " carload of detectives " had gone to several addresses looking for Chris Kahui , who was brought in for questioning . At 10 p.m. , it was announced in a press conference that a 21 @-@ year @-@ old man had been arrested and charged with the murder of the infants , and would appear in the Manukau District Court the next day . No other family members faced charges with relation to the deaths . 
 Contrary to this , the Sunday News reported on 31 December 2006 that , according to an unnamed source , a second arrest was expected . Neither the exact charges that would be laid nor the relationship of the person to the infants were revealed . Three weeks later the same newspaper said four people involved in the investigation had been summoned to the appear at the Manukau district court on 24 January . Sources told the newspaper that the new charges relate to dead infants and a pre @-@ school child . One of those to be charged was Macsyna King , the mother of Chris and Cru . None of these charges eventuated . 
 According to the Herald on Sunday , the Microsoft Word file containing the press release announcing the arrest of Kahui had actually been created five days earlier , and the last edit was the day before the arrest . In the same article , the Herald reported the Police were questioning whether Kahui was actually the biological father of the infants . DNA tests later confirmed that he was the father . 
 = = = Court appearances = = = 
 Kahui appeared in the Number One court of the Manukau District Court on 27 October for a two @-@ minute hearing , where he was formally charged with murder . He was asked not to plead ; however , outside the court , Kahui 's lawyer , Lorraine Smith , said her client would " fight the charges " . He was remanded in police custody until 10 November when he was freed on bail . A pre @-@ depositions hearing was held 17 January . 
 A second pre @-@ depositions hearing was intended to take place on 21 March . This was so his lawyer could read 60 files of evidence collected by police , and for a medical expert from Australia to become available . This second hearing was delayed because the defence was still waiting for the medical report from Australia . The depositions hearing was finally set for 18 June , with a brief court appearance on 18 April . This date was later changed to sometime on 13 August . 
 Kahui was found not guilty on Thursday 22 May 2008 , after only one minute of deliberation by the jury . The officer who led the police investigations into the murders , Detective Inspector John Tims , said he was " disappointed " at the verdict , finding " no evidence to support a charge against any other person and that includes the mother , Macsyna King " . He acknowledged the prosecutor , who had " said in his opening and closing address that there is no new evidence to support a charge being laid against the mother , Macsyna King " . No charges were laid against Macsyna King . 
 Kahui 's lawyer has threatened to lodge a complaint with the Police Complaints Authority over Police handling of the prosecution of her client for the murder of Chris and Cru Kahui .

He said there was no evidence or fact to support that injuries being caused by the children 's mother , Macsyna King . Chris Kahui , who gave evidence to the coroner 's inquest , attempted to prevent the publication of the report .

He is a variation of Francis Urquhart , the protagonist of the British novel and television series House of Cards , from which the American Netflix series is adapted . He is married to Claire Underwood ( Robin Wright ) , but also had a sexual relationship with Zoe Barnes ( Kate Mara ) in season 1 . He made his first appearance in the series ' pilot episode , " Chapter 1 " . 
 Underwood is from Gaffney , South Carolina . He graduated from The Sentinel , a fictionalized version of The Citadel , The Military College of South Carolina , and Harvard Law School .

The character speaks with a Southern accent . During season 1 , he is the Democratic Majority Whip in the United States House of Representatives . In season 2 , he is the newly appointed Vice President of the United States , before becoming President of the United States in the season finale .

 Spacey has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Frank Underwood , but the character itself has been criticized for it 's repetitive nature and one dimensionality . Spacey shared the distinction of being among the first three leading web @-@ television roles to be nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards . Spacey has also been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards , winning one , and five Screen Actors Guild Awards , including two cast nominations and including two wins , for his performance .

He was raised in impoverished circumstances , with the threat of bank foreclosure on their farm they lived on . He entered the The Sentinel , a military school in Charleston , South Carolina , loosely based on The Citadel , The Military College of South Carolina , in 1976 of which he was nearly expelled from due to suffering grades after he volunteered for a U.S. Senate campaign in 1980 , however , he graduated soon after and was accepted into Harvard Law School that fall . Despite poor grades at The Sentinel , he was able to graduate from law school in 1984 . He had a homosexual relationship with his friend from military school , Tim Corbet , during his first year of law school . Underwood was raised Christian , but privately holds God in complete contempt .

 Underwood 's great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandfather , Corporal Augustus Elijah Underwood , was a Confederate soldier who served in the 12th South Carolina Infantry Regiment of McGowan 's Brigade at the Battle of Spotsylvania . He served at the Bloody Angle on May 12 , 1864 , during the Civil War and was killed by a bludgeon to the back of the head from his own regiment during the middle of the night . Underwood is fascinated by his ancestry . When Underwood fell in a coma following an assassination attempt , Augustus appears in several of his hallucinations . However , he dismisses the Confederacy as weak and calls their cause of preserving the institution of slavery " asinine " . His great @-@ great grandfather was two when Augustus was killed . 
 His father , Calvin T. Underwood , was a peach farmer in his home town of Gaffney who died at the age of 43 of a heart attack . The Underwoods lived in poverty , and nearly lost the farm when Frank was a child ; to get a bank loan and avoid foreclosure , his father attended a meeting of the Ku Klux Klan , of which the bank manager was a member . Underwood speaks fondly of his father in public , but this is a political ploy ; in his asides to the audience , Underwood describes his father as a weak man who accomplished nothing with his life . He even urinates on his father 's grave in season 3 . Despite disliking his father , however , Underwood was influenced by him . Calvin was an abusive alcoholic , and caused his wife and son years of misery . Underwood has said that when he was 13 , he walked in on his father putting a shotgun in his mouth . Calvin asked him to pull the trigger , which he refused to do . He has stated that his biggest regret is not killing his father when he had the chance .

 Underwood was elected at the age of 25 to the South Carolina State Senate as one of the youngest members in the state 's legislative history after graduating from Harvard in 1984 . He was re @-@ elected to the state senate at 29 in 1988 for his second , and last , term as a State Senator . 
 = = = = Representative Election = = = = 
 Underwood was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990 as a Democratic representative for the 5th Congressional District of South Carolina , being sworn in around January 1991 . He won another 11 consecutive elections , winning his final term in 2012 . He was elected Whip for the Democratic Party in 2005 , serving as House Majority Whip between 2005 and 2013 . 
 Often , Underwood 's thoughts throughout the series are presented in a direct address to the audience , a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall . Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards , Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare 's Richard III as Richard III of England , a character that serves as a partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood . His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood , who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901 . Among his few vices are smoking cigarettes . He has a hobby of playing video games ; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President , he takes up creating model figurines . 
 Spacey viewed portraying Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process . " There is so much I don ’ t know about Francis , so much that I 'm learning ... I 've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective ... We are given clues by writers ... Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who ’ s complex and surprising , maybe even to yourself . " 
 Underwood 's sexuality is ambiguous throughout much of the first two seasons ; he has sexual liaisons with both men and women , but he is never explicitly identified by any sexual label . Before Season 2 , various sources speculated about his homosexuality . It is revealed in " Chapter 8 " he had an experience with homosexuality in college . Underwood and Claire are never depicted having sex in season 1 . Slate journalist Hanna Rosin noted : if Frank and Claire Underwood were a real @-@ life Washington couple and they were found each to be having an affair , he would be accused of being " secretly gay , turned on by women only when he can use them for a pure power play " . Other sources make no definite stance on Underwood 's sexuality , but hypothesize that he is not sexually attracted to Claire . In season 2 , Underwood is involved in a threesome with Claire and Secret Service agent Edward Meechum ( Nathan Darrow ) , while in season 3 , there is a moment of sexual tension between Underwood and his biographer , Tom Yates ( Paul Sparks ) . The same season , however , also features the only scene in the series in which Underwood and Claire have sex exclusively with each other . 
 According to Time television critic James Poniewozik , by the end of the first episode , it becomes clear that Underwood both literally and figuratively uses meat as his metaphor of choice . He may begin a day with a celebratory rack of ribs , because " I 'm feelin ' hungry today ! " , and he depicts his life with meat metaphors . For example , he describes the White House Chief of Staff with grudging admiration : " She ’ s as tough as a two @-@ dollar steak " and plans to destroy an enemy the way " you devour a whale . One bite at a time " . He also endures a tedious weekly meeting with House leaders , as he tells the audience , by " [ imagining ] their lightly salted faces frying in a skillet . " 
 Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter notes that , in Season 2 , with Underwood 's new position as Vice President , " He 's got more power now and that means he instills more fear in his enemies " . At one point during the season , he states " The road to power is paved with hypocrisy and casualties . I need to prove what the vice president is capable of . " Underwood and Claire " continue their ruthless rise to power as threats mount on all fronts . " 
 = = = Underwood vs. Urquhart = = = 
 Underwood is an Americanized version of the original BBC series lead character Francis Urquhart , a Machiavellian post @-@ Margaret Thatcher Chief Whip of the Conservative Party . Urquhart employs deceit , cunning , murder , and blackmail to influence and pursue the office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom . According to series producer Beau Willimon , the change in last name stemmed from the " Dickensian " feeling and " more legitimately American " sounding resonance of the name ' Underwood ' . Whereas Urquhart is an aristocrat by birth , Underwood is a self @-@ made man . Urquhart was one of television 's first antiheroes , whereas Underwood follows the more recent rash of antiheroes that includes Tony Soprano of The Sopranos , Walter White of Breaking Bad , and Dexter Morgan of Dexter . However , unlike most other antiheroes , Underwood is not forced into immorality either by circumstance ( White ) , birth ( Soprano ) or upbringing ( Morgan ) . In his review of Season 2 , Slant Magazine 's Alan Jones writes that Underwood is evil by choice . Although the character is based on the BBC show 's lead character , in interviews during the writing and filming of season 2 , creator and showrunner Willimon said that he used Lyndon B. Johnson as a source of themes and issues addressed in House of Cards . Unlike the right @-@ wing Urquhart , who leads the Conservative Party , the center @-@ left Underwood is a member of the Democratic Party , but cares little for ideology in favor of " ruthless pragmatism " in furthering his own political influence and power . 
 = = = Relationship with Claire Underwood = = = 
 Stelter described Frank and Claire Underwood as a " scheming " couple . Michael Dobbs , the author of the trilogy of novels upon which the British miniseries is based , compares the compelling nature of their relationship favorably to the characters in the original miniseries , and likens them to Macbeth and Lady Macbeth . Underwood has strong feelings for Claire , and frequently plots with her at night . He says , " I love that woman . I love her more than sharks love blood . " While Underwood is Machiavellian , Claire , like Lady Macbeth , encourages her husband to do whatever is necessary to seize power . Hank Stuever of The Washington Post describes her as an ice @-@ queen wife . She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness , saying , " My husband doesn ’ t apologize ... even to me . " Her overt encouragement gives a credibility to their symbiosis . Smith says " The Underwoods have proven themselves almost robotic in their pursuit of power . " Upon viewing a four @-@ episode preview of season 2 , Goodman says the series " ... sells husband and wife power @-@ at @-@ all @-@ costs couple ... as a little too oily and reptilian for anyone 's good . " Willimon notes that " What 's extraordinary about Frank and Claire is there is deep love and mutual respect , but the way they achieve this is by operating on a completely different set of rules than the rest of us typically do . " Los Angeles Times critic Mary McNamara makes the case that House of Cards is a love story on many levels , but most importantly between Underwood and Claire . It is a story about a man who will commit almost any crime imaginable while in pursuit of power and a political wife who gives him the encouragement to pursue that power . 
 Underwood and Claire engage in a threesome with their Secret Service bodyguard Edward Meechum at one point in season 2 , but have otherwise largely given up <unk> and extramarital sex in favor of their pursuit of power . International Business Times critic Ellen <unk> notes that this may relate back to Underwood 's quotation of Oscar Wilde to Zoe Barnes in Season 1 : " A great man once said , ' everything is about sex except sex . Sex is about power . ' " Avoiding sex may retain the balance of power in their relationship . His relationship with Claire is the epicenter of season 2 . 
 = = = Relationship with Zoe Barnes = = = 
 Underwood develops an intimate relationship with Washington Herald and Slugline reporter Zoe Barnes ( Kate Mara ) , with Claire 's knowledge . As the show begins , Barnes is desperate to rise from covering the Fairfax County Council beat to covering what 's going on behind the veil of power in the Capitol hallways . " By the end of the first episode , Barnes is among the cadre of Underwood 's accomplices . They begin a relationship , with Barnes promising to earn his trust and not " ask any questions " in return for his supplying her with sensitive political information . Toward the end of Season 1 , she ends their personal relationship and begins investigating his connection to Congressman Peter Russo 's apparent suicide ( Underwood had in fact killed him by locking him in his car in a closed garage ) . Underwood ultimately kills Barnes in the season 2 premiere , by pushing her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train after she begins to follow clues related to the murder .

 Underwood is fond of the head of his Secret Service detail , Edward Meechum ( Nathan Darrow ) , and it is hinted several times that they harbor unacknowledged sexual feelings for each other . When Meechum stumbles upon Underwood watching pornography , Underwood and Claire joke about there being sexual chemistry between the two men . Shortly after Underwood becomes vice president , he , Claire and Meechum have a threesome . 
 Meechum remains Underwood 's bodyguard once he becomes the president , and there does not appear to be any continuing sexual relationship . Meechum remains fiercely loyal , however ; he warns Underwood 's biographer Tom Yates ( Paul Sparks ) not to write anything that would damage Underwood 's reputation . In season 4 , Underwood traces Meechum 's hand with a marker on one of the walls of the White House when he wants to replace a confederate painting ; Meechum suggests he put up something he likes instead . 
 When Lucas Goodwin shoots Underwood during a campaign event , Meechum trades fire with the assassin , and both are killed instantly . Meechum 's death is one of the tragedies Claire mentions in a press briefing for a gun control bill she is sponsoring , and Underwood has him buried in Arlington National Cemetery , a rare privilege for a Secret Service agent . When Underwood recovers and finds that Meechum 's hand tracing has been painted over , he expresses grief and regret at the loss to Claire , who says that Meechum was one of the few people who truly understood them . 
 = = = Breaking the fourth wall = = = 
 Spacey summed up Underwood 's relationship with the viewer - i.e. whenever he breaks the fourth wall - as being like that of a " best friend " and " the person [ he trusts ] more than anyone . " Because of this , his asides to the viewer serves as an indication of Underwood 's true feelings and intentions - typically when he is feigning politeness and courtesy to people whom he despises . In the season 2 premiere , after having gone the whole episode without doing so , Underwood addresses the viewer directly , saying , " Did you think I had forgotten you ? Perhaps you hoped I had . " In addition , in season 3 , after an argument with Claire that ends with her storming out on him , he looks directly at the viewer and snaps , " What 're you lookin ' at ? ! " For the first four seasons , Underwood was the only character to break the fourth wall until the very end of the fourth season , during which his wife Claire - though silent - addresses the camera directly with Frank .

 At the start of the show , Underwood is a Democratic Majority Whip in the House of Representatives , where he has represented South Carolina 's 5th congressional district since 1990 . 
 Underwood is passed over for an appointment as United States Secretary of State even though he had been promised the position after ensuring the election of Colorado Governor Garrett Walker ( Michel Gill ) as President . Walker 's Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez ( Sakina Jaffrey ) gives him this news prior to the January 2013 United States presidential inauguration . With the aid of Claire , and his fiercely loyal Chief of Staff Doug Stamper ( Michael Kelly ) , Underwood uses his position as House Whip to seek retribution . He quickly allies with Washington Herald reporter Zoe Barnes ( Kate Mara ) , whom he uses to undermine his rivals via the press . The viciousness of Underwood 's manipulations escalates over the course of the season . He befriends Pennsylvania Rep. Peter Russo ( Corey Stoll ) , encouraging him to quit drinking and run for Governor of Pennsylvania ; then his underlings create enough pressure in the race to push Russo into publicly falling off the wagon and ruining his career , and finally murders him and makes it look like suicide . He then persuades Vice President Jim Matthews ( Dan <unk> ) to resign so he can run for the office he previously held , Governor of Pennsylvania , the race being wide open following Russo 's death . In the season finale , " Chapter 13 " , Underwood is appointed Vice President to replace Matthews . 
 = = = Season 2 = = = 
 Underwood assumes the position of Vice President of the United States . Over the course of the season , he " faces challenges from similarly ambitious businessmen , the Chinese government and Congress itself " as he continues to pursue his political aspirations . His plotline revolves around battles with billionaire Raymond Tusk ( Gerald McRaney ) , involving Chinese money laundering . Over the course of the season his biggest challenges are the institutional power of the Office of the President and Tusk 's power as a billionaire industrialist . 
 He finds new rivals in Tusk , who seeks to maintain his position as Walker 's right @-@ hand adviser against Underwood 's intrusion , and his former communications director , Remy Danton ( <unk> Ali ) , who is now a lobbyist working with Tusk . 
 At the beginning of the season , Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo 's death . Thus , he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train , and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin ( Sebastian Arcelus ) for cyberterrorism . Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority Whip . He supports Jacqueline Sharp ( Molly Parker ) , a military veteran and third @-@ term Representative from California , although he refrains from offering public backing . 
 Toward the end of the season , Underwood orchestrates Walker 's downfall . He secretly leaks the details of the money laundering , for which Walker is blamed . While publicly supporting Walker , Underwood works behind the scenes to have him impeached , with Sharp 's help . In the season finale , " Chapter 26 " , Walker resigns , and Underwood succeeds him as President of the United States . 
 = = = Season 3 = = = 
 Season 3 begins with Underwood 's presidency off to a rocky start : six months into his term , he is unpopular with the public , and Congress is blocking his attempts to move legislation forward . He plans to secure his legacy with an ambitious jobs bill , America Works , but the Democratic Congressional leadership refuses to support it ; they also tell him that they will not support him if he seeks the presidential nomination in the next election . To make matters worse , Claire 's nomination for United States Ambassador to the United Nations is defeated after she makes a gaffe during a Senate nomination hearing . 
 Underwood announces that he will not run for reelection , and advocates for America Works , which he intends to pay for by stripping entitlement programs . He fails to get the jobs bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016 . Solicitor General Heather Dunbar ( Elizabeth Marvel ) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination , and actually gives Underwood a battle . Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy , for the sole reason of sapping women ’ s votes from Dunbar , at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP . After the presidential debate , where Underwood attacks Dunbar and Sharp , she announces her withdrawal from the race , and gives her support to Dunbar . Ultimately , however , Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses . 
 Meanwhile , the Underwoods ' marriage is faltering . Underwood gives Claire the ambassador job in a recess appointment , but she is forced to resign in order to solve a diplomatic crisis . Claire begins to question whether she still loves her husband , and they get into an ugly fight in which he tells her that she is nothing without him . Season 3 ends with Claire leaving Underwood as he prepares for the New Hampshire primary . 
 = = = Season 4 = = = 
 Underwood trails Dunbar in the polls , eventually losing the New Hampshire primary . Realizing that he needs Claire to win , he persuades her to come back by promising to support her run for a Senate seat in Texas . However , he sandbags her prospective candidacy by endorsing a political ally 's daughter , in order to keep Claire focused on his campaign . On the day of the South Carolina primary , Claire retaliates by arranging for two compromising photos to be leaked : one of Underwood 's father with a Klansman , and one of Underwood posing with a Confederate Civil War re @-@ enactor , putting his campaign in jeopardy . Underwood deduces that Claire was behind the leaks , and confronts her . Claire calmly admits what she did , and puts forth a proposition : that she run as his vice president . He angrily rejects the idea . 
 Lucas Goodwin is released from prison and , seeking revenge for Barnes ' death , shoots Underwood at a campaign rally , hitting him in the liver . He also mortally wounds Meechum , who manages to kill him before succumbing to his wounds . Underwood is rushed to the hospital for immediate surgery , rendering him in a coma . It is soon discovered that he needs a liver transplant . Stamper manages to bump him to the top of the transplant list , and he survives . Once he recovers , he agrees to let Claire run as his vice president . 
 After Dunbar drops out of the race due to the discovery of a meeting she 'd had with Goodwin a few days before the attempt on Underwood 's life , Underwood begins planning to maneuver Claire into the VP spot and to use the NSA to illegally obtain voter information and spy on the Republican nominee , Will Conway ( Joel Kinnaman ) . This happens while Underwood and Claire advocate for a controversial gun control bill for the sole purpose of creating an atmosphere divisive enough to weed out potential running mates . During the resulting open convention , Underwood intimidates the front @-@ runner , Secretary of State Catherine Durant ( Jayne Atkinson ) , into surrendering her delegates , and uses the public sympathy from Claire 's mother 's death to ensure that he and Claire are nominated . 
 When American extremists loyal to the terrorist group Islamic Caliphate Organization ( ICO ) kidnaps a suburban family , Underwood allows Conway to negotiate with them , making his opponent look like a hero - and then releases NSA data that proves Conway illegally influenced Congress . Soon afterward , however , Underwood is hit with two crises at once : ICO 's leader orders his followers to kill one of the hostages , while journalist Tom Hammerschmidt ( Boris McGiver ) exposes Underwood 's crimes in the Washington Herald . Facing disgrace and possible impeachment , Underwood decides to declare war on ICO and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that he and Claire can exploit in the weeks before the election .

 The New York Times ' David Itzkoff called Underwood a " scheming politician " who does " some of the most evil and underhanded things imaginable " . Brian Stelter of The New York Times said Underwood " … is on a quest for power that ’ s just as suspenseful as anything on television . " New York Daily News critic Don Kaplan says " … conniving Congressman Frank Underwood , is easily one of the most complex antiheroes on TV — except he ’ s not on TV " . David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle describes the character as one who " all but <unk> over the chance to use his considerable power to gain more power , especially if it involves pulling the rug out from under some colleagues and the wool over the eyes of others . " 
 Andrew Davies , the producer of the original UK TV series , feels that Underwood lacks the " charm " of the original character , Francis Urquhart . 
 The Independent praised Spacey 's portrayal as a more " menacing " character , " hiding his rage behind Southern charm and old @-@ fashioned courtesy , " while The New Republic noted that " When Urquhart addressed the audience , it was partly in the spirit of conspiratorial fun . His asides sparked with wit . He wasn 't just ruthlessly striving , he was amusing himself , mocking the ridiculousness of his milieu . There is no impishness about Spacey ’ s Frank Underwood , just numb , machine @-@ like ambition . Even his affection for his wife is a calculation . " 
 Poniewozik praises Underwood 's accent , saying " Spacey gives Underwood a silky Southern accent you could pour over crushed ice and sip with a sprig of mint on Derby Day . " Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes the accent as a " mild but sometimes missing Carolina accent " . Time listed Frank Underwood among the 11 most influential fictional characters in 2013 . 
 = = = Season 2 = = = 
 According The Kansas City Star 's Smith , " Frank hasn ’ t changed , and neither has his brand of Machiavellian political theater " and " Spacey has lost none of his smarmy magnetism as the cartoonish villain " . According to Variety 's Brian Lowry , " Kevin Spacey ’ s showy performance as an unscrupulous politician " is foremost among the show 's strengths , but the show 's weakness is the " failure to present its scheming protagonist with equally matched foes " . Lowry feels that as conniving as Underwood is , it is unfathomable that " nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him " . Goodman says " Spacey is nothing if not constantly magnetic " . The delayed use of the fourth wall is perceived as clever . Alison Willmore of Indiewire says that " Unlike Walter White or Tony Soprano , Frank feels at peace with his ruthless pragmatism and what he does in pursuit of power , and reminds us of the fact in his asides to the camera ... he may be a ruthless sociopath , but there 's something to admire there " . However Willmore noted that Frank became lighter in season 2 noting that the season was " ... delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before . " 
 Poniewozik notes that " It also remains a delight to watch Spacey pump the humid breath of life into House of Cards ’ arid Capitol chill . If only his character weren ’ t so dominant of his surroundings as well . One reason the series ’ movements can feel so mechanical is that , so far , no one seems nearly in Underwood ’ s league : not the adversaries he battles directly , nor the sad sacks that he gulls without their even knowing it . " Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News notes that the preview episodes show that " Frank 's " Survivor " -like back @-@ stabbing is beginning to feel a bit repetitive . " and that his lack of an adversarial foil has become an issue : " ... things always seem to fall neatly into place for him . Even his showdowns with the president ( Michel Gill ) come off as one @-@ sided ... " Verne Gay of Newsday notes that " Frank Underwood has no remorse , no superannuated sense of Washington tradition or decorum , and certainly no second thoughts . He is TV 's perfect monster of the moment - a compleat malefactor , with a pleasing honey @-@ toned drawl . " 
 Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times says " By positing a <unk> power broker and master schemer who wields <unk> influence behind the scenes , House of Cards assigns order and purpose to what , in real life , is too often just an endless , baffling tick @-@ tack @-@ toe stalemate . " NPR 's Eric Deggans says that Underwood " blends velvety charm and mesmerizing menace like no other character on television " . 
 New York Observer critic Drew Grant notes that although the series aired during the golden age of dramatic antiheroes , Underwood 's villainy has become trite : " House of Cards is a good reminder , however , that there is a reason Iago wasn ’ t the center of Othello . <unk> , unexplained cruelty can be as pedantic as constant kindness . " 
 However , Hitfix reviewer , Alan Sepinwall was highly critical of Spacey 's performance and accused him of " hamming it up " and " phoning it in on a not very good show to begin with " . 
 = = = Season 3 = = = 
 Reviews for season 3 of House of Cards were mostly positive . However , a few critics found the Underwood character was becoming repetitive : the critical consensus on the review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes held that , " Season three introduces intriguing new political and personal elements to Frank Underwood 's character , even if it feels like more of the same for some . " Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph wrote , " Everyone in House of Cards has an agenda - a secret twitching in the attic . The thrill , and the horror , may lie in the degree to which we catch reflections of real life in its dark , cool contours . " 
 Some critics opined that the Underwood character is less interesting once he achieves his goal of becoming president and actually has to govern . " You could take the show seriously just as long as you didn ’ t have to take it seriously , as long as it only took place in the dream world of imaginary fantasy politics , " wrote Aaron <unk> of The New Republic , who compared Underwood unfavorably with Josiah Bartlett of The West Wing . " But when a cartoon becomes president , it starts to look too fake to be real , but too real to be a cartoon . Frank plays the role of President Bartlett , a cartoon president doing things that would actually , in reality , be kind of great . But Bartlett was too good to be true , and the old Frank was too evil to be true . President Underwood is just too dull to be a fantasy , and so the props take center stage . " 
 Critics continued to praise Spacey 's performance , however . Don Kaplan of The New York Daily News wrote , " Underwood ’ s bottomless appetite for dark dealing keeps Spacey so deliciously detestable you can ’ t help but keep rooting for the bad guy to win . " 
 = = = Season 4 = = = 
 In season 4 , Jacob <unk> wrote in his review of the first six episodes of season four : " Until now , ' House of Cards ' has centred on the character 's outward expression of power -- not to mention his hunger for it -- but the writers have shrewdly stripped that back , instead focusing on the character 's internal fears in a way not dissimilar from Tony 's dream sequences in ' The Sopranos ' , " he later added , " You 'll never root for Frank more than you do by the end of these six episodes . " 
 On the other hand , Daniel Fienberg from The Hollywood Reporter was critical of Spacey 's performance , writing : " Spacey 's performance , which at least had an appealingly theatrical extravagance when the series began , has grown less enjoyable . Having reached a pinnacle , there 's no way to root for Frank 's striving anymore , if you ever were , but House of Cards has yet to commit to urging us to root for Frank 's downfall . " 
 There was also considerable mention of the evolution of Underwood 's relationship with Claire . " [ T ] heir partnership has morphed into an entirely professional exercise , with a shared lust for power having supplanted more conventional matrimonial bonds , " wrote Brian Lowry of Variety . The Atlantic 's Spencer Kornhaber remarked , however , that the utter ruthlessness displayed by Underwoods in the season finale may have represented a " jump the shark " moment for the series : " The Underwoods have murdered a politician and a journalist , and some innocents have also been collateral damage to their activities . Now , though , they ’ ve set out to maintain their power at the cost of mass casualties . Netflix hasn ’ t said how many seasons are to come , but it ’ s hard to imagine the show being watchable for all that much longer now that this <unk> of <unk> has been crossed . " 
 Some compared Underwood 's storyline in season 4 to the 2016 U.S. presidential election . Brian <unk> of The Guardian wrote , " ' House of Cards ' has never felt like the real presidency : Frank Underwood is evil incarnate , bumping off junior Congressmen and pushing journalists in front of trains . But now that , in real life , we 're in the throes of such a bizarre presidential race , his machinations are starting to look almost viable . There are several parallels between Underwood 's re @-@ election campaign and the 2016 campaigns of Donald Trump , Ted Cruz , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . "

 = Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement = 
 Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem written by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796 . Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp , the poem discusses Coleridge 's understanding of nature and his married life , which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem . Overall , the poem focuses on humanity 's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature in order to fulfill a moral obligation to humanity . The discussion of man 's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet . By the end of the poem , the narrator follows the philosophical path in a manner similar to what Coleridge sought to do . The response to the poem from critics was mostly positive with many of them emphasizing the religious aspects of the poem in their analysis . 
 = = Background = = 
 After marrying Sarah Fricker in autumn 1795 , Coleridge left their home at Clevedon and began to travel throughout England in order to meet with various philosophers and political theorists . In part , he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works . During this time , he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health . His feelings of guilt , along with a fever that he treated with laudanum , affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796 : " My past life seems to me like a dream , a feverish dream ! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions , and dim @-@ discovered motives ! Friendships lost by indolence , and happiness murdered by mismanaged sensibilities . " 
 After the letter , Coleridge returned to his wife who was now living with her family at Redcliffe Hill , Bristol . As he wrote The Eolian Harp to commemorate coming to his home at Clevedon , Coleridge composed Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement on leaving it . The poem was not included in Coleridge 's 1796 collection of poems as it was probably still incomplete , but it was published in the October 1796 Monthly Magazine under the title Reflections on Entering into Active Life . A poem Which Affects Not to be Poetry . Reflections was included in Coleridge 's 28 October 1797 collection of poems and the collections that followed . Of his early poems , Coleridge believed that Reflections was his best . 
 = = Poem = = 
 The poem begins with an idealisation of a " Valley of Seclusion " : 
 In the open air 
 Our <unk> blossom 'd ; and across the porch 
 Thick <unk> twined : the little landscape round 
 Was green and woody , and refresh 'd the eye . 
 It was a spot which you might aptly call 
 The Valley of Seclusion ! ( lines 4 – 9 ) 
 The poem continues with a goodbye to the valley and asks if his life of pleasure was appropriate : 
 I was constrain 'd to quit you . Was it right , 
 While my <unk> 'd brethren toil 'd and bled , 
 That I should dream away the entrusted hours 
 On rose @-@ leaf beds , pampering the coward heart 
 With feelings all too delicate for use ? ( lines 44 – 48 ) 
 The narrator describes the reasons why he is leaving Clevedon along with the allowance of remembering his former life there after his work is done : 
 I therefore go , and join head , heart , and hand , 
 Active and firm , to fight the bloodless fight 
 Of Science , Freedom , and the Truth in <unk> . 
 Yet oft when after honourable toil 
 Rests the tir 'd mind , and waking loves to dream 
 My Spirit shall revisit thee , dear Cot ! ( lines 60 – 65 ) 
 = = Themes = = 
 The themes of Reflections are connected to Coleridge 's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same . The land of Clevedon is praised and seen full of life , and it serves as contrast to escaping from the real world into fantasy and pondering about the abstract . Both poems also describe Coleridge 's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire . The imagination aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp . Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God , one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth . 
 Feeling the need to seek out truth creates a separation between the mind of a poet and the mind of a philosopher . The poem reconciles the two by allowing the pursuer of truth to reflect on his time of simply enjoying nature and God 's presence . However , the philosopher aspect is dominant and the individual must go out and try to help humanity . Nature can be soothing , but the narrator must reject the Edenic quality of nature because such a state is not yet appropriate . The Edenic imagery figures into many of Coleridge 's poems and is reinforced with the image of myrtle trees and takes on many forms within his poetry . In Reflections , to dwell in an Edenic state is a paradise in which the narrator leaves voluntarily because he cannot ignore the problems of the world like a coward . Instead , the individual is compelled to join with humanity and even the lowest form of benefiting humanity is superior to doing nothing at all . 
 The image of nature and other themes reappears in Fears in Solitude ( 1798 ) . The later poem recreates the " Valley of Seclusion " image in the form of a dell . Even the image of a passerby looking in on the cottage found in Reflection is repeated . Similarly , the compulsion to enter into the world and help humanity is included , but it is altered from being motivated by guilt to a warning message against a possible invasion from outside forces . As such , Fears in Solitude does not seek to leave the location to help humanity , but to stay as a protector over his family . 
 In Coleridge 's own life , he tried to follow the path of the philosopher , but the 10 July 1834 entry in Table Talk admits that he was unable to do so : " so I own I wish life and strength had been spared to me to complete my Philosophy . For , as God hears me , the originating , continuing , and sustaining wish and design in my heart were to exalt the glory of his name ; and , which is the same thing in other words , to promote the improvement of humanity . But <unk> <unk> Deo , and his will be done . " 
 In terms of Coleridge 's marriage , Reflections differs from The Eolian Harp by saying that there were problems within the marriage , especially with it distracting Coleridge from nature and the world outside of the home that he shared with his wife . The poem expresses feelings of solitude and confinement , and there is a difference between the worlds inside and outside of the cottage in a similar manner to the focus found within Coleridge 's Kubla Khan . This is especially true with a focus from the private to the public spheres . Within the outside world , the poem 's narrator is separate from humanity , but his focus is ever on humanity and contains both a religious and political component . The image of " One Life " within the poem compels him to abandon the sensual pleasures of the cottage and to pursue a path of helping humanity . 
 = = Critical response = = 
 The Critical Review saw favor with " To the River Otter " and Reflections in their review of the 1797 collection of Coleridge 's poem . The July review claims that the poem " evince a feeling heart . The comparison between the weeping eyes of a humane friend and the unmoved face of another equally benevolent , and the contrast between the latter and those who merely affect sympathy , are well drawn . " 
 During the 20th century , Virginia Radley declares that Reflections " although not so striking in imagery as is the ' Eolian Harp , ' still has much to recommend it in this respect [ ... ] The impression left with the reader that the cottage and its surroundings are <unk> lovely , quiet , and peaceful is a paramount one , while the dead lines [ ... ] do not move the reader at all , except to make him wonder if the move from Clevedon for the cause of humanity was a necessary one . " Richard Haven argues that the poem 's image of the moral path is weak because " the returned traveller can only dismiss his ascent to another mode of being as a pleasant but useless memory " . 
 Anthony Harding believes " it is important to recognize that it steps outside the idyllic but circumscribed scene of ' The Eolian Harp ' , and admits the impossibility , in a fallen world , of human self @-@ sufficiency . " Oswald Doughty states that the " most important additions " to Coleridge 's 1797 edition of poems included Reflections . Richard Holmes points out that both Reflections and The Eolian Harp " mark a new stage in Coleridge 's exploration of the sacred relations between man and nature , which gradually become more serious and impassioned as they carry increasingly theological implications behind his Romanticism .

 = HMS Pioneer ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Pioneer was a Colossus @-@ class aircraft carrier built for the Royal Navy during World War II . She was modified whilst under construction into an aircraft maintenance carrier .

She supported the British attacks on the Japanese Home Islands from mid @-@ June until the end of the war in August from a base in the Admiralty Islands . The ship and her facilities were used to help repair Hong Kong 's infrastructure in late 1945 and she returned to the UK in early 1946 . Pioneer was immediately placed in reserve upon her arrival and she was sold in 1954 for scrap . 
 = = Design , description and construction = = 
 The Colossus @-@ class carriers were intended to meet a shortage of naval flight decks . Their design was based on that of the Illustrious @-@ class aircraft carriers , but modified to permit rapid construction in commercial yards . Pioneer was not completed to her original design ; the success of the maintenance aircraft carrier Unicorn prompted modification of the ship , whilst under construction , to an aircraft maintenance ship without aircraft catapults . 
 Pioneer had an overall length of 695 feet ( 211 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 80 feet 4 inches ( 24 @.@ 5 m ) , and a draught of 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) at deep load . She displaced 12 @,@ 000 long tons ( 12 @,@ 000 t ) at standard load . Each of the ship 's two sets of Parsons geared steam turbines drove one propeller shaft . Steam was supplied by four Admiralty three @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers operating at a pressure of 400 psi ( 2 @,@ 758 kPa ; 28 kgf / cm2 ) . The turbines were designed for a total of 40 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave Pioneer a speed of 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . The ship carried 3 @,@ 196 long tons ( 3 @,@ 247 t ) of fuel oil which gave her a range of 8 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 700 km ; 9 @,@ 800 mi ) at 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . 
 In order to maximize space for workshops and stores , the ship 's arresting gear and catapult were not fitted ; two large deckhouses were added to port of the island and on the rear of the flight deck . The ship had a single hangar , 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 33 m ) high . Aircraft were transported between the hangars and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts ( elevators ) ; each measured 34 by 45 feet ( 10 @.@ 4 m × 13 @.@ 7 m ) . Two large cranes were mounted on the flight deck to move aircraft and stores to and from the flight deck . The ship carried two small self @-@ propelled lighters to allow unflyable aircraft to be transferred between ships or to shore facilities . Bulk petrol storage consisted of 98 @,@ 600 imperial gallons ( 448 @,@ 000 l ; 118 @,@ 400 US gal ) . The ship 's crew totaled 854 , plus 222 in her aircraft repair department . 
 The ship was equipped with six quadruple mounts for the 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk VIII gun ( " pom @-@ pom " ) . These gun mounts could depress to − 10 ° and elevate to a maximum of + 80 ° .

The gun 's rate of fire was approximately 96 – 98 rounds per minute . She was also fitted with 19 Bofors 40 mm autocannon in single mounts . The Bofors fired a 0 @.@ 719 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 326 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 890 ft / s ( 880 m / s ) . It had a rate of fire of about 120 rounds per minute and a maximum range of 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) .

 = Pythagorean theorem = 
 In mathematics , the Pythagorean theorem , also known as Pythagoras ' theorem , is a fundamental relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle . It states that the square of the hypotenuse ( the side opposite the right angle ) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides . The theorem can be written as an equation relating the lengths of the sides a , b and c , often called the " Pythagorean equation " : 
 <formula> 
 where c represents the length of the hypotenuse and a and b the lengths of the triangle 's other two sides . 
 Although it is often argued that knowledge of the theorem predates him , the theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras ( c . 570 – c . 495 BC ) as it is he who , by tradition , is credited with its first recorded proof . There is some evidence that Babylonian mathematicians understood the formula , although little of it indicates an application within a mathematical framework . Mesopotamian , Indian and Chinese mathematicians all discovered the theorem independently and , in some cases , provided proofs for special cases . 
 The theorem has been given numerous proofs – possibly the most for any mathematical theorem . They are very diverse , including both geometric proofs and algebraic proofs , with some dating back thousands of years . The theorem can be generalized in various ways , including higher @-@ dimensional spaces , to spaces that are not Euclidean , to objects that are not right triangles , and indeed , to objects that are not triangles at all , but n @-@ dimensional solids . The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical <unk> , mystique , or intellectual power ; popular references in literature , plays , musicals , songs , stamps and cartoons abound . 
 = = Pythagorean proof = = 
 The Pythagorean Theorem was known long before Pythagoras , but he may well have been the first to prove it . In any event , the proof attributed to him is very simple , and is called a proof by rearrangement . 
 The two large squares shown in the figure each contain four identical triangles , and the only difference between the two large squares is that the triangles are arranged differently . Therefore , the white space within each of the two large squares must have equal area . Equating the area of the white space yields the Pythagorean Theorem , <unk> 
 That Pythagoras originated this very simple proof is sometimes inferred from the writings of the later Greek philosopher and mathematician Proclus . Several other proofs of this theorem are described below , but this is known as the Pythagorean one . 
 = = Other forms of the theorem = = 
 As pointed out in the introduction , if c denotes the length of the hypotenuse and a and b denote the lengths of the other two sides , the Pythagorean theorem can be expressed as the Pythagorean equation : 
 <formula> 
 If the length of both a and b are known , then c can be calculated as 
 <formula> 
 If the length of the hypotenuse c and of one side ( a or b ) are known , then the length of the other side can be calculated as 
 <formula> 
 or 
 <formula> 
 The Pythagorean equation relates the sides of a right triangle in a simple way , so that if the lengths of any two sides are known the length of the third side can be found . Another corollary of the theorem is that in any right triangle , the hypotenuse is greater than any one of the other sides , but less than their sum . 
 A generalization of this theorem is the law of cosines , which allows the computation of the length of any side of any triangle , given the lengths of the other two sides and the angle between them . If the angle between the other sides is a right angle , the law of cosines reduces to the Pythagorean equation . 
 = = Other proofs of the theorem = = 
 This theorem may have more known proofs than any other ( the law of quadratic reciprocity being another contender for that distinction ) ; the book The Pythagorean Proposition contains 370 proofs . 
 = = = Proof using similar triangles = = = 
 This proof is based on the proportionality of the sides of two similar triangles , that is , upon the fact that the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles . 
 Let ABC represent a right triangle , with the right angle located at C , as shown on the figure . Draw the altitude from point C , and call H its intersection with the side AB . Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e . The new triangle <unk> is similar to triangle ABC , because they both have a right angle ( by definition of the altitude ) , and they share the angle at A , meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well , marked as θ in the figure . By a similar reasoning , the triangle <unk> is also similar to ABC . The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the triangle postulate : the sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles , and is equivalent to the parallel postulate . Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides : 
 <formula> 
 The first result equates the cosines of the angles θ , whereas the second result equates their sines . 
 These ratios can be written as 
 <formula> 
 Summing these two equalities results in 
 <formula> 
 which , after simplification , expresses the Pythagorean theorem : 
 <formula> 
 The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation . The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof , but invented another . One conjecture is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions , a topic not discussed until later in the Elements , and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time . 
 = = = Euclid 's proof = = = 
 In outline , here is how the proof in Euclid 's Elements proceeds . The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle . A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle . Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left @-@ most side . These two triangles are shown to be congruent , proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle . This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square . Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse , its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares . The details follow . 
 Let A , B , C be the vertices of a right triangle , with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse . That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles , each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs . 
 For the formal proof , we require four elementary <unk> : 
 If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other , each to each , and the angles included by those sides equal , then the triangles are congruent ( side @-@ angle @-@ side ) . 
 The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude . 
 The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides . 
 The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides ( follows from 3 ) . 
 Next , each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square . 
 The proof is as follows : 
 Let ACB be a right @-@ angled triangle with right angle CAB . 
 On each of the sides BC , AB , and CA , squares are drawn , <unk> , BAGF , and <unk> , in that order . The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid , and depends upon the parallel postulate . 
 From A , draw a line parallel to BD and CE . It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L , respectively . 
 Join CF and AD , to form the triangles BCF and BDA . 
 Angles CAB and <unk> are both right angles ; therefore C , A , and G are collinear . Similarly for B , A , and H. 
 Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles ; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC , since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC . 
 Since AB is equal to FB and BD is equal to BC , triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC . 
 Since A @-@ K @-@ L is a straight line , parallel to BD , then rectangle <unk> has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK , i.e. , a line normal to their common base , connecting the parallel lines BD and AL . ( lemma 2 ) 
 Since C is collinear with A and G , square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC . 
 Therefore , rectangle <unk> must have the same area as square BAGF 
 = AB2 . 
 Similarly , it can be shown that rectangle <unk> must have the same area as square <unk> = 
 AC2 . 
 Adding these two results , AB2 + AC2 
 = BD × BK + KL × KC 
 Since BD = 
 KL , BD × BK + KL × KC 
 = BD ( BK + KC ) = 
 BD × BC 
 Therefore , AB2 + AC2 = <unk> , since <unk> is a square . 
 This proof , which appears in Euclid 's Elements as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1 , demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares . This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles , which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used . 
 = = = Proofs by dissection and rearrangement = = = 
 We have already discussed the Pythagorean proof , which was a proof by rearrangement . The same idea is conveyed by the leftmost animation below , which consists of a large square , side a + b , containing four identical right triangles . The triangles are shown in two arrangements , the first of which leaves two squares a2 and b2 uncovered , the second of which leaves square c2 uncovered . The area encompassed by the outer square never changes , and the area of the four triangles is the same at the beginning and the end , so the black square areas must be equal , therefore a2 + b2 = c2 . 
 A second proof by rearrangement is given by the middle animation . A large square is formed with area c2 , from four identical right triangles with sides a , b and c , fitted around a small central square . Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles . Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2 , which must have the same area as the initial large square . 
 The third , rightmost image also gives a proof . The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading , into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two . This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called dissection . This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones . 
 = = = Einstein 's proof by dissection without rearrangement = = = 
 Albert Einstein gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces need not get moved . Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs , one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse , and two similar shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse . In Einstein 's proof , the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself . The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse , thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts . Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle , and have the legs of the original triangle as their <unk> , and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle . Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles , the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well . 
 = = = Algebraic proofs = = = 
 The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of a right triangle with sides a , b and c , arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram . The triangles are similar with area <formula> , while the small square has side b − a and area ( b − a ) 2 . The area of the large square is therefore 
 <formula> 
 But this is a square with side c and area c2 , so 
 <formula> 
 A similar proof uses four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c , as shown in the lower part of the diagram . This results in a larger square , with side a + b and area ( a + b ) 2 . The four triangles and the square side c must have the same area as the larger square , 
 <formula> 
 giving 
 <formula> 
 A related proof was published by future U.S. President James A. Garfield ( then a U.S. Representative ) . Instead of a square it uses a trapezoid , which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square , to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram . The area of the trapezoid can be calculated to be half the area of the square , that is 
 <formula> 
 The inner square is similarly halved , and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of <formula> , which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result . 
 = = = Proof using differentials = = = 
 One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing calculus . 
 The triangle ABC is a right triangle , as shown in the upper part of the diagram , with BC the hypotenuse . At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown , with the hypotenuse of length y , the side AC of length x and the side AB of length a , as seen in the lower diagram part . 
 If x is increased by a small amount dx by extending the side AC slightly to D , then y also increases by dy . These form two sides of a triangle , <unk> , which ( with E chosen so CE is perpendicular to the hypotenuse ) is a right triangle approximately similar to ABC . Therefore , the ratios of their sides must be the same , that is : 
 <formula> 
 This can be rewritten as <formula> , which is a differential equation that can be solved by direct integration : 
 <formula> 
 giving 
 <formula> 
 The constant can be deduced from x 
 = 0 , y = 
 a to give the equation 
 <formula> 
 This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one : it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of dx and dy . 
 = = Converse = = 
 The converse of the theorem is also true : 
 For any three positive numbers a , b , and c such that a2 + b2 
 = c2 , there exists a triangle with sides a , b and c , and every such triangle has a right angle between the sides of lengths a and b . 
 An alternative statement is : 
 For any triangle with sides a , b , c , if a2 + b2 = 
 c2 , then the angle between a and b measures 90 ° . 
 This converse also appears in Euclid 's Elements ( Book I , Proposition 48 ) : 
 " If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle , then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right . " 
 It can be proven using the law of cosines or as follows : 
 Let ABC be a triangle with side lengths a , b , and c , with a2 + b2 
 = c2 . Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle . By the Pythagorean theorem , it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length c = 
 √ a2 + b2 , the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle . Since both triangles ' sides are the same lengths a , b and c , the triangles are congruent and must have the same angles . Therefore , the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle . 
 The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean Theorem itself . The converse can also be proven without assuming the Pythagorean Theorem . 
 A corollary of the Pythagorean theorem 's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right , obtuse , or acute , as follows . Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and a + b > c ( otherwise there is no triangle according to the triangle inequality ) . The following statements apply : 
 If a2 + b2 
 = c2 , then the triangle is right . 
 If a2 + b2 > c2 , then the triangle is acute . 
 If a2 + b2 < c2 , then the triangle is obtuse . 
 Edsger Dijkstra has stated this proposition about acute , right , and obtuse triangles in this language : 
 sgn ( α + β − γ ) = 
 sgn ( a2 + b2 − c2 ) , 
 where α is the angle opposite to side a , β is the angle opposite to side b , γ is the angle opposite to side c , and sgn is the sign function . 
 = = Consequences and uses of the theorem = = 
 = = = Pythagorean triples = = = 
 A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a , b , and c , such that a2 + b2 = c2 . In other words , a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths . Evidence from megalithic monuments in Northern Europe shows that such triples were known before the discovery of writing . Such a triple is commonly written ( a , b , c ) . Some well @-@ known examples are ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) and ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) . 
 A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a , b and c are coprime ( the greatest common divisor of a , b and c is 1 ) . 
 The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100 : 
 ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) , ( 5 , 12 , 13 ) , ( 7 , 24 , 25 ) , ( 8 , 15 , 17 ) , ( 9 , 40 , 41 ) , ( 11 , 60 , 61 ) , ( 12 , 35 , 37 ) , ( 13 , 84 , 85 ) , ( 16 , 63 , 65 ) , ( 20 , 21 , 29 ) , ( 28 , 45 , 53 ) , ( 33 , 56 , 65 ) , ( 36 , 77 , 85 ) , ( 39 , 80 , 89 ) , ( 48 , 55 , 73 ) , ( 65 , 72 , 97 ) 
 = = = <unk> lengths = = = 
 One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are incommensurable ( so the ratio of which is not a rational number ) can be constructed using a straightedge and compass . Pythagoras 's theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the square root operation . 
 The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer . Each triangle has a side ( labeled " 1 " ) that is the chosen unit for measurement . In each right triangle , Pythagoras 's theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit . If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square , it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit , such as √ 2 , √ 3 , √ 5 . For more detail , see Quadratic irrational . 
 <unk> lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school 's concept of numbers as only whole numbers . The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit . According to one legend , <unk> of Metapontum ( ca . 470 B.C. ) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable . 
 = = = Complex numbers = = = 
 For any complex number 
 <formula> 
 the absolute value or modulus is given by 
 <formula> 
 So the three quantities , r , x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation , 
 <formula> 
 Note that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive . Geometrically r is the distance of the z from zero or the origin O in the complex plane . 
 This can be generalised to find the distance between two points , z1 and z2 say . The required distance is given by 
 <formula> 
 so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation , 
 <formula> 
 = = = Euclidean distance in various coordinate systems = = = 
 The distance formula in Cartesian coordinates is derived from the Pythagorean theorem . If ( x1 , y1 ) and ( x2 , y2 ) are points in the plane , then the distance between them , also called the Euclidean distance , is given by 
 <formula> 
 More generally , in Euclidean n @-@ space , the Euclidean distance between two points , <formula> and <formula> , is defined , by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem , as : 
 <formula> 
 If Cartesian coordinates are not used , for example , if polar coordinates are used in two dimensions or , in more general terms , if curvilinear coordinates are used , the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem , but can be derived from it . A typical example where the straight @-@ line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the applications of Legendre polynomials in physics . The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras 's theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates . For example , the polar coordinates ( r , θ ) can be introduced as : 
 <formula> 
 Then two points with locations ( r1 , θ1 ) and ( r2 , θ2 ) are separated by a distance s : 
 <formula> 
 Performing the squares and combining terms , the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as : 
 <formula> 
 using the trigonometric product @-@ to @-@ sum formulas . This formula is the law of cosines , sometimes called the Generalized Pythagorean Theorem . From this result , for the case where the radii to the two locations are at right angles , the enclosed angle <unk> = π / 2 , and the form corresponding to Pythagoras 's theorem is regained : <formula> The Pythagorean theorem , valid for right triangles , therefore is a special case of the more general law of cosines , valid for arbitrary triangles . 
 = = = Pythagorean trigonometric identity = = = 
 In a right triangle with sides a , b and hypotenuse c , trigonometry determines the sine and cosine of the angle θ between side a and the hypotenuse as : 
 <formula> 
 From that it follows : 
 <formula> 
 where the last step applies Pythagoras 's theorem . This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity . In similar triangles , the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles , and depend upon the angles . Consequently , in the figure , the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin θ and adjacent side of size cos θ in units of the hypotenuse . 
 = = = Relation to the cross product = = = 
 The Pythagorean theorem relates the cross product and dot product in a similar way : 
 <formula> 
 This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product , as 
 <formula> 
 with n a unit vector normal to both a and b . The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity . 
 This can also be used to define the cross product . By rearranging the following equation is obtained 
 <formula> 
 This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition , for example in seven dimensions . 
 = = Generalizations = = 
 = = = Similar figures on the three sides = = = 
 A generalization of the Pythagorean theorem extending beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to similar figures was known by Hippocrates of Chios in the 5th century BC , and was included by Euclid in his Elements : 
 If one erects similar figures ( see Euclidean geometry ) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle , then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side . 
 This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures ( so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are a : b : c ) . While Euclid 's proof only applied to convex polygons , the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries ( but still with part of a figure 's boundary being the side of the original triangle ) . 
 The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any linear dimension , and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side . Thus , if similar figures with areas A , B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a , b and c then : 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 But , by the Pythagorean theorem , a2 + b2 
 = c2 , so A + B = 
 C. 
 Conversely , if we can prove that A + B 
 = C for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem , then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem . For example , the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse , and two similar right triangles ( A and B ) constructed on the other two sides , formed by dividing the central triangle by its altitude . The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third , thus A + B = 
 C and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 + b2 = c2 . 
 = = = Law of cosines = = = 
 The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem relating the lengths of sides in any triangle , the law of cosines : 
 <formula> 
 where θ is the angle between sides a and b . 
 When θ is 90 degrees ( π / 2 radians ) , then <unk> = 0 , and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem . 
 = = = Arbitrary triangle = = = 
 At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides a , b , c , inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base θ are the same as the selected angle . Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled c . <unk> the isosceles triangle forms triangle ABD with angle θ opposite side a and with side r along c . A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side b and a side with length s along c , as shown in the figure . Thābit ibn Qurra stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as : 
 <formula> 
 As the angle θ approaches π / 2 , the base of the isosceles triangle narrows , and lengths r and s overlap less and less . When θ 
 = π / 2 , ADB becomes a right triangle , r + s = 
 c , and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained . 
 One proof observes that triangle ABC has the same angles as triangle ABD , but in opposite order . ( The two triangles share the angle at vertex B , both contain the angle θ , and so also have the same third angle by the triangle postulate . ) Consequently , ABC is similar to the reflection of ABD , the triangle <unk> in the lower panel . Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ , 
 <formula> 
 Likewise , for the reflection of the other triangle , 
 <formula> 
 Clearing fractions and adding these two relations : 
 <formula> 
 the required result . 
 The theorem remains valid if the angle <formula> is obtuse so the lengths r and s are non @-@ overlapping . 
 = = = General triangles using parallelograms = = = 
 Pappus 's area theorem is a further generalization , that applies to triangles that are not right triangles , using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares ( squares are a special case , of course ) . The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle , the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides , provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated ( the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same , and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram ) . This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras 's theorem , and was considered a generalization by Pappus of Alexandria in 4 A.D. 
 The lower figure shows the elements of the proof . Focus on the left side of the figure . The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left , blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h . However , the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure , because they have the same base ( the upper left side of the triangle ) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle . Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure , the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms . 
 = = = Solid geometry = = = 
 In terms of solid geometry , Pythagoras 's theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows . Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure . The length of diagonal BD is found from Pythagoras 's theorem as : 
 <formula> 
 where these three sides form a right triangle . Using horizontal diagonal BD and the vertical edge AB , the length of diagonal AD then is found by a second application of Pythagoras 's theorem as : 
 <formula> 
 or , doing it all in one step : 
 <formula> 
 This result is the three @-@ dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector v ( the diagonal AD ) in terms of its orthogonal components { <unk> } ( the three mutually perpendicular sides ) : 
 <formula> 
 This one @-@ step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras 's theorem to higher dimensions . However , this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras 's theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes . 
 A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is de Gua 's theorem , named for Jean Paul de Gua de <unk> : If a tetrahedron has a right angle corner ( like a corner of a cube ) , then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces . This result can be generalized as in the " n @-@ dimensional Pythagorean theorem " : 
 Let <formula> be orthogonal vectors in <unk> . Consider the n @-@ dimensional simplex S with vertices <formula> . ( Think of the ( n − 1 ) -dimensional simplex with vertices <formula> not including the origin as the " hypotenuse " of S and the remaining ( n − 1 ) -dimensional faces of S as its " legs " . ) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs . 
 This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure . The " hypotenuse " is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure , and the " legs " are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground . As the depth of the base from the vertex increases , the area of the " legs " increases , while that of the base is fixed . The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex , the generalization of Pythagoras 's theorem applies . In a different wording : 
 Given an n @-@ rectangular n @-@ dimensional simplex , the square of the ( n − 1 ) <unk> of the facet opposing the right vertex will equal the sum of the squares of the ( n − 1 ) <unk> of the remaining facets . 
 = = = Inner product spaces = = = 
 The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to inner product spaces , which are generalizations of the familiar 2 @-@ dimensional and 3 @-@ dimensional Euclidean spaces . For example , a function may be considered as a vector with infinitely many components in an inner product space , as in functional analysis . 
 In an inner product space , the concept of <unk> is replaced by the concept of orthogonality : two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product <formula> is zero . The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors . The dot product is called the standard inner product or the Euclidean inner product . However , other inner products are possible . 
 The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the norm | | v | | of a vector v , defined as : 
 <formula> 
 In an inner @-@ product space , the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have 
 <formula> 
 Here the vectors v and w are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the vector sum v + w . This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the properties of the inner product : 
 <formula> 
 where the inner products of the cross terms are zero , because of orthogonality . 
 A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non @-@ orthogonal vectors is the parallelogram law : 
 <formula> 
 which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals . Any norm that satisfies this equality is ipso facto a norm corresponding to an inner product . 
 The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors . If v1 , v2 , ... , vn are pairwise @-@ orthogonal vectors in an inner @-@ product space , then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors ( as described for 3 @-@ dimensions in the section on solid geometry ) results in the equation 
 <formula> 
 = = = Sets of m @-@ dimensional objects in n @-@ dimensional space = = = 
 The broadest generalization of the Pythagorean theorem , introduced by Donald R. Conant and William A. Beyer , applies to a wide range of objects and sets of objects in any number of dimensions . Specifically , the square of the measure of an m @-@ dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel m @-@ dimensional flats in n @-@ dimensional Euclidean space is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the orthogonal projections of the object ( s ) onto all m @-@ dimensional coordinate subspaces . 
 In mathematical terms : 
 <formula> 
 where : 
 <formula> is a measure in m @-@ dimensions ( a length in one dimension , an area in two dimensions , a volume in three dimensions , etc . ) . 
 <formula> is a set of one or more non @-@ overlapping m @-@ dimensional objects in one or more parallel m @-@ dimensional flats in n @-@ dimensional Euclidean space . 
 <formula> is the total measure ( sum ) of the set of m @-@ dimensional objects . 
 <formula> represents an m @-@ dimensional projection of the original set onto an orthogonal coordinate subspace . 
 <formula> is the measure of the m @-@ dimensional set projection onto m @-@ dimensional coordinate subspace <formula> . Because object projections can overlap on a coordinate subspace , the measure of each object projection in the set must be calculated individually , then measures of all projections added together to provide the total measure for the set of projections on the given coordinate subspace . 
 <formula> is the number of orthogonal , m @-@ dimensional coordinate subspaces in n @-@ dimensional space ( Rn ) onto which the m @-@ dimensional objects are projected ( m ≤ n ) : 
 <formula> 
 For example , for a set of one or more two @-@ dimensional parallel objects in three @-@ dimensional space , m 
 = 2 and n = 
 3 . Therefore , the coordinate subspace calculation for this scenario is : x 
 = 3 ! / 2 ! ( 3 @-@ 2 ) ! = 
 3 * 2 * 1 / 2 * 1 * 1 
 = 6 / 2 = 
 3 
 Thus , three coordinate planes ( xy @-@ plane , xz @-@ plane , and yz @-@ plane ) are required to capture the necessary projections for calculating the area of the set . If the set contained one @-@ dimensional parallel line segments instead , three coordinate axes ( x , y , and z ) , rather than planes , would be needed to capture the projections for calculating the length of the set . 
 = = = = Applied to sets containing a single object = = = = 
 This generalized formula can be applied in the simplest case to a single one @-@ dimensional object , a line segment , in two @-@ dimensional space . The animation illustrates this case with a line segment shown in blue and its projections onto the x- and <unk> axes shown in green . The lengths of the projections squared and added together are equal to the length of the original line segment squared . This produces the familiar Pythagorean theorem formula : 
 <formula> 
 where c is the length of the original line segment , a is the length of the segment projected onto the x @-@ axis , and b is the length of the segment projected onto the y @-@ axis . In the animation , a2 
 = 27 , b2 = 
 9 , and c2 = 36 . Bringing the line segment together with its coordinate projections forms the traditional right triangle . 
 Similarly , for any two @-@ dimensional object in three @-@ dimensional space , the formula can be stated as : 
 <formula> 
 where D is the area of a specified two @-@ dimensional object , A is the area of the object 's projection onto the xy @-@ coordinate plane , B is the area of the object 's projection onto the xz @-@ coordinate plane , and C is the area of the object 's projection onto the yz @-@ coordinate plane . 
 The animation showing a blue three @-@ by @-@ three square object in three dimensions of space illustrates this application of the generalization to an object of more than one dimension . As the orientation of the object changes , the proportions of the green coordinate plane projections adjust accordingly , so the squares of the areas of the projections always add up to the same value : the square of the area of the original object . In this case , the sum of the squares of the projection areas always add up to 81 . 
 = = = = Applied to sets containing multiple objects = = = = 
 The generalization applies equally to sets of multiple objects , as long as they are in the same plane or parallel planes . The measures of the objects in such a set can be added together and essentially treated as a single object . The multiple line @-@ segment animation illustrates the generalization applied to a set of three one @-@ dimensional objects in three dimensions of space . In this case , two sequential line segments exist in parallel to a third line segment . Because lines are one @-@ dimensional , the coordinate subspaces onto which they are projected must also be one @-@ dimensional . Thus , projections appear on the coordinate axes rather than on the coordinate planes . The lengths of the projected line segments on a given axis are summed , then squared , then added to the total lengths squared on the other axes . The result is the squared sum of the lengths of the original line segments . For the sake of simplicity , when projections are single points of zero length , they are not shown , since they do not affect the calculations . 
 The generalization applies to flat objects of any shape , regular or irregular . The multi @-@ object animation illustrates the use of the generalization on a set of several different objects in different planes – in this case , a triangle and a circle on one plane , and a flat cat on a parallel plane ( shown in blue ) . Projections of the set are shown in green on the coordinate plane subspaces . Objects shown initially upright in the yz @-@ plane are subsequently tilted in parallel . Again , regardless of set orientation , the result remains the same . On each coordinate plane subspace , the areas of object projections are calculated individually ( to avoid miscalculations due to projection overlap ) , then added together to produce the total projection area of the set on that plane . The projection set area is then squared for each coordinate plane . The sum of all projection set areas squared is always equal to the original set area squared . 
 = = = = Applied in any number of dimensions = = = = 
 This generalization holds regardless of the number of dimensions involved . The volume squared for a three @-@ dimensional object or set can be calculated by summing the squares of the volumes of the associated three @-@ dimensional projections onto three @-@ dimensional subspaces . Any number of dimensions is valid for the set as long as one uses the same number of dimensions for the coordinate subspaces and projections . 
 It is the built @-@ in symmetry of the Cartesian coordinate system where coordinates are orthogonal vectors of unit length in flat Euclidean space that allows this generalization to apply so broadly . 
 = = = Non @-@ Euclidean geometry = = = 
 The Pythagorean theorem is derived from the axioms of Euclidean geometry , and in fact , the Pythagorean theorem given above does not hold in a non @-@ Euclidean geometry . ( The Pythagorean theorem has been shown , in fact , to be equivalent to Euclid 's Parallel ( Fifth ) Postulate . ) In other words , in non @-@ Euclidean geometry , the relation between the sides of a triangle must necessarily take a non @-@ Pythagorean form . For example , in spherical geometry , all three sides of the right triangle ( say a , b , and c ) bounding an <unk> of the unit sphere have length equal to π / 2 , and all its angles are right angles , which violates the Pythagorean theorem because a2 + b2 ≠ c2 . 
 Here two cases of non @-@ Euclidean geometry are considered — spherical geometry and hyperbolic plane geometry ; in each case , as in the Euclidean case for non @-@ right triangles , the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines . 
 However , the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third , say A + B = C. The sides are then related as follows : the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c . 
 = = = = Spherical geometry = = = = 
 For any right triangle on a sphere of radius R ( for example , if γ in the figure is a right angle ) , with sides a , b , c , the relation between the sides takes the form : 
 <formula> 
 This equation can be derived as a special case of the spherical law of cosines that applies to all spherical triangles : 
 <formula> 
 By expressing the Maclaurin series for the cosine function as an asymptotic expansion with the remainder term in big O notation , 
 <formula> 
 it can be shown that as the radius R approaches infinity and the arguments a / R , b / R , and c / R tend to zero , the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle approaches the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem . Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields 
 <formula> 
 The constants a4 , b4 , and c4 have been absorbed into the big O remainder terms since they are independent of the radius R. This asymptotic relationship can be further simplified by multiplying out the bracketed quantities , cancelling the ones , multiplying through by − 2 , and collecting all the error terms together : 
 <formula> 
 After multiplying through by R2 , the Euclidean Pythagorean relationship c2 = a2 + b2 is recovered in the limit as the radius R approaches infinity ( since the remainder term tends to zero ) : 
 <formula> 
 For small right triangles ( a , b < < R ) , the cosines can be eliminated to avoid loss of significance , giving 
 <formula> 
 = = = = Hyperbolic geometry = = = = 
 In a hyperbolic space with uniform curvature − 1 / R2 , for a right triangle with legs a , b , and hypotenuse c , the relation between the sides takes the form : 
 <formula> 
 where cosh is the hyperbolic cosine . This formula is a special form of the hyperbolic law of cosines that applies to all hyperbolic triangles : 
 <formula> 
 with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side c . 
 By using the Maclaurin series for the hyperbolic cosine , cosh x ≈ 1 + x2 / 2 , it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small ( that is , as a , b , and c all approach zero ) , the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras 's theorem . 
 For small right triangles ( a , b < < R ) , the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid loss of significance , giving 
 <formula> 
 = = = = Very small triangles = = = = 
 For any uniform curvature K ( positive , zero , or negative ) , in very small right triangles ( | K | a2 , | K | b2 < < 1 ) with hypotenuse c , it can be shown that

 On an infinitesimal level , in three dimensional space , Pythagoras 's theorem describes the distance between two infinitesimally separated points as : 
 <formula> 
 with ds the element of distance and ( dx , dy , dz ) the components of the vector separating the two points . Such a space is called a Euclidean space . However , in Riemannian geometry , a generalization of this expression useful for general coordinates ( not just Cartesian ) and general spaces ( not just Euclidean ) takes the form : 
 <formula> 
 which is called the metric tensor . ( Sometimes , by abuse of language , the same term is applied to the set of coefficients <unk> . ) It may be a function of position , and often describes curved space . A simple example is Euclidean ( flat ) space expressed in curvilinear coordinates . For example , in polar coordinates :

 = = History = = 
 There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once , or many times in many places , and the date of first discovery is uncertain , as is the date of the first proof . According to Joran Friberg , a historian of mathematics , evidence indicates that the Pythagorean Theorem was well @-@ known to the mathematicians of the First Babylonian Dynasty ( 20th to 16th centuries BC ) , which would have been over a thousand years before Pythagoras was born . ( Yale 's Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Heritage 's 3 @-@ D scan of a cuneiform tablet depicting the proof is one of their mostly widely used images . ) Other sources , such as a book by Leon Lederman and Dick <unk> , mention that Pythagoras discovered the theorem , although <unk> subsequently stated that the Babylonians developed the theorem " at least fifteen hundred years before Pythagoras was born . " The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts : knowledge of Pythagorean triples , knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle , knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles , and proofs of the theorem within some deductive system . 
 Bartel <unk> van der Waerden ( 1903 – 1996 ) conjectured that Pythagorean triples were discovered algebraically by the Babylonians . Written between 2000 and 1786 BC , the Middle Kingdom Egyptian Berlin Papyrus <unk> includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6 : 8 : 10 , but the problem does not mention a triangle . The Mesopotamian tablet Plimpton 322 , written between 1790 and 1750 BC during the reign of Hammurabi the Great , contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples . 
 In India , the <unk> <unk> Sutra , the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC , contains a list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically , a statement of the Pythagorean theorem , and a geometrical proof of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle . The <unk> <unk> Sutra ( c . 600 BC ) contains a numerical proof of the general Pythagorean theorem , using an area computation . Van der Waerden believed that " it was certainly based on earlier traditions " . Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in <unk> @-@ <unk> may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math , but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility . 
 With contents known much earlier , but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC , the Chinese text Zhou Bi Suan Jing ( <unk> ) , ( The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven ) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) triangle — in China it is called the " <unk> Theorem " ( <unk> ) . During the Han Dynasty ( 202 BC to 220 AD ) , Pythagorean triples appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , together with a mention of right triangles . Some believe the theorem arose first in China , where it is alternatively known as the " Shang Gao Theorem " ( <unk> ) , named after the Duke of Zhou 's astronomer and mathematician , whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhou Bi Suan Jing . 
 Pythagoras , whose dates are commonly given as 569 – 475 BC , used algebraic methods to construct Pythagorean triples , according to Proclus 's commentary on Euclid . Proclus , however , wrote between 410 and 485 AD . According to Thomas L. Heath ( 1861 – 1940 ) , no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived . However , when authors such as Plutarch and Cicero attributed the theorem to Pythagoras , they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted . " Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally , [ ... ] one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of Pythagorean mathematics . " 
 Around 400 BC , according to Proclus , Plato gave a method for finding Pythagorean triples that combined algebra and geometry . Around 300 BC , in Euclid 's Elements , the oldest extant axiomatic proof of the theorem is presented . 
 = = In popular culture = = 
 The Pythagorean theorem has arisen in popular culture in a variety of ways . 
 John Aubrey in his Brief Lives records of Thomas Hobbes that " He was forty years old before he looked on geometry ; which happened accidentally . Being in a gentleman 's library Euclid 's Elements lay open , and ' twas the forty @-@ seventh proposition * in the first book . He read the proposition . ' By G , ' said he , ' this is impossible ! ' So he reads the demonstration of it , which referred him back to such a proof ; which referred him back to another , which he also read . Et sic <unk> , that at last he was demonstratively convinced of that truth . This made him in love with geometry . " 
 Hans Christian Andersen wrote in 1831 a poem about the Pythagorean theorem : <unk> <unk> Magie ( Et <unk> <unk> ) . 
 A verse of the Major @-@ General 's Song in the Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera The Pirates of Penzance , " About binomial theorem I 'm teeming with a lot o ' news , With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse " , makes an oblique reference to the theorem . 
 The Scarecrow in the film The Wizard of Oz makes a more specific reference to the theorem . Upon receiving his diploma from the Wizard , he immediately exhibits his " knowledge " by reciting a mangled and incorrect version of the theorem : " The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isosceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side . Oh , joy ! Oh , rapture ! I 've got a brain ! " 
 In 2000 , Uganda released a coin with the shape of an isosceles right triangle . The coin 's tail has an image of Pythagoras and the equation α2 + β2 = <unk> , accompanied with the mention " <unk> <unk> " . 
 Greece , Japan , San Marino , Sierra Leone , and Suriname have issued postage stamps depicting Pythagoras and the Pythagorean theorem . 
 In Neal Stephenson 's speculative fiction <unk> , the Pythagorean theorem is referred to as ' the <unk> theorem ' . A geometric proof of the theorem is displayed on the side of an alien ship to demonstrate the aliens ' understanding of mathematics . 
 = Signs and Wonders ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Signs and Wonders " is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 23 , 2000 . It was written by Jeffrey Bell , directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Signs and Wonders " earned a Nielsen household rating of 8 @.@ 5 , being watched by 13 @.@ 86 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders , a church where the Bible is read literally , and punishment is dealt deftly , after a small town church is the site of a number of ritualistic @-@ like murders . But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may not be very much at all . 
 Bell wished to write a " down @-@ and @-@ dirty " horror story about a snake @-@ handling church . Furthermore , Bell wanted the true antagonist of the episode to remain hidden until the very end . In order to do this , the script was written so that Mulder suspected the wrong individual . According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz , the theme of the episode was " intolerance can be good " , in some cases . The episode used live rattlesnakes ; at any one time , there were between six and fifty snakes on the set . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Blessing , Tennessee , Jared Chirp , while attempting to flee his home , is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed . Federal agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey , go to Reverend Enoch O 'Connor 's church , Church of God with Signs and Wonders , where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services . As such , O 'Connor becomes the prime suspect . Later , a woman named Iris , tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order to talk to his girlfriend , Gracie . Iris , however , refused because Gracie was in bed . Later that night , Iris is bitten when her staple remover turns into a snake ; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom . 
 Gracie is questioned by Mulder and Scully about O 'Connor because she is a former member of his church . The two agents discover that she is , in fact , O 'Connor 's daughter and was kicked out of his congregation and home when she became pregnant . The agents go back to O 'Connor 's church and Scully is attacked by O 'Connor , who attempts to stick her head in a box of snakes . He is promptly arrested . Later , while in his cell , he is attacked by snakes in his cell , but is not killed . O 'Connor later wakes up in the hospital and is visited by Gracie . O 'Connor then takes Gracie and leaves the hospital . Reverend Mackey tells Mulder and Scully that Enoch O 'Connor is the father of Gracie 's child . 
 Meanwhile , O 'Connor takes Gracie back to his church and baptizes her . Suddenly , she goes into labor and gives birth to live snakes . O 'Connor goes to Mackey 's church and attempts to kill him , but Mulder intervenes and saves Mackey . In the ambulance , Gracie tells Scully that Mackey was the real murderer , and the father of Gracie 's baby . He killed everyone to keep the fact that he was the father a secret and in order to destroy O 'Connor . Back at the church , Mulder realizes O 'Connor was innocent all along , but Mackey summons snakes who promptly attack Mulder . Luckily , Scully is able to break down the door and save Mulder . Mackey , unfortunately , disappears to Connecticut , changes his name to Reverend Wells , and starts another church . The episode ends with a snake coming out of Mackey 's mouth and eating a mouse .

 " Signs and Wonders " was written by The X @-@ Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell . Bell had long desired to write a " down @-@ and @-@ dirty " horror story for the series . In addition , he had informally studied the practice of snake handling , concluding that " anything involving snakes would be scary and I saw the church stuff as something that would be really fascinating . " However , unlike most stories featuring the radical religious , the theme of the episode was that in certain circumstances , " intolerance can be good " , according to executive producer Frank Spotnitz . 
 Bell " wanted the snake church people to end up being the good guys . " However , the trick would be to disguise the real bad guys in plain sight . According to Bell , " The way the shows usually work out , Mulder is the one to figure out who the bad guys are . So I went into the story meeting with the idea of having Mulder being wrong . Because Mulder believes so strong it 's the other guy , it helped hide the true identity of the bad guy from the audience . " 
 During the snake handling scene at the Church of God with Signs and Wonders , the song being sung by the congregation is called " May Glory Protect Us " . The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin , who was heavily involved in the episode 's music production . Rabwin later noted , " I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [ to episode director Kim Manners ] . I told him I could write one that was better and he told me to go for it . And I did . [ … ] Kim loved it . [ … ] It was a great tribute that he was able to ask me and accept my opinion on it . " 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 The casting for " Signs & Wonders " was " rather unorthodox " . In order to prevent <unk> from hitting the actors on the day of filming , live rattlesnakes were brought in during the casting sessions . Strangely enough , many of the actors were " thrilled " about holding the snakes , according to Kim Manners . He later noted that " the funny thing was that the actors couldn 't wait to hold the rattlesnakes [ … ] but we were still nervous . " In addition , Michael Childers , who portrayed Reverend O 'Connor , was actually the son of a real life snake preacher . Manners later noted that " he had gone to church as a child and handled snakes . " 
 A series of safety meetings were scheduled in order to prevent accidents on the set . One of the items on the agenda was finding the closest hospital to the set , according to make @-@ up effects coordinator John Vulich . Furthermore , several of the cast and crew members had a fear of snakes , including Manners , David Duchovny , and John Shiban . During one of the days that the show was being prepped , a snake wrangler brought several live rattlesnakes to the set , but one escaped . It was eventually found behind Manners ' desk . In order to prevent future accidents , the mouths of the snakes were sutured shut .

 At any one time , there were between six and fifty snakes on the set . During the scene where Mulder is attacked , fifteen live snakes were used . However , Duchovny was " not within blocks " of the shot and a stunt double was used . Several faux @-@ body parts were used to simulate snake bites . One of the fake arms , which was used for Mulder , was recycled from the sixth season episode " Dreamland " . A false stomach was created for Tracy Middendorf , who portrayed Gracie , to give the illusion that live snakes were wriggling inside of her . 
 At one point in the episode , Expulsion from the Garden of Eden , a famous painting by Italian Early Renaissance artist Masaccio appears in the background . Because the painting contains nudity , Fox 's network executives took issue with the scene , forcing the show to edit out the genitalia on the painting . Paul Rabwin later noted that " the network executive censors didn 't feel it was appropriate for us to show all the details [ ... ] course , they could see people giving birth to hundreds of snakes , but that 's OK . " On the seventh season DVD special features , the painting is erroneously attributed to the famed Michelangelo .

 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote a very positive review of the episode , writing , " ' Signs and Wonders ' is a clever episode whose serpentine plot twists will leave many viewers genuinely surprised . Although a bit overly reliant on the alleged shock value of snakes , the episode establishes , more firmly than any before it , the demonic nature of some of the powers at work in The X @-@ Files . " Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and called the episode , " one of the scariest episodes of season 7 " before noting that the episode " really creeped me out . " However , other reviews were more mixed . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two noted that , despite several very " cool " images — such as Gracie birthing snakes and a man oozing reptile venom — the episode " doesn 't really seem to stand for anything . " Shearman and Pearson further criticized putting " religion in the crosshair " and concluded that the episode was " just your everyday sliver of supernatural hokum . " 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four . Vitaris criticized the polarization of religion viewed in the episode , noting that " although ' Signs and Wonder 's purports to be an examination of different modes of faith , it offers a pessimistic — and distorted view of religion . " Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a mixed review , writing " I have always been the type of person who admires the creative attempt , even if the attempt isn 't a complete success . [ … ] This is precisely the mindset I 'm feeling after watching ' Signs and Wonders ' . I admire the attempt to spook me , to offer up conflicting views of religion and righteousness , even if I 'm not completely sure what the point of it all was . " Nevertheless , Kessenich praised the snake attack scenes and the episode 's occasional quips of humor . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " C + " . Despite writing that the snake attack scenes were " surprisingly horrifying " and that the episode contained " plenty [ of elements ] to recommend " , he was critical about the lack of explanation behind Mackey . Although he had a positive opinion of the first 30 minutes , he wrote that the " last 10 minutes just sink everything good the episode has going , and in a way that hurts everything that came before .

 Cody Douglas Hodgson ( born February 18 , 1990 ) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centreman currently an unrestricted free agent who most recently played for the Milwaukee Admirals in the American Hockey League ( AHL ) while under contract to the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . 
 Hodgson played at the major junior level for four seasons with the Brampton Battalion of the Ontario Hockey League ( OHL ) . After being selected tenth overall in the 2008 NHL Entry Draft by the Vancouver Canucks , Hodgson won the William Hanley Trophy ( OHL 's most sportsmanlike player ) , Red Tilson Trophy ( OHL player of the year ) and the CHL Player of the Year Award , as well as First Team All @-@ Star honours for the 2008 – 09 season . While training in the 2009 off @-@ season , Hodgson suffered a back injury that required a year for him to fully recover . In 2010 – 11 , he played his professional rookie season with the Canucks ' minor league affiliate , the Manitoba Moose of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) . The season also marked his debut at the NHL level with the Canucks and he went on to participate in the team 's run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals . During his rookie season the subsequent year , Hodgson was dealt to the Buffalo Sabres at the 2012 trade deadline . 
 Hodgson has represented Canada at two International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) – sanctioned events , winning gold and leading tournament scoring at both – the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships and 2009 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships . In 2007 , he won a gold medal with Ontario at the Canada Games . He also represented Canada at the 2007 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament , finishing fourth .

 Hodgson was born in Toronto , Ontario , to Marie and Chris Hodgson . His father is the president of the Ontario Mining Association and a former Ontario provincial Progressive Conservative cabinet minister in Premier Mike Harris 's government , while his mother is the executive director of a day care . He has an older brother , Clayton , and two younger sisters . His sister Charlotte attends the University of Western Ontario and Caroline attends Belmont University in Nashville , Tennessee . Both girls played organized hockey in Markham , Ontario . Hodgson grew up in Haliburton , Ontario , with his family until they moved to Markham , Ontario , in 1998 . The family would return in the summers to their cottage on Haliburton Lake . 
 Hodgson began playing organized hockey at age four in Haliburton . Playing for the Ontario Minor Hockey Association ( OMHA ) ' s Haliburton Huskies , he was teammates with Matt Duchene . The two were childhood friends and played together throughout their minor and junior careers , including with the Brampton Battalion and on Canada 's national under @-@ 18 and under @-@ 20 teams . His family was also friends with Jeff Skinner 's family growing up in Markham . Hodgson played bantam hockey with the Toronto Jr . Canadiens of the Greater Toronto Hockey League ( GTHL ) , captaining a team that included four other eventual 2008 NHL draftees – Alex Pietrangelo , Tyler <unk> , Josh Brittain and Stefan Della Rovere . His tenure with the team included a provincial championship . Hodgson then joined the OMHA 's Markham Waxers , competing with their bantam team in 2004 – 05 , then at the midget level in 2005 – 06 . He recorded a 511 @-@ point campaign over 31 games in his midget season , while also recording one assist over two games with the club 's Junior A side . During his tenure with the Waxers program , he played alongside future NHL players Steven Stamkos and Michael Del Zotto . Hodgson had also played alongside Stamkos on annual summer teams , starting at the age of 11 . 
 Hodgson attended <unk> Public School and Unionville High School in Markham , the latter of which he helped win numerous hockey tournaments . Following his draft by the Vancouver Canucks , Hodgson was accepted into the business program at York University for the 2008 fall semester . However , due to missing classes from his commitments to the Canucks ' training camp and a subsequent university staff strike , he placed his academics on hiatus . 
 In December 2009 , Hodgson was chosen to be the city of Markham 's official torchbearer for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . The torch passed through Markham on its way to Vancouver on December 17 , 2009 , on day 49 of the cross @-@ country relay .

He led the team in rookie scoring with 23 goals and 46 points . He added four points in four playoff games as the Battalion were eliminated by the Barrie Colts in the first round . 
 In his second season with Brampton , Hodgson improved to 85 points in 68 games , second in team @-@ scoring , behind centre John Hughes . He was chosen to the Eastern Conference squad in the 2008 OHL All @-@ Star Classic and scored one goal . Hodgson added five goals in five playoff games , as Brampton was eliminated in the opening round for the second @-@ straight season by Barrie . 
 Heading into the 2008 NHL Entry Draft , Hodgson was ranked ninth among North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau . He went on to be chosen tenth overall by the Vancouver Canucks . Scouting reports and former coaches emphasized Hodgson 's hockey sense and character , while Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis cited his leadership as a strong factor in drafting him . After the 2007 – 08 season , OHL coaches had voted him the smartest player in the Eastern Conference . As his skating was considered a weakness , he spent the subsequent off @-@ season training to improve it . 
 Hodgson was expected to compete for a roster spot on the Canucks immediately after being drafted . He was then signed to a three @-@ year , entry @-@ level contract worth the rookie maximum of $ 2 @.@ 625 million on October 5 , 2008 . However , the next day , he was sent back to Brampton for the 2008 – 09 season . 
 Upon his return , Hodgson was named the ninth captain in Battalion team history . He succeeded forward Thomas Stajan , who served as captain for the start of the season while Hodgson competed in the NHL pre @-@ season . Stajan himself had just replaced defenceman John de Gray , who had turned professional . 
 Chosen to represent the OHL in the 2008 ADT Canada @-@ Russia Challenge in November , Hodgson recorded a hat @-@ trick and added an assist in the first of two games against Russia ; he was chosen as game MVP . He went on to complete the month of November with 27 points in 13 games to be named OHL Player of the Month . Hodgson had also been chosen as the OHL Player of the Week for the week ending on November 9 after scoring nine points in three games . After a second Player of the Week recognition , scoring seven points in three games for the week ending February 1 , 2009 , Hodgson participated in the 2009 OHL All @-@ Star Classic . Joined by teammates Matt Duchene , Evgeny Grachev and Thomas McCollum for the Eastern Conference , Hodgson received player of the game honours after a five @-@ point effort in an 11 – 6 win . He recorded a hat @-@ trick , along with Western Conference representative Justin DiBenedetto , to tie Scott Barney , who first scored three goals in 1999 , for the OHL All @-@ Star Game record . Hodgson 's five points also tied the All @-@ Star Game record for most points ( shared by five others ) . He recorded another record later in the month with a 23 @-@ game point @-@ scoring streak , registering 17 goals , 23 assists and 40 points in that span . The streak was both a Battalion club record and OHL season @-@ high . 
 Hodgson finished the season with 43 goals and 92 points in 53 games , fourth in League scoring . The annual OHL coaches poll distinguished Hodgson as the smartest player ( for the second consecutive season ) , the hardest worker , the best on faceoffs and the best penalty killer . In addition to OHL First All @-@ Star Team honours , he was awarded both the William Hanley Trophy as the League 's most sportsmanlike player and the Red Tilson Trophy as OHL player of the year . The media voted Hodgson ahead of forward John Tavares and goaltender Mike Murphy for the Tilson award . Hodgson was then distinguished over fellow major junior league MVP 's Brett Sonne of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) and Nicola <unk> of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League ( QMJHL ) as the CHL Player of the Year . 
 Early in the subsequent playoff season , Hodgson received his second OHL Player of the Month recognition for March ( 26 points in 11 games ) . He helped the Battalion advance to the OHL Finals , where they lost the J. Ross Robertson Cup to the Windsor Spitfires . He led his team with 31 points in the post @-@ season . 
 Following the Battalion 's playoff elimination , Hodgson was assigned to the Canucks ' American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Manitoba Moose , for their 2009 playoff run . Making his professional debut with the Moose in Game 1 of the semi @-@ finals against the Houston Aeros , he notched an assist on the game 's first goal for his first professional point . He followed up with his first professional goal the next night , a wrist shot against Aeros goaltender Nolan Schaefer , in a 5 – 2 victory . While Hodgson started on the fourth line for the Moose , he quickly moved his way up to the second line with fellow Canucks first @-@ round pick Michael Grabner . Advancing past the Aeros , Moose Head Coach Scott Arniel chose not to play Hodgson in Game 4 of the Calder Cup Finals against the Hershey Bears . Arniel explained the decision was attributed to fatigue on Hodgson 's part from a lengthy season in the juniors ( including the 2009 World Juniors and a lengthy OHL playoff run ) . He returned the next game to help the Moose stave off elimination with a goal in a 3 – 2 Game 5 victory . Manitoba went on to lose the Calder Cup in Game 6 by a 4 – 1 score . Hodgson 's assisted on the Moose 's lone tally by Mário <unk> . 
 Preparing for the Canucks ' training camp for the 2009 – 10 season , Hodgson injured his back while working out in the summer . The injury , which was misdiagnosed as a bulging disc in his lower back , caused him to miss two months of summer training . After being cleared to play by Canucks team doctors on September 11 , 2009 , and a back specialist in Toronto , Hodgson was again expected to secure a roster spot during training camp . After struggling in six pre @-@ season games , he was returned to the Brampton Battalion on September 29 in the final round of team cuts . 
 Hodgson subsequently sought a third opinion regarding his back at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio . In response , then @-@ Canucks Head Coach Alain Vigneault publicly speculated whether Hodgson was simply having a hard time being cut and was trying to " roll the [ blame ] in another direction . " Despite having been cleared earlier to play in the pre @-@ season by two sets of doctors , the Cleveland Clinic judged him unfit to play for a month . Previously undetected nerve damage in one leg was also revealed . Due to Hodgson 's misdiagnosis , which was not corrected until a year later , subsequent treatment and rehabilitation was designed for a bulging disc , which further aggravated his real injury – a muscle strain . 
 After missing the first 50 games of the 2009 – 10 OHL season , Hodgson returned to the Battalion line @-@ up on February 4 , 2010 , recording two assists in a 4 – 2 win against the Erie Otters . Following his return , he declared he would no longer be training in the off @-@ season with Canucks Director of Player Development Dave Gagner , under whose supervision he suffered his back injury . Combined with the Canucks doctors ' initial misdiagnosis and Vigneault 's disparaging comments regarding Hodgson following the NHL pre @-@ season , there was speculation in the media of a possible conflict between Hodgson and the Canucks organization . General Manager Mike Gillis , however , dismissed such speculation . 
 Eight days after his OHL return , Hodgson suffered another injury , breaking a toe on his right foot while blocking a shot against the Sudbury Wolves . Initial X @-@ rays came up negative and he continued playing for nine more games before a second X @-@ ray revealed a hairline fracture in one his right metatarsal bones . Missing the Battalion 's final five regular season games , he finished the campaign with eight goals and 20 points over 13 contests . Despite missing the majority of the season , he was voted as the smartest player in the Eastern Conference for the third consecutive year in the OHL coaches poll . 
 Hodgson returned to the Brampton line @-@ up for the opening game of the 2010 playoffs , scoring the game @-@ winning goal against the Kingston Frontenacs . In Game 5 of the series , he scored his 20th career playoff goal in the OHL , surpassing Wojtek Wolski for the all @-@ time lead among Battalion players . The Battalion eliminated the Frontenacs in seven games before themselves being ousted in four games by Barrie in the second round . Hodgson completed the post @-@ season with ten points in 11 games , second in team @-@ scoring to Sean Jones . He admitted publicly after the playoffs that his health " was never 100 percent " during the 2009 – 10 season . 
 The Battalion 's playoff elimination marked the end of Hodgson 's four @-@ year OHL career . He left Brampton ranked second on the club 's all @-@ time scoring list behind Wojtek Wolski in regular season goals ( 114 ) , assists ( 129 ) , points ( 243 ) , powerplay goals ( 46 ) and shorthanded goals ( 7 ) , while ranking first in game @-@ winning goals ( 23 ) . In playoff games , he left as the all @-@ time leader in goals ( 20 ) , assists ( 30 ) and points ( 50 ) . 
 Following his 2009 – 10 OHL season , it was expected Hodgson would join the Manitoba Moose for a second consecutive AHL playoff season . However , after being assessed by Canucks team doctors , his broken toe was judged to have not yet fully healed and he was not cleared for AHL assignment . Hodgson additionally believed that he had re @-@ injured his back while colliding head @-@ first into the boards during Game 7 of the opening playoff round . He underwent an MRI in the off @-@ season , which uncovered the misdiagnosed bulging disc to be a muscle strain instead . With the Canucks ' consent , he trained in the off @-@ season with former NHL player Gary Roberts , who had himself overcome a back injury during his career .

 After challenging for a Canucks roster spot once again during the team 's 2010 training camp , Hodgson was assigned to the Manitoba Moose . He scored his first regular season AHL goal against goaltender Peter Delmas of the Hamilton Bulldogs on October 22 , 2010 . With the score tied 3 – 3 after overtime , Hodgson added a shootout goal to help the Moose win the game . Later , in December 2010 , Hodgson suffered a broken orbital bone after he was high @-@ sticked by teammate Lee Sweatt during a Moose practice . Eight days after returning to Manitoba 's line @-@ up , Hodgson earned his first NHL call @-@ up to Vancouver . 
 Hodgson made his NHL debut on February 1 , 2011 , in a 4 – 1 win against the Dallas Stars . Centring the fourth line and playing on the second powerplay unit , he registered two shots in over nine minutes of ice time . The following day , he scored his first career NHL goal against Ilya <unk> in a 6 – 0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes . In his third game , he recorded his first career NHL assist on a goal by Christian Ehrhoff against the Chicago Blackhawks ; Vancouver won 4 – 3 . After appearing in his first five NHL games , Hodgson was returned to the Moose on February 11 . Team management explained to the media his call @-@ up was a means to introduce him to NHL play and that they were more comfortable having him continue developing in the AHL with first @-@ line minutes and a bigger role with the Moose . However , with the team 's fourth @-@ line centre role unfilled ( Alain Vigneault had been using natural winger Tanner Glass in that position ) , he was called back to Vancouver within ten days . Hodgson played three more games for the Canucks before the team acquired fourth @-@ line centre Maxim Lapierre from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline on February 28 . Hodgson was subsequently sent back down to Manitoba . He completed his professional rookie season with 30 points in 52 AHL games – ranking fifth in Moose scoring – and two points in eight NHL games . 
 At the end of the regular season , Hodgson was called up to the Canucks for the 2011 playoffs . He registered his first NHL playoff point in Game 2 of the opening round against the Chicago Blackhawks , assisting on a goal by defenceman Alexander Edler in a 4 – 3 win . Hodgson drew in and out of the line @-@ up throughout the post @-@ season , appearing in 12 of the Canucks ' 25 @-@ game playoff run , which ended in a Game 7 loss to the Boston Bruins in the Stanley Cup Finals . 
 During the off @-@ season , Canucks centre Ryan Kesler underwent hip surgery , sidelining him for the start of the 2011 – 12 campaign . With the centre position on the second line vacant , Hodgson competed with the newly @-@ acquired Andrew Ebbett to temporarily replace Kesler . After being cut in his previous three training camps with the team , Hodgson emerged with the second @-@ line position to start the season . After wearing 39 on his jersey the previous season as a rookie , Hodgson switched to 9 , a number historically associated in the NHL with high @-@ profile players . He had previously spoken to team trainers regarding the number , but decided having the number is " something you have to earn [ by ] mak [ ing ] the team first . " When Kesler returned to the team 's line @-@ up six games into the season , Hodgson was moved to the right wing to remain on the second line , before settling in as the team 's third @-@ line centre . On December 10 , 2011 , Hodgson left a game against the Ottawa Senators after a hit from opposing forward Nick <unk> left him unsteadily skating back to the bench . Hodgson was reportedly uninjured , as Vigneault told media he was kept out of the contest for precautionary measures . 
 Ranking fifth among NHL rookies in scoring by January 2012 , he was selected as one of 12 first @-@ year players to participate in the NHL All @-@ Star Game SuperSkills Competition in Ottawa , Ontario . He was designated to Team Chara during the All @-@ Star Draft and went on to participate in one SuperSkills event , the shooting accuracy segment . Hitting all four targets in 20 @.@ 929 seconds , he lost the rookie heat to Matt Read of the Philadelphia Flyers , who had a time of 14 @.@ 011 seconds . Hodgson 's time ranked fifth among the eight players who participated in the event . Canucks teammates Henrik Sedin , Daniel Sedin and Alexander Edler joined Hodgson in Ottawa as NHL All @-@ Stars , though they competed against him in the SuperSkills Competition as part of Team Alfredsson . Following the NHL All @-@ Star weekend , Hodgson was named the League 's Rookie of the Month for January after having recorded ten points ( six goals and four assists ) over 11 games , first among Canucks and NHL first @-@ year players . 
 Playing behind Henrik Sedin and Ryan Kesler on the Canucks ' depth chart at centre , Hodgson earned limited ice @-@ time with the Canucks . By mid @-@ season , his success as a rookie led many in the media to question the 10 – 12 minutes of ice time Alain Vigneault routinely allotted him per game . 
 = = = Buffalo Sabres = = = 
 Minutes before the NHL trade deadline on February 27 , 2012 , Hodgson was dealt , along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer , to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc @-@ André <unk> . Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade as an effort to balance his team out by trading Hodgson 's skill and finesse in return for Kassian 's size and toughness . Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment , commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs , Hodgson 's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver 's success was based upon . 
 In a telephone interview with TSN shortly after the trade , Hodgson told reporters he was " in shock , " adding that " It 's tough to leave Vancouver . " There were , however , reports in the media that Hodgson had asked for a trade from the Canucks , an allegation that Mike Gillis neither confirmed nor denied . The reaction in the Vancouver media was largely of surprise that Gillis would trade away a well @-@ performing rookie . Vancouver Sun columnist Iain MacIntyre declared it " a stunner " and " one of the most unpopular trades in Vancouver in years . " Another Sun article likened the deal to a lopsided 1996 trade between the Canucks and Pittsburgh Penguins in which two first @-@ round prospects of opposite playing styles – the skilled Markus Näslund and the larger , more aggressive Alek Stojanov – were exchanged . Näslund went on to become the Canucks ' all @-@ time leading goal- and point @-@ scorer , while the latter had a short career in the minor leagues . 
 Hodgson made his Sabres debut two days after the trade , registering four shots on goal and 16 minutes of ice time in a 2 – 0 win against the Anaheim Ducks . After going pointless in his first ten games with Buffalo , Hodgson recorded two assists in a 7 – 3 win against the Tampa Bay Lightning on March 19 . Two nights later , he scored his first two goals as a Sabre in a game against the Montreal Canadiens . Leaving Vancouver gave Hodgson a larger on @-@ ice role , earning nearly five minutes more ice time per game as a Sabre . Completing his first NHL season with the Sabres , he finished with 41 points ( 19 goals and 22 assists ) over 83 games . He ranked fifth in League rookie scoring and first in power play goals ( 7 ) , despite earning less ice time than his first @-@ year peers ( his 13 minutes and 49 seconds per game averaged the least among the top 14 rookie scorers ) . As a team , the Sabres then failed to qualify for the 2012 playoffs , finishing ninth in the Eastern Conference . Hodgson was assigned to the AHL 's Rochester Americans immediately before the 2012 – 13 NHL lock @-@ out took effect . 
 Hodgson signed a six @-@ year , $ 25 @.@ 5 million extension with the Sabres on September 11 , 2013 . 
 In the second year of his contract extension with the Sabres in the 2014 – 15 season , Hodgson suffered the worst season in his professional career , contributing with just 6 goals and 13 points in 78 outings for the cellar @-@ dwelling Sabres . With the option to buy @-@ out his contract at a lower rate due to his age , on June 29 , 2015 , the Sabres , in the midst of a rebuild , placed Hodgson on unconditional waivers in order for a release to free agency . 
 = = = Nashville Predators = = = 
 On the opening day of free agency , Hodgson signed a one @-@ year contract with the Nashville Predators . Hodgson made the opening night roster of the Predators to begin the 2015 – 16 season . He was used primarily in a depth role , centering the fourth @-@ line . After posting 8 points in 39 games , Hodgson was placed on waivers by the Predators on January 13 , 2016 . Hodgson passed through waivers unclaimed and was subsequently assigned to AHL affiliate , the Milwaukee Admirals the following day . Hodgson was not offered a new contract by the club , and became an unrestricted free agent on July 1 . 
 = = International play = = 
 Hodgson first competed internationally for Canada at the 2007 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament in <unk> , Czech Republic , and Piešťany , Slovakia . Although favoured to win the tournament , Canada finished in fourth place . He scored two goals in the 5 – 4 bronze medal game loss to Russia . In total , Hodgson contributed a team @-@ high five points in four games , tied with Steven Stamkos . Hodgson also represented Ontario later that year at the 2007 Canada Winter Games , winning gold over Manitoba 6 – 4 in the gold medal game . 
 Hodgson next represented Canada at the 2008 IIHF World U18 Championships in Kazan , Russia . Playing in the quarter @-@ finals against Finland , Hodgson was named player of the game after scoring the game @-@ winning goal in a 2 – 1 victory . Hodgson finished with a tournament @-@ high 12 points in seven games , leading Canada as team captain to its second IIHF World U18 gold medal with an 8 – 0 victory over tournament host Russia . He was chosen as one of Canada 's three top players by tournament coaches , along with forward Jordan Eberle and goaltender Jake Allen . 
 In his third year of junior , Hodgson was selected to compete in the 2009 World Junior Championships with Team Canada in Ottawa . He was chosen as an alternate captain to defenceman Thomas Hickey . In the second round @-@ robin game against Kazakhstan , Hodgson accumulated six points ( two goals and four assists ) , coming within one point of the single @-@ game Canadian record held by Michael Cammalleri and Dave <unk> . In the following round @-@ robin game against the United States , he scored the game @-@ winning goal in a 7 – 4 win to lead Team Canada to first place in their pool and a bye to the semi @-@ finals . Facing Sweden in the final game , Hodgson scored two goals – one on the powerplay and an empty @-@ netter – and one assist to overtake John Tavares as the tournament leading scorer with five goals and 11 assists for 16 points in six games . Team Canada defeated Sweden 5 – 1 to capture the gold medal while Hodgson was named to the Tournament All @-@ Star Team . Returning from the tournament , Hodgson was asked to drop the ceremonial faceoff for a Toronto Maple Leafs game against the Florida Panthers on January 6 , 2009 . 
 Leading up to the 2010 World Junior Championships in Saskatchewan , Hodgson was named to Team Canada 's selection camp roster on December 2 , 2009 , despite not yet playing in an OHL game during the 2009 – 10 season due to a back injury . However , he notified Hockey Canada five days later that his back was not yet ready and that he would not participate in the selection camp .

 = Simba = 
 Simba ( from the Swahili word for lion ) is a fictional character who appears in The Lion King franchise . Introduced in Walt Disney Animation 's 32nd animated feature film The Lion King ( 1994 ) , the character subsequently appears in its sequels The Lion King II : Simba 's Pride ( 1998 ) and The Lion King 1 ½ ( 2004 ) . 
 Simba was created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi , Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton . While Mark Henn served as Simba 's supervising animator as a cub , Ruben A. Aquino animated the character as he appears as an adult . 
 Although considered an original character , Simba was inspired by the character Bambi from Disney 's Bambi ( 1942 ) , as well as the stories of Moses and Joseph from the Bible . Additionally , several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet from William Shakespeare 's tragedy of the same name . In 1997 , The Lion King was adapted into Broadway musical , with actors Scott Irby @-@ Ranniar and Jason Raize originating the roles of the cub and adult Simbas , respectively . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 The idea for The Lion King originated from Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1989 and was originally conceived under the title King of the Jungle . The story , which has been compared to Bambi ( 1942 ) , was jokingly referred to as " Bambi in Africa " because of the similarities between the two films and their respective main characters . Co @-@ director Rob Minkoff said that both films are " more true @-@ life adventure than mythical epic . " Though considered an original coming @-@ of @-@ age story that follows the life of Simba as he grows up and " tak [ es ] on the responsibility of adulthood , " co @-@ directors Roger Allers and Minkoff drew inspiration from other sources . In particular , the biblical figures Moses and Joseph served as creative inspiration for the character . Producer Don Hahn said that , like them , Simba is " born into royalty , is then exiled , and has to return to claim [ his ] kingdom . " 
 Several film and entertainment critics have noted similarities and parallels between the stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare 's tragedy Hamlet , and their protagonists . Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and came as a surprise to the filmmakers themselves ; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it . According to Hahn , " When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet . Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we were doing something Shakespearean , so we continued to look for ways to model our film on that all @-@ time classic . " 
 Screenwriter Jonathan Roberts said that , in a musical , songs are used to convey a character 's emotions and " I wants . " Composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice wrote the song " I Just Can 't Wait to Be King " in order to give Simba a medium through which he can express his desire to become King of the Pride Lands . Roberts said , " It 's a way for storytellers to move the story and deliver the direction of the character . " 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Matthew Broderick provided the speaking voice of Adult Simba . The first actor to be assigned to The Lion King , Broderick learned of the role while he was on vacation in Ireland , where he received a telephone call from his agent informing him that the directors were interested in casting him as Simba . At the time , Broderick was well known for portraying the title character in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off ( 1986 ) . The directors decided to cast him as Simba because they felt that he was " perfect " for the role ; according to producer Don Hahn , Broderick 's voice resembled " the kind of character who could be irresponsible and likeable , but you also felt that he could come back in a very heroic way . " Jonathan Taylor Thomas , who was starring as Randy Taylor on the television sitcom Home Improvement at the time , was cast as the speaking voice of Young Simba . His appearance and personality would later serve as creative inspiration for supervising animator Mark Henn . 
 Though Broderick is a trained Broadway singer , he was not up to the task , and neither was non @-@ singer Thomas , so Toto lead singer Joseph Williams and actor Jason Weaver were hired to dub their respective singing voices . Williams ' voice is heard on the song " Can You Feel the Love Tonight " . Impressed by Weaver 's performance as a young Michael Jackson in the miniseries The Jacksons : An American Dream , songwriters Elton John and Tim Rice recruited him to record " I Just Can 't Wait to Be King " and " Hakuna Matata " while the film was still in its early stages of production . As directors , Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff worked closely with the actors in order to ensure credible performances . As is frequently done in animated films , the filmmakers videotaped the actors while they recorded their dialogue , allowing the animators to incorporate their specific mannerisms into the designs of their characters . 
 = = = Characterization and animation = = = 
 When The Lion King was green @-@ lit , its concept and story were not well received by studio employees . To guarantee the release of at least one successful film , Disney CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg divided the studio into two separate projects : The Lion King and Pocahontas ( 1995 ) , with Pocahontas expected to be the more successful of the two . Because of this assumption , the majority of the studio 's more seasoned animators gravitated towards Pocahontas because The Lion King was deemed a " risk " , while less experienced animators were assigned to work on The Lion King . Co @-@ director Rob Minkoff received this positively , saying that this decision " gave a lot of newer animators a chance to step up to leadership roles . " 
 The role of animating Simba was divided between Mark Henn and Ruben A. Aquino . While Henn served as the supervising animator of Simba as a cub , credited as Young Simba , Aquino was placed in charge of animating the character as he appears as an adult . The Lion King was Disney 's first animated feature film to feature a cast of quadrupeds since Oliver & Company ( 1988 ) . According to Aquino , animating four @-@ legged creatures is difficult because the artists are faced with the task of drawing " twice as many legs ... as you do with human characters " and must also attribute to them both human and animal @-@ like qualities . For assistance , Aquino drew influence from previous animated films that feature four @-@ legged creatures as their main characters , citing Bambi , Lady and the Tramp ( 1955 ) and The Jungle Book ( 1967 ) as his main sources of inspiration . 
 Before The Lion King , Henn 's experience as a supervising animator was limited to predominantly female characters ; he had just recently completed work on Ariel from The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , Belle from Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) and Jasmine from Aladdin ( 1992 ) . When he became involved with The Lion King , Henn initially expressed interest in animating the film 's villain , Scar , because he wanted to do " something different . " However , producer Don Hahn felt that he was better suited for animating Simba . Henn approaches animating new characters by " put [ ting himself ] into the character ’ s situation . " Simba proved to be a challenge because Henn was faced with the task of creating an animated character who would both appear and behave like a real lion cub . To achieve this , Henn visited zoos , sketched and studied live lion cubs that were brought into the studio for research , and frequently consulted with wildlife experts . 
 When it came time to animate Simba during the " I Just Can 't Wait to Be King " musical sequence , Henn felt it essential that the character remain on all fours at all times , despite the fact that he is meant to be dancing . In terms of personality , Henn aimed to depict Simba as a " cocky , confident character " at the beginning of the film , who must eventually mature and learn to take responsibility . The animators would often observe and document the voice actors while they recorded their dialogue , using their movements and mannerisms as a visual aid . Actor Jonathan Taylor Thomas , who provided the voice of Young Simba , served as inspiration for the design and personality of Simba . Henn said , " I loved watching Jonathan Taylor Thomas when he was a boy on Home Improvement , and getting to meet him and observe him . " Although Aquino was responsible for animating the majority of Simba 's adult sequences , Henn animated the character 's first appearance as an adult that occurs near the end of the " Hakuna Matata " musical number .

 Released in theaters in 1994 , The Lion King marks Simba 's first appearance . All the animals in the Pride Lands gather at the foot of Pride Rock to commemorate the birth of Simba , who will eventually succeed to the throne and take his father Mufasa 's place as king . Furious by the fact that he is no longer next in line , Simba 's jealous uncle Scar refuses to attend the ceremony . While Simba grows into a rambunctious lion cub who frequently boasts about the fact that he will someday rule over the Pride Lands , Scar secretly plots against him . 
 Scar plots regicide and <unk> against Simba and Mufasa by luring Simba into a vast gorge , where he triggers a wildebeest stampede . Notified by Scar that Simba is in danger , Mufasa rushes to his aid and manages to place him safely on a ledge . Weakened and unable to pull himself up the steep slope to safety , Mufasa asks his brother for assistance . However , Scar 's true nature is revealed and he betrays Mufasa , throwing him into the gorge where he is killed by the fall . 
 Convinced by Scar that he is responsible for his father 's death , Simba runs away to a distant jungle where he is befriended by Timon and Pumbaa , who teach him to ignore his past and avoid his responsibilities . There , he grows into a handsome young lion , while Scar wreaks havoc on the Pride Lands . When Simba is discovered by his childhood friend Nala several years later , she confronts him , warning him of Scar 's tyranny and begging him to return home . Afraid of facing his past , Simba refuses until a wise mandrill named Rafiki leads him to Mufasa 's ghost , who convinces him to return home and reclaim his kingdom from Scar . 
 Simba returns to the Pride Lands and finds them barren because their natural resources have been squandered and abused by Scar . After witnessing Scar strike his mother Sarabi , Simba orders Scar to resign . At first thrown by the fact that he is alive , Scar soon regains composure and forces Simba to reveal that he is responsible for Mufasa 's death , while cornering him at the edge of Pride Rock , hoping to subject him to a similar fate as his father . Having grown overconfident , Scar finally reveals to Simba that he killed Mufasa . Furious , Simba tackles Scar and forces him into announcing this to the pride , initiating a battle between Simba 's pride of lionesses , Timon , & Pumbaa and Scar 's army of hyenas . Simba eventually defeats Scar and throws him into a pit , where he is cornered and killed by the hyenas , who have had enough of Scar treating them like slaves .
