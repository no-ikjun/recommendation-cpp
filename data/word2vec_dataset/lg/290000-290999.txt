 The International Military Tribunal for the Far East stated that the massacre took place in the parts of Nanking captured on December 13 , 1937 , and after and lasted until early February 1938 . Though many still support the IMTFE 's geographic scope for the massacre , in 1984 the journalist Katsuichi Honda became the first individual to voice disapproval of this definition . Honda argued that the Japanese Army 's atrocities had not suddenly started when the Japanese reached the city of Nanking proper on December 13 , but rather were part of a continuous process which started soon after the Japanese Army left Shanghai early in November . Honda believes all those atrocities that were committed on " the road to Nanking " were part of the massacre . 
 Then in 1997 Kasahara formulated a definition between the two . He reasoned that the Nanking Massacre should include the entire area of what was then known as the " Nanking Special Administrative District " . This district encompassed not only the city of Nanking proper , occupied by the Japanese from December 13 , but also the six rural counties surrounding it , namely <unk> , Lishui , Jurong , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . This definition , though considerably larger than the IMTFE 's , keeps the massacre contained to " Nanking " without including cities on the outskirts of Shanghai like Suzhou and Wuxi which Honda does include . Kasahara believes that including massacre victims from the surrounding rural parts of Nanking adds 30 @,@ 000 victims onto the death toll . 
 However , the expansion of the definition of the Nanking Massacre to include areas outside of Nanking has not been without controversy . The argument in favor of this made by Katsuichi Honda in 1984 was seen by some scholars involved in the debate on the massacre as a " partial admission of defeat " by Honda . In their view Honda , who had previously put forward the idea that more than 100 @,@ 000 people were murdered in the city of Nanking alone , was failing to prove his argument and therefore sought to extend the boundaries of the massacre until a larger figure for the death toll could be achieved . French historian Jean @-@ Louis Margolin , for instance , has strongly criticized Honda 's argument , noting that " As , in our present knowledge , it is impossible to get convincing figures for such large areas , such methods may be considered as attempts to blur hopelessly the debate . " 
 Apart from geographical scope , some historians including Kasahara deny that the massacre ended in early February and instead put the end date at March 28 , though such a long time range is disputed by other historians . On the other hand , at least one historian has noted that the atrocity in Nanking could be equated with the entire war waged by Japan on China . By this definition the " Nanking Massacre " can symbolically be said to have lasted from 1931 to 1945 , extended over the whole of China , and included ten million victims . 
 = = Japanese views = = 
 In the early 1970s , Japanese historian Hora 's estimate of 200 @,@ 000 massacre victims was challenged for the first time by the journalist Akira Suzuki , who suggested that " several tens of thousands " had been killed . Soon after some revisionists claimed that no massacre had taken place at all . Nanking Massacre studies in Japan eventually became divided into three camps based on their death toll estimates : the " illusion " school of Nanking Massacre deniers , the " great massacre " school which believes hundreds of thousands were killed , and the " middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road " or " centrist " school which puts the number in the tens of thousands . 
 However , when Shokun ! magazine surveyed members of each " school " for their opinions on the massacre , many of the so @-@ called " centrists " advocated extremely low figures for the total number of victims , including <unk> University professor Akira Nakamura , journalist Yoshiko Sakurai , and researcher Toshio Tanabe , who each counted about 10 @,@ 000 massacred , and military historian Takeshi Hara who selected 20 @,@ 000 . In reviewing this survey , Askew concluded that all of its " centrists " were effectively deniers of the atrocity except for Hara . By contrast Bob Wakabayashi sets the bar higher and believes that the estimate of 40 @,@ 000 victims put forward by Ikuhiko Hata is the lowest reasonable estimate of the total death toll and considers numbers below this to be attempts at minimizing the atrocity . Today most Japanese historians of the so @-@ called " great massacre " school have reduced their death toll estimates somewhat and now advocate the figure of " 100 @,@ 000 plus " in contrast with the old consensus of 200 @,@ 000 . According to historians Haruo Tohmatsu and HP Willmott , Japanese scholars generally consider the estimate of roughly 40 @,@ 000 massacre victims to be " the most academically reliable estimate " . 
 = = <unk> of the Chinese government = = 
 The official stance of the People 's Republic of China is that 300 @,@ 000 or more Chinese were massacred in Nanking . Initially , this figure was generally accepted as including both massacre victims and Chinese soldiers killed in combat , though during the 1980s it came to be interpreted as including only massacre victims . 
 Today many mainstream historians concur that this estimate is exaggerated . The figure was originally based on the verdict of the Nanking War Crimes Tribunal which added the burial records of 155 @,@ 300 bodies with 72 @,@ 291 destroyed corpses to arrive at a total of 279 @,@ 586 , though there was an apparent adding mistake in this calculation . Furthermore , this estimate includes an accusation that the Japanese Army murdered 57 @,@ 418 Chinese POWs at Mufushan , though the latest research indicates that between 4 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 were massacred , and it also includes the 112 @,@ 266 corpses allegedly buried by the <unk> , though today many historians agree that the <unk> 's records were at least exaggerated if not entirely fabricated . Bob Wakabayashi concludes from this that estimates over 200 @,@ 000 are not credible . Ikuhiko Hata considers the number of 300 @,@ 000 to be a " symbolic figure " representative of China 's wartime suffering and not a figure to be taken literally . 
 Nevertheless , the Chinese government has maintained a hard line on its estimate of 300 @,@ 000 victims . Within China scholars focus on defending the official figures and in the past the government has imposed censorship on historians who have suggested alternative numbers . Joshua A. Fogel , a historian of China at York University , has decried the efforts of many Chinese to exaggerate the death toll of the atrocity and then " silence anyone who disagrees " . 
 In 2006 , Kaz Ross , a historian with the University of Tasmania , anonymously interviewed a number of university researchers in the city of Nanking to learn their private views on the death toll of the Nanking Massacre . She found that Chinese historians favor estimates between 40 @,@ 000 and 150 @,@ 000 and that they " speculated that reducing the official Chinese estimate of victims would pave the way for greater reconciliation between Japan and China " . However , they feared that speaking out openly " would be detrimental to their careers . " In contrast with the People 's Republic of China , the official history of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War released by the Republic of China states that the death toll of the massacre was " more than 100 @,@ 000 people " . 
 = = Western views = = 
 By the year 2000 very little research had been done by Western scholars concerning the death toll of the Nanking Massacre , and instead most Western sources simply repeated the early death toll estimates , including those proposed in the 1930s and 1940s by the International Military Tribunal of the Far East , which put the toll at 100 @,@ 000 or more , and by Miner Searle Bates , who said roughly 40 @,@ 000 . In The Cambridge History of China , historian Lloyd Eastman asserted that the death toll was " at least 42 @,@ 000 " , whereas military officer Frank Dorn wrote in his book The Sino @-@ Japanese War , 1937 @-@ 41 that the death toll was " over 200 @,@ 000 civilians " . 
 According to Canadian scholar David Bruce MacDonald , the higher range of estimates of over 100 @,@ 000 victims are more likely to be accurate , whereas by contrast the Irish historian LM Cullen argues that the lower range of estimates , which put the death toll in tens of thousands , " are probably the most credible . " 
 = = Death toll estimates = = 
 Currently , the most reliable and widely agreed upon figures place the total death toll of the massacre between the broad range of 40 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 massacre victims in the entire Nanking Special Administrative District . Some individual estimates by scholars and eyewitnesses are included in the following table . 
 = = Concerns about victim counts = = 
 The debate on the death toll has gone on for many decades to the point where some historians have begun to question its usefulness on the grounds that excessive quibbling over the precise death toll has distracted from the study of other more important facets of the massacre . <unk> Yang , a historian at George Washington University , believes that " an obsession with figures reduces an atrocity to abstraction and serves to circumvent a critical examination of the causes of and responsibilities for these appalling atrocities " and Carol Gluck concurs that " The crucial historical question remains the moral one : how could ordinary Japanese have done what they did ? <unk> arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities do not address this point . " However , Masahiro Yamamoto printed a rebuttal of Gluck 's statement in his book Nanking : Anatomy of an Atrocity , arguing that " To determine the extent and nature of [ Japan 's ] responsibility , the ' numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities , ' which [ Gluck ] termed as irrelevant to the moral question , are essential . Only after firmly establishing ' historical particularities ' can one clearly define Japan ’ s responsibility . And based on a clear definition of the responsibility there can be an answer to the ' moral ' question . "

 Jedi Knight is primarily a first @-@ person shooter , although it does offer the choice of a third @-@ person view . The game consists of twenty @-@ one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level . There are weapons available in each level and after level three , the player has the use of a lightsaber , along with the Force . In addition to being an effective weapon , the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player , providing light in dark areas , deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles . 
 There are three types of Force powers ; light , dark and neutral . Light Force powers provide nonviolent advantages such as being able to restore health or persuade enemies to ignore the player . Dark Force powers are violent and give the ability to throw objects or choke enemies . Neutral powers enhance athletic abilities such as being able to jump higher or run faster . There are fourteen powers in total , four of each type and a bonus power in each light and dark if the Jedi stays true to that path . Players earn stars to allocate toward Force powers by completing specific levels . By finding all the secrets in a level , players can also gain one bonus star to use . Between levels , the player can choose which Force powers to enhance by allocating stars to that power . Stars cannot be reclaimed from powers later on . 
 Some levels contain puzzles that may require use of the Force to overcome , or by locating certain objects in the level . There are a variety of hostile and non @-@ hostile non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) within each level with whom the player can interact . Other enemies include monsters and vehicles . There are two endings to Jedi Knight , depending on how the player plays the game . If the player does not harm non @-@ hostile NPCs and focuses on collecting light Force powers , the player will get the light side ending . Conversely if the player harms non @-@ hostile NPCs and collects dark Force powers , the game will end with the dark side ending .

 Jedi Knight includes a multiplayer mode that allows up to eight people to compete with one another on a local area network and up to thirty two people online . Online gaming was hosted by the MSN Gaming Zone . The player creates an avatar within Jedi Knight and selects a ranking , with higher rankings having access to more Force powers . The player can also edit their avatar 's " skin " and lightsaber color . There are two types of game in Jedi Knight 's multiplayer mode , " Capture the flag " and " Jedi Training " , similar to deathmatch . The players can customize the settings to play a deathmatch the way they desire ; for example , by limiting the use of Force powers or playing on teams . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game is set one year after the events of Return of the Jedi . The player controls Kyle Katarn ( voiced by Jason Court ) , who made his first appearance as a mercenary in Dark Forces . On Nar Shaddaa , Katarn meets with an information broker droid named <unk> ( Denny Delk ) who tells Katarn that his father , Morgan Katarn ( Jacob Witkin ) , was killed by a Dark Jedi named Jerec ( Christopher Neame ) , who also intends to rebuild the Empire under his rule . After a lengthy firefight , Kyle retrieves a disk from <unk> that can only be read by <unk> , the Katarn 's family droid . The disk 's message , coupled with <unk> giving Kyle a lightsaber , compel Kyle to undertake a journey to confront his father 's murderers and discover his own latent Force abilities . While on this journey , Kyle learns that seven Dark Jedi are intent on finding the " Valley of the Jedi " , a focal point for the Force and sacred ground for the Jedi . 
 Katarn retrieves the Valley 's location and travels with Rebel Alliance agent and close friend Jan Ors ( Angela Harry ) to <unk> , the planet on which the Valley is located . Jerec captures Ors and offers Katarn the choice to execute her or die . The decision Katarn makes here depends on the player 's actions within the game up to this point . If Katarn has fallen to the dark side he kills Ors , but if he has remained true to the light path he spares her . With both paths , Katarn has a final confrontation with Jerec in the Valley of the Jedi 's core . If the player chose the dark path , the game ends with Katarn becoming the new Emperor ; if the player chose the light side , the game concludes with Katarn being reunited with Ors and carving a monument to Rahn and his dead father . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development of Jedi Knight was led by Justin Chin , who had also worked on the previous game . The most significant developments for Jedi Knight are the use of The Force and the lightsaber . The Force plays an integral role in how the player plays the game and shapes the way the game is played . The method of allocating credits to Force powers was designed with a role @-@ playing video game style in mind , allowing the player the choice of which powers to improve . Chin said in an early interview that progress in the game is based upon the abilities the player develops . 
 Jedi Knight uses both 3D graphics and surround sound . It is one of the early games to adopt the use of 3D graphics hardware acceleration using Microsoft Direct3D . The 3D sound technology was tweaked extensively to give an immersive feel to the game . This was achieved by experimentation using many different sound effects and playback styles . Between levels Jedi Knight features full motion video cutscenes . The characters are represented by live actors while the backgrounds are pre @-@ rendered graphics . The cutscenes included the first lightsaber footage filmed since Return of the Jedi in 1983 .

 After the release of Jedi Knight , LucasArts developed Star Wars Jedi Knight : Mysteries of the Sith as an expansion pack . It was released on January 31 , 1998 and received positive reviews from critics . The expansion includes a single @-@ player mode and fifteen multiplayer maps . There are also technical improvements over Jedi Knight , including colored lighting , new textures and models , and developments to the artificial intelligence . 
 The single @-@ player story in Mysteries of the Sith is set five years after the events of Jedi Knight . The player once more takes control of Kyle Katarn , but later in the game is given control of Mara Jade , one of the most popular Star Wars expanded universe characters .

 Star Wars Jedi Knight : Dark Forces II was well received . The game holds an aggregate score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on ten reviews , and 88 @.@ 69 % on GameRankings , based on thirteen reviews . The combination of puzzles and gameplay drew praise from critics , who indicated that the game builds upon the qualities found in Dark Forces . The user control of the game was praised , especially the control of the lightsaber . The game was compared positively with Doom , a significant game in the first @-@ person shooter genre . 
 The gameplay did not escape criticism , however , with Tom Chick of IGN criticising the layout of the levels : " The levels can be awfully linear , throwing you up against some frustrating brick walls where you don 't know where to go or what you 're supposed to do next . There are some bald key hunts . " The artificial intelligence of hostile NPCs received mixed reactions . GameSpot 's Ron Dulin praised the AI , saying that they help the suspension of disbelief . Chi Kong Lui of <unk> , however , gave the opposite view : " Enemy artificial intelligence is still pretty mindless and blasting them doesn 't require much skill . " 
 Jedi Knight 's graphics received mixed reviews . Critics stated the non @-@ 3D accelerated version of the game looks poor . Game Revolution 's Calvin Hubble argued that the game only really looks good if played on a system with a powerful 3D card . Other graphical aspects received praise . The character animations were considered more detailed than similar games . The graphical presentation of the levels received specific praise from IGN : " No other first person shooter has come close to Jedi Knight 's dizzying sense of scale and its vast levels . " The full @-@ motion video sequences between levels received both praise and criticism . 
 The use of John Williams ' soundtrack from the Star Wars films was met with praise , though one reviewer believed that the music is overused in Star Wars video games . The sound effects were also lauded , and seen as providing a good atmosphere for the game , in particular the lightsaber sound and its implementation . 
 The addition of a multiplayer mode to Jedi Knight was met positively , but questions arose to why there are so few multiplayer maps and why single @-@ player maps cannot be used in the multiplayer mode . Tom Chick of IGN believes this was corrected with the release of Mysteries of the Sith .

 Grand Teton National Park is a United States National Park in northwestern Wyoming . At approximately 310 @,@ 000 acres ( 480 sq mi ; 130 @,@ 000 ha ; 1 @,@ 300 km2 ) , the park includes the major peaks of the 40 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 64 km ) Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole . It is only 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Yellowstone National Park , to which it is connected by the National Park Service @-@ managed John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway . Along with surrounding National Forests , these three protected areas constitute the almost 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 7 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 ha ) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , one of the largest intact mid @-@ latitude temperate ecosystems in the world . 
 Human history of the Grand Teton region dates back at least 11 @,@ 000 years , when the first nomadic hunter @-@ gatherer Paleo @-@ Indians began migrating into the region during warmer months pursuing food and supplies . In the early 19th century , the first White explorers encountered the eastern Shoshone natives . Between 1810 and 1840 , the region attracted fur trading companies that vied for control of the lucrative beaver pelt trade . U.S. Government expeditions to the region commenced in the mid @-@ 19th century as an offshoot of exploration in Yellowstone , with the first permanent white settlers in Jackson Hole arriving in the 1880s . Efforts to preserve the region as a national park commenced in the late 19th century , and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established , protecting the major peaks of the Teton Range . The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s , when conservationists led by John D. Rockefeller , Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole to be added to the existing national park . Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures , much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943 . The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park . 
 Grand Teton National Park is named for Grand Teton , the tallest mountain in the Teton Range . The naming of the mountains is attributed to early 19th @-@ century French @-@ speaking trappers — les trois <unk> ( the three teats ) was later anglicized and shortened to Tetons . At 13 @,@ 775 feet ( 4 @,@ 199 m ) , Grand Teton abruptly rises more than 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) above Jackson Hole , almost 850 feet ( 260 m ) higher than Mount Owen , the second @-@ highest summit in the range . The park has numerous lakes , including 15 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 24 km ) Jackson Lake as well as streams of varying length and the upper main stem of the Snake River . Though in a state of recession , a dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range . Some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any U.S. National Park and have been dated at nearly 2 @.@ 7 billion years . 
 Grand Teton National Park is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there . More than 1 @,@ 000 species of vascular plants , dozens of species of mammals , 300 species of birds , more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist . Due to various changes in the ecosystem , some of them human @-@ induced , efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine . 
 Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering , hiking , fishing and other forms of recreation . There are more than 1 @,@ 000 drive @-@ in campsites and over 200 miles ( 320 km ) of hiking trails that provide access to backcountry camping areas . Noted for world @-@ renowned trout fishing , the park is one of the few places to catch Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout .

 Paleo @-@ Indian presence in what is now Grand Teton National Park dates back more than 11 @,@ 000 years . Jackson Hole valley climate at that time was colder and more alpine than the semi @-@ arid climate found today , and the first humans were migratory hunter @-@ gatherers spending summer months in Jackson Hole and wintering in the valleys west of the Teton Range . Along the shores of Jackson Lake , fire pits , tools and what are thought to have been fishing weights have been discovered . One of the tools found is of a type associated with the Clovis culture , and tools from this cultural period date back at least 11 @,@ 500 years . Some of the tools are made of obsidian which chemical analysis indicates came from sources near present @-@ day Teton Pass , south of Grand Teton National Park . Though obsidian was also available north of Jackson Hole , virtually all the obsidian spear points found are from a source to the south , indicating that the main seasonal migratory route for the Paleo @-@ Indian was from this direction . Elk , which winter on the National Elk Refuge at the southern end of Jackson Hole and northwest into higher altitudes during spring and summer , follow a similar migratory pattern to this day . From 11 @,@ 000 to about 500 years ago , there is little evidence of change in the migratory patterns amongst the Native American groups in the region and no evidence that indicates any permanent human settlement . 
 When white American explorers first entered the region in the first decade of the 19th century , they encountered the eastern tribes of the Shoshone people . Most of the Shoshone that lived in the mountain vastness of the greater Yellowstone region continued to be pedestrian while other groups of Shoshone that resided in lower elevations had limited use of horses . The mountain @-@ dwelling Shoshone were known as " Sheep @-@ eaters " or " <unk> " as they referred to themselves , since a staple of their diet was the Bighorn Sheep . The Shoshones continued to follow the same migratory pattern as their predecessors and have been documented as having a close spiritual relationship with the Teton Range . A number of stone enclosures on some of the peaks , including on the upper slopes of Grand Teton ( known simply as The Enclosure ) are thought to have been used by Shoshone during vision quests . The Teton and Yellowstone region Shoshone relocated to the Wind River Indian Reservation after it was established in 1868 . The reservation is situated 100 mi ( 160 km ) southeast of Jackson Hole on land that was selected by Chief Washakie .

 The Lewis and Clark Expedition ( 1804 – 1806 ) passed well north of the Grand Teton region . During their return trip from the Pacific Ocean , expedition member John Colter was given an early discharge so he could join two fur trappers who were heading west in search of beaver pelts . Colter was later hired by Manuel Lisa to lead fur trappers and to explore the region around the Yellowstone River . During the winter of 1807 / 08 Colter passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range . Lewis and Clark expedition co @-@ leader William Clark produced a map based on the previous expedition and included the explorations of John Colter in 1807 , apparently based on discussions between Clark and Colter when the two met in St. Louis , Missouri in 1810 . Another map attributed to William Clark indicates John Colter entered Jackson Hole from the northeast , crossing the Continental Divide at either Togwotee Pass or Union Pass and left the region after crossing Teton Pass , following the well established Native American trails . In 1931 , the Colter Stone , a rock carved in the shape of a head with the inscription " John Colter " on one side and the year " 1808 " on the other , was discovered in a field in <unk> , Idaho , which is west of Teton Pass . The Colter Stone has not been authenticated to have been created by John Colter and may have been the work of later expeditions to the region . 
 John Colter is widely considered the first mountain man and , like those that came to the Jackson Hole region over the next 30 years , he was there primarily for the profitable fur trapping ; the region was rich with the highly sought after pelts of beaver and other fur bearing animals . Between 1810 and 1812 , the <unk> traveled through Jackson Hole and crossed Teton Pass as they headed east in 1812 . After 1810 , American and British fur trading companies were in competition for control of the North American fur trade , and American sovereignty over the region was not secured until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846 . One party employed by the British North West Company and led by explorer Donald Mackenzie entered Jackson Hole from the west in 1818 or 1819 . The Tetons , as well as the valley west of the Teton Range known today as Pierre 's Hole , may have been named by French speaking Iroquois or French Canadian trappers that were part of Mackenzie 's party . Earlier parties had referred to the most prominent peaks of the Teton Range as the Pilot Knobs . The French trappers ' les trois <unk> ( the three breasts ) was later shortened to the Tetons . 
 Formed in the mid @-@ 1820s , the Rocky Mountain Fur Company partnership included Jedediah Smith , William Sublette and David Edward Jackson or " Davey Jackson " . Jackson oversaw the trapping operations in the Teton region between 1826 and 1830 . Sublette named the valley east of the Teton Range " Jackson 's Hole " ( later simply Jackson Hole ) for Davey Jackson . As the demand for beaver fur declined and the various regions of the American West became depleted of beaver due to over trapping , American fur trading companies folded ; however , individual mountain men continued to trap beaver in the region until about 1840 . From the mid @-@ 1840s until 1860 , Jackson Hole and the Teton Range were generally devoid of all but the small populations of Native American tribes that had already been there . Most overland human migration routes such as the Oregon and Mormon Trails crossed over South Pass , well to the south of the Teton Range , and Caucasian influence in the Teton region was minimal until the U.S. Government commenced organized explorations . 
 = = = Organized exploration and settlement = = = 
 The first U.S. Government sponsored expedition to enter Jackson Hole was the 1859 – 60 Raynolds Expedition . Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger , it included naturalist F. V. Hayden , who later led other expeditions to the region . The expedition had been charged with exploring the Yellowstone region , but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow . Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros Ventre River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass . Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well @-@ funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . In 1872 , Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone , while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region . Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range . The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region . The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth . Nevertheless , small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers . By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned . Though the Teton Range was never permanently inhabited , pioneers began settling the Jackson Hole valley to the east of the range in 1884 . These earliest homesteaders were mostly single men who endured long winters , short growing seasons and rocky soils that were hard to cultivate . The region was mostly suited for the cultivation of hay and cattle ranching . By 1890 , Jackson Hole had an estimated permanent population of 60 . Menor 's Ferry was built in 1892 near present @-@ day Moose , Wyoming to provide access for wagons to the west side of the Snake River . Ranching increased significantly from 1900 to 1920 , but a series of agricultural related economic downturns in the early 1920s left many ranchers destitute . Beginning in the 1920s , the automobile provided faster and easier access to areas of natural beauty and old military roads into Jackson Hole over Teton and Togwotee Passes were improved to accommodate the increased vehicle traffic . In response to the increased tourism , dude ranches were established , some new and some from existing cattle ranches , so urbanized travelers could experience the life of a cattleman . 
 = = = Establishment of the park = = = 
 To the north of Jackson Hole , Yellowstone National Park had been established in 1872 , and by the close of the 19th century , conservationists wanted to expand the boundaries of that park to include at least the Teton Range . By 1907 , in an effort to regulate water flow for irrigation purposes , the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a log crib dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake . This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911 . The dam was further enlarged in 1916 , raising lake waters 39 ft ( 12 m ) as part of the Minidoka Project , designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho . Further dam construction plans for other lakes in the Teton Range alarmed Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright , who sought to block such efforts . Jackson Hole residents were opposed to an expansion of Yellowstone , but were more in favor of the establishment of a separate National Park which would include the Teton Range and six lakes at the base of the mountains . After congressional approval , President Calvin Coolidge signed the executive order establishing the 96 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 39 @,@ 000 ha ) Grand Teton National Park on February 26 , 1929 . 
 The valley of Jackson Hole remained primarily in private ownership when John D. Rockefeller , Jr. and his wife visited the region in the late 1920s . Horace Albright and Rockefeller discussed ways to preserve Jackson Hole from commercial exploitation , and in consequence , Rockefeller started buying Jackson Hole properties through the Snake River Land Company for the purpose of later turning them over to the National Park Service . In 1930 , this plan was revealed to the residents of the region and was met with strong disapproval . Congressional efforts to prevent the expansion of Grand Teton National Park ended up putting the Snake River Land Company 's holdings in limbo . By 1942 Rockefeller had become increasingly impatient that his purchased property might never be added to the park , and wrote to the Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes that he was considering selling the land to another party . Secretary Ickes recommended to President Franklin Roosevelt that the Antiquities Act , which permitted Presidents to set aside land for protection without the approval of Congress , be used to establish a National Monument in Jackson Hole . Roosevelt created the 221 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 89 @,@ 000 ha ) Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943 , using the land donated from the Snake River Land Company and adding additional property from Teton National Forest . The monument and park were adjacent to each other and both were administered by the National Park Service , but the monument designation ensured no funding allotment , nor provided a level of resource protection equal to the park . Members of Congress repeatedly attempted to have the new National Monument abolished . 
 After the end of World War II national public sentiment was in favor of adding the monument to the park , and though there was still much local opposition , the monument and park were combined in 1950 . In recognition of John D. Rockefeller , Jr . ' s efforts to establish and then expand Grand Teton National Park , a 24 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 9 @,@ 700 ha ) parcel of land between Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks was added to the National Park Service in 1972 . This land and the road from the southern boundary of the park to West Thumb in Yellowstone National Park was named the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway . The Rockefeller family owned the JY Ranch , which bordered Grand Teton National Park to the southwest . In November 2007 , the Rockefeller family transferred ownership of the ranch to the park for the establishment of the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve , which was dedicated on June 21 , 2008 . 
 = = = History of mountaineering = = = 
 During the last 25 years of the 19th century , the mountains of the Teton Range became a focal point for explorers wanting to claim first ascents of the peaks . However , white explorers may not have been the first to climb many of the peaks and the earliest first ascent of even the formidable Grand Teton itself might have been achieved long before written history documented it . Native American relics remain including The Enclosure , an obviously man @-@ made structure that is located about 530 ft ( 160 m ) below the summit of Grand Teton at a point near the Upper Saddle ( 13 @,@ 160 ft ( 4 @,@ 010 m ) ) . Nathaniel P. Langford and James Stevenson , both members of the Hayden Geological Survey of 1872 , found The Enclosure during their early attempt to summit Grand Teton . Langford claimed that he and Stevenson climbed Grand Teton , but were vague as to whether they had made it to the summit . Their reported obstacles and sightings were never corroborated by later parties . Langford and Stevenson likely did not get much further than The Enclosure . The first ascent of Grand Teton that is substantiated was made by William O. Owen , Frank Petersen , John Shive and Franklin Spencer Spalding on August 11 , 1898 . Owen had made two previous attempts on the peak and after publishing several accounts of this first ascent , discredited any claim that Langford and Stevenson had ever reached beyond The Enclosure in 1872 . The disagreement over which party first reached the top of Grand Teton may be the greatest controversy in the history of American mountaineering . After 1898 no other ascents of Grand Teton were recorded until 1923 . 
 By the mid @-@ 1930s , more than a dozen different climbing routes had been established on Grand Teton including the northeast ridge in 1931 by Glenn Exum . Glenn Exum teamed up with another noted climber named Paul Petzoldt to found the Exum Mountain Guides in 1931 . Of the other major peaks on the Teton Range , all were climbed by the late 1930s including Mount Moran in 1922 and Mount Owen in 1930 by Fritiof Fryxell and others after numerous previous attempts had failed . Both Middle and South Teton were first climbed on the same day , August 29 , 1923 , by a group of climbers led by Albert R. Ellingwood . New routes on the peaks were explored as safety equipment and skills improved and eventually climbs rated at above 5 @.@ 9 on the Yosemite Decimal System difficulty scale were established on Grand Teton . The classic climb following the route first pioneered by Owen , known as the Owen @-@ Spalding route , is rated at 5 @.@ 4 due a combination of concerns beyond the gradient alone . Rock climbing and bouldering had become popular in the park by the mid 20th century . In the late 1950s , gymnast John Gill came to the park and started climbing large boulders near Jenny Lake . Gill approached climbing from a gymnastics perspective and while in the Tetons became the first known climber in history to use gymnastic chalk to improve handholds and to keep hands dry while climbing . During the latter decades of the 20th century , extremely difficult cliffs were explored including some in Death Canyon , and by the mid @-@ 1990s , 800 different climbing routes had been documented for the various peaks and canyon cliffs . 
 = = Park management = = 
 Grand Teton National Park is one of the ten most visited national parks in the U.S. , with an average of 2 @.@ 5 million visitors annually . The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway . Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees . The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging , restaurants , mountaineering guides , dude ranching , fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake . The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service , the Bureau of Reclamation , and also , in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport 's presence in the park , the Federal Aviation Administration . Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s . When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated , the airport was inside it . After the monument and park were combined , the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park . Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions , with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east , south or southwest flight corridors . As of 2010 , 110 privately owned property inholdings , many belonging to the state of Wyoming , are located within Grand Teton National Park . Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities , 10 million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016 . Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund , but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies . Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Grand Teton National Park is located in the northwestern region of the U.S. state of Wyoming . To the north the park is bordered by the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway , which is administered by Grand Teton National Park . The scenic highway with the same name passes from the southern boundary of Grand Teton National Park to West Thumb in Yellowstone National Park . Grand Teton National Park covers approximately 310 @,@ 000 acres ( 130 @,@ 000 ha ) , while the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway includes 23 @,@ 700 acres ( 9 @,@ 600 ha ) . Most of the Jackson Hole valley and virtually all the major mountain peaks of the Teton Range are within the park . The Jedediah Smith Wilderness of Caribou @-@ Targhee National Forest lies along the western boundary and includes the western slopes of the Teton Range . To the northeast and east lie the Teton Wilderness and Gros Ventre Wilderness of Bridger @-@ Teton National Forest . The National Elk Refuge is to the southeast , and migrating herds of elk winter there . Privately owned land borders the park to the south and southwest . Grand Teton National Park , along with Yellowstone National Park , surrounding National Forests and related protected areas constitute the 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 7 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 ha ) ( 28 @,@ 000 sq mi ( 73 @,@ 000 km2 ) ) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem . The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem spans across portions of three states and is one of the largest intact mid @-@ latitude ecosystems remaining on Earth . By road , Grand Teton National Park is 290 mi ( 470 km ) from Salt Lake City , Utah and 550 mi ( 890 km ) from Denver , Colorado . 
 = = = Teton Range = = = 
 The youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains , the Teton Range began forming between 6 and 9 million years ago . It runs roughly north to south and rises from the floor of Jackson Hole without any foothills along a 40 mi ( 64 km ) long by 7 to 9 mi ( 11 to 14 km ) wide active fault @-@ block mountain front . The range tilts westward , rising abruptly above Jackson Hole valley which lies to the east but more gradually into Teton Valley to the west . A series of earthquakes along the Teton Fault slowly displaced the western side of the fault upward and the eastern side of the fault downward at an average of 1 foot ( 30 cm ) of displacement every 300 – 400 years . Most of the displacement of the fault occurred in the last 2 million years . While the fault has experienced up to 7 @.@ 5 – earthquake magnitude events since it formed , it has been relatively quiescent during historical periods , with only a few 5 @.@ 0 – magnitude or greater earthquakes known to have occurred since 1850 . 
 In addition to 13 @,@ 775 ft ( 4 @,@ 199 m ) high Grand Teton , another nine peaks are over 12 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) above sea level . Eight of these peaks between Avalanche and Cascade Canyons make up the often @-@ photographed Cathedral Group . The most prominent peak north of Cascade Canyon is the monolithic Mount Moran ( 12 @,@ 605 ft ( 3 @,@ 842 m ) ) which rises 5 @,@ 728 ft ( 1 @,@ 746 m ) above Jackson Lake . To the north of Mount Moran , the range eventually merges into the high altitude Yellowstone Plateau . South of the central Cathedral Group the Teton Range tapers off near Teton Pass and blends into the Snake River Range . 
 West to east trending canyons provide easier access by foot into the heart of the range as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass , which is south of the park . Carved by a combination of glacier activity as well as by numerous streams , the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin of the range at Jackson Hole . Flowing from higher to lower elevations , the glaciers created more than a dozen U @-@ shaped valleys throughout the range . Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake . North to south , Webb , Moran , Paintbrush , Cascade , Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range . 
 = = = Jackson Hole = = = 
 Jackson Hole is a 55 mi ( 89 km ) long by 6 to 13 mi ( 10 to 21 km ) wide graben valley with an average elevation of 6 @,@ 800 ft ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , its lowest point is near the southern park boundary at 6 @,@ 350 ft ( 1 @,@ 940 m ) . The valley sits east of the Teton Range and is vertically displaced downward 30 @,@ 000 ft ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) , making the Teton Fault and its parallel twin on the east side of the valley normal faults with the Jackson Hole block being the hanging wall and the Teton Mountain block being the <unk> . Grand Teton National Park contains the major part of both blocks . Erosion of the range provided sediment in the valley so the topographic relief is only 7 @,@ 700 ft ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) . Jackson Hole is comparatively flat , with only a modest increase in altitude south to north , however a few isolated buttes such as Blacktail Butte and hills including Signal Mountain dot the valley floor . In addition to a few outcroppings , the Snake River has eroded terraces into Jackson Hole . Southeast of Jackson Lake , glacial depressions known as kettles are numerous . The kettles were formed when ice situated under gravel outwash from ice sheets melted as the glaciers retreated . 
 = = = Lakes and rivers = = = 
 Most of the lakes in the park were formed by glaciers and the largest of these lakes are located at the base of the Teton Range . In the northern section of the park lies Jackson Lake , the largest lake in the park at 15 mi ( 24 km ) in length , 5 mi ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) wide and 438 ft ( 134 m ) deep . Though Jackson Lake is natural , the Jackson Lake Dam was constructed at its outlet before the creation of the park and the lake level was raised almost 40 ft ( 12 m ) consequently . East of the Jackson Lake Lodge lies Emma Matilda and Two Ocean Lakes . South of Jackson Lake , Leigh , Jenny , Bradley , Taggart and Phelps Lakes rest at the outlets of the canyons which lead into the Teton Range . Within the Teton Range , small alpine lakes in cirques are common , and there are more than 100 scattered throughout the high country . Lake Solitude , located at an elevation of 9 @,@ 035 ft ( 2 @,@ 754 m ) , is in a cirque at the head of the North Fork of Cascade Canyon . Other high altitude lakes can be found at over 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) in elevation and a few , such as <unk> Lake , remain ice clogged for much of the year . The park is not noted for large waterfalls ; however , 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) high Hidden Falls just west of Jenny Lake is easy to reach after a short hike . 
 From its headwaters on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park , the Snake River flows north to south through the park , entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway . The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole , exiting the park just west of the Jackson Hole Airport . The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River . Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros Ventre River at the southern border of the park . Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley , the Snake River descends an average of 19 feet per mile ( 3 @.@ 6 m / km ) , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope . The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections , erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers . 
 = = = Glaciation = = = 
 The major peaks of the Teton Range were carved into their current shapes by long vanished glaciers . Commencing 250 @,@ 000 – 150 @,@ 000 years ago , the Tetons went through several periods of glaciation with some areas of Jackson Hole covered by glaciers 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) thick . This heavy glaciation is unrelated to the uplift of the range itself and is instead part of a period of global cooling known as the Quaternary glaciation . Beginning with the Buffalo Glaciation and followed by the Bull Lake and then the Pinedale glaciation , which ended roughly 15 @,@ 000 years ago , the landscape was greatly impacted by glacial activity . During the Pinedale glaciation , the landscape visible today was created as glaciers from the Yellowstone Plateau flowed south and formed Jackson Lake , while smaller glaciers descending from the Teton Range pushed rock moraines out from the canyons and left behind lakes near the base of the mountains . The peaks themselves were carved into horns and arêtes and the canyons were transformed from water @-@ eroded V @-@ shapes to glacier @-@ carved U @-@ shaped valleys . Approximately a dozen glaciers currently exist in the park , but they are not ancient as they were all reestablished sometime between 1400 and 1850 AD during the Little Ice Age . Of these more recent glaciers , the largest is Teton Glacier , which sits below the northeast face of Grand Teton . Teton Glacier is 3 @,@ 500 ft ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) long and 1 @,@ 100 ft ( 340 m ) wide , and nearly surrounded by the tallest summits in the range . Teton Glacier is also the best studied glacier in the range , and researchers concluded in 2005 that the glacier could disappear in 30 to 75 years . West of the Cathedral Group near Hurricane Pass , <unk> Glacier is tiny but has well defined terminal and lateral moraines , a small proglacial lake and other typical glacier features in close proximity to each other . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Grand Teton National Park has some of the most ancient rocks found in any U.S. National Park . The oldest rocks dated so far are 2 @,@ 680 ± 12 million years old , though even older rocks are believed to exist in the park . Formed during the Archean Eon ( 4 to 2 @.@ 5 billion years ago ) , these metamorphic rocks include gneiss , schist and <unk> . Metamorphic rocks are the most common types found in the northern and southern sections of the Teton Range . 2 @,@ 545 million years ago , the metamorphic rocks were intruded by igneous granitic rocks , which are now visible in the central Tetons including Grand Teton and the nearby peaks . The light colored granites of the central Teton Range contrast with the darker metamorphic gneiss found on the flanks of Mount Moran to the north . Magma intrusions of diabase rocks 765 million years ago left dikes that can be seen on the east face of Mount Moran and Middle Teton . Granite and pegmatite intrusions also worked their way into fissures in the older gneiss . Precambrian rocks in Jackson Hole are buried deep under comparatively recent Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary deposits , as well as Pleistocene glacial deposits . 
 By the close of the Precambrian , the region was intermittently submerged under shallow seas , and for 500 million years various types of sedimentary rocks were formed . During the Paleozoic ( 542 to 251 million years ago ) sandstone , shale , limestone and dolomite were deposited . Though most of these sedimentary rocks have since eroded away from the central Teton Range , they are still evident on the northern , southern and western flanks of the range . One notable exception is the sandstone Flathead Formation which continues to cap Mount Moran . Sedimentary layering of rocks in Alaska Basin , which is on the western border of Grand Teton National Park , chronicles a 120 million year period of sedimentary deposition . Fossils found in the sedimentary rocks in the park include algae , brachiopods and trilobites . Sedimentary deposition continued during the Mesozoic ( 250 – 66 million years ago ) and the coal seams found in the sedimentary rock strata indicate the region was densely forested during that era . Numerous coal seams of 5 to 10 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 0 m ) in thickness are interspersed with siltstone , claystone and other sedimentary rocks . During the late Cretaceous , a volcanic arc west of the region deposited fine grained ash that later formed into bentonite , an important mineral resource . 
 From the end of the Mesozoic to present , the region went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences . Commencing 66 million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain @-@ building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains . This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most complete non @-@ marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America . Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range . These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury . During the Eocene and Oligocene , volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits . Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting , creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene ( 10 million years ago ) , an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake . During the Quaternary , landslides , erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes . The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park , when the Gros Ventre landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain .

 = = = Flora = = = 
 Grand Teton National Park and the surrounding region host over 1000 species of vascular plants . With an altitude variance of over 7 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , the park has a number of different ecological zones including alpine tundra , the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce @-@ fir forests are dominant , and the valley floor , where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits . Additionally , wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses , especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge . Altitude , available soils , wildfire incidence , avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area . Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone . 
 The range of altitude in Grand Teton National Park impacts the types of plant species found at various elevations . In the alpine zone above the tree line , which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , tundra conditions prevail . In this treeless region , hundreds of species of grass , wildflower , moss and lichen are found . In the subalpine region from the tree line to the base of the mountains , whitebark pine , limber pine , subalpine fir , and Engelmann spruce are dominant . In the valley floor , lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas @-@ fir , and blue spruce inhabit drier areas , while aspen , cottonwood , alder , and willow are more commonly found around lakes , streams and wetlands . However , the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park . The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers . Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being <unk> Island . In this ecotone , forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging . 
 While the flora of Grand Teton National Park is generally healthy , the whitebark pine , and to a lesser degree the lodgepole pine , are considered at risk . In the case of the whitebark pine , an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree , making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles . Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above 8 @,@ 000 ft ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the grizzly bear , red squirrel and Clark 's nutcracker . The species is considered to be a keystone and a foundation species ; keystone in that its " ecological role ( is ) disproportionately large relative to its abundance " and foundation in that it has a paramount role that " defines ecosystem structure , function , and process " . Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range . The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton . Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality , its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees , increasing mortality . While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to take its course , the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 Sixty @-@ one species of mammals have been recorded in Grand Teton National Park . This includes the gray wolf , which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there . The re @-@ establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park . In addition to gray wolves , another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear . Relatively common sightings of coyote , river otter , marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar , Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually . A number of rodent species exist including yellow @-@ bellied marmot , least chipmunk , muskrat , beaver , Uinta ground squirrel , pika , snowshoe hare , porcupine , and six species of bats . 
 Of the larger mammals the most common are elk , which exist in the thousands . Their migration route between the National Elk Refuge and Yellowstone National Park is through Grand Teton National Park , so while easily seen anytime of the year , they are most numerous in the spring and fall . Other ungulates include bison and pronghorn — the fastest land mammal in the western hemisphere — which are found throughout Jackson Hole as are moose , which tend to stay near waterways and wetlands . Between 100 – 125 bighorn sheep dwell in the alpine and rocky zones of the peaks . 
 Over 300 species of birds have been sighted in the park including the calliope hummingbird , the smallest bird species in North America , as well as trumpeter swans , which is North America 's largest waterfowl . In addition to trumpeter swans , another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue @-@ winged teal , common merganser , American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon . Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey , red @-@ tailed hawk , American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported . Of the 14 species of owls reported , the most common is the great horned owl , though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally . A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported , as have a similar number of species of warblers , plovers and gulls . The vocal and gregarious black @-@ billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller 's jay and Clark 's nutcracker are found in the backcountry . The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse , Brewer 's sparrow and sage thrashers , while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron , American white pelican , sandhill crane and on rare occasions it 's endangered relative , the whooping crane . 
 The Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout ( or Snake River cutthroat trout ) is the only native trout species in Grand Teton National Park . It is also the only subspecies of cutthroat trout that is exclusively native to large streams and rivers . Various researchers have not been able to identify any genetic differences between the Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout and the Yellowstone cutthroat trout , though in terms of appearances , the Snake River subspecies has much smaller spots which cover a greater portion of the body , and the two subspecies inhabit different ecological niches . The Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout was identified by some researchers as a separate subspecies by the mid @-@ 1990s , and is managed as a distinct subspecies by the state of Wyoming , but is not yet recognized as such by the neighboring states of Idaho and Montana . Snake River fine @-@ spotted cutthroat trout is found only in the Snake River and tributaries below the Jackson Lake dam to the Palisades Reservoir in Idaho . Other non @-@ native species of trout such as the rainbow trout and lake trout were introduced by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department or migrated out of Yellowstone . Today five trout species inhabit park waters . Native species of fish include the mountain whitefish , longnose dace , mountain sucker and non @-@ native species include the Utah chub and Arctic grayling . 
 Only four species of reptiles are documented in the park : three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake , the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa , as well as one lizard species , the northern sagebrush lizard , that was first reported in 1992 . None of the species are venomous . Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog , boreal chorus frog , tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog . A sixth amphibian species , the bullfrog , was introduced . An estimated 10 @,@ 000 insect species frequent the park ; they pollinate plants , provide a food source for birds , fish , mammals and other animals , and help in the decomposition of wood . In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem , swarms of Army <unk> moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators . One study concluded that when this moth species is most available , bears consume 40 @,@ 000 moths per day which is roughly 20 @,@ 000 kcal / day . 
 Grand Teton National Park is the only U.S. National Park that permits hunting , but only of elk in an effort to keep the populations of that species regulated . This provision was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950 . While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances , hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed . In Grand Teton National Park , hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers . Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran , Wyoming , the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89 . Proponents of continuing the elk hunt , which occurs in the fall , argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it , leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds . Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park , rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt . 
 = = = Fire ecology = = = 
 The role of wildfire is an important one for plant and animal species diversity . Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire . Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire . Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park , studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities . One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types . The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine . Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds , lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species . In accordance with a better understanding of the role wildfire plays in the environment , the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem .

 Grand Teton National Park has a semi @-@ arid climate with the wettest months between November and January , mostly in the form of snow . The park averages 450 inches ( 1 @,@ 100 cm ) of snow in the mountains and 191 inches ( 490 cm ) in the valley annually . In January , the daily temperature range averages between 26 ° F ( − 3 ° C ) during the day to 1 ° F ( − 17 ° C ) at night . During the month of July , the daily temperature range is 80 and 41 ° F ( 27 and 5 ° C ) . The record high is 93 ° F ( 34 ° C ) and the record low is − 66 ° F ( − 54 ° C ) . Temperatures above the valley in the mountains during the summer average 1 ° F ( 0 @.@ 56 ° C ) cooler for every 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) of altitude gained , so high altitude passes may remain snow @-@ covered until mid @-@ July . Thunderstorms are common during the summer , especially over the mountains ; by contrast , no tornados have ever been reported within the park .

 Grand Teton National Park is more than 100 mi ( 160 km ) air distance from any major urban or industrial area , and localized human activities have generally had a very low environmental impact on the surrounding region . However , levels of ammonium and nitrogen have been trending slightly upwards due to deposition from rain and snow that is believed to originate from regional agricultural activities . Additionally , there has also been a slight increase in mercury and pesticides that have been detected in snow and some alpine lakes . Ozone and haze may be impacting overall visibility levels . Grand Teton National Park , in partnership with other agencies , erected the first air quality monitoring station in the park in 2011 . The station is designed to check for various pollutants as well as ozone levels and weather . 
 A 2005 study of the water of Jackson , Jenny and Taggart Lakes indicated that all three of these lakes had virtually pristine water quality . Of the three lakes , only on Taggart Lake are motorized boats prohibited , yet little difference in water quality was detected in the three lakes . In a study published in 2002 , the Snake River was found to have better overall water quality than other river systems in Wyoming , and low levels of pollution from anthropogenic sources .

 Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountain and rock climbers partly because the mountains are easily accessible by road . Trails are well marked and routes to the summits of most peaks are long established , and for the experienced and fit , most peaks can be climbed in one day . The highest maintained trails climb from the floor of Jackson Hole over 4 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) to mountain passes that are sometimes called saddles or divides . From these passes , the climbs follow routes that require varying skill levels . Climbers do not need a permit but are encouraged to voluntarily register their climbing plans with the National Park Service and inform associates of their itinerary . Any climb requiring an overnight stay in the backcountry does require a permit . Climbers are essentially on their own to determine their own skill levels and are encouraged to not take unnecessary risks . The Exum Mountain Guides , which is considered one of the finest mountaineering guide services in the U.S. , as well as the Jackson Hole Mountain Guides , offer instruction and climbing escorts for those who are less experienced or unfamiliar with various routes . 
 An average of 4 @,@ 000 climbers per year make an attempt to summit Grand Teton and most ascend up Garnet Canyon to a mountain pass called the Lower Saddle , which is between Grand Teton and Middle Teton . From the Lower Saddle , climbers often follow the Owen @-@ Spalding or Exum Ridge routes to the top of Grand Teton though there are 38 distinct routes to the summit . The north face route to the summit of Grand Teton is a world renowned climb involving a dozen distinct pitches and is rated at grade 5 @.@ 8 in difficulty for the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) vertical ascent . On a connecting ridge and just north of Grand Teton lies Mount Owen , and though lower in altitude , this peak is considered more difficult to ascend . Middle Teton is another popular climb that is most easily summited from a saddle between it and South Teton . Well north of Grand Teton lies Mount Moran , which is further from trailheads and more difficult to access and ascend . The Direct South Buttress of Mount Moran provides a vertical mile of climbing that was considered the most difficult climb in the U.S. when first accomplished in 1953 . Other popular climbing destinations include Buck Mountain , Symmetry Spire , Mount Saint John , Mount Wister , Teewinot Mountain and Nez Perce Peak and each mountain has at least six established routes to their summits . 
 = = = Camping and hiking = = = 
 Grand Teton National Park has five front @-@ country vehicular access campgrounds . The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds , and each has 350 campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles . Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86 campsites respectively , while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only . Additionally , full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112 campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway . Though all front @-@ country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall , primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center . 
 All campsites accessible only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites and they are available by permit only , but camping is allowed in most of these backcountry zones year @-@ round . The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding . Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear @-@ resistant container . As of 2012 , only four brands of bear @-@ resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand Teton National Park backcountry . Additionally , hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears . 
 The park has 200 mi ( 320 km ) of hiking trails , ranging in difficulty from easy to strenuous . The easiest hiking trails are located in the valley , where the altitude changes are generally minimal . In the vicinity of Colter Bay Village , the Hermitage Point Trail is 9 @.@ 4 mi ( 15 @.@ 1 km ) long and considered easy . Several other trails link Hermitage Point with Emma Matilda Lake and Two Ocean Lake Trails , also considered to be relatively easy hikes in the Jackson Lake Lodge area . Other easy hikes include the Valley Trail which runs from Trapper Lake in the north to the south park boundary near Teton Village and the Jenny Lake Trail which circles the lake . Ranging from moderate to strenuous in difficulty , trails leading into the canyons are rated based on distance and more importantly on the amount of elevation change . The greatest elevation change is found on the Paintbrush Canyon , Alaska Basin and Garnet Canyon Trails , where elevation increases of over 4 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) are typical . Horses and pack animals are permitted on almost all trails in the park , however there are only five designated backcountry camping locations for pack animals and these campsites are far from the high mountain passes . Bicycles are limited to vehicle roadways only and the park has widened some roads to provide a safer biking experience . A paved multi @-@ use pathway opened in 2009 and provides non @-@ motorized biking access from the town of Jackson to South Jenny Lake . 
 = = = Boating and fishing = = = 
 Grand Teton National Park allows boating on all the lakes in Jackson Hole , but motorized boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes . While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake ( though there is a noise restriction ) , Jenny Lake is restricted to 10 horsepower . Only non – motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw , Bradley , Emma Matilda , Leigh , Phelps , String , Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes . There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake . Additionally , sailboats , <unk> and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted on any of the park waterways . All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger . Only non – motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River . All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating , and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River . 
 In 2010 , Grand Teton National Park started requiring all boats to display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal issued by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a Yellowstone National Park boat permit . In an effort to keep the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the Zebra mussel and whirling disease , boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self @-@ certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer . 
 Grand Teton National Park fisheries are managed by the Wyoming Fish and Game Department and a Wyoming state fishing license is required to fish all waterways in Grand Teton National Park . The creel limit for trout is restricted to six per day , including no more than three cutthroat trout with none longer than 12 in ( 30 cm ) , while the maximum length of other trout species may not exceed 20 in ( 51 cm ) , except those taken from Jackson Lake , where the maximum allowable length is 24 in ( 61 cm ) . There are also restrictions as to the seasonal accessibility to certain areas as well as the types of bait and fishing tackle permitted . 
 = = = Winter activities = = = 
 Visitors are allowed to snowshoe and do cross @-@ country skiing and are not restricted to trails . The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and this section of the road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic . The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose , Wyoming . Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers . 
 The only location in Grand Teton National Park where snowmobiles are permitted is on Jackson Lake . The National Park Service requires that all snowmobiles use " Best Available Technology " ( BAT ) and lists various models of snowmobiles that are permitted , all of which are deemed to provide the least amount of air pollution and maximize noise abatement . All snowmobiles must be less than 10 years old and have odometer readings of less than 6 @,@ 000 mi ( 9 @,@ 700 km ) . Additionally , snowmobile use is for the purposes of accessing ice fishing locations only . Snowmobile access was permitted between Moran Junction and Flagg Ranch adjacent to the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway so that travelers using the Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail could traverse between Bridger @-@ Teton National Forest and Yellowstone National Park . However , in 2009 , winter use planners closed this since unguided snowmobile access into Yellowstone National Park was also discontinued .

 The Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center adjacent to the park headquarters at Moose , Wyoming , is open year round . Opened in 2007 to replace an old , inadequate visitor center , the facility is named for the late U.S. Senator Craig Thomas and designed by acclaimed architect , Bohlin Cywinski Jackson . It was financed with a combination of federal grants and private donations . An adjoining 154 @-@ seat auditorium was opened to the public in April 2011 . To the north at Colter Bay Village on Jackson Lake , the Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum is open from the beginning of May to the early October . The Colter Bay Visitor Center & Indian Arts Museum has housed the David T. Vernon Indian Arts Exhibit since 1972 . The Colter Bay Visitor Center was built in 1956 and was determined in 2005 to be substandard for the proper care and display of the Indian arts collection . During the winter of 2011 – 2012 , a $ 150 @,@ 000 renovation project was completed at the center and a portion of the arts collection was made available for viewing when the center opened for the season in May 2012 . 
 South of Moose on the Moose – Wilson Road , the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Center is located on land that was privately owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and is situated on Phelps Lake . Donated to Grand Teton National Park and opened to the public in 2008 , the property was once part of the JY Ranch , the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole . At Jenny Lake , the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid – May to mid – September . This visitor center is within the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and is the same structure photographer Harrison Crandall had constructed as an art studio in the 1920s . 
 = = = Accommodations = = = 
 Contracted through the National Park Service , various concessionaire entities manage lodging facilities inside the park .

 = Hero of Belarus = 
 Hero of Belarus ( Belarusian : Герой <unk> ; <unk> : <unk> <unk> ; Russian : Герой Беларуси , transliterated <unk> <unk> ) is the highest title that can be bestowed on a citizen of Belarus . The title is awarded to those " who perform great deeds in the name of freedom , independence and prosperity of the Republic of Belarus " . The deed can be for military performance , economic performance or great service to the State and society . The design of the medal is similar to that of its predecessor , Hero of the Soviet Union . Similar titles to the Hero of Belarus include the Russian Hero of the Russian Federation , Ukrainian Hero of Ukraine , and Uzbek Hero of Uzbekistan . Since its creation , the title has been awarded to ten people . 
 = = Legislation = = 
 The title and other Belarusian state awards , their creation , nomination and awarding , are regulated by a set of legal documents : Belarusian Constitution , Law N 288 @-@ З " About state awards of the Republic of Belarus " and presidential decrees . 
 The title was created by the Belarus Supreme Soviet on April 13 , 1995 , with the passage of Resolution N <unk> @-@ XII , titled " System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus " . Alongside the Hero of Belarus title , the resolution authorized the creation of medals , orders , and titles that can be presented by the Belarusian government . The creation of the awards was a way to honor those who have made valuable contributions to Belarus , irrespective of whether they were performed by a citizen or a foreigner . 
 This resolution was outlawed and replaced by Law N 288 @-@ З on May 18 , 2004 . 
 = = Recommendation process and awarding = = 
 To be considered for title , a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large . The title can be awarded to those serving in the military , public service or private enterprise . It can only be awarded once to an individual , and can be awarded posthumously . The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2 , Article 5 of Law N 288 @-@ З . Chapter 3 , Article 60 of Law N 288 @-@ З allows any group ( association ) of workers to submit a recommendation ( petition ) for an individual to be awarded the title . Governmental bodies , the National Assembly , the Council of Ministers , cabinet officials and public unions , among others , are also eligible to submit nominations for the title . The candidate is evaluated , and if deemed worthy , the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then , after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the Belarusian Security Council , to the President of the Republic . 
 Under the Belarus Constitution ( Part 4 , Chapter 3 , Article 84 ) , the President of the Republic has the power to bestow state awards . To announce an award , the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person . Within two months , the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting , usually at the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Minsk . A certificate ( <unk> ) will also be presented to the recipient , signed by the President of the Republic . 
 = = Privileges = = 
 Initially , social privileges for those , who achieved Hero of Belarus , according to the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under April 13 , 1995 N <unk> @-@ XII , were equal to the privileges for people , whom Hero of Soviet Union , Hero of Socialist Labour , Order of Glory or Order of Labor Glory was given . These privileges are regulated by Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under February 21 , 1995 N <unk> @-@ XII . 
 Now this question is regulated by Law of the Republic of Belarus under June 14 , 2007 N 239 @-@ З " About social privileges , rights and guarantees to a definite category of citizens " . 
 According to it , Heroes of Belarus have rights : 
 of free supplying with medicines in the list of main medicines , which are given under recipes in hospitals ; 
 of free production and repairing of dentures in governmental organizations domiciliary and of free supplying with other technical means of rehabilitation in accordance with the Governmental register of technical means of social rehabilitation ;

 The recipient of the title is given a medal called the Medal of the Hero of Belarus ( Belarusian : медаль <unk> <unk> , Russian : медаль <unk> Беларуси ) . The star and suspension are made of gold , and thus it is nicknamed " Gold Star " , as was its predecessor , the Hero of the Soviet Union . The star has a total diameter of 33 millimeters , and is attached to a rectangular suspension device ( boot tree ) . In the center of the rectangle is a ribbon of two sections of red and one section of green . The red and green bars on the ribbon evoke the design and colors of the national flag . The amount of gold is set at 585 @-@ 1 Test , with the total weight of the medal being 19 grams . The present design was enacted into law by Presidential Decree Number 516 on September 6 , 1999 . 
 The design of the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union . Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union , Hero of Socialist Labor and the Hero of the Russian Federation titles , there is no engraving on the reverse of the star . The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal 's ribbon , since a flag design was also used to make the ribbon of that medal . The medal is always worn in full on the left side of the breast above all other medals and orders . Chapter 4 , Article 69 of Law N 288 @-@ З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus . The same one can reed in the Presidential decree N 168 on April 8 , 2005 . 
 = = = 1996 medal = = = 
 When the title was created , a suggested medal was drafted and designed by the government . The major difference between this medal and the current medal is the design of the suspension and the star medallion at the bottom : the top suspension is longer than the bottom , and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies . The suspension was made from gold @-@ plated silver , while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold , as the medal . The design of the star evokes the Marshal 's Star , which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks . This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15 , 1996 .

 = Siege of Constantinople ( 674 – 678 ) = 
 The First Arab Siege of Constantinople in 674 – 678 was a major conflict of the Arab – Byzantine Wars , and the first culmination of the Umayyad Caliphate 's expansionist strategy towards the Byzantine Empire , led by Caliph Mu 'awiya I. Mu 'awiya , who had emerged in 661 as the ruler of the Muslim Arab empire following a civil war , renewed aggressive warfare against Byzantium after a lapse of some years and hoped to deliver a lethal blow by capturing the Byzantine capital , Constantinople . 
 As reported by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor , the Arab attack was methodical : in 672 – 673 Arab fleets secured bases along the coasts of Asia Minor , and then proceeded to install a loose blockade around Constantinople . They used the peninsula of Cyzicus near the city as a base to spend the winter , and returned every spring to launch attacks against the city 's fortifications . Finally , the Byzantines , under Emperor Constantine IV , managed to destroy the Arab navy using a new invention , the liquid incendiary substance known as Greek fire . The Arab land army in Asia Minor was also defeated by the Byzantines , forcing the Arabs to lift the siege . The Byzantine victory was of major importance for the survival of the Byzantine state , as the Arab threat receded for a time . A peace treaty was signed soon after , and following the outbreak of another Muslim civil war , the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate . 
 The siege left several traces in the legends of the nascent Muslim world , although it is conflated with accounts of another expedition against the city a few years previously , led by the future Caliph Yazid I. As a result , the veracity of Theophanes 's account has been questioned by recent scholarship , which places more emphasis on the Arabic and Syriac sources . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following the disastrous Battle of Yarmouk in 636 , the Byzantine Empire withdrew the bulk of its remaining forces from the Levant into Asia Minor , which was shielded by the Taurus Mountains from the Muslim expansion . This left the field open for the warriors of the nascent Rashidun Caliphate to complete their conquest of Syria , with Egypt too falling shortly after . Muslim raids against the Cilician frontier zone and deep into Asia Minor began as early as 640 , and continued under the leadership of the Rashidun governor of Syria , Mu 'awiya . The energetic Mu 'awiya also spearheaded the development of a Muslim navy , which within a few years grew sufficiently strong to occupy Cyprus and raid as far as Kos , Rhodes and Crete in the Aegean Sea . Finally , the young Muslim navy scored a crushing victory over its Byzantine counterpart in the Battle of Phoenix in 655 . Following the murder of Caliph Uthman and the outbreak of the First Muslim Civil War , however , Arab attacks against Byzantium stopped . In 659 , Mu 'awiya even concluded a truce with Byzantium , including payment of tribute to the Empire . 
 The peace lasted until the end of the Muslim civil war in 661 , from which Mu 'awiya and his clan emerged victorious , establishing the Umayyad Caliphate . From the next year , Muslim attacks recommenced , with pressure mounting as Muslim armies began wintering on Byzantine soil west of the Taurus range , maximizing the disruption caused to the Byzantine economy . These land expeditions were sometimes coupled with naval raids against the coasts of southern Asia Minor . In 668 , the Arabs sent aid to <unk> , strategos of the Armeniac Theme , who had rebelled and proclaimed himself emperor . The Arab troops under Fadhala ibn ' Ubayd arrived too late to assist <unk> , who had died after falling from his horse , and they spent the winter in the <unk> around Melitene awaiting reinforcements . 
 In spring 669 , after receiving additional troops , Fadhala entered Asia Minor and advanced as far as Chalcedon , on the Asian shore of the Bosporus across from the Byzantine capital , Constantinople . The Arab attacks on Chalcedon were repelled , and the Arab army was decimated by famine and disease . Mu 'awiya dispatched another army , led by his son ( and future Caliph ) Yazid , to Fadhala 's aid . Accounts of what followed differ . The Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor reports that the Arabs remained before Chalcedon for a while before returning to Syria , and that on their way they captured and garrisoned Amorium . This was the first time the Arabs tried to hold a captured fortress in the interior of Asia Minor beyond the campaigning season , and probably meant that the Arabs intended to return next year and use the town as their base , but Amorium was retaken by the Byzantines during the subsequent winter . The Arab sources on the other hand report that the Muslims crossed over into Europe and launched an unsuccessful attack on Constantinople itself , before returning to Syria . Given the lack of any mention of such an assault in Byzantine sources , it is most probable that the Arab chroniclers — taking account of Yazid 's presence and the fact that Chalcedon is a suburb of Constantinople — " upgraded " the attack on Chalcedon to an attack on the Byzantine capital itself . 
 = = Opening moves : the campaigns of 672 and 673 = = 
 The campaign of 669 clearly demonstrated to the Arabs the possibility of a direct strike at Constantinople , as well as the necessity of having a supply base in the region . This was found in the peninsula of Cyzicus on the southern shore of the Sea of Marmara , where a raiding fleet under Fadhala ibn ' Ubayd wintered in 670 or 671 . Mu 'awiya now began preparing his final assault on the Byzantine capital . In contrast to Yazid 's expedition , Mu 'awiya intended to take a coastal route to Constantinople . The undertaking was not haphazard , but followed a careful , phased approach : first the Muslims had to secure strongpoints and bases along the coast , and then , with Cyzicus as a base , Constantinople would be blockaded by land and sea and cut off from its agrarian hinterland , on which it depended for its food supply . 
 Accordingly , in 672 three great Muslim fleets were dispatched to secure the sea lanes and establish bases between Syria and the Aegean . Muhammad ibn Abdallah 's fleet wintered at Smyrna , a fleet under a certain Qays ( perhaps Abdallah ibn Qays ) wintered in Lycia and Cilicia , and a third fleet , under Khalid , joined them later . According to the report of Theophanes , the Emperor Constantine IV ( r . 661 – 685 ) , upon learning of the Arab fleets ' approach , began equipping his own fleet for war . Constantine 's armament included siphon @-@ bearing ships intended for the deployment of a newly developed incendiary substance , Greek fire . In 673 , another Arab fleet , under <unk> ibn Abu Umayya , captured Tarsus in Cilicia , as well as Rhodes . The latter , located midway between Syria and Constantinople , was converted into a forward supply base and centre for Muslim naval raids . Its garrison of 12 @,@ 000 men was regularly rotated back to Syria , a small fleet was attached to it for defence and raiding , and the Arabs even sowed wheat and brought along animals to graze on the island . The Byzantines attempted to obstruct the Arab plans with a naval attack on Egypt , but it was unsuccessful . Throughout this period , overland raids into Asia Minor continued , and the Arab troops wintered on Byzantine soil . 
 = = Arab attacks and related expeditions in 674 – 678 = = 
 In 674 , the Arab fleet sailed from its bases in the eastern Aegean and entered the Sea of Marmara . According to the account of Theophanes , they landed on the Thracian shore near Hebdomon in April , and until September were engaged in constant clashes with the Byzantine troops . As the Byzantine chronicler reports , " Every day there was a military engagement from morning until evening , between the outworks of the Golden Gate and the <unk> , with thrust and counter @-@ thrust " . Then the Arabs departed and made for Cyzicus , which they captured and converted into a fortified camp to spend the winter in . This set the pattern that continued throughout the siege : each spring , the Arabs crossed the Marmara and assaulted Constantinople , withdrawing to Cyzicus for the winter . In fact , the " siege " of Constantinople was a series of engagements around the city , which may even be stretched to include Yazid 's 669 attack . It should also be noted that both Byzantine and Arab chroniclers record the siege as lasting for seven years instead of five . This can be reconciled either by including the opening campaigns of 672 – 673 , or by counting the years until the final withdrawal of the Arab troops from their forward bases , in 680 . 
 The details of the clashes around Constantinople are unclear , as Theophanes condenses the siege in his account of the first year , and the Arab chroniclers do not mention the siege at all but merely provide the names of leaders of unspecified expeditions into Byzantine territory . Thus from the Arab sources it is only known that Abdallah ibn Qays and Fadhala ibn ' Ubayd raided Crete and wintered there in 675 , while in the same year Malik ibn Abdallah led a raid into Asia Minor . The Arab historians Ibn <unk> and al @-@ Tabari report that Yazid was dispatched by Mu 'awiya with reinforcements to Constantinople in 676 , and record that Abdallah ibn Qays led a campaign in 677 , whose target is unknown . At the same time , the Byzantines had to face a Slavic attack on Thessalonica and Lombard attacks in Italy . Finally , in autumn 677 or early 678 Constantine IV resolved to confront the Arab besiegers in a head @-@ on engagement . His fleet , equipped with Greek fire , routed the Arab fleet . It is probable that the death of admiral Yazid ibn <unk> , reported by Arab chroniclers for 677 / 678 , is related to this defeat . At about the same time , the Muslim army in Asia Minor , under the command of Sufyan ibn ' Awf , was defeated by the Byzantine army under the generals <unk> , <unk> and Cyprian , losing 30 @,@ 000 men according to Theophanes . These defeats forced the Arabs to abandon the siege in 678 . On its way back to Syria , the Arab fleet was almost annihilated in a storm off <unk> . 
 The essential outline of Theophanes ' account may be corroborated by the only near @-@ contemporary Byzantine reference to the siege , a celebratory poem by the otherwise unknown Theodosius Grammaticus , which was earlier believed to refer to the second Arab siege of 717 – 718 . Theodosius ' poem commemorates a decisive naval victory before the walls of the city — with the interesting detail that the Arab fleet too possessed fire @-@ throwing ships — and makes a reference to " the fear of their returning shadows " , which may be interpreted as confirming the recurring Arab attacks each spring from their base in Cyzicus . 
 = = Importance and aftermath = = 
 Constantinople was the nerve centre of the Byzantine state . Had it fallen , the Empire 's remaining provinces would have been unlikely to hold together , and would have become easy prey for the Arabs . At the same time , the failure of the Arab attack on Constantinople was a momentous event in itself . It marked the culmination of Mu 'awiya 's campaign of attrition , pursued steadily since 661 . Immense resources were poured into the undertaking , including the creation of a huge fleet . Its failure had similarly important repercussions , and represented a major blow to the Caliph 's prestige . Conversely , Byzantine prestige reached new heights , especially in the West : Constantine IV received envoys from the Avars and the Balkan Slavs , bearing gifts and congratulations and acknowledging Byzantine supremacy . The subsequent peace also gave a much @-@ needed respite from constant raiding to Asia Minor , and allowed the Byzantine state to recover its balance and consolidate itself following the cataclysmic changes of the previous decades . 
 The failure of the Arabs before Constantinople coincided with the increased activity of the Mardaites , a Christian group living in the mountains of Syria that resisted Muslim control and raided the lowlands . Faced with this new threat , and after the immense losses suffered against the Byzantines , Mu 'awiya began negotiations for a truce , with embassies exchanged between the two courts . These were drawn out until 679 , giving the Arabs time for a last raid into Asia Minor under ' Amr ibn Murra , perhaps intended to put pressure on the Byzantines . The peace treaty , of a nominal 30 @-@ year duration , provided that the Caliph would pay an annual tribute of 3 @,@ 000 nomismata , 50 horses and 50 slaves . The Arab garrisons were withdrawn from their bases on the Byzantine coastlands , including Rhodes , in 679 – 680 . 
 Constantine IV used the peace to proceed against the mounting Bulgar menace in the Balkans , but his huge army , comprising all the available forces of the Empire , was decisively beaten , opening the way for the establishment of a Bulgar state in the northeastern Balkans . In the Muslim world , after the death of Mu 'awiya in 680 , the various forces of opposition within the Caliphate manifested themselves . The Caliphate 's division during this Second Muslim Civil War allowed Byzantium to achieve not only peace , but also a position of predominance on its eastern frontier . Armenia and Iberia reverted for a time to Byzantine control , and Cyprus became a condominium between Byzantium and the Caliphate . The peace lasted until Justinian II ( r . 685 – 695 and 705 – 711 ) broke it in 693 , with devastating consequences : the Byzantines were defeated , Justinian was deposed and a twenty @-@ year period of anarchy followed . Muslim incursions intensified , leading to a second Arab attempt at conquering Constantinople in 717 – 718 , which also proved unsuccessful . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 Later Arab sources dwell extensively on the events of Yazid 's 669 expedition and supposed attack on Constantinople , including various mythical anecdotes , which are taken by modern scholarship to refer to the events of the 674 – 678 siege . Several important personalities of early Islam are mentioned as taking part , such as Ibn Abbas , Ibn Umar and Ibn al @-@ Zubayr . The most prominent among them in later tradition is Abu Ayyub al @-@ Ansari , one of the early companions ( Ansari ) and standard @-@ bearer of Muhammad , who died of illness before the city walls during the siege and was buried there . According to Muslim tradition , Constantine IV threatened to destroy his tomb , but the Caliph warned that if he did so , the Christians under his rule would suffer . Thus the tomb was left in peace , and even became a site of veneration by the Byzantines , who prayed there in times of drought . The tomb was " rediscovered " after the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 by the dervish Sheikh Ak Shams al @-@ Din , and Sultan Mehmed II ( r . 1444 – 1446 , 1451 – 1481 ) ordered the construction of a marble tomb and a mosque adjacent to it . It became a tradition that Ottoman sultans were girt with the Sword of Osman at the <unk> mosque upon their accession . Today it remains one of the holiest Muslim shrines in Istanbul . 
 = = Modern reassessment of the events = = 
 The narrative on the siege accepted by modern historians relies largely on Theophanes ' account , while the Arab and Syriac sources do not mention any siege , but rather individual campaigns , only a few of which reached as far as Constantinople . Thus the capture of an island named Arwad " in the sea of <unk> " is recorded for 673 / 674 , although it is unclear if this refers to the Sea of Marmara or the Aegean , and Yazid 's 676 expedition is also said to have reached Constantinople . The Syriac chroniclers also disagree with Theophanes in placing the decisive battle and destruction of the Arab fleet by Greek fire in 674 , during an Arab expedition against the coasts of Lycia and Cilicia , rather than Constantinople . This was followed by the landing of Byzantine forces in Syria in 677 / 678 , which began the Mardaite uprising that threatened the Caliphate 's grip on Syria enough to result in the peace agreement of 678 / 679 . 
 Based on a re @-@ evaluation of the original sources used by the medieval historians , the Oxford scholar James Howard @-@ Johnston , in his acclaimed 2010 book Witnesses to a World Crisis : Historians and Histories of the Middle East in the Seventh Century , rejects the traditional interpretation of events , based on Theophanes , in favour of the Syriac chroniclers ' version . Howard @-@ Johnston asserts that no siege actually took place , based not only on its absence in the eastern sources , but also on the logistical impossibility of such an undertaking for the duration reported . Instead , he believes that the reference to a siege was a later interpolation , influenced by the events of the second Arab siege of 717 – 718 , by an anonymous source that was then used by Theophanes . According to Howard @-@ Johnston , " The blockade of Constantinople in the 670s is a myth which has been allowed to mask the very real success achieved by the Byzantines in the last decade of Mu 'awiya ’ s caliphate , first by sea off Lycia and then on land , through an insurgency which , before long , aroused deep anxiety among the Arabs , conscious as they were that they had merely coated the Middle East with their power " .

 Kisnorbo played at centre @-@ back but has also played as a defensive midfielder . He was a fans ' favourite at Leicester City , accumulating over 100 appearances in his four years at the club . During his time with Leicester , he was at the centre of a number of refereeing controversies in which officiating calls were later shown to be wrong . He has also suffered some injuries that affected his playing ability for a time . Kisnorbo has represented Australia at international level in three tournaments ; the 2002 and 2004 Nation Cups and the 2007 Asian Cup . He started his professional career at South Melbourne and later played for the Scottish club Hearts before joining Leicester and then transferring to Leeds United . 
 Kisnorbo won the 2009 – 10 fans Player of The Season award and also the Players Player Award for Leeds United in his debut season . During his first 2 years at Leeds , Kisnorbo wore a headband bandage when playing football as ' tradition ' after initially wearing it after suffering a head injury on his Leeds debut .

 Following the collapse of the Australian National Soccer League , he made his move from South Melbourne to the Edinburgh @-@ based Scottish Premier League club Hearts in July 2003 , signing a two @-@ year contract . He was recommended to Hearts by former player Dave McPherson . Kisnorbo quickly became a regular for the first team where he made 48 appearances in two seasons , scoring his only league goal in a 2 – 1 win over Hibernian on 24 October 2004 . 
 Kisnorbo also played in the UEFA Cup against such clubs as Bordeaux , Feyenoord , Schalke 04 and Ferencváros , and scored a goal against Portuguese club SC ( Sporting Club ) Braga . He spent 18 months at Hearts , playing a total of 64 competitive games , before his contract expired at the end of the 2004 – 05 season . It was not renewed by the club .

 Kisnorbo joined Leicester City in April 2005 after leaving Hearts , signing a pre @-@ contract agreement in January . He followed former Hearts boss Craig Levein , teammates Mark de Vries and Alan Maybury across the border to the Midlands club . 
 Kisnorbo 's first goal for Leicester came on 15 October 2005 against Watford at Vicarage Road , which turned out to be the match winner . His initial appearances for Leicester were as a midfielder , and at first he failed to adjust and was booed by his own fans during a 2 – 1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday . However , a move back to defence resulted in a change in fortunes for Kisnorbo , and his partnership with then @-@ teammate Paddy McCarthy was instrumental in helping Leicester avoid relegation to League One that season . 
 Transfer speculation linked Kisnorbo to Wigan Athletic at the end of the 2005 – 06 season , but he decided to extend his stay with Leicester by signing a new three @-@ year contract , less than 12 months after joining the club . Kisnorbo began the 2006 – 07 season well , scoring two goals and putting in fine rear @-@ guard displays against Coventry City and Southend United , helping the club survive relegation yet again . He was linked with a move to Fulham during the January transfer window . His performance in the 2006 – 07 season earned him the players ' player of the season award from his teammates . It was also at this point that he became a fan favourite .

 In the 2007 – 08 season , Kisnorbo was relegated to League One with the club , but was also on the receiving end of no less than three controversial refereeing decisions . His first was a goal against Scunthorpe United on 20 October , which referee Scott Mathieson ruled out for an offside , depriving Leicester of an away win . Video replay showed that Kisnorbo 's disallowed goal was actually onside , greatly frustrating him , while Leicester coach Gerry Taggart commented " We have all seen the replay of Patrick 's goal in the dressing room and he is clearly not offside . " Kisnorbo 's second was a red card by referee Phil Joslin for what the linesman claimed was a foul on Pablo <unk> . Joslin awarded Ipswich Town a penalty kick , and Ipswich won 3 – 1 . Joslin admitted his mistake , and had the ban rescinded the following day after video replays showed Kisnorbo actually won the ball outside the penalty area . Leicester 's then @-@ manager Ian Holloway described the sending off as a " complete <unk> " . The Leicester club was fined £ 3 @,@ 000 by The Football Association , however , because of Kisnorbo 's teammates ' angry appeals to Joslin during the game . Kisnorbo 's third was another red card by referee Mike Pike for a foul on Billy Sharp on 5 April 2008 . Pike awarded Sheffield United a penalty kick as they won 3 – 0 . Video replays , however , showed no contact between the two , confirming that Sharp was diving . Holloway branded Pike 's decision " embarrassing " , saying " that was the biggest blunder I 've seen in a long time . " Leicester also succeeded in their appeal against the second red card . 
 Further misfortune came when Kisnorbo suffered damaged knee ligaments in 3 – 1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday on 26 April 2008 , sidelining him for six months . His injury badly affected Leicester 's hopes of surviving in the Championship . He played his 100th game and scored his last ever goal for Leicester in a 2 – 0 home win over Ipswich on 26 December 2007 .

 Kisnorbo returned to action the following season in a 3 – 0 reserve team win over Rushden & Diamonds on 2 October . He later returned for the first team coming on as a substitute in a 1 – 1 draw against Oldham Athletic on 18 October 2008 . However , he was struck with another ligament injury to his other knee in a 3 – 0 FA Cup win over Stevenage Borough on 9 November , putting him out for two more months . Kisnorbo made his competitive return as a second @-@ half substitute in a 1 – 0 win over Millwall on 14 March 2009 , but by then was facing competition in the first team from teammates Wayne Brown , Jack Hobbs , Michael Morrison and Aleksandar <unk> . He started just three games in the second half of the season , which saw the club secure their promotion as League One champions . 
 It was reported on 28 April that manager Nigel Pearson told Kisnorbo he could leave on a free transfer the following summer as the club began their preparations for their Championship campaign the following season . Leicester on 29 May released Kisnorbo at the end of his contract , along with Paul Henderson , Marc <unk> , Bruno N 'Gotty and Barry Hayles . Kisnorbo stated he was " very disappointed to have been released " , and made it clear that he wanted " to show Leicester next season what they are missing because I 'm desperate to stay in the Championship .

 On 22 July 2009 , Kisnorbo signed for Leeds United on a two @-@ year contract . He made his debut in a 2 – 1 win over Exeter City on 8 August . On his debut Kisnorbo suffered a head wound which required stitches , after receiving stitches to the wound off the pitch he came out wearing a head bandage . After playing for Australia on 12 August , Kisnorbo became Leeds 's 100th full international player . Whilst at Leeds he established himself as a fans ' favourite for his solid performances and his brave style of play . After suffering the head injury , which required 12 stitches , Kisnorbo wore a protective headband . He rejected plastic surgery to avoid losing his place in the team : " I can 't see myself going for [ surgery ] at the moment because I 've got bigger things to worry about than getting this sorted . " 
 Kisnorbo scored his first goal for Leeds against Millwall on his return to the starting lineup after missing the previous game against Norwich City having picked up an illness on international duty . His international call @-@ ups along with other internationals at Leeds resulted in games against Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers being postponed . Kisnorbo missed the games against Kettering Town , Oldham Athletic and local rivals Huddersfield Town through an injury he picked up in training . He had not recovered from injury to be able to have a part in the squad in the FA Cup replay to Kettering . Instead , the Australia international returned to the Leeds starting line up against Brentford . 
 Kisnorbo played against Manchester United when Leeds won 1 – 0 away at Old Trafford on 3 January in the FA Cup , during which he and Richard Naylor " bolted the door against the assaults of Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov " , after which he was described as a hero . Kisnorbo missed the Football League Trophy Northern Section Final first leg loss against Carlisle United with a calf injury . Kisnorbo returned to Leeds ' starting lineup , and played the full 90 minutes , in the next game where Leeds earned a 2 – 2 draw against Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup . 
 Kisnorbo was part of the Leeds defence , who were defeated 3 – 0 by Swindon Town . Kisnorbo was omitted from the Leeds squad in the next game against Colchester United after being ruled out by injury . The injury also forced him to miss the FA Cup replay at Elland Road against Tottenham Hotspur , the League One game against Hartlepool United and the Football League Trophy Northern Section final second leg against Carlisle . 
 Kisnorbo 's season prematurely ended after he suffered a suspected ruptured <unk> tendon against Millwall in March , ending his hopes of playing in Leeds 's promotion charge , and also his dream of playing in the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Leeds as a result signed Neill Collins on loan from Preston to cover his absence . 
 In May 2010 , he was selected in the Football League One PFA Team of the Year for the 2009 – 10 season . On the final day of the season Kisnorbo was named as the fans ' Leeds United Player Of The Season and also the Players ' Player Of The Season . Leeds were promoted to the Football League Championship after finishing in 2nd place in League 1 and thus earning automatic promotion .

 Kisnorbo joined the Leeds squad on the pre @-@ season tour of Slovakia despite being injured . Grayson confirmed that Kisnorbo was looking to return from his Achilles tendon rupture injury around December / January time meaning he would miss at least half of the 2010 / 11 season for Leeds . Manager Simon Grayson revealed contract talks with Kisnorbo would start once the defender returned from injury and managed to prove his fitness . After having another operation on his injury in October 2010 , Grayson said that Kisnorbo was looking to return later than planned , with an estimated return around February / March 2011 . 
 On 20 November , Grayson reiterated his desire to keep Kisnorbo but stated that he had to prove his fitness before being offered a new deal at Leeds . Kisnorbo got an infection on his Achilles tendon injury , and stepped up his rehab by going to the USA for treatment . Kisnorbo returned to Leeds ' training ground Thorp Arch during mid January . However , on 11 March 2011 , it was confirmed that he would not play again in the 2010 – 11 season . As Kisnorbo 's contract was set to expire in June 2011 , he had to prove his fitness to the coaching staff at Leeds in the hope of earning a new contract , or be free to join another club . In March 2011 , Kisnorbo returned to full training with Leeds after his long spell out injured . 
 In Leeds ' penultimate game of the season , against Burnley , Kisnorbo made the provisional squad but failed to make the substitutes bench . On 6 May , Grayson revealed the club were going to offer Kisnorbo a new contract on a short term deal , which , if he accepted , would allow him more time to earn a new long term deal once he proved his fitness . On 7 May , Kisnorbo was named on the bench for Leeds against Queens Park Rangers , the first time he was included in a matchday squad since suffering his ruptured Achilles tendon .

Kisnorbo revealed he wouldn 't be wearing his iconic head bandage for the 2011 – 12 season as he wanted it to represent a new start for him . Kisnorbo scored the opening goal in the pre @-@ season friendly victory against Newcastle United . Kisnorbo started for Leeds on the opening day of the season as they suffered a 3 – 1 defeat against Southampton . It was his first competitive start for Leeds since picking up his injury against Millwall 17 months earlier . 
 Kisnorbo was handed the captaincy in the absence of suspended captain Jonny Howson on 16 August against Hull City . Kisnorbo scored an own goal against West Ham United on 21 August . Kisnorbo 's poor form continued when he was sent off and gave away a penalty for Leeds in the match against Bristol City on 17 September . As a result of the suspension , Kisnorbo missed the League Cup game against fierce rivals Manchester United . After a spell on the bench due to the partnership of Tom Lees and Darren O 'Dea , Kisnorbo came on as a substitute replacing O 'Dea in Leeds ' 1 – 1 draw against Cardiff City on 30 October . After starting in the 5 – 0 loss against Blackpool , Kisnorbo put in an impressive performance against his old side Leicester City on 6 November to help earn Leeds a clean sheet in a 1 – 0 win . 
 Due to the knee injury sustained by Captain Jonny Howson , Kisnorbo took over the captain 's armband , starting with Leeds ' 1 – 1 draw against Watford on 10 December , in which Kisnorbo gave away a penalty which was saved by Leeds keeper Alex McCarthy with Leeds 1 – 0 down . The save proved crucial as Leeds scored a last minute equaliser . 
 Kisnorbo 's season was ended on 2 January when he sustained a serious knee injury in Leeds ' 2 – 1 win over Burnley . In April , Kisnorbo revealed he had stepped up in his comeback and had started running again in training , but there was no timescale put on his return .

 Manager , Neil Warnock revealed on 3 May that he was hoping that Kisnorbo may return from injury in time for the start of the 2012 – 13 pre @-@ season . With Kisnorbo missing several pre @-@ season games he wasn 't allocated a number for the 2012 – 13 season , losing his number 3 squad number to Adam Drury . Kisnorbo returned to the Leeds squad on 4 August in the pre @-@ season friendly against Preston North End . Kisnorbo was allocated the squad number 6 for the upcoming season and was named on the bench for the first game of the season against Shrewsbury Town on 11 August . 
 Kisnorbo made his first start of the season on 28 August 2012 in a League Cup match against Oxford United . 
 On 3 May 2013 , it was announced that Kisnorbo , along with 10 other players were being released from the club .

 = = International = = 
 Kisnorbo was part of Australia 's 2001 Youth World Cup campaign , playing five matches for the under @-@ 20 team in Oceania qualifiers , including a goal against Papua New Guinea . He remained on the squad for the finals , appearing in all the matches leading up to Australia 's second @-@ round elimination at the hands of Brazil . His performances in the under @-@ 20 level led to his first international appearance on 6 July 2002 against Vanuatu in Australia 's first match of the 2002 OFC Nations Cup . He made three appearances in the tournament including the defeat to New Zealand in the final . 
 In 2004 Kisnorbo was again selected for the squad for the Oceania Cup . In Australia 's last group match against Solomon Islands he was sent off for receiving two yellow cards , ending his tournament . He declined to join the " <unk> " squad for an Olympic preparation tour in July , electing to concentrate on cementing a place at Hearts in the pre @-@ season . This decision harmed his national team aspirations , as he was left out of the squad that eventually lost to Iraq in the quarter @-@ finals . 
 Kisnorbo made appearances for Australia in friendlies against Ghana , Denmark , China and Uruguay . These performances led to his selection for the Australian 2007 AFC Asian Cup squad , playing in the first two group matches against Oman and Iraq . After Australia tied the first match and lost the second , Kisnorbo was dropped from the starting line @-@ up amongst a host of changes . He played no further part in the tournament as Australia were eventually knocked out by Japan . 
 It was widely regarded that Kisnorbo 's poor performance at the Asian Cup had ruined his chances of ever returning to international level , and he remained outside the Australian national squad for over two years , however , following admirable performances with his new club Leeds United , Kisnorbo regained his international place in 2009 and started in a 3 – 0 friendly win over Republic of Ireland on 12 August 2009 , nearly scoring a goal in the 22nd minute when his header was saved at pointblank range by goalkeeper Shay Given . On 5 September 2009 , Kisnorbo scored his first goal for Australia in a game against South Korea . Kisnorbo was subsequently selected in the Australian squad for a friendly against the Netherlands on 10 October 2009 . 
 Kisnorbo 's ruptured Achilles tendon injury suffered against Millwall in March 2010 ruled him out of the 2010 World Cup for Australia . 
 In June 2011 , Kisnorbo was recalled to the Australia national side for the first time since recovering from his Achilles tendon injury when he was called up to train with the national side in a non playing role ahead of the friendly against Serbia .

 = Postelsia = 
 Postelsia palmaeformis , also known as the sea palm ( not to be confused with the southern sea palm ) or palm seaweed , is a species of kelp and classified within brown algae . The sea palm is found along the western coast of North America , on rocky shores with constant waves . It is one of the few algae that can survive and remain erect out of the water ; in fact , it spends most of its life cycle exposed to the air . It is an annual , and edible , though harvesting of the alga is discouraged due to the species ' sensitivity to overharvesting . 
 = = History = = 
 The sea palm was known by the natives of California by the name of <unk> @-@ <unk> before any Europeans entered the region . Postelsia was first scientifically described by Franz Josef Ruprecht ( 1814 – 1870 ) in 1852 from a specimen found near Bodega Bay in California . Ruprecht , an Austro @-@ Hungarian who became curator of botany at the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1839 , studied seaweed specimens collected by botanist Ilya <unk> , and published a paper describing one seagrass and five seaweeds , one of which was Postelsia . The sea palm has been used by several textbooks , such as the Campbell – Reece Biology textbook , as an example of multicellular protists , as well as an example of the class <unk> . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The generic name , Postelsia honors Alexander <unk> <unk> , an Estonian @-@ born geologist and artist who worked with Ruprecht , while the specific name , palmaeformis , describes the alga 's superficial similarity in appearance to true palms . 
 = = Fossil record = = 
 Fossils from Monte Bolca , a lagerstätte near Verona , were originally named <unk> caput @-@ medusae and previously thought to be trace fossils , but were later found to be plants instead and given the name <unk> by French zoologist Henri Milne @-@ Edwards in 1866 . The type specimen collected by Italian paleobotanist <unk> Bartolommeo <unk> before 1855 is at the Natural History Museum of Verona and was preserved in a lithographic limestone upper and lower slab . 
 When Italian botanist Achille Forti ( 1878 – 1937 ) worked on the specimens in 1926 , they were reinterpreted as close relatives of Postelsia , now known to be a brown algae , which had lived in the coastal waters of the Eocene sea . Forti renamed the species <unk> caput @-@ medusae commemorating the fossils ' extreme similarity to the extant Postelsia palmaeformis . The appearance of the plant fossil is a holdfast on the bottom , with a stem @-@ like stipe between there and the fronds which are about 5 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) to 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . In life , the fronds would have hung vertically whenever the plant was submerged during high tide , and would have flopped over the stipe when the plant was exposed during low tide in a habitus similar to that of the living sea palm . 
 Other specimens from this deposit collected and described by <unk> in 1855 were actually trace fossils , and they remain assigned to <unk> ; only the specimens of Z. caput @-@ medusae have been assigned to <unk> , as those are fossils of the original plant , and not trace fossils . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 Postelsia has two distinct morphologies : one for its diploid , monoicous sporophyte stage , which is the dominant portion of the life cycle , and one for its smaller , haploid , dioecious gametophyte stage . Like all seaweeds , the sporophyte stage of Postelsia consists of a thallus , which is made up of a stem @-@ like stipe topped with possibly over 100 leaf @-@ like blades , and rests on a root @-@ like holdfast . The holdfast anchors the organism to the rocks it lives on . The sea palm has no vascular system ; the stipe is only for support of the organism and holds the fronds up over other organisms so they can receive more light . The stipe is merely a firm , hollow tube , able to withstand the open air of low tide conditions as well as the crashing waves of high tide . The blades are grooved , with the sporangia held within these grooves . The gametophyte stage is microscopic , consisting of only a few cells . The gametophytes produce sperm and eggs to create new sporophytes . 
 Like all <unk> , sea palms use the pigments chlorophyll a , chlorophyll c , <unk> , and carotenes in photosynthesis . Their cell walls are composed of alginate . They use <unk> and mannitol for storage . 
 = = Life cycle and growth = = 
 Like most brown algae , Postelsia goes through alternation of generations , and is an annual species . The diploid sporophyte produces , through meiosis , haploid spores , which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate , which may be mussels , barnacles , or bare rock . These spores develop , through mitosis , into small , multicellular haploid gametophytes , male and female . The male and female <unk> create sperm and eggs , respectively . The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes , resulting in a diploid zygote , which develops into a new sporophyte . 
 Postelsia are green in color as juveniles , and change to a golden brown as they age , reaching a height of 50 – 75 cm ( 20 – 30 in ) . 
 As a Postelsia alga grows , its stipe thickens in the same manner as a tree 's trunk . The cells beneath the epidermis , called the <unk> , divide rapidly to form rings of growth , again , like a tree . However , the greater flexibility of Postelsia 's stipe over that of a woody tree makes for some distinct differences . Postelsia must be thicker than a tree of equal height in order to support itself . However , the stipe is very much more suited to the coastal habitat , as it allows the seaweed to bend with the constant wave action . Such an environment would cause the inflexible , woody tree to break . 
 The blades of the new sporophyte grow from one or two initial blades by splitting . A tear forms in the middle of the blade at its base , which then continues along the entire length of the blade until it is split in two . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 Sea palms are found on the rocky shores of western North America , from as far north as Vancouver Island , to the southern central coast of California . They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in very wavy areas . High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus , allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize . In addition , the constant wave action removes competitors , such as the California mussel . Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists . A control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels ; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes . Alternatively , it is thought that the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as <unk> or <unk> , allowing Postelsia to grow freely after wave action removes the mussels . 
 When Postelsia release their spores , they tend to fall within a few meters of the parent sporophyte for two reasons . The first is that though spores are flagellated and can swim , they are often released at low tide and are deposited directly to the substrate below . Secondly , Postelsia gametophytes need to be close to each other in order for fertilization to occur . As such , sea palms tend to live very close to each other in large aggregations . Some juvenile sporophytes will grow on competing organisms , like mussels or barnacles , and rip them from the rocks when the waves come , gripping them with holdfasts of incredible strength . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Two other , smaller brown algae , of the family <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Pylaiella gardneri , as well as the two red algae <unk> borealis and <unk> gardneri , are epiphytic on Postelsia . Pylaiella gardneri is an obligate epiphyte to Postelsia . As with all epiphytes , these algae are not harmful to Postelsia , and merely use the larger alga as a substrate to grow upon . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 The blades ( and less often , the stipes ) of Postelsia are sometimes used in certain dishes , usually in California . Postelsia is a protected species , however , and harvesting it is illegal throughout much of its range , as clipping the blades too low , below the meristem , prevents reproduction . Postelsia can regenerate blades cut above the meristem , but removing the blades can limit a sporophyte 's ability to produce spores and contribute to subsequent populations . Postelsia has also been in danger of overharvesting at some points . It is illegal to harvest Postelsia in British Columbia , Washington and Oregon . In California , Postelsia is a partially protected species : recreational harvesting is illegal , but commercial harvesting is legal . Between 2000 and 2001 , an estimated 2 to 3 tons of Postelsia were harvested in California . The blades are eaten raw or are dried , and dried blades sell for up to US $ 45 per pound . Commercial harvesters of Postelsia must purchase a $ 100 license , pay a royalty to the State of California ( $ 24 per wet ton of algae harvested ) , and submit a monthly harvest log . 
 An experiment done to try to prove or disprove the claims of Postelsia harvesters that their gathering methods are sustainable yielded results stating that recovery from collection depended greatly on the season of collection . 
 = SM UB @-@ 2 = 
 SM UB @-@ 2 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. She sank eleven ships during her career and was broken up in Germany in 1920 . 
 UB @-@ 2 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November . UB @-@ 2 was a little more than 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 142 tonnes ( 125 and 140 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . She was launched and commissioned as SM UB @-@ 2 in February 1915 . 
 When UB @-@ 2 sailed to join the Flanders Flotilla in May 1915 , she became the only member of her class to not be shipped by rail to Antwerp to join the unit . While in the flotilla , UB @-@ 2 sank eleven British ships of 1 @,@ 374 gross register tons ( GRT ) under the command of Kptlt . Werner Fürbringer . The U @-@ boat was assigned to the Baltic Flotilla in March 1916 relegated to a training role from December that same year . At the end of the war , UB @-@ 2 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany 's U @-@ boat fleet . She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . UB @-@ 2 was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines — numbered UB @-@ 1 to UB @-@ 8 — ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . 
 UB @-@ 2 was laid down by Germaniawerft on 1 November , one of the first two boats of the class started . She was launched at Kiel on 13 February 1915 . As built , UB @-@ 2 was 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 44 kW ) Daimler 4 @-@ cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 6 @.@ 47 knots ( 11 @.@ 98 km / h ; 7 @.@ 45 mph ) , surfaced , and 5 @.@ 51 knots ( 10 @.@ 20 km / h ; 6 @.@ 34 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 650 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 060 km ; 1 @,@ 900 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 2 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 2 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB @-@ 2 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . 
 = = Service career = = 
 The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB @-@ 2 on 20 February under the command of Kapitänleutnant Werner Fürbringer , a 26 @-@ year @-@ old native of Braunschweig , and underwent trials in German home waters . 
 UB @-@ 2 sailed from Germany to Flanders to join the Flanders Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote des Marinekorps U @-@ Flotille Flandern ) on 10 May 1915 , and was the only UB I or UC I boat in the flotilla to not be shipped to Antwerp by rail . When UB @-@ 2 joined the flotilla , Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive , begun in February . During this campaign , enemy vessels in the German @-@ defined war zone ( German : Kriegsgebiet ) , which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom ( including the English Channel ) , were to be sunk . Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag . 
 The UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla were initially limited to patrols in the Hoofden , the southern portion of the North Sea between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands . On 9 and 10 June , while patrolling in this area 50 to 60 nautical miles ( 93 to 111 km ; 58 to 69 mi ) southeast of Lowestoft , UB @-@ 2 sank six British fishing smacks with a combined tonnage of just under 300 GRT , the largest being Intrepid of 59 tons . All six of the smacks — sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails — were stopped , boarded by crewmen from UB @-@ 2 , and sunk with explosives . 
 After UB @-@ 2 's sister boat UB @-@ 6 pioneered a route around past British anti @-@ submarine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June , boats of the flotilla began to patrol the western English Channel . UB @-@ 2 , UB @-@ 5 , and UB @-@ 10 soon followed with patrols in the Channel . Even though none of the boats sank any ships , by successfully completing their voyages they helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover . 
 On 28 August , UB @-@ 2 was patrolling in the <unk> – Yarmouth area when she sank the British trawler Miura . At 297 tons , Miura bested Intrepid as the largest vessel sunk by UB @-@ 2 to @-@ date . Early the following month , UB @-@ 2 sank another two fishing smacks 44 nautical miles ( 81 km ; 51 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Lowestoft : the 57 @-@ ton Constance , and the 44 @-@ ton Emanuel . Three days later , UB @-@ 2 sank 47 @-@ ton smack Boy Ernie about 58 nautical miles ( 107 km ; 67 mi ) east of Cromer . As with the six vessels sunk in June , all three were stopped by UB @-@ 2 and sunk with explosives . 
 Germany 's submarine offensive was suspended on 18 September by the chief of the Admiralstab , Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff , In response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer Lusitania in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September . Holtzendorff 's directive from ordered all U @-@ boats out of the English Channel and the South @-@ Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations . UB @-@ 2 did not sink any vessels over the next four months . 
 The German Imperial Navy began its second submarine offensive in February 1916 , declaring , among other provisions , that all enemy vessels in the war zone were to be destroyed without warning . On 26 February 1916 , UB @-@ 2 torpedoed and sank the cargo ship <unk> , in what was ultimately her last wartime success . The British steamer — at 672 GRT , the largest ship sunk by UB @-@ 2 — went down with a loss of all fourteen of her crew . 
 In early March , Kapitänleutnant Fürbringer was succeeded by the former commander of UB @-@ 13 , Kptlt . Karl Neumann , who had been in the same cadet class as Fürbringer . Fürbringer went on to command six other U @-@ boats , and was responsible for sinking nearly 100 @,@ 000 tons of shipping . In 1933 he published a memoir of his World War I U @-@ boat service , Alarm ! <unk> ! ! : U @-@ boot in Kampf und Sturm , which included an overview of his career , including his time on UB @-@ 2 .

 = Death of Edgar Allan Poe = 
 The death of Edgar Allan Poe on October 7 , 1849 , has remained mysterious : the circumstances leading up to it are uncertain and the cause of death is disputed . On October 3 , Poe was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore , Maryland , " in great distress , and ... in need of immediate assistance " , according to the man who found him , Joseph W. Walker . He was taken to the Washington College Hospital , where he died at 5 a.m. on Sunday , October 7 . Poe was never coherent enough to explain how he came to be in this condition . 
 Much of the extant information about the last few days of Poe 's life comes from his attending physician , Dr. John Joseph Moran , though his credibility is questionable . Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground , but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875 . The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe 's wife , Virginia , and his mother @-@ in @-@ law , Maria . Theories as to what caused Poe 's death include suicide , murder , cholera , <unk> , rabies , syphilis , influenza , and that Poe was a victim of cooping . Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed . 
 After Poe 's death , Rufus Wilmot Griswold wrote his obituary under the pseudonym " Ludwig " . Griswold , who became the literary executor of Poe 's estate , was actually a rival of Poe and later published his first full biography , depicting him as a depraved , drunk , drug @-@ addled madman . Much of the evidence for this image of Poe is believed to have been forged by Griswold , and though friends of Poe denounced it , this interpretation had lasting impact . 
 = = Chronology = = 
 On September 27 , 1849 , Poe left Richmond , Virginia , on his way home to New York . No reliable evidence exists about Poe 's whereabouts until a week later on October 3 , when he was found delirious on the streets of Baltimore , outside Ryan 's Tavern ( sometimes referred to as Gunner 's Hall ) . A printer named Joseph W. Walker sent a letter requesting help from an acquaintance of Poe , Dr. Joseph E. Snodgrass . His letter reads : 
 Snodgrass later claimed the note said that Poe was " in a state of beastly intoxication " , but the original letter proves otherwise . 
 Snodgrass 's first @-@ hand account describes Poe 's appearance as " repulsive " , with unkempt hair , a haggard , unwashed face and " <unk> and vacant " eyes . His clothing , Snodgrass said , which included a dirty shirt but no vest and unpolished shoes , was worn and did not fit well . Dr. John Joseph Moran , who was Poe 's attending physician , gives his own detailed account of Poe 's appearance that day : " a stained faded , old <unk> coat , pantaloons of a similar character , a pair of worn @-@ out shoes run down at the heels , and an old straw hat " . Poe was never coherent long enough to explain how he came to be in this condition , and it is believed the clothes he was wearing were not his own , not least because wearing shabby clothes was out of character for Poe . 
 Moran cared for Poe at the for @-@ profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street . He was denied any visitors and was confined in a prison @-@ like room with barred windows in a section of the building reserved for drunk people . Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name " Reynolds " on the night before his death , though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred . One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds , a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket . Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds , one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan 's Tavern , who may have met Poe on Election Day . Poe may have instead been calling for " Herring " , as the author had an uncle @-@ in @-@ law in Baltimore named Henry Herring . In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a " Misses Herring " . He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during one of the few times Poe was awake . When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends , Poe allegedly replied that " the best thing his friend could do would be to blow out his brains with a pistol " . 
 In Poe 's distressed state , he made reference to a wife in Richmond . He may have been delusional , thinking that his wife , Virginia , was still alive , or he may have been referring to Sarah Elmira Royster , to whom he had recently proposed . He did not know what had happened to his trunk of belongings which , it transpired , had been left behind at the Swan Tavern in Richmond . Moran reported that Poe 's final words were " Lord , help my poor soul " before dying on October 7 , 1849 . 
 = = = Credibility of Moran = = = 
 Because Poe did not have visitors , Moran was probably the only person to see the author in his last days . Even so , Moran 's credibility has been questioned repeatedly , if not considered altogether untrustworthy . Throughout the years after Poe 's death , his story changed as he wrote and lectured on the topic . He claimed ( in 1875 and again in 1885 , for example ) that he had immediately contacted Poe 's aunt ( and mother @-@ in @-@ law ) , Maria Clemm , to let her know about Poe 's death ; in fact , he wrote to her only after she had requested it on November 9 , almost a full month after the event . He also claimed that Poe had said , quite poetically , as he prepared to draw his last breath : " The arched heavens encompass me , and God has his decree legibly written upon the <unk> of every created human being , and demons incarnate , their goal will be the seething waves of blank despair . " The editor of the New York Herald , which published this version of Moran 's story , admitted , " We cannot imagine Poe , even if delirious , constructing [ such sentences ] . " Poe biographer William Bittner attributes Moran 's claim to a convention of assigning pious last words to console mourners . 
 Moran 's accounts even altered dates . At different points , he claimed Poe was brought to the hospital on October 3 at 5 p.m. , on October 6 at 9 a.m. , or on October 7 ( the day he died ) at " 10 o 'clock in the afternoon " . For each published account , he claimed to have the hospital records as reference . A search for hospital records a century later , specifically an official death certificate , found nothing . Some critics claim Moran 's inconsistencies and errors were due only to a lapse of memory , an innocent desire to romanticize , or even to senility . At the time he wrote and published his last account in 1885 , Moran was 65 . 
 = = Cause of death = = 
 All medical records and documents , including Poe 's death certificate , have been lost , if they ever existed . The precise cause of Poe 's death is disputed , but many theories exist . Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions , ranging from Jeffrey Meyers ' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh 's conspiratorial murder plot theory . It has also been suggested that Poe 's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression . In 1848 , he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum , readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer . Though it is unclear if this was a true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe 's part , it did not lead to Poe 's death a year later . 
 Snodgrass was convinced that Poe died from alcoholism and did a great deal to popularize this idea . He was a supporter of the temperance movement and found Poe a useful example in his temperance work . However , Snodgrass 's writings on the topic have been proven untrustworthy . Moran contradicted Snodgrass by stating in his own 1885 account that Poe did not die under the effect of any intoxicant . Moran claimed that Poe " had not the slightest odor of liquor upon his breath or person " . Even so , some newspapers at the time reported Poe 's death as " congestion of the brain " or " cerebral inflammation " , euphemisms for deaths from disgraceful causes such as alcoholism . In a study of Poe , a psychologist suggested that Poe had <unk> . 
 Poe 's characterization as an uncontrollable alcoholic is disputed . His drinking companion for a time , Thomas Mayne Reid , admitted that the two engaged in wild " frolics " but that Poe " never went beyond the innocent mirth in which we all indulge ... While acknowledging this as one of Poe 's failings , I can speak truly of its not being habitual " . Some believe Poe had a severe susceptibility to alcohol and became drunk after one glass of wine . He only drank during difficult periods of his life and sometimes went several months at a time without alcohol . Adding further confusion about the frequency of Poe 's use of alcohol was his membership in the Sons of Temperance at the time of his death . William Glenn , who administered Poe 's pledge , wrote years later that the temperance community had no reason to believe Poe had violated his pledge while in Richmond . Suggestions of a drug overdose have also been proven to be untrue , though it is still often reported . Thomas Dunn English , an admitted enemy of Poe and a trained doctor , insisted that Poe was not a drug user . He wrote : " Had Poe the opium habit when I knew him ( before 1846 ) I should both as a physician and a man of observation , have discovered it during his frequent visits to my rooms , my visits at his house , and our meetings elsewhere – I saw no signs of it and believe the charge to be a baseless slander . " 
 Numerous other causes of death have been proposed over the years , including several forms of rare brain disease or a brain tumor , diabetes , various types of enzyme deficiency , syphilis , apoplexy , delirium tremens , epilepsy and meningeal inflammation . A doctor named John W. Francis examined Poe in May 1848 and believed Poe had heart disease , which Poe later denied . A 2006 test of a sample of Poe 's hair provides evidence against the possibility of lead poisoning , mercury poisoning , and similar toxic heavy @-@ metal exposures . Cholera has also been suggested . Poe had passed through Philadelphia in early 1849 during a cholera epidemic . He got sick during his time in the city and wrote a letter to his aunt , Maria Clemm , saying that he may " have had the cholera , or spasms quite as bad " . 
 Because Poe was found on the day of an election , it was suggested as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping . This was a ballot @-@ box @-@ stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied , drugged , and used as a pawn to vote for a political party at multiple locations . <unk> had become the standard explanation for Poe 's death in most of his biographies for several decades , though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked . More recently , analysis suggesting that Poe 's death resulted from rabies has been presented . 
 = = Funeral = = 
 Poe 's funeral was a simple one , held at 4 p.m. on Monday , October 8 , 1849 . Few people attended the ceremony . Poe 's uncle , Henry Herring , provided a simple mahogany coffin , and a cousin , Neilson Poe , supplied the hearse . Moran 's wife made his shroud . The funeral was presided over by the Reverend W. T. D. Clemm , cousin of Poe 's wife , Virginia . Also in attendance were Dr. Snodgrass , Baltimore lawyer and former University of Virginia classmate Zaccheus Collins Lee , Poe 's first cousin Elizabeth Herring and her husband , and former schoolmaster Joseph Clarke . The entire ceremony lasted only three minutes in the cold , damp weather . Reverend Clemm decided not to bother with a sermon because the crowd was too small . Sexton George W. Spence wrote of the weather : " It was a dark and gloomy day , not raining but just kind of raw and threatening . " Poe was buried in a cheap coffin that lacked handles , a nameplate , cloth lining , or a cushion for his head . 
 On October 10 , 2009 , Poe received a second funeral in Baltimore . Actors portrayed Poe 's contemporaries and other long @-@ dead writers and artists . Each paid their respects and read eulogies adapted from their writings about Poe . The funeral included a replica of Poe 's casket and wax cadaver . 
 = = Burial and reburial = = 
 Poe is buried on the grounds of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground , now part of the University of Maryland School of Law in Baltimore . Even after his death , he created controversy and mystery . 
 Poe was originally buried without a headstone towards the rear corner of the churchyard near his grandfather , David Poe , Sr. A headstone of white Italian marble , paid for by Poe 's cousin Neilson Poe , was destroyed before it reached the grave when a train derailed and plowed through the monument yard where it was being kept . Instead , it was marked with a sand @-@ stone block that read " No. 80 " . In 1873 , Southern poet Paul Hamilton Hayne visited Poe 's grave and published a newspaper article describing its poor condition and suggesting a more appropriate monument . Sara Sigourney Rice , a teacher in Baltimore 's public schools , took advantage of renewed interest in Poe 's grave site and personally solicited for funds . She even had some of her elocution students give public performances to raise money . Many in Baltimore and throughout the United States contributed ; the final $ 650 came from Philadelphia publisher and philanthropist George William Childs . The new monument was designed by architect George A. Frederick and built by Colonel Hugh Sisson , and included a medallion of Poe by artist Adalbert <unk> . All three men were from Baltimore . The total cost of the monument , with the medallion , amounted to slightly more than $ 1 @,@ 500 . ( $ 31 @,@ 600 in 2014 dollars ) 
 Poe was reburied on October 1 , 1875 , at a new location close to the front of the church . A celebration was held at the dedication of the new tomb on November 17 . His original burial spot was marked with a large stone donated by Orin C. Painter , though it was originally placed in the wrong spot . Attendees included Neilson Poe , who gave a speech and called his cousin " one of the best hearted men that ever lived " , as well as Nathan C. Brooks , John Snodgrass , and John Hill Hewitt . Though several leading poets were invited to the ceremony , Walt Whitman was the only one to attend . Alfred Tennyson contributed a poem which was read at the ceremony : 
 Probably unknown to the reburial crew , the headstones on all the graves , previously facing to the east , had been turned to face the West Gate in 1864 . The crew digging up Poe 's remains had difficulty finding the right body : they first exhumed a 19 @-@ year @-@ old Maryland militiaman , Philip Mosher , Jr . When they correctly located Poe , they opened his coffin and one witness noted : " The skull was in excellent condition — the shape of the forehead , one of Poe 's striking features , was easily discerned . " 
 A few years later , the remains of Poe 's wife , Virginia , were moved to this spot as well . In 1875 , the cemetery in which she lay was destroyed , and she had no kin to claim her remains . William Gill , an early Poe biographer , gathered her bones and stored them in a box he hid under his bed . Virginia 's remains were finally buried with her husband 's on January 19 , 1885 , the 76th anniversary of her husband 's birth and nearly 10 years after his present monument was erected . George W. Spence , the man who served as sexton during Poe 's original burial as well as his exhumation and reburial , attended the rites that brought his body to rest with Virginia and Virginia 's mother , Maria Clemm . 
 = = Posthumous character assassination = = 
 On October 9 , the day of Poe 's burial , an obituary appeared in the " New York Tribune " . Signed only " Ludwig " , the obituary floridly alternated between praising the dead author 's abilities and eloquence and damning his temperament and ambition . " Ludwig " said that " literary art lost one of its most brilliant , but erratic stars " but also claimed Poe was known for walking the streets in delirium , muttering to himself and claimed Poe was excessively arrogant , that he assumed all men were villains , and that he was quick to anger . " Ludwig " was later revealed to be Rufus Wilmot Griswold , a former colleague and acquaintance of Poe . Even while Poe was still alive , Griswold had engaged in character assassination . Much of his characterization in the obituary was lifted almost verbatim from that of the fictitious Francis Vivian in The <unk> by Edward Bulwer @-@ Lytton . The Ludwig obituary quickly became the standard characterization of Poe . 
 Griswold also claimed that Poe had asked him to be his literary executor . Griswold had served as an agent for several American authors , but it is unclear whether Poe appointed him to be the executor or whether Griswold became executor through a trick or a mistake by Poe 's aunt and mother @-@ in @-@ law , Maria . In 1850 he presented , in collaboration with James Russell Lowell and Nathaniel Parker Willis , a collection of Poe 's work that included a biographical article titled " Memoir of the Author " , in which Poe was depicted as a depraved , drunk , drug @-@ addled madman . Many parts of it were believed to have been fabricated by Griswold , and it was denounced by those who had known Poe , including Sarah Helen Whitman , Charles Frederick Briggs , and George Rex Graham . This account became popularly accepted , in part because it was the only full biography available and was widely reprinted . It also remained popular because many readers assumed that Poe was similar to his fictional characters or were thrilled at the thought of reading the works of an " evil " man . 
 A more accurate biography of Poe did not appear until John Henry Ingram 's of 1875 . Even so , historians continued to use Griswold 's depiction as a model for their own biographies of Poe , including W. H. Davenport in 1880 , Thomas R. <unk> in 1909 , and Augustus Hopkins Strong in 1916 . Many used Poe as a cautionary tale against alcohol and drugs . In 1941 , Arthur Hobson Quinn presented evidence that Griswold had forged and re @-@ written a number of Poe 's letters that were included in his " Memoir of the Author " . By then , Griswold 's depiction of Poe was entrenched in the mind of the public , not only in America but around the world , and this distorted image of Poe has become part of the Poe legend despite attempts to dispel it . 
 = Hurricane Greta ( 1956 ) = 
 Hurricane Greta was an extremely large late @-@ season Atlantic hurricane in the 1956 Atlantic hurricane season . Originating from a tropical depression near Jamaica on October 30 , the system initially featured non @-@ tropical characteristics as it tracked northward . By November 2 , the system began producing gale @-@ force winds around the low pressure area ; however , winds near the center of circulation were calm . By November 3 , the system intensified into a tropical storm and was named Greta . Steadily strengthening , Greta attained hurricane intensity on November 4 , eventually reaching a peak intensity with 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) winds . Shortly after , Greta began to gradually weaken as it tracked over cooler waters . The storm eventually became extratropical on November 7 over the central Atlantic . Although Greta did not directly impact land as a tropical storm or hurricane , it generated large swells that impacted numerous areas . One person was killed in Puerto Rico and coastal damages from the waves amounted to roughly $ 3 @.@ 6 million ( 1956 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Greta originated out of a tropical disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Jamaica on October 30 , 1956 . A Navy reconnaissance plane recorded sustained winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and found an area of low pressure . Around this time , the system was classified as a tropical depression . Although a ship near the system discovered a cold @-@ core circulation — a feature of non @-@ tropical cyclones — it was classified as tropical . By October 31 , the depression passed near the western edge of Haiti and later crossed the eastern tip of Cuba before entering the Atlantic Ocean . By the afternoon of November 1 , the depression had moved through the central Bahamas and turned towards the northeast . 
 By this time , the central pressure of the depression had decreased to 998 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) and gale @-@ force winds were recorded over a large area , and the system was upgraded to a tropical storm that morning . The system was compared to that of a Kona low , a large @-@ scale subtropical cyclone that forms near Hawaii . Early on November 2 , the storm turned northwest in response to an area of high pressure over the central Atlantic . Later that day , the first scientific mission into a hurricane with two planes took place when two research aircraft flew into Greta . During the day , an Air Force B @-@ 50 aircraft and NHRP B @-@ 47 high altitude jet flew into the storm . The storm executed a counter @-@ clockwise loop , ending on November 3 , during which time numerous reconnaissance missions were flown into the system . By this time , the storm had also begun a southeastward track . 
 Continuing to gradually intensify , Greta attained hurricane status on November 4 and later that day it attained Category 2 status on the modern day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . After reaching this intensity , the hurricane turned northeastward and accelerated , although it did not intensify further . A reconnaissance mission around this time recorded a minimum pressure of 970 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 64 inHg ) . 
 Around the time it first reached peak intensity , Greta was an extraordinarily large hurricane , with the gale @-@ diameter of the storm extending roughly 1 @,@ 200 mi ( 1 @,@ 930 km ) . After attaining its peak intensity , the storm began to move over cooler waters , resulting in the circulation becoming elongated , however it did not weaken over the next couple days . On the morning of November 6 , Greta transitioned into an exceptionally large and intense extratropical cyclone . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Although Greta did not directly track over land as a tropical storm or hurricane , the size of the system contributed to large waves , exceeding 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) in height over a large expanse of the Atlantic . Impacts from the storm were felt as far away as the eastern United States . The National Weather Bureau warned ships in the vicinity of the system to take precautions . St. Croix was nearly isolated and stressed into an emergency due to Greta after the storm 's swells destroyed docks and prevented ships carrying food from reaching the island . Several light vessels were destroyed by Greta 's gale @-@ force winds and only schooners with little carrying capacity were able to make it to the island . Along the coast of Jacksonville , Florida alone , coastal structures sustained roughly $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( 1956 USD ; $ 9 @.@ 6 million 2009 USD ) in damages . In Puerto Rico , waves up to 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) caused significant damage and resulted in the death of one person after he did not evacuate his home . Swells up to 25 ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) were recorded in the Virgin Islands . In Guadeloupe , 80 % of the port installations were destroyed by rough seas . In all , damages from Greta amounted to roughly $ 3 @.@ 6 million ( 1956 USD ; $ 31 @.@ 3 million 2016 USD ) .

 David played squash when she was five years old , and received coaching at the age of eight . While training at the Bukit <unk> Squash Centre , David was talent spotted by Ee <unk> Hoon , who led her to represent her home state of Penang , along with her sisters . David 's squash career began in 1992 when she won silver in the Under @-@ 14 category of the Penang State Junior Championship . Her first national level victory was also in 1992 at the Milo @-@ Dunlop Sport National Junior Interstate Championship , where she won silver in the Under @-@ 16 category . In 1994 , David was chosen to join the Penang state squash team for the Malaysian Games ( SUKMA ) tournament where she helped Penang win a gold medal in the team event , despite being ill at the time . In the same year , she won her first two international titles – the Hong Kong U @-@ 13 and the Scottish Junior Open Under @-@ 12 . 
 David won the Women 's World Junior Squash Championships of 1999 in Antwerp , Belgium , making her the youngest woman to become the world junior champion at the age of 15 . In the process , she defeated three players ranked in the world top 20 . She successfully defended the title in Penang in 2001 , becoming one of only two players in the history of squash to have won it twice ; her coach was Richard Glanfield . 
 In 1999 , David began to win major junior tournaments , including the British Junior Open ( Under @-@ 17 champion ) , the German Junior Open ( Under @-@ 19 , Champion ) , the SEA Games ( Champion in the Senior and Team categories ) , and the Asian Junior Champion for both individual and team events . 
 David 's biggest win , however , was the World Junior Championships , played in Antwerp . It took just half an hour for the then 15 @-@ year @-@ old Malaysian schoolgirl to obtain world junior champion status when she beat compatriot Leong Siu Lynn 9 – 5 , 9 – 3 and 9 – 2 in the final of the women 's individual event to become the youngest ever winner of the title . David reached the quarterfinals of the previous World Junior Championships in August 1997 in Brazil , as a thirteen @-@ year @-@ old and has since claimed both the Asian junior and senior titles , as well as the gold medal in the Asian Games in December 1998 . David also is one of a few squash player to have won all the age categories in the British Junior Open .

The victory came in February , when she defeated Salma Shabana in the final of the <unk> Finnish Open with a score of 9 – 1 , 9 – 0 and 9 – 5 . Within a month , Hotel Equatorial announced its two @-@ year worldwide sponsorship for her . David also won a sponsorship on the WISPA tour by Dunlop squash . 
 In 2001 , David , who has played under Dunlop Sport sponsorship for most of her junior career and WISPA career , signed a two @-@ year deal to play with Head rackets with local conglomerate <unk> Sports . In July , David won the World Junior title for a second time , beating <unk> Abdel <unk> in just 17 minutes with a score of 9 – 2 , 9 – 4 and 9 – 2 in the final . She remained the only female squash player to have achieved this until 2007 , when Raneem El Weleily won her second World Junior Championship . David also won the individual event in the Asian Junior Squash Championships by defeating her compatriot Tricia <unk> in the final with a score of 9 – 5 , 9 – 6 and 9 – 0 ; and helped the Malaysian team to the team event title . 
 In 2002 David , together with her mixed double event partner Ong Beng Hee , won a Commonwealth Games silver medal for Malaysia after losing to Glen Wilson and Leilani <unk> in the final . Earlier in the year , David defeated Ellen Petersen of Denmark with a score of 9 – 2 , 9 – 7 , 8 – 10 , 9 – 4 to win the second Kuala Lumpur Open title of her career .

 Defeated only twice in 2005 , the 21 @-@ year @-@ old from Penang returned to her home country in July after winning the gold medal at the World Games in Germany . she then became the first local player to win the Women 's CIMB Malaysian Open Squash Championship title in the event ’ s 31 @-@ year history . In October , David proved that her success in the World Games and in the Malaysian Open was not by chance by becoming the first Malaysian to win a British Open title , the first Asian to win the women 's crown , when she beat Australia 's Natalie Grinham in the women 's final in straight games that lasted in 55 minutes . Within two months after the British Open and the World Games win , David won the World Open in Hong Kong for the first time and world number one ranking for the first time in January 2006 . Later in the year , she was voted by her fellow members of the Women 's International Squash Players Association as the WISPA Player of The Year 2005 . David became the World 's number 1 female squash player in January 2006 at the age of 23 to become the first Malaysian and the first Asian woman to be ranked World number 1 in the sport . She also became the twelfth holder of the position since the rankings were first produced in April 1983 . David started the year on a low , losing twice to Vanessa Atkinson in February , in the <unk> Open and in the Kuala Lumpur Open , both in the final . The two straight loses to Atkinson saw David 's world rank dropped to number 2 . David started to show progress later in the year and recovered from the setback to win six straight tour titles and reclaimed the World number 1 spot . David successfully defended her World Open title on 25 November 2006 , at the Ulster Hall in Belfast by defeating Natalie Grinham in the final that was said to be " one of the great finals of the Women ’ s World Open " . She became the first Malaysian athlete to win a world championship title for the second consecutive time , and the fourth person in history to retain the World Open Squash Championship . David also captured the Qatar Airways Challenge Open , the Dunlop British Open Championship , the Hong Kong Open , the Penang Open and the CIMB Malaysian Open . David topped the December WISPA ranking with a points average of almost twice that of her nearest rival , Rachael Grinham , and in the same month , in the second annual WISPA Awards , she was voted best female player of the year for the second time .

 David captured another six titles in the early months of 2007 , then lost the final of the British Open to Australian Rachael Grinham in a five set final lasting 87 minutes . A month later , David again failed to defend her World Open title when she stumbled in the second round , losing to Shelley Kitchen with a score of 0 – 9 , 1 – 9 , 9 – 2 , 9 – 3 and 6 – 9 in 69 minutes . It was the first time since April 2004 that David did not qualify for the quarters of a tournament , losing to the same person who denied her the bronze medal of the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne 9 months previously . In December , David won the inaugural Asian Sportswoman of the Year , beating more than 100 competitors who represented 25 sporting bodies . 
 In 2008 , David won ten tour titles and was unbeaten . David completed her most successful year to date , retaining her Cathay Pacific Hong Kong Open title for the third successive year in November to bring her 2008 WISPA World Tour title total to ten , extending her unbeaten Tour record since October 2007 to 53 matches . David celebrated her second full calendar year as world number one in the December Women 's World Squash Rankings thus bringing her reign at the top of women ’ s squash to 30 straight months . David 's WISPA title successes in 2008 began with the <unk> Open in New York in February , and continued with the KL Open on home soil in Malaysia , the British Open title in England , Seoul Open in Korea , Malaysian Open , the Singapore Masters , Dutch Open , World Open in England , Qatar Classic and the Hong Kong Open . Away from the tour , David secured her sixth successive biennial Asian Championship crown in February , after winning the first in July 1998 when aged just 14 , and then lead Malaysia to the bronze medal in the Women 's World Team Championship in Cairo .

 With a lead over her nearest rival , she led in the Women 's World Squash Rankings published on 1 January 2009 by the Women 's International Squash Players ' Association ( WISPA ) – thus moving into her 30th successive month as the world ’ s number one female player . David headed an unchanged top four , with Natalie Grinham ( Netherlands ) at No. 2 ; her older sister Rachael Grinham ( Australia ) at No. 3 ; and Natalie Grainger , of the United States , at No. 4 . In her first tournament of the year , the Kuala Lumpur Open , David 's 17 @-@ month , 56 @-@ match winning run was brought to an end when she lost to Natalie Grainger in the final . After the defeat , David recovered to capture the inaugural Cayman Islands Open . She managed to avenge her loss to Grainger early in the year by beating her 11 – 8 , 11 – 6 and 11 – 5 in the final . It is her 35th tour crown and her 50th appearance in a WISPA Tour final . A week later , David went on to win her second title of the year by again dispatching Grainger , this time in four sets . 
 Twenty @-@ one days after winning the Texas Open title , David captured her second Seoul City Open crown by defeating Jenny Duncalf in four sets . A month later , on 24 July , she retained her World Games women 's singles title with a win over arch rival Natalie Grinham of the Netherlands in straight sets . A week later , on 1 August , David picked up her fifth consecutive Malaysian Open title , winning 11 – 6 , 11 – 8 , 9 – 11 , 11 – 7 in a 60 @-@ minute match against 25 @-@ year @-@ old Londoner , Alison Waters . David thus became the first player to win five Malaysian Open titles in a row since its inception in 1975 . 
 Dominating on the squash courts , David beat Natalie Grinham to win her third consecutive Singapore Masters championship , and her third title within a month . She overcame Natalie in three sets with a score of 11 – 9 , 11 – 8 and 11 – 9 for her fifth WISPA title of the year . David celebrated another milestone in her squash career by moving into her 41st month as world number one in the September Women 's World Rankings thus surpassing her mentor Sarah Fitz @-@ Gerald as the player with the third longest ever reign at the top of the women 's rankings . On 12 September , David lost to Madeline Perry in the British Open quarter @-@ final in a five set match that lasted for 76 minutes ; 15 days later , she recovered to defeat arch @-@ rival Natalie Grinham in the final of the World Open Championship , obtaining the title for a record fourth time . David ended the year on a low when she lost in the semis to Jenny Duncalf in both the Qatar Classic and the US Open , the former ending in five sets . 
 David started 2010 ranked number 1 for the 42nd consecutive month . She appeared in the WISPA calendar for the month of January . David competed in her first tournament in March , the US $ 53 @,@ 000 Chennai Open ; she won all her matches in straight sets and was crowned as the champion , avenging two straight defeats to Jenny Duncalf in late 2009 . Thirteen days later , in the Kuala Lumpur Open , David defeated the fourth seeded Egyptian <unk> Abdel <unk> who upset second seed Jenny Duncalf in the semi @-@ finals in straight sets to win her second successive WISPA title of the year . It was David 's sixth title in the Kuala Lumpur Open tournament as she had previously won it in 2000 , 2002 , 2005 , 2007 and 2008 . 
 David had won five more tour titles since April . This include winning the " prestigious " World Open title on 22 September . The World Open win was David fifth thus equalling Sarah Fitz @-@ Gerald 's record for the most times World Open win . In October , in the women 's singles final of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi , David defeated Jenny Duncalf 11 – 3 , 11 – 5 , 11 – 7 in 40 minutes to win the gold medal . David did not drop a game in the entire tournament , just as she did in the 2010 World Open in Egypt . 
 Nicol David added another feather to her cap , becoming the first player – male or female – to win the US Open for the third straight year . The 31 @-@ year @-@ old Nicol , a seven @-@ time world champion and five @-@ time British Open winner , exacted sweet revenge over Egyptian teenager Nour El Sherbini to win the US $ 115 @,@ 000 ( <unk> ) tournament in Philadelphia .

 Baseball is a bat @-@ and @-@ ball game played between two teams of nine players each , who take turns batting and fielding . 
 The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter , then running counter @-@ clockwise around a series of four bases : first , second , third , and home plate . A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate . 
 Players on the batting team take turns hitting against the pitcher of the fielding team , which tries to prevent runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways . A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during teammates ' turns batting , such as on a hit or by other means . The teams switch between batting and fielding whenever the fielding team records three outs . One turn batting for both teams , beginning with the visiting team , constitutes an inning . A game is composed of nine innings , and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins . Baseball has no game clock , although almost all games end in the ninth inning . 
 Baseball evolved from older bat @-@ and @-@ ball games already being played in England by the mid @-@ 18th century . This game was brought by immigrants to North America , where the modern version developed . By the late 19th century , baseball was widely recognized as the national sport of the United States . Baseball is now popular in North America and parts of Central and South America , the Caribbean , and East Asia . 
 In the United States and Canada , professional Major League Baseball ( MLB ) teams are divided into the National League ( NL ) and American League ( AL ) , each with three divisions : East , West , and Central . The major league champion is determined by playoffs that culminate in the World Series . The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the Central and Pacific Leagues and in Cuba between the West League and East League .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The evolution of baseball from older bat @-@ and @-@ ball games is difficult to trace with precision . A French manuscript from 1344 contains an illustration of clerics playing a game , possibly la soule , with similarities to baseball . Other old French games such as <unk> , la <unk> au <unk> , and la <unk> <unk> also appear to be related . Consensus once held that today 's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders , popular in Great Britain and Ireland . Baseball Before We Knew It : A Search for the Roots of the Game ( 2005 ) , by David Block , suggests that the game originated in England ; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position . Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other , and that the game 's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and " tut @-@ ball . " It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games , though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders . 
 The earliest known reference to baseball is in a 1744 British publication , A Little Pretty Pocket @-@ Book , by John Newbery . It contains a rhymed description of " base @-@ ball " and a woodcut that shows a field set @-@ up somewhat similar to the modern game — though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration , and with posts instead of ground @-@ level bases . David Block discovered that the first recorded game of " Bass @-@ Ball " took place in 1749 in Surrey , and featured the Prince of Wales as a player . William Bray , an English lawyer , recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford , Surrey . This early form of the game was apparently brought to Canada by English immigrants . Rounders was also brought to the USA by Canadians of both British and Irish ancestry . The first known American reference to baseball appears in a 1791 Pittsfield , Massachusetts , town bylaw prohibiting the playing of the game near the town 's new meeting house . By 1796 , a version of the game was well @-@ known enough to earn a mention in a German scholar 's book on popular pastimes . As described by Johann <unk> , " <unk> Base @-@ ball " involved a contest between two teams , in which " the batter has three attempts to hit the ball while at the home plate . " Only one out was required to retire a side . 
 By the early 1830s , there were reports of a variety of uncodified bat @-@ and @-@ ball games recognizable as early forms of baseball being played around North America . These games were often referred to locally as " town ball " , though other names such as " round @-@ ball " and " base @-@ ball " were also used . Among the earliest examples to receive a detailed description — albeit five decades after the fact , in a letter from an attendee to Sporting Life magazine — took place in <unk> , Ontario , in 1838 . There were many similarities to modern baseball , and some crucial differences : five bases ( or byes ) ; first bye just 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) from the home bye ; batter out if a hit ball was caught after the first bounce . The once widely accepted story that Abner Doubleday invented baseball in Cooperstown , New York , in 1839 has been conclusively debunked by sports historians . 
 In 1845 , Alexander Cartwright , a member of New York City 's Knickerbocker Club , led the codification of the so @-@ called Knickerbocker Rules . The practice , common to bat @-@ and @-@ ball games of the day , of " soaking " or " plugging " — effecting a putout by hitting a runner with a thrown ball — was barred . The rules thus facilitated the use of a smaller , harder ball than had been common . Several other rules also brought the Knickerbockers ' game close to the modern one , though a ball caught on the first bounce was , again , an out and only underhand pitching was allowed . While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845 , the contest long recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19 , 1846 , in Hoboken , New Jersey : the " New York Nine " defeated the Knickerbockers , 23 – 1 , in four innings ( three earlier games have recently been discovered ) . With the Knickerbocker code as the basis , the rules of modern baseball continued to evolve over the next half @-@ century .

 In the mid @-@ 1850s , a baseball craze hit the New York metropolitan area . By 1856 , local journals were referring to baseball as the " national pastime " or " national game . " A year later , sixteen area clubs formed the sport 's first governing body , the National Association of Base Ball Players . In 1858 in Corona , Queens New York , at the Fashion Race Course , the first games of baseball to charge admission took place . The games , which took place between the all stars of Brooklyn , including players from the Brooklyn Atlantics , Excelsior of Brooklyn , <unk> and <unk> of Brooklyn , and the All Stars of New York ( Manhattan ) , including players from the New York Knickerbockers , <unk> ( predecessors of the San Francisco Giants ) , Eagles and Empire , are commonly believed to be the first all @-@ star baseball games . In 1863 , the organization disallowed putouts made by catching a fair ball on the first bounce . Four years later , it barred participation by African Americans . The game 's commercial potential was developing : in 1869 the first fully professional baseball club , the Cincinnati Red Stockings , was formed and went undefeated against a schedule of semipro and amateur teams . The first professional league , the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , lasted from 1871 to 1875 ; scholars dispute its status as a major league . 
 The more formally structured National League was founded in 1876 . As the oldest surviving major league , the National League is sometimes referred to as the " senior circuit . " Several other major leagues formed and failed . In 1884 , African American Moses Walker ( and , briefly , his brother <unk> ) played in one of these , the American Association . An injury ended Walker 's major league career , and by the early 1890s , a gentlemen 's agreement in the form of the baseball color line effectively barred black players from the white @-@ owned professional leagues , major and minor . Professional Negro leagues formed , but quickly folded . Several independent African American teams succeeded as <unk> . Also in 1884 , overhand pitching was legalized . In 1887 , softball , under the name of indoor baseball or indoor @-@ outdoor , was invented as a winter version of the parent game . Virtually all of the modern baseball rules were in place by 1893 ; the last major change — counting foul balls as strikes — was instituted in 1901 . The National League 's first successful counterpart , the American League , which evolved from the minor Western League , was established that year . The two leagues , each with eight teams , were rivals that fought for the best players , often disregarding each other 's contracts and engaging in bitter legal disputes . 
 A modicum of peace was eventually established , leading to the National Agreement of 1903 . The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues , representing most of the country 's minor professional leagues . The World Series , pitting the two major league champions against each other , was inaugurated that fall , albeit without express major league sanction : The Boston Americans of the American League defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates of the National League . The next year , the series was not held , as the National League champion New York Giants , under manager John McGraw , refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion . In 1905 , the Giants were National League champions again and team management relented , leading to the establishment of the World Series as the major leagues ' annual championship event . 
 As professional baseball became increasingly profitable , players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues of control and equitable income distribution . During the major leagues ' early decades , players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes , which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened . In general , the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause , which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended , tended to keep the players in check . Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers ' payoffs , real and promised , members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series . The Black Sox Scandal led to the formation of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together . The first major league baseball commissioner , Kenesaw Mountain Landis , was elected in 1920 . That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League ; the first significant Negro league , it would operate until 1931 . For part of the 1920s , it was joined by the Eastern Colored League . 
 Professional baseball was played in northeastern cities with a large immigrant @-@ ethnic population ; they gave strong support to the new sport . The Irish Catholics dominated in the late 19th century , comprising a third or more of the players and many of the top stars and managers . Historian Jerrold <unk> argues that : 
 Baseball for Irish kids was a shortcut to the American dream and to self @-@ indulgent glory and fortune . By the mid @-@ 1880s these young Irish men dominated the sport and popularized a style of play that was termed heady , daring , and spontaneous .... Ed Delahanty personified the flamboyant , exciting spectator @-@ favorite , the Casey @-@ at @-@ the @-@ bat , Irish slugger . The handsome masculine athlete who is expected to live as large as he played . 
 = = = = Rise of Ruth and racial integration = = = = 
 Compared with the present , professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower @-@ scoring and pitchers , the likes of Walter Johnson and Christy Mathewson , were more dominant . The " inside game , " which demanded that players " scratch for runs " , was played much more aggressively than it is today : the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this style . The so @-@ called dead @-@ ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters . Strict new regulations governing the ball 's size , shape and composition along with a new rule officially banning the spitball , along with other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed @-@ up with foreign substances after the death of Ray Chapman who was hit by a pitch in August 1920 , coupled with superior materials available after World War I , resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit . The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of bringing the outfield fences closer in , making home runs more common . The rise of the legendary player Babe Ruth , the first great power hitter of the new era , helped permanently alter the nature of the game . The club with which Ruth set most of his slugging records , the New York Yankees , built a reputation as the majors ' premier team . In the late 1920s and early 1930s , St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern " farm system " . A new Negro National League was organized in 1933 ; four years later , it was joined by the Negro American League . The first elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame took place in 1936 . In 1939 Little League Baseball was founded in Pennsylvania . By the late 1940s , it was the organizing body for children 's baseball leagues across the United States . 
 With America 's entry into World War II , many professional players had left to serve in the armed forces . A large number of minor league teams disbanded as a result and the major league game seemed under threat as well . Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley led the formation of a new professional league with women players to help keep the game in the public eye – the All @-@ American Girls Professional Baseball League existed from 1943 to 1954 . The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947 , and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded . This program soon became another important organizing body for children 's baseball . The first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white @-@ controlled professional ball occurred the previous year : Jackie Robinson was signed by the National League 's Brooklyn Dodgers — where Branch Rickey had become general manager — and began playing for their minor league team in Montreal . In 1947 , Robinson broke the major leagues ' color barrier when he debuted with the Dodgers . Larry Doby debuted with the American League 's Cleveland Indians the same year . Latin American players , largely overlooked before , also started entering the majors in greater numbers . In 1951 , two Chicago White Sox , Venezuelan @-@ born Chico Carrasquel and black Cuban @-@ born Minnie Miñoso , became the first Hispanic All @-@ Stars . 
 Facing competition as varied as television and football , baseball attendance at all levels declined . While the majors rebounded by the mid @-@ 1950s , the minor leagues were gutted and hundreds of semipro and amateur teams dissolved . Integration proceeded slowly : by 1953 , only six of the 16 major league teams had a black player on the roster . That year , the Major League Baseball Players Association was founded . It was the first professional baseball union to survive more than briefly , but it remained largely ineffective for years . No major league team had been located west of St. Louis until 1958 , when the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants relocated to Los Angeles and San Francisco , respectively . The majors ' final all @-@ white bastion , the Boston Red Sox , added a black player in 1959 . With the integration of the majors drying up the available pool of players , the last Negro league folded the following year . In 1961 , the American League reached the West Coast with the | Los Angeles Angels expansion team , and the major league season was extended from 154 games to 162 . This coincidentally helped Roger Maris break Babe Ruth 's long @-@ standing single @-@ season home run record , one of the most celebrated marks in baseball . Along with the Angels , three other new franchises were launched during 1961 – 62 . With this , the first major league expansion in 60 years , each league now had ten teams .

 The players ' union became bolder under the leadership of former United Steelworkers chief economist and negotiator Marvin Miller , who was elected executive director in 1966 . On the playing field , major league pitchers were becoming increasingly dominant again . After the 1968 season , in an effort to restore balance , the strike zone was reduced and the height of the pitcher 's mound was lowered from 15 to 10 inches . In 1969 , both the National and American leagues added two more expansion teams , the leagues were reorganized into two divisions each , and a post @-@ season playoff system leading to the World Series was instituted . Also that same year , Curt Flood of the St. Louis Cardinals made the first serious legal challenge to the reserve clause . The major leagues ' first general players ' strike took place in 1972 . In another effort to add more offense to the game , the American League adopted the designated hitter rule the following year . In 1975 , the union 's power — and players ' salaries — began to increase greatly when the reserve clause was effectively struck down , leading to the free agency system . In 1977 , two more expansion teams joined the American League . Significant work stoppages occurred again in 1981 and 1994 , the latter forcing the cancellation of the World Series for the first time in 90 years . Attendance had been growing steadily since the mid @-@ 1970s and in 1994 , before the stoppage , the majors were setting their all @-@ time record for per @-@ game attendance . 
 The addition of two more expansion teams after the 1993 season had facilitated another restructuring of the major leagues , this time into three divisions each . Offensive production — the number of home runs in particular — had surged that year , and again in the abbreviated 1994 season . After play resumed in 1995 , this trend continued and non @-@ division @-@ winning wild card teams became a permanent fixture of the post @-@ season . Regular @-@ season interleague play was introduced in 1997 and the second @-@ highest attendance mark for a full season was set . The next year , Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa both surpassed Maris 's decades @-@ old single season home run record and two more expansion franchises were added . In 2000 , the National and American leagues were dissolved as legal entities . While their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes ( and the designated hitter distinction ) , the regulations and other functions — such as player discipline and umpire supervision — they had administered separately were consolidated under the rubric of Major League Baseball ( MLB ) . 
 In 2001 , Barry Bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season . There had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids ( as well as by the dilution of pitching talent due to expansion ) , but the issue only began attracting significant media attention in 2002 and there was no penalty for the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs before 2004 . In 2007 , Bonds became MLB 's all @-@ time home run leader , surpassing Hank Aaron , as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all @-@ time highs . Even though McGwire , Sosa , and Bonds — as well as many other players , including storied pitcher Roger Clemens — have been implicated in the steroid abuse scandal , their feats and those of other sluggers had become the major leagues ' defining attraction . In contrast to the professional game 's resurgence in popularity after the 1994 interruption , Little League enrollment was in decline : after peaking in 1996 , it dropped 1 percent a year over the following decade . With more rigorous testing and penalties for performance @-@ enhancing drug use a possible factor , the balance between bat and ball swung markedly in 2010 , which became known as the " Year of the Pitcher " . Runs per game fell to their lowest level in 18 years , and the strikeout rate was higher than it had been in half a century . 
 Before the start of the 2012 season , MLB altered its rules to double the number of wild card teams admitted into the playoffs to two per league . The playoff expansion resulted in the addition of annual one @-@ game playoffs between the wild card teams in each league . 
 = = = Baseball around the world = = = 
 Baseball , widely known as America 's pastime , is well established in several other countries as well . The history of baseball in Canada has remained closely linked with that of the sport in the United States . As early as 1877 , a professional league , the International Association , featured teams from both countries . While baseball is widely played in Canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country , the American major leagues did not include a Canadian club until 1969 , when the Montreal Expos joined the National League as an expansion team . In 1977 , the expansion Toronto Blue Jays joined the American League . The Blue Jays won the World Series in 1992 and 1993 , the first and still the only club from outside the United States to do so . After the 2004 season , Major League Baseball relocated the Expos to Washington , D.C. , where the team is now known as the Nationals . 
 In 1847 , American soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in Mexico at Parque Los <unk> in Xalapa , Veracruz . A few days after the Battle of Cerro Gordo , they used the " wooden leg captured ( by the Fourth Illinois regiment ) from General Santa Anna " . The first formal baseball league outside of the United States and Canada was founded in 1878 in Cuba , which maintains a rich baseball tradition and whose national team has been one of the world 's strongest since international play began in the late 1930s ( all organized baseball in the country has officially been amateur since the Cuban Revolution ) . The Dominican Republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912 . Professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars , including the Netherlands ( formed in 1922 ) , Australia ( 1934 ) , Japan ( 1936 ) , Mexico ( 1937 ) , and Puerto Rico ( 1938 ) . The Japanese major leagues — the Central League and Pacific League — have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the United States . Japan has a professional minor league system as well , though it is much smaller than the American version — each team has only one farm club in contrast to MLB teams ' four or five . 
 After World War II , professional leagues were founded in many Latin American nations , most prominently Venezuela ( 1946 ) and the Dominican Republic ( 1955 ) . Since the early 1970s , the annual Caribbean Series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading Latin American winter leagues : the Dominican Professional Baseball League , Mexican Pacific League , Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League , and Venezuelan Professional Baseball League . In Asia , South Korea ( 1982 ) , Taiwan ( 1990 ) , and China ( 2003 ) all have professional leagues . 
 Many European countries have professional leagues as well , the most successful , other than the Dutch league , being the Italian league founded in 1948 . Compared to those in Asia and Latin America , the various European leagues and the one in Australia historically have had no more than niche appeal . In 2004 , Australia won a surprise silver medal at the Olympic Games . The Israel Baseball League , launched in 2007 , folded after one season . The Confédération <unk> de Baseball ( European Baseball Confederation ) , founded in 1953 , organizes a number of competitions between clubs from different countries , as well as national squads . Other competitions between national teams , such as the Baseball World Cup and the Olympic baseball tournament , were administered by the International Baseball Federation ( IBAF ) from its formation in 1938 until its 2013 merger with the International Softball Federation to create the current joint governing body for both sports , the World Baseball Softball Confederation ( <unk> ) . By 2009 , the IBAF had 117 member countries . Women 's baseball is played on an organized amateur basis in many of the countries where it is a leading men 's sport . Since 2004 , the IBAF and now <unk> have sanctioned the Women 's Baseball World Cup , featuring national teams . 
 After being admitted to the Olympics as a medal sport beginning with the 1992 Games , baseball was dropped from the 2012 Summer Olympic Games at the 2005 International Olympic Committee meeting . It remained part of the 2008 Games . The elimination of baseball , along with softball , from the 2012 Olympic program enabled the IOC to consider adding two different sports , but none received the votes required for inclusion . While the sport 's lack of a following in much of the world was a factor , more important was Major League Baseball 's reluctance to have a break during the Games to allow its players to participate , as the National Hockey League now does during the Winter Olympic Games . Such a break is more difficult for MLB to accommodate because it would force the playoffs deeper into cold weather . Seeking reinstatement for the 2016 Summer Olympics , the IBAF proposed an abbreviated competition designed to facilitate the participation of top players , but the effort failed . Major League Baseball initiated the World Baseball Classic , scheduled to precede the major league season , partly as a replacement , high @-@ profile international tournament . The inaugural Classic , held in March 2006 , was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of MLB participants . The Baseball World Cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic . 
 = = Rules and gameplay = = 
 A game is played between two teams , each composed of nine players , that take turns playing offense ( batting and baserunning ) and defense ( pitching and fielding ) . A pair of turns , one at bat and one in the field , by each team constitutes an inning . A game consists of nine innings ( seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues ) . One team — customarily the visiting team — bats in the top , or first half , of every inning . The other team — customarily the home team — bats in the bottom , or second half , of every inning . The goal of the game is to score more points ( runs ) than the other team . The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square @-@ shaped baseball diamond . A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base , second base , third base , and back home in order to score a run . The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs , which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team 's batting order comes up again . When three outs are recorded , the teams switch roles for the next half @-@ inning . If the score of the game is tied after nine innings , extra innings are played to resolve the contest . Many amateur games , particularly unorganized ones , involve different numbers of players and innings . 
 The game is played on a field whose primary boundaries , the foul lines , extend forward from home plate at 45 @-@ degree angles . The 90 @-@ degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory ; the 270 @-@ degree area outside them is foul territory . The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield ; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield . In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher 's mound , with a rectangular rubber plate ( the rubber ) at its center . The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence , which may be of any material and height ( many amateur games are played on unfenced fields ) . Fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball 's field of play , though significant events can take place in foul territory , as well . 
 There are three basic tools of baseball : the ball , the bat , and the glove or mitt : 
 The baseball is about the size of an adult 's fist , around 9 inches ( 23 centimeters ) in circumference . It has a rubber or cork center , wound in yarn and covered in white cowhide , with red stitching . 
 The bat is a hitting tool , traditionally made of a single , solid piece of wood . Other materials are now commonly used for nonprofessional games . It is a hard round stick , about 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 6 @.@ 4 centimeters ) in diameter at the hitting end , tapering to a narrower handle and culminating in a knob . Bats used by adults are typically around 34 inches ( 86 centimeters ) long , and not longer than 42 inches ( 106 centimeters ) . 
 The glove or mitt is a fielding tool , made of padded leather with webbing between the fingers . As an aid in catching and holding onto the ball , it takes various shapes to meet the specific needs of different fielding positions . 
 Protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters . 
 At the beginning of each half @-@ inning , the nine players on the fielding team arrange themselves around the field . One of them , the pitcher , stands on the pitcher 's mound . The pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber , pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate . Another player , the catcher , squats on the far side of home plate , facing the pitcher . The rest of the team faces home plate , typically arranged as four infielders — who set up along or within a few yards outside the imaginary lines between first , second , and third base — and three outfielders . In the standard arrangement , there is a first baseman positioned several steps to the left of first base , a second baseman to the right of second base , a shortstop to the left of second base , and a third baseman to the right of third base . The basic outfield positions are left fielder , center fielder , and right fielder . A neutral umpire sets up behind the catcher . Other umpires will be distributed around the field as well , though the number will vary depending on the level of play , amateur or children 's games may only have an umpire behind the plate , while as many as six umpires can be used for important Major League Baseball games . 
 Play starts with a batter standing at home plate , holding a bat . The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch ( the ball ) toward home plate , and attempts to hit the ball with the bat . The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit — as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect — and returns them to the pitcher . A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base , at which point the player is referred to as a runner ( or , until the play is over , a batter @-@ runner ) . A batter @-@ runner who reaches first base without being put out ( see below ) is said to be safe and is now on base . A batter @-@ runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond — however far the player believes can be reached safely . A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit . A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single . If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit , it is a double ; third base , a triple . If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield ( and outfield fence , if there is one ) , it is a home run : the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases , each scoring a run . This is the most desirable result for the batter . A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit — instead , the responsible fielder is charged with an error . 
 Any runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land , or contact the ground , in fair territory , before or after the ball lands . A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play . If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield , it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began . If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands , the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began , as or after the ball is caught . Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate — a successful effort is a stolen base . 
 A pitch that is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball . A batter against whom three strikes are recorded strikes out . A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk , a free advance to first base . ( A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter 's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone , provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit . ) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire 's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone , a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter 's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee . 
 A strike is called when one of the following happens : 
 The batter lets a well @-@ pitched ball ( one within the strike zone ) go through to the catcher . 
 The batter swings at any ball ( even one outside the strike zone ) and misses , or foul tips it directly into the catcher 's hands . 
 The batter hits a foul ball — one that either initially lands in foul territory or initially lands within the diamond but moves into foul territory before passing first or third base . If there are already two strikes on the batter , a foul ball is not counted as a third strike ; thus , a foul ball cannot result in the immediate strikeout of the batter . ( There is an exception to this exception : a two @-@ strike foul bunt is recorded as a third strike . ) 
 A ball is called when the pitcher throws a pitch that is outside the strike zone , provided the batter has not swung at it . 
 While the team at bat is trying to score runs , the team in the field is attempting to record outs . Among the various ways a member of the batting team may be put out , five are most common : 
 The strikeout : as described above , recorded against a batter who makes three strikes before putting the ball into play or being awarded a free advance to first base ( see also uncaught third strike ) . 
 The <unk> : as described above , recorded against a batter who hits a ball in the air that is caught by a fielder , whether in fair territory or foul territory , before it lands , whether or not the batter has run . 
 The ground out : recorded against a batter ( in this case , batter @-@ runner ) who hits a ball that lands in fair territory which , before the batter @-@ runner can reach first base , is retrieved by a fielder who touches first base while holding the ball or relays it to another fielder who touches first base while holding the ball . 
 The force out : recorded against a runner who is required to attempt to advance — either because the runner is on first base and a batted ball lands in fair territory , or because the runner immediately behind on the <unk> is thus required to attempt to advance — but fails to reach the next base before a fielder touches the base while holding the ball . The ground out is technically a special case of the force out . 
 The tag out : recorded against a runner who is touched by a fielder with the ball or a glove holding the ball , while the runner is not touching a base . 
 It is possible to record two outs in the course of the same play — a double play . Even three — a triple play — is possible , though this is very rare . Players put out or retired must leave the field , returning to their team 's dugout or bench . A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team . Stranded runners do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat — every half @-@ inning begins with the bases empty of runners . 
 An individual player 's turn batting or plate appearance is complete when the player reaches base , hits a home run , makes an out , or hits a ball that results in the team 's third out , even if it is recorded against a teammate . On rare occasions , a batter may be at the plate when , without the batter 's hitting the ball , a third out is recorded against a teammate — for instance , a runner getting caught stealing ( tagged out attempting to steal a base ) . A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team 's next turn batting ; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased . A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn . Once a player has completed a plate appearance , that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player 's team have all taken their turn at bat . The batting order is set before the game begins , and may not be altered except for substitutions . Once a player has been removed for a substitute , that player may not reenter the game . Children 's games often have more liberal substitution rules . 
 If the designated hitter ( DH ) rule is in effect , each team has a tenth player whose sole responsibility is to bat ( and run ) . The DH takes the place of another player — almost invariably the pitcher — in the batting order , but does not field . Thus , even with the DH , each team still has a batting order of nine players and a fielding arrangement of nine players . 
 = = Personnel = = 
 = = = Player rosters = = = 
 Roster , or squad , sizes differ between different leagues and different levels of organized play . Major League Baseball teams maintain 25 @-@ player active rosters . A typical 25 @-@ man roster in a league without the DH rule , such as MLB 's National League , features : 
 eight position players — catcher , four infielders , three outfielders — who play on a regular basis 
 five starting pitchers who constitute the team 's pitching rotation or starting rotation 
 six relief pitchers , including one specialist closer , who constitute the team 's bullpen ( named for the off @-@ field area where pitchers warm up ) 
 one backup , or substitute , catcher 
 two backup infielders 
 two backup outfielders 
 one specialist pinch hitter , or a second backup catcher , or a seventh reliever 
 In the American League and others with the DH rule , there will usually be nine offensive regulars ( including the DH ) , five starting pitchers , seven or eight relievers , a backup catcher and two or three other reserves ; the need for late inning pinch @-@ hitters ( usually in the pitcher 's spot ) is reduced by the DH . 
 = = = Other personnel = = = 
 The manager , or head coach of a team , oversees the team 's major strategic decisions , such as establishing the starting rotation , setting the lineup , or batting order , before each game , and making substitutions during games — in particular , bringing in relief pitchers . Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches ; they may have specialized responsibilities , such as working with players on hitting , fielding , pitching , or strength and conditioning . At most levels of organized play , two coaches are stationed on the field when the team is at bat : the first base coach and third base coach , occupying designated coaches ' boxes just outside the foul lines , assist in the direction of baserunners when the ball is in play , and relay tactical signals from the manager to batters and runners during pauses in play . In contrast to many other team sports , baseball managers and coaches generally wear their team 's uniforms ; coaches must be in uniform in order to be allowed on the playing field during a game . 
 Any baseball game involves one or more umpires , who make rulings on the outcome of each play . At a minimum , one umpire will stand behind the catcher , to have a good view of the strike zone , and call balls and strikes . Additional umpires may be stationed near the other bases , thus making it easier to judge plays such as attempted force outs and tag outs . In Major League Baseball , four umpires are used for each game , one near each base . In the playoffs , six umpires are used : one at each base and two in the outfield along the foul lines . 
 = = Strategy and tactics = = 
 Many of the pre @-@ game and in @-@ game strategic decisions in baseball revolve around a fundamental fact : in general , right @-@ handed batters tend to be more successful against left @-@ handed pitchers and , to an even greater degree , left @-@ handed batters tend to be more successful against right @-@ handed pitchers . A manager with several left @-@ handed batters in the regular lineup who knows the team will be facing a left @-@ handed starting pitcher may respond by starting one or more of the right @-@ handed backups on the team 's roster . During the late innings of a game , as relief pitchers and pinch hitters are brought in , the opposing managers will often go back and forth trying to create favorable matchups with their substitutions : the manager of the fielding team trying to arrange same @-@ handed pitcher @-@ batter matchups , the manager of the batting team trying to arrange opposite @-@ handed matchups . With a team that has the lead in the late innings , a manager may remove a starting position player — especially one whose turn at bat is not likely to come up again — for a more skillful fielder . 
 = = = Pitching and fielding tactics = = = 
 The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection . By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner , and by throwing it at a certain speed , pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side , or downward , as it approaches the batter . Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown , the four basic types are the fastball , the changeup ( or off @-@ speed pitch ) , and two breaking balls — the curveball and the slider . Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing . Conventionally , before each pitch , the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw , as well as its general vertical and / or horizontal location . If there is disagreement on the selection , the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch . With a runner on base and taking a lead , the pitcher may attempt a pickoff , a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner 's lead in check or , optimally , effect a tag out . <unk> attempts , however , are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher 's movements before and during the pickoff attempt . Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher , with the result being runners on base , if any , advance one base with impunity . If an attempted stolen base is anticipated , the catcher may call for a <unk> , a ball thrown deliberately off the plate , allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base . Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field , the fielding team may employ a shift , with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions . With a runner on third base , the infielders may play in , moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball , though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn @-@ in infield . 
 = = = Batting and baserunning tactics = = = 
 Several basic offensive tactics come into play with a runner on first base , including the fundamental choice of whether to attempt a steal of second base . The hit and run is sometimes employed with a skillful contact hitter : the runner takes off with the pitch drawing the shortstop or second baseman over to second base , creating a gap in the infield for the batter to poke the ball through . The sacrifice bunt calls for the batter to focus on making contact with the ball so that it rolls a short distance into the infield , allowing the runner to advance into scoring position even at the expense of the batter being thrown out at first — a batter who succeeds is credited with a sacrifice . ( A batter , particularly one who is a fast runner , may also attempt to bunt for a hit . ) A sacrifice bunt employed with a runner on third base , aimed at bringing that runner home , is known as a squeeze play . With a runner on third and fewer than two outs , a batter may instead concentrate on hitting a fly ball that , even if it is caught , will be deep enough to allow the runner to tag up and score — a successful batter in this case gets credit for a sacrifice fly . The manager will sometimes signal a batter who is ahead in the count ( i.e. , has more balls than strikes ) to take , or not swing at , the next pitch . 
 = = Distinctive elements = = 
 Baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following , including American and Canadian football , basketball , ice hockey , and soccer . All of these sports use a clock ; in all of them , play is less individual and more collective ; and in none of them is the variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important . The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball 's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports . 
 = = = No clock to kill = = = 
 In clock @-@ limited sports , games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team . In contrast , baseball has no clock ; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time . At almost any turn in any baseball game , the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy . In contrast , again , the clock comes into play even in the case of multi @-@ day Test and first @-@ class cricket : the possibility of a draw often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind to bat defensively , giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss . Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting . 
 While nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball , the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years . At the turn of the 20th century , games typically took an hour and a half to play . In the 1920s , they averaged just less than two hours , which eventually ballooned to 2 : 38 in 1960 . By 1997 , the average American League game lasted 2 : 57 ( National League games were about 10 minutes shorter — pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters ) . In 2004 , Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of merely 2 : 45 . By 2014 , though , the average MLB game took over three hours to complete . The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half @-@ innings for television commercials , increased offense , more pitching changes , and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery , and batters stepping out of the box more frequently . Other leagues have experienced similar issues . In 2008 , Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade 's average of 3 : 18 . 
 = = = Individual focus = = = 
 Although baseball is a team sport , individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure . In 1915 , a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch , of which there are often more than two hundred in a game , involves an individual , one @-@ on @-@ one contest : " the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits " . Contrasting the game with both football and basketball , scholar Michael Mandelbaum argues that " baseball is the one closest in evolutionary descent to the older individual sports " . Pitcher , batter , and fielder all act essentially independent of each other . While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics , the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts . If the batter hits a line drive , the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing . The statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it . As described by Mandelbaum , 
 It is impossible to isolate and objectively assess the contribution each [ football ] team member makes to the outcome of the play ... [ E ] very basketball player is interacting with all of his teammates all the time . In baseball , by contrast , every player is more or less on his own ... Baseball is therefore a realm of complete transparency and total responsibility . A baseball player lives in a glass house , and in a stark moral universe ... Everything that every player does is accounted for and everything accounted for is either good or bad , right or wrong . 
 Cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard : while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running , it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more . There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play . 
 = = = Uniqueness of each baseball park = = = 
 Unlike those of most sports , baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape . While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated , the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams following the rules of Major League and Minor League Baseball is that fields built or remodeled since June 1 , 1958 , must have a minimum distance of 325 feet ( 99 m ) from home plate to the fences in left and right field and 400 feet ( 122 m ) to center . Major league teams often skirt even this rule . For example , at Minute Maid Park , which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000 , the Crawford Boxes in left field are only 315 feet ( 96 m ) from home plate . There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield . The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left @-@ field wall at Boston 's Fenway Park , in use since 1912 : the Green Monster is 310 feet ( 94 m ) from home plate down the line and 37 feet ( 11 m ) tall . 
 Similarly , there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory . Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands , but a <unk> in a park with more expansive foul ground . A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders , while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions , as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner . These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside @-@ the @-@ park home run . The surface of the field is also unregulated . While the image to the left shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement ( and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields ) , teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare . Some fields — including several in MLB — use an artificial surface , such as AstroTurf . Surface variations can have a significant effect on how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning . Similarly , the presence of a roof ( seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs ) can greatly affect how fly balls are played . While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering , the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized . The area out @-@ of @-@ bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does , so variations in that regard are largely insignificant . 
 These physical variations create a distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark . Other local factors , such as altitude and climate , can also significantly affect play . A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher 's park or a hitter 's park , if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements . The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field , home of the Colorado Rockies . Its high altitude — 5 @,@ 282 feet ( 1 @,@ 610 m ) above sea level — is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter 's park effect in the major leagues . Wrigley Field , home of the Chicago Cubs , is known for its fickle disposition : a hitter 's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out , it becomes more of a pitcher 's park when they are blowing in . The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out , but the nature of team rosters and players ' statistical records . For example , hitting a fly ball 330 feet ( 100 m ) into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park , and a home run at another . A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field , such as the New York Yankees , will tend to stock its roster with left @-@ handed pull hitters , who can best exploit it . On the individual level , a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter 's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time — even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park . 
 = = Statistics = = 
 Organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports . Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes . In the late 19th century , a former cricket player , English @-@ born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn , New York , was responsible for the " development of the box score , tabular standings , the annual baseball guide , the batting average , and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball . " The statistical record is so central to the game 's " historical essence " that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball . In the 1920s , American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics , initiating what journalist and historian Alan Schwarz describes as a " tectonic shift in sports , as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines . " 
 The Official Baseball Rules administered by Major League Baseball require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously . The rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency . The score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records . General managers , managers , and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions . 
 Certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans . The basic batting statistics include : 
 At bats : plate appearances , excluding walks and hit by pitches — where the batter 's ability is not fully tested — and sacrifices and sacrifice flies — where the batter intentionally makes an out in order to advance one or more baserunners 
 Hits : times reached base because of a batted , fair ball without fielding error or fielder 's choice 
 Runs : times circling the bases and reaching home safely 
 Runs batted in ( RBIs ) : number of runners who scored due to a batter 's action ( including the batter , in the case of a home run ) , except when batter grounded into double play or reached on an error 
 Home runs : hits on which the batter successfully touched all four bases , without the contribution of a fielding error 
 Batting average : hits divided by at bats — the traditional measure of batting ability 
 The basic baserunning statistics include : 
 Stolen bases : times advancing to the next base entirely due to the runner 's own efforts , generally while the pitcher is preparing to deliver or delivering the ball 
 Caught stealing : times tagged out while attempting to steal a base 
 The basic pitching statistics include : 
 Wins : credited to pitcher on winning team who last pitched before the team took a lead that it never relinquished ( a starting pitcher must pitch at least five innings to qualify for a win ) 
 Losses : charged to pitcher on losing team who was pitching when the opposing team took a lead that it never relinquished 
 Saves : games where the pitcher enters a game led by the pitcher 's team , finishes the game without surrendering the lead , is not the winning pitcher , and either ( a ) the lead was three runs or less when the pitcher entered the game ; ( b ) the potential tying run was on base , at bat , or on deck ; or ( c ) the pitcher pitched three or more innings 
 Innings pitched : outs recorded while pitching divided by three ( partial innings are conventionally recorded as , e.g. , " 5 @.@ 2 " or " 7 @.@ 1 " , the last digit actually representing thirds , not tenths , of an inning ) 
 Strikeouts : times pitching three strikes to a batter 
 Winning percentage : wins divided by decisions ( wins plus losses ) 
 Earned run average ( ERA ) : runs allowed , excluding those resulting from fielding errors , per nine innings pitched 
 The basic fielding statistics include : 
 <unk> : times the fielder catches a fly ball , tags or forces out a runner , or otherwise directly effects an out 
 Assists : times a putout by another fielder was recorded following the fielder touching the ball 
 Errors : times the fielder fails to make a play that should have been made with common effort , and the batting team benefits as a result 
 Total chances : putouts plus assists plus errors 
 Fielding average : successful chances ( putouts plus assists ) divided by total chances 
 Among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics . For example , statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against . If a given situation statistically favors a certain batter , the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed . 
 = = = Sabermetrics = = = 
 Sabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools . The term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves . The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field 's leading proponents , Bill James , and derives from the Society for American Baseball Research ( SABR ) . 
 The growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter 's skill than batting average : 
 On @-@ base percentage measures a batter 's ability to get on base . It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter 's successes in getting on base ( hits plus walks plus hit by pitches ) and dividing that by the batter 's total plate appearances ( at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies ) , except for sacrifice bunts . 
 Slugging percentage measures a batter 's ability to hit for power . It is calculated by taking the batter 's total bases ( one per each single , two per double , three per triple , and four per home run ) and dividing that by the batter 's at bats . 
 Some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use : 
 On @-@ base plus slugging ( OPS ) measures a batter 's overall ability . It is calculated by adding the batter 's on @-@ base percentage and slugging percentage . 
 Walks plus hits per inning pitched ( WHIP ) measures a pitcher 's ability at preventing hitters from reaching base . It is calculated exactly as its name suggests . 
 = = Popularity and cultural impact = = 
 Writing in 1919 , philosopher Morris Raphael Cohen described baseball as America 's national religion . In the words of sports columnist Jayson Stark , baseball has long been " a unique paragon of American culture " — a status he sees as devastated by the steroid abuse scandal . Baseball has an important place in other national cultures as well : Scholar Peter <unk> describes " how deeply the sport is ingrained in the history and culture of a nation such as Cuba , [ and ] how thoroughly it was radically reshaped and <unk> in Japan . " Since the early 1980s , the Dominican Republic , in particular the city of San Pedro de Macorís , has been the major leagues ' primary source of foreign talent . Hall @-@ of @-@ Famer Roberto Clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in Puerto Rico 's history . While baseball has long been the island 's primary athletic pastime , its once well @-@ attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990 , when young Puerto Rican players began to be included in the major leagues ' annual first @-@ year player draft . In the Western Hemisphere , baseball is also one of the leading sports in Canada , Colombia , Mexico , the Netherlands Antilles , Nicaragua , Panama , and Venezuela . In Asia , it is among the most popular sports in Japan , South Korea and Taiwan . 
 The major league game in the United States was originally targeted toward a middle @-@ class , white @-@ collar audience : relative to other spectator pastimes , the National League 's set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high , while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue @-@ collar audience . A century later , the situation was very different . With the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices — football , basketball , and hockey — professional baseball had become among the most blue @-@ collar @-@ oriented of leading American spectator sports . 
 In the late 1900s and early 2000s , baseball 's position compared to football in the United States moved in contradictory directions . In 2008 , Major League Baseball set a revenue record of $ 6 @.@ 5 billion , matching the NFL 's revenue for the first time in decades . A new MLB revenue record of $ 6 @.@ 6 billion was set in 2009 . On the other hand , the percentage of American sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 16 % , compared to pro football at 31 % . In 1985 , the respective figures were pro football 24 % , baseball 23 % . Because there are so many more major league baseball games played , there is no comparison in overall attendance . In 2008 , total attendance at major league games was the second @-@ highest in history : 78 @.@ 6 million , 0 @.@ 7 % off the record set the previous year . The following year , amid the U.S. recession , attendance fell by 6 @.@ 6 % to 73 @.@ 4 million . Attendance at games held under the Minor League Baseball umbrella also set a record in 2007 , with 42 @.@ 8 million ; this figure does not include attendance at games of the several independent minor leagues . 
 In Japan , where baseball is inarguably the leading spectator team sport , combined revenue for the twelve teams in Nippon Professional Baseball ( NPB ) , the body that oversees both the Central and Pacific leagues , was estimated at $ 1 billion in 2007 . Total NPB attendance for the year was approximately 20 million . While in the preceding two decades , MLB attendance grew by 50 percent and revenue nearly tripled , the comparable NPB figures were stagnant . There are concerns that MLB 's growing interest in acquiring star Japanese players will hurt the game in their home country . In Cuba , where baseball is by every reckoning the national sport , the national team overshadows the city and provincial teams that play in the top @-@ level domestic leagues . Revenue figures are not released for the country 's amateur system . Similarly , according to one official pronouncement , the sport 's governing authority " has never taken into account attendance ... because its greatest interest has always been the development of athletes " . 
 As of 2007 , Little League Baseball oversees more than 7 @,@ 000 children 's baseball leagues with more than 2 @.@ 2 million participants – 2 @.@ 1 million in the United States and 123 @,@ 000 in other countries . Babe Ruth League teams have over 1 million participants . According to the president of the International Baseball Federation , between 300 @,@ 000 and 500 @,@ 000 women and girls play baseball around the world , including Little League and the introductory game of Tee Ball . 
 A varsity baseball team is an established part of physical education departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States . In 2008 , nearly half a million high schoolers and over 35 @,@ 000 collegians played on their schools ' baseball teams . The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s , falling well behind the number of soccer participants . By early in the 20th century , intercollegiate baseball was Japan 's leading sport . Today , high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there . The final rounds of the two annual tournaments — the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring , and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer — are broadcast around the country . The tournaments are known , respectively , as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stadium where they are played . In Cuba , baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education , which begins at age six . Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training — the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team . 
 = = = Baseball in popular culture = = = 
 Baseball has had a broad impact on popular culture , both in the United States and elsewhere . Dozens of English @-@ language idioms have been derived from baseball ; in particular , the game is the source of a number of widely used sexual euphemisms . The first networked radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series : famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play @-@ by @-@ play from New York City 's Polo Grounds on WJZ – Newark , New Jersey , which was connected by wire to WGY – Schenectady , New York , and WBZ – Springfield , Massachusetts . The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item not only in the United States and Japan , but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular , such as the United Kingdom . 
 Baseball has inspired many works of art and entertainment . One of the first major examples , Ernest Thayer 's poem " Casey at the Bat " , appeared in 1888 . A wry description of the failure of a star player in what would now be called a " clutch situation " , the poem became the source of vaudeville and other staged performances , audio recordings , film adaptations , and an opera , as well as a host of sequels and parodies in various media . There have been many baseball movies , including the Academy Award – winning The Pride of the Yankees ( 1942 ) and the Oscar nominees The Natural ( 1984 ) and Field of Dreams ( 1989 ) . The American Film Institute 's selection of the ten best sports movies includes The Pride of the Yankees at number 3 and Bull Durham ( 1988 ) at number 5 . Baseball has provided thematic material for hits on both stage — the Adler – Ross musical Damn Yankees — and record — George J. Gaskin 's " Slide , Kelly , Slide " , Simon and Garfunkel 's " Mrs. Robinson " , and John Fogerty 's " <unk> " . The baseball @-@ founded comedic sketch " Who 's on First " , popularized by Abbott and Costello in 1938 , quickly became famous . Six decades later , Time named it the best comedy routine of the 20th century . Baseball is also featured in various video games including MLB : The Show , Wii Sports , Kinect Sports : Season 2 and Mario Baseball . 
 Literary works connected to the game include the short fiction of Ring Lardner and novels such as Bernard Malamud 's The Natural ( the source for the movie ) , Robert Coover 's The Universal Baseball Association , Inc . , J. Henry Waugh , Prop . , and W. P. Kinsella 's Shoeless Joe ( the source for Field of Dreams ) . Baseball 's literary canon also includes the beat reportage of Damon Runyon ; the columns of Grantland Rice , Red Smith , Dick Young , and Peter Gammons ; and the essays of Roger Angell . Among the celebrated nonfiction books in the field are Lawrence S. Ritter 's The Glory of Their Times , Roger Kahn 's The Boys of Summer , and Michael Lewis 's Moneyball . The 1970 publication of major league pitcher Jim Bouton 's tell @-@ all chronicle Ball Four is considered a turning point in the reporting of professional sports . 
 Baseball has also inspired the creation of new cultural forms . Baseball cards were introduced in the late 19th century as trade cards . A typical example would feature an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other . In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies . The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card , with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data . Baseball cards — many of which are now prized collectibles — are the source of the much broader trading card industry , involving similar products for different sports and non @-@ sports @-@ related fields . 
 Modern fantasy sports began in 1980 with the invention of Rotisserie League Baseball by New York writer Daniel Okrent and several friends . Participants in a Rotisserie league draft notional teams from the list of active Major League Baseball players and play out an entire imaginary season with game outcomes based on the players ' latest real @-@ world statistics . Rotisserie @-@ style play quickly became a phenomenon . Now known more generically as fantasy baseball , it has inspired similar games based on an array of different sports . The field boomed with increasing Internet access and new fantasy sports – related websites . By 2008 , 29 @.@ 9 million people in the United States and Canada were playing fantasy sports , spending $ 800 million on the hobby . The burgeoning popularity of fantasy baseball is also credited with the increasing attention paid to sabermetrics — first among fans , only later among baseball professionals .

 As opposed to earlier games in the Call of Duty series , the game features modern equipment and new features , many exclusive to the multiplayer part of the game , such as " <unk> " ; killing a number of enemies without the player dying in between kills allows access to various assets including airstrikes and helicopter support . A character can be positioned in one of three stances : standing , crouching , or prone , each affecting the character 's rate of movement , accuracy , and stealth . Using cover helps the player avoid enemy fire or recover health after taking significant damage . As such , there are no armor or health power ups . When the character has taken damage , the edges of the screen glow red and the character 's heartbeat increases . If the character stays out of fire , the character can recover . When the character is within the blast radius of a live grenade , a marker indicates the direction of the grenade , helping the player to either flee or toss it back to the enemy . 
 = = = Campaign = = = 
 The player takes on the role of various characters during a single @-@ player campaign . The characters ' involvement in the plot occurs simultaneously and overlaps the events in the game . As such , the player 's perspective changes from one character to another between missions . Each mission features a series of objectives ; the player is led to each objective with the heads up display , which marks its direction and distance . Some objectives require that the player arrives at a checkpoint , while other objectives require the player to eliminate enemies in a specified location , stand their ground to defend an objective , or plant explosive charges on an enemy installation . After the credits , a special epilogue mission is unlocked for play , featuring a four @-@ man squad retrieving a VIP from terrorists who have hijacked an airliner . The SAS rescue the VIP and escape before the plane is destroyed . 
 = = = Multiplayer = = = 
 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare features team @-@ based and deathmatch @-@ based multiplayer modes on various maps . Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete . Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans , air strikes , and attack helicopters , when they achieve three- , five- , and seven @-@ enemy kill streaks respectively . A game ends when either a team or player has reached a predefined number of points , or the allotted time expires in which case the team or player with the most points wins . If the points are even when the time expires , Sudden Death mode is activated in which there is no re @-@ spawning and the team who either has the last man standing , or achieves the objective first are the winners . If the player is in either of the two matches , then there is an Overtime match , in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory . 
 The player 's performance in the multiplayer mode is tracked with experience points , which can be earned by killing opposing players , completing challenges , completing objectives , or by completing a round or match . As the player gains experience , they advance in level , unlocking new weapons , perks , challenges , and gameplay modes . The highest obtainable level is 55 , but on the console versions of the game , the player has the option to enter " Prestige " mode , which returns their level to one and removes all accumulated unlockables . This process can be repeated up to 10 times with a different insignia being given each time . 
 Completing a challenge grants experience points and may unlock weapon attachments . As a player 's level increases by gaining experience points within online games , it unlocks new weapons , perks , or challenges . As the player advances in levels , they earn the ability to customize their classes ; this includes selecting their main weapon , side arm and special grenade type . Additionally , the player can select 3 perks , one from each of the three " Tiers " , that can customize their character further . Perk effects include , but are not limited to , extra ammunition , increasing bullet damage by the player , or dropping a live grenade when the player is killed . The player is also given the choice to complete challenges in order to receive even more experience points ; challenges include achieving a certain number of kills with a specific weapon , shooting down a helicopter or performing a number of head shots . Additionally , when the player attains a certain amount of headshots with a specific weapon , excluding sidearms , the player unlocks extra weapon " <unk> " , or camouflage , to use for that specific weapon .

 During the single player campaign , the player controls six different characters from a first @-@ person perspective . The player assumes the role of recent British Special Air Service ( SAS ) recruit Sergeant John " Soap " MacTavish for most of the game , starting with his enrollment in the 22nd SAS Regiment . Sergeant Paul Jackson is part of USMC 1st Force Recon deployed to the Middle East , and the player controls Jackson 's character during five levels of Act 1 . Captain John Price ( voiced by actor Billy Murray ) is an SAS officer who is playable in two flashback missions from 1996 in which he is still Lieutenant . The player also assumes the role of an American thermal @-@ imaging TV operator aboard a Lockheed AC @-@ 130 gunship during one level , and a British SAS operative infiltrating a hijacked airliner to save a VIP in a secret level titled " Mile High Club " . Finally , the player may control Yasir Al @-@ Fulani , the president of the unnamed Middle Eastern country in the game before he is executed , although he has no freedom of action beyond turning his head . 
 The game 's non @-@ playable characters ( NPCs ) feature prominently in the story : Captain Price and his right @-@ hand man , Gaz ( voiced by Craig Fairbrass ) , serve as mentors to Soap . Jackson 's USMC platoon is led by Lieutenant Vasquez ( voiced by David Sobolov ) and Staff Sergeant Griggs ( voiced by and modeled after Infinity Ward lead animator Mark Grigsby ) ; Griggs later accompanies Soap in Russia . Sergeant <unk> leads the Russian loyalists that aid SAS and USMC forces . " Nikolai " is a Russian informant who helps the SAS . Captain MacMillan is Price 's mentor and commanding officer during a flashback . 
 The antagonists in the story include Imran Zakhaev ( voiced by Yevgeni Lazarev ) , the leader of the Russian ultranationalist party and the main antagonist of the game ; Khaled Al @-@ Asad , the commander of the revolutionary forces in the Middle East and an ally of Imran Zakhaev ; and Victor Zakhaev , the son of Imran Zakhaev and a priority figure in the ultranationalist party . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 In 2011 , a civil war has broken out in Russia between its government and ultranationalists who seek to restore Russia to its Soviet @-@ era glamor . Meanwhile , a separatist group led by Khaled Al @-@ Asad seizes power in a " small but oil @-@ rich " country in the Middle East through a coup d 'état . Al @-@ Asad is ruthless and has extreme anti @-@ Western views , which prompts the United States to invade the country . In the afternoon of the second day of invasion , a platoon of USMC 1st Force Recon is sent to capture Al @-@ Asad . The platoon attacks a TV station in which Al @-@ Asad was thought to be broadcasting live and then engages in urban combat in an unnamed city south of the capital . In the meantime , a British Special Air Service ( SAS ) squad led by Captain Price conducts two important operations , one on a ship in the Bering Strait and one in Russia . Intelligence gathered from the two missions indicates that Al @-@ Asad may be in possession of a Russian nuclear device . 
 In evening of the third day , the U.S. launches a full @-@ scale assault on Al @-@ Asad 's presidential palace in spite of the SAS warning about the possible nuclear device . As U.S. Navy SEALs invade the palace , the Marines engage Al @-@ Asad 's ground forces . The assault , however , ends in catastrophe when the nuclear device suddenly detonates , wiping out most of the city along with everyone in it . 
 Refusing to assume Al @-@ Asad dead , Price 's strike team supported by Russian loyalists attacks a potential safe house in a village in Azerbaijan to eradicate the occupying Russian forces and capture Al @-@ Asad . Shortly into the interrogation , Al @-@ Asad 's phone rings . After hearing the voice of the caller , Price executes Al @-@ Asad and reveals that the caller was the leader of the ultranationalists : Imran Zakhaev . 
 Price tells the story of a mission in Pripyat , Ukraine in 1996 . In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the Soviet Union , Zakhaev took advantage of the turmoil to profit from nuclear proliferation and used his new wealth to lure soldiers from the Soviet Army to form his ultranationalist party . Price was part of a black operation to assassinate Zakhaev . From his vantage point on the top floor of an abandoned hotel , Price fired upon Zakhaev with a Barrett M82 sniper rifle , but the shot only severed Zakhaev 's arm . Pursued across the city by Zakhaev 's henchmen , Price barely escaped . 
 A joint task force composed of the SAS , Force Recon , and the Loyalists attempt to capture Zakhaev 's son , Victor , to learn Zakhaev 's whereabouts but as they corner him on the roof of an apartment building , Victor commits suicide . Enraged , Zakhaev retaliates by launching nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. Eastern Seaboard , which could kill 41 million people . The SAS and Force Recon , however , manage to seize the launch facility 's command room and remotely destroy the missiles over the Atlantic Ocean . They escape the facility in military trucks with Zakhaev 's forces in hot pursuit . 
 An ultranationalist Mi @-@ 24 Hind helicopter destroys a vital bridge and traps the joint force . The ensuing fight with ultranationalists leaves everyone in the joint force either dead or severely wounded . Zakhaev himself arrives and begins killing wounded soldiers when loyalists suddenly destroy his Mi @-@ 24 Hind and join the fray . Zakhaev is shot dead . Loyalist forces start tending to the wounded immediately . 
 In the outro , the missiles incident and the ultranationalists ' support of Al @-@ Asad are hushed up , thus causing the events of Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 . 
 = = Development = = 
 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare was developed by a team of a hundred people , over the course of two years . After Call of Duty 2 , the Infinity Ward team decided to move away from the World War II environment of previous games in the series . This resulted in three game concepts : Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 . While developing the story for Call of Duty 4 , Infinity Ward chose to avoid referencing current , real @-@ life wars , and keep the series ' common theme of two opposing forces of similar strength . To enhance the realistic feel of the game , the development team attended a live @-@ fire exercise at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms , a training facility in the California desert . This helped the developers to simulate the effects of being near an Abrams tank when it fires . The team also talked with U.S. Marines who were recently in combat to get a feel for the background , emotions , and attitude of Marines in combat . Veterans were also recruited to supervise motion capture sessions and the artificial intelligence design of the game . 
 The development team designed the online multiplayer component to be balanced and rewarding for new players while still offering something for experienced players . An early idea to implement air support ( air strikes and attack helicopters ) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies . This idea was discarded because it discouraged the type of deathmatch gameplay they intended . The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills . Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting . Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games — the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well . Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Most of the music for Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare was written by British composer Stephen Barton , who had also contributed to film scores by Harry Gregson @-@ Williams , to whom , composed the main theme of the game . Several music tracks from the game are available on Infinity Ward 's " 7 Days of Modern Warfare " website , and some are available at Barton 's own web site . The rap song played during the end credits is performed by Call of Duty 4 's lead animator , Mark Grigsby . 
 = = = Game engine = = = 
 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare runs on the IW engine , specifically IW 3 @.@ 0 , featuring true world @-@ dynamic lighting , HDR lighting effects , dynamic shadows and depth of field . Bullet penetration is calculated by the engine , taking into account factors such as surface type and entity thickness . The game runs in a native resolution of <unk> on the Xbox 360 and PS3 . 
 Certain objects , such as cars and some buildings , are destructible . This makes distinguishing cover from concealment important , as the protection provided by objects such as wooden fences and thin walls do not completely protect players from harm . Bullet stopping power is decreased after penetrating an object , and the decrease is dependent on the thickness and surface type of the object . The game makes use of a dynamic physics engine , not implemented in previous Call of Duty titles . Death animations are a combination of pre @-@ set animations and ragdoll physics . Console versions of Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare run at a consistent 60 frames per second , and the Wii version runs at 30 frames per second . Code was included to determine spawning points based on the nearby weapons and the relationship between enemy positions and line of sight to the points . The various criteria are meant to minimize players dying immediately after rejoining a match , or being " spawn @-@ killed " due to players simply waiting for others to " respawn " . However , enemies may still respawn infinitely , a notable feature in Call of Duty game engines . 
 The game engine has also been used for the development of two other Activision games . An enhanced version of the original engine was used in Call of Duty : World at War , the fifth installment in the Call of Duty series after Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , while a slightly altered version has been used for the James Bond video game Quantum of Solace as well as GoldenEye 007 using a heavily modified version .

 On April 27 , 2007 , the day before the release of the game 's official trailer , Infinity Ward launched a website called " Charlie Oscar Delta " to provide information on the game . Charlie Oscar Delta features a ranking system that allows users to complete missions to increase their rank and compete for prizes . Charlie Oscar Delta is derived from the NATO phonetic alphabet and the initials of Call of Duty . The first Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare trailer featuring game footage was released on April 28 , 2007 . An Xbox 360 Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare public beta test was announced on August 30 , 2007 . The beta test was designed to test the servers , find glitches , and help balance out the weapons . It was originally only for residents of the US , but was later available to other countries . The beta concluded on September 30 , 2007 . The maximum rank for the beta was initially level 16 , but was increased to level 25 towards the end of the beta . Three multiplayer maps were available for play : Crash , Vacant , and Overgrown . A single @-@ player demo for the PC was released on October 11 , 2007 as a Yahoo ! exclusive download , and is now available for free download . The demo includes one level , " The Bog , " which showcases the advanced night vision and associated graphics capabilities .
