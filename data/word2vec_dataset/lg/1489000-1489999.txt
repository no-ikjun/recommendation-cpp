 = = = = Warm seclusion = = = = 
 A warm seclusion is the mature phase of the extratropical cyclone lifecycle . This was conceptualized after the <unk> field experiment of the late 1980s , which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low @-@ level thermal structure , secluded ( or surrounded ) by a bent @-@ back warm front and a coincident chevron @-@ shaped band of intense surface winds . The Norwegian Cyclone Model , as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology , largely observed cyclones at the tail end of their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages . 
 Warm seclusions may have cloud @-@ free , eye @-@ like features at their center ( reminiscent of tropical cyclones ) , significant pressure falls , hurricane @-@ force winds , and moderate to strong convection . The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950 millibars ( 28 @.@ 05 inHg ) with a definitive lower to mid @-@ level warm core structure . A warm seclusion , the result of a baroclinic lifecycle , occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics . 
 As latent heat flux releases are important for their development and intensification , most warm seclusion events occur over the oceans ; they may impact coastal nations with hurricane force winds and torrential rain . Climatologically , the Northern Hemisphere sees warm seclusions during the cold season months , while the Southern Hemisphere may see a strong cyclone event such as this during all times of the year . 
 In all tropical basins , except the Northern Indian Ocean , the extratropical transition of a tropical cyclone may result in reintensification into a warm seclusion . For example , Hurricane Maria of 2005 reintensified into a strong baroclinic system and achieved warm seclusion status at maturity ( or lowest pressure ) . 
 = = Motion = = 
 Extratropical cyclones are generally driven , or " steered " , by deep westerly winds in a general west to east motion across both the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the Earth . This general motion of atmospheric flow is known as " zonal " . Where this general trend is the main steering influence of an extratropical cyclone , it is known as a " zonal flow regime " . 
 When the general flow pattern buckles from a zonal pattern to the meridional pattern , a slower movement in a north or southward direction is more likely . <unk> flow patterns feature strong , amplified troughs and ridges , generally with more northerly and southerly flow . 
 Changes in direction of this nature are most commonly observed as a result of a cyclone 's interaction with other low pressure systems , troughs , ridges , or with anticyclones . A strong and stationary anticyclone can effectively block the path of an extratropical cyclone . Such blocking patterns are quite normal , and will generally result in a weakening of the cyclone , the weakening of the anticyclone , a diversion of the cyclone towards the anticyclone 's periphery , or a combination of all three to some extent depending on the precise conditions . It is also common for an extratropical cyclone to strengthen as the blocking anticyclone or ridge weakens in these circumstances . 
 Where an extratropical cyclone encounters another extratropical cyclone ( or almost any other kind of cyclonic vortex in the atmosphere ) , the two may combine to become a binary cyclone , where the vortices of the two cyclones rotate around each other ( known as the " Fujiwhara effect " ) . This most often results in a merging of the two low pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone , or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of either one or both of the cyclones . The precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones , their strength , their distance from each other , and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them . 
 = = Effects = = 
 = = = General = = = 
 Extratropical cyclones can bring mild weather with a little rain and surface winds of 15 – 30 km / h ( 9 @.@ 3 – 18 @.@ 6 mph ) , or they can be cold and dangerous with torrential rain and winds exceeding 119 km / h ( 74 mph ) , ( sometimes referred to as windstorms in Europe ) . The band of precipitation that is associated with the warm front is often extensive . In mature extratropical cyclones , an area known as the comma head on the northwest periphery of the surface low can be a region of heavy precipitation , frequent thunderstorms , and <unk> . Cyclones tend to move along a predictable path at a moderate rate of progress . During fall , winter , and spring , the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall . 
 = = = Severe weather = = = 
 Squall lines , or solid bands of strong thunderstorms , can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs due to the presence of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence , leading to hail and high winds . When significant directional wind shear exists in the atmosphere ahead of a cold front in the presence of a strong upper level jet stream , tornado formation is possible . Although tornadoes can form anywhere on Earth , the greatest number occur in the Great Plains in the United States , because downsloped winds off the north @-@ south oriented Rocky Mountains , which can form a dryline , aid their development at any strength . 
 Explosive development of extratropical cyclones can be sudden . The storm known in the UK as the " Great Storm of 1987 " deepened to 953 millibars ( 28 @.@ 14 inHg ) with a highest recorded wind of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , resulting in the loss of 19 lives , 15 million trees , widespread damage to homes and an estimated economic cost of £ 1 @.@ 2 billion ( US $ 2 @.@ 3 billion ) . 
 Although most tropical cyclones that become extratropical quickly dissipate or are absorbed by another weather system , they can still retain winds of hurricane or gale force . In 1954 , Hurricane Hazel became extratropical over North Carolina as a strong Category 3 storm . The Columbus Day Storm of 1962 , which evolved from the remains of Typhoon Freda , caused heavy damage in Oregon and Washington , with widespread damage equivalent to at least a Category 3 . In 2005 , Hurricane Wilma began to lose tropical characteristics while still sporting Category 3 @-@ force winds ( and became fully extratropical as a Category 1 storm ) . 
 = = = Climate and general circulation = = = 
 In the classic analysis by Edward Lorenz ( the Lorenz Energy Cycle ) , extratropical cyclones ( so @-@ called atmospheric transients ) acts as a mechanism in converting potential energy that is created by pole to equator temperature gradients to eddy kinetic energy . In the process , the pole @-@ equator temperature gradient is reduced ( i.e. energy is transported poleward to warm up the higher latitudes ) . 
 The existence of such transients are also closely related to the formation of the Icelandic and Aleutian Low — the two most prominent general circulation features in the mid- to sub @-@ polar northern latitudes . The two lows are formed by both the transport of kinetic energy and the latent heating ( the energy released when water phase changed from vapor to liquid during precipitation ) from the extratropical cyclones .

 A violent storm during the Crimean War on November 14 , 1854 , wrecked 30 vessels , and sparked initial investigations into meteorology and forecasting in Europe . In the United States , the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 , one of many Pacific Northwest windstorms , led to Oregon 's lowest measured pressure of 965 @.@ 5 hPa ( 96 @.@ 55 kPa ; 28 @.@ 51 inHg ) , violent winds , and US $ 170 million in damage ( 1964 dollars ) . The " Wahine storm " was an extratropical cyclone that struck Wellington , New Zealand on April 10 , 1968 , so named after causing the inter @-@ island ferry TEV Wahine to strike a reef and founder at the entrance to Wellington Harbour , resulting in 53 deaths . On November 10 , 1975 , an extratropical storm on Lake Superior contributed to the sinking of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald near the US / Canadian border , 15 NM northwest of the entrance to Whitefish Bay . A rapidly strengthening storm struck Vancouver Island on October 11 , 1984 , and inspired the development of moored buoys off the western coast of Canada . The Braer Storm of January 1993 was the strongest extratropical cyclone known to occur across the northern Atlantic ocean , with a central pressure of 914 millibars ( 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) . In 2012 , Hurricane Sandy transitioned to a post @-@ tropical cyclone on the night of October 29 ; a few minutes later it made landfall on the New Jersey coast as an extratropical storm with winds similar to a Category 1 hurricane and a wind field of over 1 @,@ 150 miles ( 1 @,@ 850 km ) . 
 In the Southern Hemisphere , a violent extratropical storm hit Uruguay on August 23 – 24 , 2005 , killing 10 people . The system 's winds exceeded 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) while Montevideo , the country 's capital with 1 @.@ 5 million inhabitants , was affected by tropical storm @-@ force winds for over 12 hours and by hurricane @-@ force winds for nearly four hours . Peak gusts were registered at Carrasco International Airport as 107 mph ( 172 km / h ) and at the Harbour of Montevideo as 116 mph ( 187 km / h ) . The lowest reported pressure was 991 @.@ 7 hPa ( 99 @.@ 17 kPa ; 29 @.@ 28 inHg ) . Extratropical cyclones are common in this part of the globe during fall , winter and spring months . The winds usually peak to 80 – 110 km / h ( 50 – 68 mph ) , and winds of 116 mph ( 187 km / h ) are very uncommon . 
 = Pattillo Higgins = 
 Pattillo Higgins ( December 5 , 1863 – June 5 , 1955 ) was a businessman as well as a self @-@ taught geologist . He earned the nickname the " Prophet of Spindletop " for his endeavors in the oil business , which accrued a fortune for many . He partnered to form the Gladys City Oil Gas and Manufacturing Company and later , established the Higgins Standard Oil Company . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Pattillo Higgins was born to Roberto James and Sarah ( Raye ) Higgins on December 5 , 1863 , in Sabine Pass , Texas . His family moved to Beaumont when he was at six years old . He attended school until he reached the fourth grade , after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father ’ s direction . In his youth , he was a violent troublemaker , pulling pranks and harassing African Americans . When he was seventeen , he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy . The deputy fired a warning shot over Higgins ' head , after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later turn out to be a fatal hit . The wounded deputy managed to fire again , striking Higgins lower left arm . Higgins ' arm would later become severely infected , requiring amputation from the elbow down . Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy , but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self @-@ defense . After his acquittal , he worked as a logger along the Texas @-@ Louisiana border , apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm . It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian . Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality , he decided to return to Beaumont , Texas to establish himself as a businessman . 
 = = Higgins ’ venture into business = = 
 Higgins ventured into real estate at first , and with the money that he saved as a logger , he started the Higgins Manufacturing Company to manufacture bricks . The business sparked his interest in oil and gas , as he used it for his kilns to burn the bricks evenly . He decided to travel to Pennsylvania to learn about these fuels and study the geographical features that give signs to the presence of underground oil . Studying geology on his own , he dedicated himself to finding these clues by reading all the United States Geological Survey reports and books that he could find . The details he learned reminded him of what some Beaumont locals back home referred to as " Sour Hill Mound " , a place where he frequently brought his Sunday school students for outings . This mound was described as " sour " due to the unpleasant sulfur smell that came out of the springs around it . Convinced that this salt dome mound had oil below it , Higgins first partnered with George O 'Brien , George Carroll , Emma John , and J.F. Lanier to form the Gladys City Oil , Gas , and Manufacturing Company in 1892 . It was during this time that other formally trained geologists dismissed the idea of finding oil along the gulf coast region of the United States . Higgins ' personal integrity was even challenged by the local newspaper . However , his informal training in geology influenced his belief that the Spindletop field contained oil below due to the presence of mineral water and gas seepage , and he managed to convince the partners to proceed with the venture . Work began the following year , but all three of the shallow drilling attempts failed to locate oil due to the shifting sands and unstable clay under the hill . Higgins held onto his ownership and leases of land over the salt dome , but resigned from the company . 
 = = = Partnership with Anthony Lucas = = = 
 Unwilling to give up hope of striking oil , Higgins placed numerous ads in industrial magazines and trade journals in an effort to spark others ' interests in the prospect of hitting a successful well at the site . Only one man responded to the ads , a Croatian @-@ American named Anthony Francis Lucas . Lucas signed agreements with the Gladys City Company and also with Higgins in 1899 , and in June of the following year , he began to drill . The first well Lucas made with his light equipment collapsed after reaching 575 feet ( 175 m ) . This failure exhausted the partners ' finances , so Lucas turned to John H. <unk> and James M. Guffey in Pittsburgh for backing . The terms set forth by Guffey ( who held and controlled the funds ) limited Lucas ’ percentage cut to a small amount , and eliminated Higgins and cut him completely from the deal . 
 = = = The Lucas <unk> at Spindletop = = = 
 In late October 1900 , with the help of the experienced crew of Al and Curt Hamill from Corsicana , drilling began again . This time , the drilling would be done using a newer , heavier , and more efficient rotary type bit . Over the next several months , work was difficult maintaining the drilling through the underground sands . On January 10 , 1901 , the six tons of four @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) drilling pipe began to shoot up out of the hole , sending the <unk> fleeing for safety . The geyser shot oil over 150 feet ( 46 m ) high and flowed an estimated 100 @,@ 000 barrels per day ( 16 @,@ 000 m3 / d ) . The well was at a depth of 1 @,@ 020 feet ( 310 m ) , and as it turns out , was at the precise location as initially predicted by Higgins . The well would not have struck oil if it had been drilled just 50 feet ( 15 m ) to the south . The well , which was dubbed " Lucas 1 " , had an initial flow rate greater than all of the oil wells in the United States combined in that day . The Spindletop oilfield churned out over 3 million barrels ( 480 @,@ 000 m3 ) the first year of operation , and over 17 million barrels ( 2 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 ) the following year . This effectively brought an end to John D. Rockefeller ’ s world monopoly . 
 = = = Lawsuit against Lucas and the Gladys City Company = = = 
 Higgins sued Lucas and Gladys City Oil , Gas and Manufacturing Company for royalties , using the basis that the second lease was invalid due to the fact the first lease had not yet expired when the second was enacted . After the parties settled out of court , Higgins formed the Higgins Oil and Fuel Company located at the center of Spindletop . This company was vulnerable to takeover bids due to Higgins ' over @-@ zealous land prospecting , which enabled the lumber baron and businessman John Henry Kirby to overtake his ownership in 1902 by purchasing his shares of the company for $ 3 million . Higgins maintained his leasing rights to his land , and would establish the Higgins Standard Oil Company . He later established other wells with various investors , with an eccentric habit of pulling his interests out , leaving the majority of the profits for others . 
 = = Higgins ' later life and death = = 
 Higgins ' lifestyle was varied in interests and occupations . Along with working as a wildcatter , his diverse activities involved drafting , work as an inventor , an artist , as well as an engineer to name a few . His religious beliefs kept him away from public entertainment and resorts , as well as maintaining a strong belief against the selling of alcohol . In addition to residing in Beaumont , he owned estates in Houston and San Antonio . He remained a bachelor until the age of 45 . In 1905 , he adopted a young woman named Annie Johns , who at the time was fifteen . Three years later Higgins married her , and later had three children with her , despite the scandal . Higgins died in San Antonio on June 5 , 1955 . 
 On December 4 , 1955 , six months after Higgins ' death , he was dramatized by the actor Robert Bray in the CBS history series You Are There in the episode entitled " Spindletop - The First Great Texas Oil Strike ( January 10 , 1901 ) " . Mike Ragan was cast as Marion Fletcher ; Parley Baer as Captain Lucas , Jean Byron as Caroline Lucas , DeForest Kelley as Al Hammill , Tyler McVey as Mayor Wheat , and William Fawcett as a farmer .

 = Santikhiri = 
 The village of Santikhiri ( Thai : <unk> ) , formerly known as Mae Salong ( Thai : <unk> ่ <unk> ) , is in the Thai highlands on Doi Mae Salong mountain of the <unk> Lao Range , in Mae Fa Luang District , Chiang Rai Province , the northernmost province of Thailand . The area has an alpine @-@ like landscape and climate , and is known for its hill tribe villages , tea plantations , and cherry blossoms . 
 Santikhiri 's early history centered on the Golden Triangle 's opium trade , in which its distinctive population – the " lost army " of the Republic of China Army 's 93rd Division – became involved . At the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 , some remnants of the anti @-@ communist Kuomintang ( KMT ) forces refused to surrender , including <unk> Regiment of the 93rd Division and 709th Regiment of the 237th Division ( led by General Li Kuo @-@ hui ) . The troops fought their way out of Yunnan in south @-@ western China , and its soldiers lived in Burma 's ( now Myanmar ) jungles . The army grew and part of it returned to Taiwan under international pressure . The remaining troops were led by Gen Tuan Shi @-@ wen ( also known as <unk> <unk> ) and sought asylum in Mae Salong later . In exchange for their asylum , they fought for Thailand until 1982 , helping to counter the communist insurgency on the Thai frontier . In reward , the Thai government granted citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families . 
 Cash crops , especially tea , have now replaced the growing of opium poppies , and Santikhiri today is a tourist attraction known as " Little Switzerland " . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the Santikhiri community go back to the end of the Chinese Civil War . In October 1949 , after Mao Zedong 's communist party victory in China , the defeated Kuomintang ( KMT ) armies led by Generalissimo Chiang Kai @-@ shek retreated to Taiwan , except for the 3rd and 5th Regiments of the 93rd Division , which refused to surrender . Fighting between the communist and KMT troops continued in some remote parts of China , including Yunnan in the south @-@ west . When the communists marched into the provincial capital of Kunming in January 1950 , 12 @,@ 000 troops from the 3rd and 5th Regiments , commanded respectively by Generals Lee Wen @-@ <unk> ( Li <unk> ) and Tuan Shi @-@ wen , fought their way out of Yunnan and escaped into Burma 's jungles . 
 The soldiers ' war did not end after their own " long march " from Yunnan to <unk> <unk> in Burma 's Shan State . The Burmese soon discovered that a foreign army was camped on their soil , and launched an offensive . The fighting continued for 12 years , and several thousand KMT soldiers were eventually evacuated to Taiwan . When China entered the Korean War , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) had a desperate need for intelligence on China . The agency turned to the two KMT generals , who agreed to slip some soldiers back into China for intelligence @-@ gathering missions . In return , the agency offered arms to equip the generals to retake China from their bases in the Shan State . The KMT army tried on no fewer than seven times between 1950 and 1952 to invade Yunnan , but was repeatedly driven back into the Shan State . The ending of the Korean War in 1953 was not the end of the KMT 's fight against the communist Chinese and Burmese armies , which continued on for many years , supported by Washington and Taiwan and subsequently funded by the KMT 's involvement in the Golden Triangle 's drug trade . 
 = = = Refuge in Thailand = = = 
 In 1961 , Tuan led some 4 @,@ 000 battle @-@ weary KMT troops out of Burma to a mountainous sanctuary in Mae Salong in Thailand . In exchange for asylum , the Thai government allowed them to stay on the understanding that they would assist in policing the area against communist infiltration . As a result , most of the village 's inhabitants today are ethnic Chinese and direct descendants of those KMT soldiers . At the same time , General Lee of the 3rd Regiment established his headquarters at Tham <unk> , north @-@ west of Chiang Mai . The KMT army was renamed " Chinese Irregular Forces " ( CIF ) and was placed directly under the control of a special task force , code @-@ named " 04 " , commanded by Bangkok . 
 After the soldiers reached Mae Salong , China and Thailand struck an agreement to transfer the administration of the group to the Thai government . The provincial governor of southern Thailand , <unk> <unk> , was reassigned as the governor of Chiang Rai , to oversee the KMT division , but upon taking up his position , <unk> was killed by communist insurgents . Soon afterwards , the KMT division was ordered to assist the Thai government to counter the advancing armies on Thailand 's northern borders and the internal threat from the Communist Party of Thailand . Fierce battles were fought in the mountains of Doi <unk> , Doi Yaw , Doi <unk> , and Mae <unk> , and the communist uprising was successfully countered . The bloodiest operation was launched on 10 December 1970 , a five @-@ year @-@ long campaign that claimed over 1 @,@ 000 lives , many from landmines . It was not until 1982 that the soldiers were able to give up their arms and were discharged to settle down to a normal life at Mae Salong . As a reward for their service , the Thai government gave citizenship to most of the KMT soldiers and their families . 
 Despite the Thai government 's attempts to integrate the KMT division and their families into the Thai nation , the inhabitants of Mae Salong preferred for many years to engage in the illegal opium trade , alongside the drug warlord Khun Sa of the Shan United Army . In 1967 , Tuan said in an interview with a British journalist : 
 We have to continue to fight the evil of communism , and to fight you must have an army , and an army must have guns , and to buy guns you must have money . In these mountains , the only money is opium . 
 According to a CIA report in 1971 , Mae Salong was then one of the largest heroin refineries in south @-@ east Asia . Only in the late 1980s , after Khun Sa 's army was finally routed and pushed over the border into Myanmar by the Thai military , was the Thai government able to make any headway in taming the region – part of which involved crop substitution plans and giving the area a new name . Santikhiri meaning " hill of peace " was introduced by the Thai government in an effort to disassociate the area from its former image as an established opium zone . King Bhumibol Adulyadej and other members of the royal family made regular visits as a sign of their support for the old soldiers who had fought against their own country for Thailand . 
 = = = Santikhiri today = = = 
 As late as the mid @-@ 1970s , Doi Mae Salong was strictly off @-@ limits to outsiders . Since 1994 , Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction , with its narrow winding streets lined with inns , noodle shops and teashops . As a result , Santikhiri has become one of Thailand 's top ten destinations among backpackers today . The former soldiers had settled down , some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped , and others having married local Thais . The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now , but still retain their Chinese identity ; the main language spoken remains <unk> . Among their local @-@ born descendants , some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry . As of 2007 , General Lue Ye @-@ <unk> , aged 90 and Tuan 's former right @-@ hand man , is the leader of the group , after taking over the leadership on Tuan 's death in 1980 . 
 The crop substitution programs successfully encouraged the cultivation of tea , coffee , corn , and fruit trees , replacing the opium poppies that had previously been grown . New fruit orchards and tea factories were also set up , followed by production facilities for fruit wines and Chinese herbs , which are particularly popular among Thais and tourists from China , Taiwan , and other ethnic Chinese communities in south @-@ east Asia . 
 Santikhiri was chosen as the filming location for the subplot The Fortitude of the Buddha in the 2005 film 3 Needles . Although the narrative is supposed to be set in the rural southern province of Yunnan , director Thom <unk> stated that difficulties in obtaining permission from the Censorship Authority resulted in the decision to shoot the segment in Santikhiri instead . The segment , which stars Lucy Liu as a heavily @-@ pregnant blood merchant , depicts the blood @-@ selling scandals in China from the 1980s @-@ 2000s in which hundreds of thousands of people , mostly rural poor , contracted HIV through government sponsored campaigns to increase blood supplies . The traditional costume of the <unk> people features heavily in the segment , however the blood selling scandals mostly impacted rural villagers in Henan province . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Santikhiri is a hilltop village in the Mae Fa Luang district of Thailand 's Chiang Rai Province , about 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) from Chiang Rai . Santikhiri is on the highest peak of the Doi Mae Salong range of mountains , at an elevation of 1 @,@ 134 metres ( 3 @,@ 722 ft ) above sea level . It has an alpine @-@ like climate , with crisp cool air all year round and chilly in the winter months of November through February . Santikhiri is accessible via two routes – Route 1130 from Ban <unk> and Route 1234 from the south , which until being paved were only accessible by pack horses . Now regular minibus services , running from 06 : 00 – 13 : 00 , are available from Chiang Rai to Santikhiri . 
 Santikhiri has long been the home of many hill tribes such as the <unk> , Yao , Karen , and Hmong that originated from southern China and Myanmar . Each tribe has its own language , and follows animist customs and practices . Living among the native inhabitants are the ethnic Chinese , who form the majority of Santikhiri 's estimated population of 20 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Landmarks and attractions = = 
 Santikhiri is noted for its high mountain oolong , a high grade traditional Chinese tea , which makes up about 80 % of all tea production in Chiang Rai . The province produces about 200 tonnes ( 200 long tons ; 220 short tons ) of tea a year . The combination of climate and soil conditions at Santikhiri is ideal for growing high quality <unk> ( " black dragon " in Chinese ) . Such teas are cultivated at elevations ranging from 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 400 metres ( 3 @,@ 960 – 4 @,@ 620 ft ) . In 2005 , Santikhiri was selected by the Tourism and Sports Ministry as an <unk> ( " One <unk> One Product " ) tourism village in recognition of its fine oolong tea . The goals are to stimulate the grassroots economy , increase the number of tourists , and develop Thailand 's products and services . Taiwanese experts work alongside local farmers in tea processing plants which produce top @-@ quality tea for both the local and export markets . The number of tea plantations in the village has increased significantly since the mid @-@ 1990s , and includes Choke <unk> Tea , Wang Put Tan , and 101 Tea . 
 From 28 December to 2 January each year , Santikhiri hosts the annual cherry blossoms festival , which is organised by Mae Salong Nok <unk> Administration Organisation in association with Mae Fa Luang District . The festival celebrates the culture of the hill tribe people from the Chiang Rai area , and includes a handicraft sale , a light and sound show , a parade by the tribes people , and a beauty contest . 
 General Tuan Shi @-@ wen died in 1980 , and was buried in a pagoda @-@ like tomb on a hilltop reached via a 300 @-@ metre ( 984 ft ) climb . From the top , there is a panoramic view of the village . There is also a memorial to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism , The Martyrs ' Memorial , a museum whose wooden panels bear the names of the dead , set on an altar in the main building . It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine like the National Revolutionary Martyrs ' Shrine in Taipei . The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of the KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley . 
 Phra <unk> Chedi is a <unk> built on a hill near the village , in honour of the late Princess Mother , <unk> . There is an excellent view of the Myanmar frontier from the top , an area that was off @-@ limits when it was under the control of the warlord Khun Sa . 
 = Pituitary apoplexy = 
 Pituitary apoplexy or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired blood supply of the pituitary gland at the base of the brain . This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary , although in 80 % of cases this has not been diagnosed previously . The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache , often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland . This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones , predominantly adrenal insufficiency . 
 The diagnosis is achieved with magnetic resonance imaging and blood tests . Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies , and in many cases surgical decompression is required . Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long @-@ term hormone supplementation . The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898 . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 = = = Acute symptoms = = = 
 The initial symptoms of pituitary apoplexy are related to the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland . The most common symptom , in over 95 % of cases , is a sudden @-@ onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples . It is often associated with nausea and vomiting . Occasionally , the presence of blood leads to irritation of the lining of the brain , which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light , as well as a decreased level of consciousness . This occurs in 24 % of cases . 
 Pressure on the part of the optic nerve known as the chiasm , which is located above the gland , leads to loss of vision on the outer side of the visual field on both sides , as this corresponds to areas on the retinas supplied by these parts of the optic nerve ; it is encountered in 75 % of cases . Visual acuity is reduced in half , and over 60 % have a visual field defect . The visual loss depends on which part of the nerve is affected . If the part of the nerve between the eye and the chiasm is compressed , the result is vision loss in one eye . If the part after the chiasm is affected , visual loss on one side of the visual field occurs . 
 Adjacent to the pituitary lies a part of the skull base known as the cavernous sinus . This contains a number of nerves that control the eye muscles . 70 % of people with pituitary apoplexy experience double vision due to compression of one of the nerves . In half of these cases , the oculomotor nerve ( the third cranial nerve ) , which controls a number of eye muscles , is affected . This leads to diagonal double vision and a dilated pupil . The fourth ( trochlear ) and sixth ( abducens ) cranial nerves are located in the same compartment and can cause diagonal or horizontal double vision , respectively . The oculomotor nerve is predominantly affected as it lies closest to the pituitary . The cavernous sinus also contains the carotid artery , which supplies blood to the brain ; occasionally , compression of the artery can lead to one @-@ sided weakness and other symptoms of stroke . 
 = = = Endocrine dysfunction = = = 
 The pituitary gland consists of two parts , the anterior ( front ) and posterior ( back ) pituitary . Both parts release hormones that control numerous other organs . In pituitary apoplexy , the main initial problem is a lack of secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH , corticotropin ) , which stimulates the secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland . This occurs in 70 % of those with pituitary apoplexy . A sudden lack of cortisol in the body leads to a constellation of symptoms called " adrenal crisis " or " <unk> crisis " ( after a complication of Addison 's disease , the main cause of adrenal dysfunction and low cortisol levels ) . The main problems are low blood pressure ( particularly on standing ) , low blood sugars ( which can lead to coma ) and abdominal pain ; the low blood pressure can be life @-@ threatening and requires immediate medical attention . 
 <unk> , an unusually low level of sodium in the blood that may cause confusion and seizures , is found in 40 % of cases . This may be caused by low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) from the posterior pituitary . Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase . 50 % have a deficiency in thyroid @-@ stimulating hormone ( TSH ) , leading to <unk> of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue , weight gain , and cold intolerance . 75 % develop a deficiency to gonadotropins ( LH and FSH ) , which control the reproductive hormone glands . This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle , infertility and decreased libido . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Almost all cases of pituitary apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma , a benign tumor of the pituitary gland . In 80 % , the patient has been previously unaware of this ( although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms ) . It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others , but this has not been confirmed . In absolute terms , only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy . In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors , apoplexy occurred in 0 @.@ 2 % annually , but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10 mm ( " <unk> " ) and tumors that were growing more rapidly ; in a meta @-@ analysis , not all these associations achieved statistical significance . 
 The majority of cases ( 60 – 80 % ) are not precipitated by a particular cause . A quarter has a history of high blood pressure , but this is a common problem in the general population , and it is not clear whether it significantly increase the risk of apoplexy . A number of cases has been reported in association with particular conditions and situations ; it is uncertain whether these were in fact causative . Amongst reported associations are surgery ( especially coronary artery bypass graft , where there are significant fluctuations in the blood pressure ) , disturbances in blood coagulation or medication that inhibits coagulation , radiation therapy to the pituitary , traumatic brain injury , pregnancy ( during which the pituitary enlarges ) and treatment with estrogens . Hormonal stimulation tests of the pituitary have been reported to provoke episodes . Treatment of <unk> ( pituitary adenomas that secrete prolactin ) with dopamine agonist drugs , as well as withdrawal of such treatment , has been reported to precipitate apoplexy . 
 Hemorrhage from a Rathke 's cleft cyst , a remnant of Rathke 's pouch that normally regresses after embryological development , may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy . Pituitary apoplexy is regarded by some as distinct from Sheehan 's syndrome , where the pituitary undergoes infarction as a result of prolonged very low blood pressure , particularly when caused by bleeding after childbirth . This condition usually occurs in the absence of a tumor . Others regard Sheehan 's syndrome as a form of pituitary apoplexy . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 The pituitary gland is located in a recess in the skull base known as the sella <unk> ( " Turkish saddle " , after its shape ) . It is attached to the hypothalamus , a part of the brain , by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland . It is unclear why pituitary tumors are five times more likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain . There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction ( insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction ) or hemorrhage . The pituitary gland normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus , but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior <unk> artery that generates a higher blood pressure , possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding . Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure , and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage . It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction ( infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue ) . Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding , and more rapidly growing lesions ( as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA ) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy . 
 After an apoplexy , the pressure inside the sella <unk> rises , and surrounding structures such as the optic nerve and the contents of the cavernous sinus are compressed . The raised pressure further impairs the blood supply to the pituitary hormone @-@ producing tissue , leading to tissue death due to insufficient blood supply . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 It is recommended that magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan of the pituitary gland is performed if the diagnosis is suspected ; this has a sensitivity of over 90 % for detecting pituitary apoplexy ; it may demonstrate infarction ( tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply ) or hemorrhage . Different MRI sequences can be used to establish when the apoplexy occurred , and the predominant form of damage ( hemorrhage or infarction ) . If MRI is not suitable ( e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal @-@ containing implants ) , a computed tomography ( CT ) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the pituitary gland , although it is less reliable . Many pituitary tumors ( 25 % ) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans , but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms . 
 In some instances , lumbar puncture may be required if there is a suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems ( meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage ) . This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord ; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine . In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal , although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space . If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , a magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRI with a contrast agent ) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels , the most common cause of SAH . 
 Professional guidelines recommend that if pituitary apoplexy is suspected or confirmed , the minimal blood tests performed should include a complete blood count , urea ( a measure of renal function , usually performed together with creatinine ) , electrolytes ( sodium and potassium ) , liver function tests , routine coagulation testing , and a hormonal panel including IGF @-@ 1 , growth hormone , prolactin , luteinizing hormone , follicle @-@ stimulating hormone , thyroid @-@ stimulating hormone , thyroid hormone , and either testosterone in men or estradiol in women . 
 Visual field testing is recommended as soon as possible after diagnosis , as it quantifies the severity of any optic nerve involvement , and may be required to decide on surgical treatment . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 The first priority in suspected or confirmed pituitary apoplexy is stabilization of the circulatory system . Cortisol deficiency can cause severe low blood pressure . Depending on the severity of the illness , admission to a high dependency unit ( HDU ) may be required . 
 Treatment for acute adrenal insufficiency requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution ; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult . This is followed by the administration of hydrocortisone , which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol , intravenously or into a muscle . The drug dexamethasone has similar properties , but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage . Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement ; in this case , blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9 : 00 AM ( as cortisol levels vary over the day ) . A level below 550 nmol / l indicates a need for replacement . 
 The decision on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects . If visual acuity is severely reduced , there are large or worsening visual field defects , or the level of consciousness falls consistently , professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed . Most commonly , operations on the pituitary gland are performed through <unk> surgery . In this procedure , surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone , which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland . Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery , and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms . 
 Those with relatively mild visual field loss or double vision only may be managed conservatively , with close observation of the level of consciousness , visual fields , and results of routine blood tests . If there is any deterioration , or expected spontaneous improvement does not occur , surgical intervention may still be indicated . If the apoplexy occurred in a prolactin @-@ secreting tumor , this may respond to dopamine agonist treatment . 
 After recovery , people who have had pituitary apoplexy require follow @-@ up by an endocrinologist to monitor for long @-@ term consequences . MRI scans are performed 3 – 6 months after the initial episode and subsequently on an annual basis . If after surgery some tumor tissue remains , this may respond to medication , further surgery , or radiation therapy with a " gamma knife " . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 In larger case series , the mortality was 1 @.@ 6 % overall . In the group of patients who were unwell enough to require surgery , the mortality was 1 @.@ 9 % , with no deaths in those who could be treated conservatively . 
 After an episode of pituitary apoplexy , 80 % of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy . The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency , which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength , obesity and fatigue . 60 – 80 % require hydrocortisone replacement ( either permanently or when unwell ) , 50 – 60 % need thyroid hormone replacement , and 60 – 80 % of men require testosterone supplements . Finally , 10 – 25 % develop diabetes insipidus , the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys due to a lack of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone . This may be treated with the drug desmopressin , which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Pituitary apoplexy is rare . Even in people with a known pituitary tumor , only 0 @.@ 6 – 10 % experience apoplexy ; the risk is higher in larger tumors . Based on extrapolations from existing data , one would expect 18 cases of pituitary apoplexy per one million people every year ; the actual figure is probably lower . 
 The average age at onset is 50 ; cases have reported in people between 15 and 90 years old . Men are affected more commonly than women , with a male @-@ to @-@ female ratio of 1 @.@ 6 . The majority of the underlying tumors are " null cell " or <unk> tumors , which do not produce excessive amounts of hormones ; this might explain why the tumor has often gone undetected prior to an episode of apoplexy . 
 = = History = = 
 The first case description of pituitary apoplexy has been attributed to the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898 . This was followed in 1905 by a further report from the German physician Bleibtreu . Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925 . Before the introduction of steroid replacement , the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50 % . 
 The name of the condition was coined in 1950 in a case series by physicians from Boston City Hospital and Harvard Medical School . The term " apoplexy " was applied as it referred to both necrosis and bleeding into pituitary tumors . 
 = Tricholoma vernaticum = 
 Tricholoma vernaticum is an agaric fungus of the genus Tricholoma native to the Pacific Northwest region of the United States . The fungus was originally described in 1976 as a species of Armillaria when that genus was more inclusive ; it received its current name twenty years later . The stout fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) have moist white to grayish caps ( later becoming grayish @-@ brown with age ) , a membranous ring on the stipe , and an odor resembling cucumbers . Mycorrhizal with conifers , the fungus fruits in the spring or early summer , with its mushrooms appearing on the ground singly or in groups at high elevations , often at the edge of melting snowbanks . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown , but it has a strong unpleasant odor and a mealy taste . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was originally described from California as Armillaria olida by mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Walter Sundberg in 1976 . The type specimen was collected on May 6 , 1972 , in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in El Dorado County . Thiers and Sundberg classified it in the section Ponderosa of genus Armillaria due to its inamyloid spores , but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear . They also noted the similarity of the form and color of its cap to species in section <unk> of genus Lyophyllum . 
 Thiers and Sundberg used a broad species concept of Armillaria , including species with a white spore print , gills attached to the stipe , and a ring formed from a partial veil , regardless of their ecological preferences . Today , Armillaria is restricted to wood @-@ rotting species that form black rhizomorphs , and several mycorrhizal former Armillaria have since been transferred to Tricholoma . The name Tricholoma olida was unavailable for this species , because it was previously used in 1920 by Josef Velenovský , so Kris Shanks proposed the new name T. vernaticum . The specific epithet refers to its growth in the spring . The previous epithet olida derives from the Latin <unk> , meaning " stinking " or " smelling " . 
 Tricholoma vernaticum is classified in the subgenus <unk> of the genus Tricholoma on account of its clamp connections and interwoven hyphae in the cap cuticle . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is convex to broadly convex before flattening out in age , and reaches diameters between 5 and 17 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 7 in ) wide . The surface is dry to moist , smooth , and in maturity appears to be made of flattened fibers arranged radially . As the mushroom ages , the cap color changes from white to fuscous ( dusky brownish grey ) or brown , usually with olive , grayish or pale tan regions . The cap margin , initially curved downward , lifts up and becomes lobed or irregular with age . The flesh is thick and white , with a strongly farinaceous odor similar to cucumber or watermelon rind . Gills initially have an emarginate ( notched ) to adnate attachment to the stipe , but pull away as the mushroom matures to become seceding or almost free from attachment . They are thick and closely spaced , and whitish in color , sometimes developing pale pink tints . The solid stipe measures 4 – 14 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) long by 1 @.@ 3 – 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick , and is either equal in width through its length or slightly club @-@ shaped . It has a dry surface , and a texture that is smooth to silky fibrillose above the ring , and appressed fibrillose to scaly below the ring . The ring , located in the middle to upper half of the stem , is sometimes inconspicuous . The edibility of the mushroom is unknown with certainty , although it has been noted to have a strongly farinaceous taste , and an unpleasant odor " strongly reminiscent of rotting white potatoes . " 
 The spore print is white . Spores are elliptic ( or narrowly so ) , and measure 8 – 12 by 4 @.@ 8 – 6 @.@ 2 µm . There are clamp connections present in the hyphae . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , club @-@ shaped , and measure 23 – 30 by 8 – 10 µm . The hymenium lacks cystidia . The cap flesh comprises homogenous , interwoven hyphae that are 3 – 5 µm in diameter , while the cap cuticle is a 200 – 300 @-@ micrometer thick layer of interwoven , gelatinous hyphae up to 4 µm in diameter . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 When collected in its typical habitat and during the appropriate season , Tricholoma vernaticum mushrooms can be readily identified because of their prominent characteristics : white color , stocky fruit body , farinaceous odor , and ring on the stipe . Tricholoma lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations , typically in autumn . T. <unk> has a gray cap , a stipe with yellow tints , and lacks a ring , while T. mutabile has violet tones in its cap and also lacks a ring . Other lookalikes include Hygrophorus subalpinus and H. <unk> , but these species have broad , waxy gills , and lack the characteristic odor of T. vernaticum . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Fruit bodies of Tricholoma vernaticum grow singly or in groups under conifers in late spring and early summer . A fairly common species throughout its range , it is found at high elevations in California north to Oregon and Washington . It is a snowbank fungus , meaning it is commonly found at the edge of melting snowbanks . Fruit bodies are often buried under humus , forming hardly visible " <unk> " , apparent only as cracked bumps on the ground .

 Serdar Tasci ( Turkish : <unk> , [ <unk> ] ; German : [ <unk> ] ) ( born 24 April 1987 ) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre @-@ back for Russian club Spartak Moscow . 
 Tasci started his career with VfB Stuttgart in 2006 and played with the club until 2013 , captaining the side from 2011 . He played for the club nearly 250 times and helped them win the 2006 – 07 Bundesliga . He missed a large part of the 2013 – 14 season with an injury in his first season with his new club , Spartak Moscow . He represented the German national team from 2008 and 2010 , gaining 14 caps , including the 2010 World Cup , in which Germany came third .

 Tasci was born in Esslingen , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Germany , to Turkish parents from <unk> . He started playing football when he was six ; he then played for the youth teams of SC <unk> , Stuttgarter Kickers and Stuttgart . Before the 2005 – 06 season , he joined Stuttgart 's second team , playing in the Regionalliga ( third division ) . Prior to 2006 – 07 , he was promoted to the club 's Bundesliga side . In October 2006 , he signed a contract that ran until 2010 with the club . 
 After being included as an unused substitute in a match against Nürnberg , Tasci had his professional debut against <unk> Bielefeld on 20 August 2006 ; the match — the second of the season — was a 3 – 2 win in which Tasci was <unk> for injured Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson in the 68th minute . Tasci 's first goal followed a week later in a game against Borussia Dortmund in a 1 – 3 defeat . Tasci 's second goal of the season came on 29 October 2006 , in a 3 – 0 win over Schalke 04 . At the end of the season , Tasci had made twenty @-@ six appearances and scored twice ; he helped the club win the Bundesliga . He came on for Sami Khedira in extra time when Stuttgart lost 3 – 2 to Nürnberg in the final of the DFB @-@ Pokal . Manager Armin Veh said of Tasci , " He is a big surprise and with his 20 years plays well beyond his years . " 
 In the 2007 – 08 season , Tasci made a strong performance against Schalke in the opening game ; kicker described his performance as clever and cool . Tasci made his Champions League debut on matchday one , as Stuttgart lost 2 – 1 to Rangers . He scored his first goal of the season in a 4 – 1 loss against Hamburg on 20 October 2007 . Tasci made twenty @-@ one appearances that season , most of which he missed due to injuries . 
 In the 2008 – 09 season , Tasci found was paired with Khalid <unk> in the center @-@ back position . In the qualification round of the UEFA Cup against Hungarian side <unk> ETO , Tasci scored his first European goal in a 2 – 1 victory , taking his club to the next round . In December 2008 , Tasci 's manager and mentor Veh was sacked . On 4 April 2009 , Tasci scored his first league goal of the season in a 2 – 1 win over Bochum . Tasci missed the rest of the season after injuring his knee in a 2 – 0 loss against Eintracht Frankfurt . He required surgery but decided not to have it , ending his 2008 – 09 season . 
 At the start of the 2009 – 10 season , on 29 August 2009 , Tasci extended his contract with Stuttgart until the summer of 2014 . A buy @-@ out clause was included as part of signing a new contract . He scored his first Champions League goal as Stuttgart drew 1 – 1 with Romanian side Unirea <unk> in the Group @-@ Stage matchday two on 29 September 2009 . In his first half of the season , Tasci captained three matches as a replacement for Thomas Hitzlsperger . However , Tasci sustained " a stress fracture in his foot " that could have put him out for the reminder of the season . He recovered after a few weeks and returned to the first team , where he scored his first goal of the Bundesliga season , in a 1 – 1 draw against Bochum on 5 December 2009 . Following Hitzlsperger removal of captaincy , Tasci was reportedly furious over not being chosen as a vice @-@ captain . On 12 March 2010 , Tasci scored his second league goal of the season , in a 2 – 1 loss against Schalke . A week later on 19 , Tasci was declared injured as he suffered a adductor problem . Six days later , he was declared fit , and was an un @-@ used substitute in a match against Bayern Munich . That season , Tasci made twenty @-@ seven appearance despite recurrence of injuries he sustained during the 2009 – 10 season . 
 At the start of the 2010 – 11 season , Tasci attracted interest from clubs around Europe . Stuttgart 's league rival Hamburger , as well as foreign clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur and Juventus reportedly expressed their desire to sign Tasci . This move was denied by his agent ; he said that Tasci would stay at Stuttgart only . On 15 July 2010 , Tasci expressed his desire to stay at the club . After being excluded from the opening game of the season , Tasci made his first appearance in a 3 – 2 loss against Borussia Dortmund . He scored his first goal for the club in the Europa League Group @-@ Stage matchday one in a 3 – 0 win over Young Boys . He then suffered a thigh problem that kept him out for a long time . In late November , Tasci returned to training with a bandage on his right knee . Once again , he was on the sideline after experiencing ongoing problems with his thigh injury despite reporting himself fit . He returned to the field on 19 December 2010 in the match against Bayern Munich , which Stuttgart lost 5 – 3 . Despite his injury , Tasci would go on to make twenty @-@ six league appearances . He continued to attract interest from Zenit Saint Petersburg , Tottenham Hotspur , Málaga and Arsenal . 
 In the 2011 – 12 season , Tasci scored his first goal of the season in a 3 – 0 win over Hannover on 10 <unk> and scored his second in a 1 – 1 draw against Borussia Dortmund on 29 October 2011 . Halfway through the 2011 – 12 season , on 12 January 2012 , Tasci was appointed the new captain of VfB Stuttgart by Bruno <unk> . Seven days before being appointed , Tasci and Cristian Molinaro were involved in an incident at training . Tasci third goal came on 10 April 2012 in a 3 – 1 win over Augsburg . Despite injuries , he appeared twenty @-@ eight times that season . 
 In the 2012 – 13 season , Tasci revealed that Spanish club Barcelona was interested in signing him . But in late July , he said that though he was linked with a move to Barcelona , AC Milan and Manchester City , the clubs had not officially approached him . This occurred as the club was making budget cuts , including the wages bill . As the season started , Tasci remained as captain of Stuttgart . In October , Tasci injured his Achilles tendon that kept him out for a short while ; he made his return against Hamburg on 21 October 2012 . Tasci scored his first goal for the club in an Europa League 5 – 1 win over Steaua București to help the club progress to the knockout stage . On 1 December 2012 , Tasci received a straight red card for a serious foul play on Milorad <unk> in a 1 – 0 victory over Greuther Fürth . Later in April 2013 , he was sidelined as he suffered from an achilles tendon rupture . Tasci made his return a week later as Stuttgart beat Schalke 2 – 1 on 11 May 2013 . In the DFB @-@ Pokal Final , Tasci captained Stuttgart for the match , which the club lost 3 – 2 to Bayern Munich . 
 In the 2013 – 14 season , Tasci sustained an injury during a match against Mainz in the opening game of the season and was replaced by Konstantin Rausch . At treatment , it was revealed that Tasci had torn his lateral meniscus . With one year left on his contract , Tasci said he was aiming to make progress to sign a new contract , having expressed a desire to prolong his contract to stay at Stuttgart .

I have always said that I am a <unk> and that I will remain . " Immediately after joining the club , his debut was delayed by the injuries he sustained while at Stuttgart and he did not play for three weeks . He made his first appearance with the club on 2 October 2013 when he appeared in training . After damaging his meniscus , Tasci announced he would return in January following an operation . Tasci made his debut for the club on 17 March 2014 in a 2 – 2 draw against <unk> <unk> . Tasci would make three more appearances that season . 
 In April 2014 , Izvestia reported that Tasci could be leaving Spartak Moscow , leading to interest from Turkish sides Fenerbahçe and Beşiktaş . Despite making four appearances during the 2013 – 14 season , Tasci said he was learning Russian , though he communicates well in German with his team @-@ mates Lucas Barrios , José Manuel Jurado and Patrick Ebert . He could also communicate in Turkish with his new manager Murat Yakin . 
 Under the management of Yakin , Tasci made his first appearance of the season against Dynamo Moscow on 10 August 2014 , only to come off in the 23rd minutes following an injury , as Spartak Moscow won 2 – 1 . Tasci then scored his first Spartak Moscow goal on 2 November 2014 , in a 3 – 3 draw against Kuban Krasnodar .

 Tasci made his debut for the Germany national under @-@ 21 football team on 6 February 2007 in a 2 – 0 win against Scotland and went on to make his senior international debut for Germany on 20 August 2008 in a friendly match against Belgium in Nuremberg , which they won 2 – 0 . The debut came exactly two years after his Bundesliga debut . 
 He was called up to the Germany squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa by coach Löw , being the second player of Turkish extraction in the squad , along with Özil . Tasci made his World Cup debut as a substitute in Germany 's third place match , against Uruguay , coming on in the 91st minute for Mesut Özil . His World Cup debut was a disappointment ; Tasci struggled to touch the ball in his 125 seconds on the pitch ; the club 's sporting director Jochen Schneider said : " But for Serdar Tasci the World Cup from a purely personal point of view was certainly not satisfactory " .

 Jacobus Anthonie Meessen ( Dutch pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; 5 December 1836 – 14 November 1885 ) was a Dutch photographer who took over 250 portraits and landscapes of the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) between 1864 and 1870 . Born to a carpenter in Utrecht , Meessen worked in that trade in the Indies before marrying in the Netherlands in the early 1860s . He returned to the colony in 1864 , intent on documenting its land and people . He worked mostly in the capital of Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , Java , and Padang , Sumatra ; he also photographed Bangka , Belitung , Borneo , and Nias . 
 When Meessen returned to the Netherlands in 1870 he established a short @-@ lived partnership with Abraham Vermeulen and began disseminating his photographs . Selected images were gifted to King William III in an elaborately decorated album in 1871 , while more were published by De Bussy in 1875 and exhibited in Paris and Amsterdam . In his final years Meessen worked predominantly as an architect . Collections of his albumen prints , some of which were hand @-@ tinted or annotated , are held in four institutions in the Netherlands . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Meessen was born in Utrecht , the Netherlands , on 5 December 1836 to the carpenter Hermanus Johannes Meessen and his wife <unk> <unk> . In 1858 the younger Meessen first went to Batavia ( now Jakarta ) , the capital of the Dutch colony in the East Indies , where he worked as a carpenter . By 1860 he was living in the Purbalingga area . Two years later he returned to the Netherlands , where he served as a special inspector for the Bureau voor den <unk> . On 11 December 1862 he wed Johanna Alida ( <unk> ) Steenbeek in Utrecht , and the couple settled in that city for the next two years . Their marriage produced three daughters , born in 1865 , 1866 , and 1869 ; the first , Antonia , died in infancy . 
 = = = Photography = = = 
 Meessen and his wife departed for the Indies in 1864 , first arriving in Batavia , where Meessen established a photo studio in early 1867 . He was one of the few photographers active in the Indies in the 1860s ; contemporaries included Isidore van Kinsbergen , Adolph Schaefer , and the commercial firm of Woodbury and Page ( operated by Walter B. Woodbury and James Page ) . Meessen hoped to eventually take images of the Indies ' various lands and people . From May to August he was in Sumatra , first in Padang and later in the Minang Highlands . There he offered various photographic services , including double and family portraits . When he returned to Batavia in September , he opened another studio , offering portraits and selling prints of landscapes . 
 Three months later Jacobus and Johanna sold their belongings and moved back to Padang , where the <unk> established a photography studio . In their biography of the photographer , Mattie Boom and Steven Wachlin suggest that this was likely a commercial necessity , as Meessen may have been unable to compete with the Batavia @-@ based Woodbury and Page . By November 1868 Jacobus was advertising his first album , titled Sumatra 's <unk> ( Sumatra 's West Coast ) . Bound in Moroccan leather , the album contained more than sixty landscapes of Padang and surrounding cities ( including Padang Panjang and Fort de Kock ) . By June 1869 , his studio at the Sumatra Hotel was offering workshops , as well as images from northern Sumatra and Nias . 
 Altogether , Meessen 's photographic ventures in the Indies – and the resulting albums – cost some 34 @,@ 000 Netherlands Indies gulden , which included camera equipment ( though it is not known what model ( s ) he used ) , chemicals , transportation , and accommodations . Meessen worked alone , never taking a partner while in the Indies , and documented the land and people in the colony in his albumen prints . In his ethnographic photography of the indigenous peoples of the Indies , he often had to overcome superstitions which , the Bataviaasch Handelsblad wrote , " made taking images of the people outside Java almost impossible " . Others were more enthusiastic , including the villagers of Nias : " Upon arrival I fired a few shots and flew the Dutch flag . Soon the villagers came and asked what I wanted . Once I told them , they promised their assistance . At exactly 5 a.m. the following morning I found some 60 warriors waiting for me on the beach . "

 In June 1869 , Meessen and his wife returned to Batavia , and the following year they returned to Utrecht . There , in late 1870 , Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen to open a new studio , named A. A. Vermeulen & Company . They signed a contract for five years , but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873 . Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen – best known for portraits – had been interested in the possibility of expanding his range with landscapes , whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies . Indeed , in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better @-@ executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to King William III . This album of 153 images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold , and featured the names of Java , Sumatra , Borneo , and Nias in the corners . In the center were silver coconut and banana trees surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons . 
 Over the next few years Meessen continued marketing his images of the Indies . In 1875 he published a collection of 250 – consisting of 175 landscapes and 75 portraits – through the Amsterdam @-@ based printer De Bussy ; this collection was titled <unk> <unk> van Nederlandsch Indië ( Collection of Photographs of the Dutch East Indies ) , sold for 225 gulden , and came in a walnut box . At the 1875 Exposition Géographique in Paris , he exhibited these images to critical acclaim . The Bataviaasch Handelsblad , in one review , wrote that the attempt to document the Indies was commendable , and expressed hope that images of animals could also be taken . In 1883 Meessen again exhibited his photographs , this time at the International Colonial and Export Trade Exhibition in Amsterdam . Ultimately , however , he does not appear to have made a return on his investment . 
 Meessen 's final years were migratory , with some time spent in <unk> and other parts of <unk> , Friesland . He worked as a building superintendent , and later municipal architect . One of his projects in this capacity was an elementary school on <unk> <unk> Street in <unk> , a Neo @-@ Gothic building – possibly influenced by similar schools in <unk> and Amsterdam – constructed to replace an older school which had been demolished . Meessen died in <unk> on 14 November 1885 after being stricken by an illness three days earlier . The incomplete school was finished by <unk> Petrus Nicolaas <unk> . 
 = = Style and legacy = = 
 Reviewing the quality of Meessen 's photography , Boom and <unk> write that his Javanese pictures are among his best , whereas those from other islands are of more variable quality . They note considerable detail in his cityscapes . He chose buildings to photograph that were popular with other photographers , including the Governor General 's Palace and the home of Raden Saleh . Many of his studio portraits appear to be purely commercial , leading Boom and Wachlin to suggest that they were meant to fund Meessen 's landscape photography . Some of his images , particularly the portraits , were hand @-@ tinted . 
 Meessen 's photos from the album he gave to King William III are kept in the Hague at the National Library of the Netherlands . This album features a travelogue regarding Meessen 's photography , as well as images from six islands ( Java , Sumatra , Bangka , Belitung , Borneo , and Nias ) and various ethnic groups , including the Javanese , Chinese , Dayaks , and Malays . He includes commentary on several images of people , noting in an image of njai ( concubines ) : " [ They are ] a necessary evil for the military . They preserve , in and outside the barracks , the best discipline , and prove invaluable in expeditions or sea journeys . " 
 Two further photographs , one of the river <unk> in Batavia , and another of Kali Mati in Padang , are held at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam . The Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies holds a copy of the De Bussy publication , and the Leiden University Library holds 281 prints , 7 of which are of disputed provenance , which were donated to the Royal Dutch Geographical Society by Pieter Johannes <unk> in 1891 . The four extant collections of Meessen 's work are considerably fewer than those of his contemporaries such as Woodbury and Page , and his oeuvre has been little studied or collected .

 Applewood Farm is a farmstead in Ledyard , Connecticut , United States . Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup , the farmhouse was built with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details that has been modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan . Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup , Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup , the last member of the family to own the property . The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40 @-@ acre parcel was sold off in November 1984 . After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s . In 1987 , the property included five contributory structures , the farmhouse , corn crib , barn , silo and chicken coop . The property also has one non @-@ contributing structure , a machinery shed from the 1960s .

 The farmhouse was built by Russel Gallup in 1826 before the incorporation of the town of Ledyard in 1836 . Gallup served as a member of the Connecticut Militia in the War of 1812 . He would hold the office of deacon for the Ledyard Congregation Church for over fifty years . The property was split as a deed to his second son , Rufus Gallup in 1855 and ownership passed upon Russel Gallup 's death in 1869 . Rufus Gallup took the same approach with his son , Russell Gallup II , and split the property in 1877 . Russell Gallup II was a teacher and became a Judge of Probate from 1896 until his death in 1911 . Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s and was the last member of the Gallup family to own the farm . The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen . A 40 @-@ acre parcel of the original property was sold to <unk> in November 1984 . The house was acquired by the Betz family , who sought to operate the farmhouse as a bed and breakfast . Betz owned the farmhouse at the time of its nomination to the National Historic Register in 1987 . Applewood Farm operated as " Applewood Farms Inn " , serving as a six @-@ guest room bed and breakfast through the 1990s . In 2005 , the property was sold from <unk> Estates LLC

 Built around 1826 by Russel Gallup , the two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story Applewood Farm 's farmhouse design harkens back to the earlier colonial center chimney design with Federal style details . The National Register of Historic Places nomination form states that the house 's construction may have been influenced by an earlier house built on the opposite side of <unk> Ledyard Highway , but there is no evidence for that design , but notes that it was a <unk> example . The farmhouse is 36 feet ( 11 m ) feet long and 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) . Around 1842 a 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ story wing was added to the east side . The rear ell , a one @-@ and @-@ half @-@ story structure measuring 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) , connects to a 60 feet ( 18 m ) by 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) shed . The house and its additions are all topped with gable roofs and were using wooden shingles at the time of its historic nomination in 1987 . The farmhouse has six fireplaces , with those on the first floor are made of cut granite blocks also with granite <unk> and the second floor are made of brick with granite lintels with brick hearths . The house has had modernization throughout the years , including modernizing the kitchen and bathrooms that has not significantly altered the floor plan . The hardware in the house was modernized and updated over the years , but had reproduction colonial hardware and early 20th @-@ century hardware at the time of its nomination . Some changes , like the installation of a new door in 1986 were done specifically to meet fire code regulations . 
 Contributing to the property is a 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) by 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) corn crib that has been previously rebuilt and dated to around the 19th century at the time of its nomination . The barn , a post @-@ and @-@ beam construction , is 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) long and 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) with large double doors on the east and west sides . The rafters were made with a single planed side and the " rest is left round " . Attached to the barn is an early 20th century dairy shed measuring 43 feet ( 13 m ) long by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide . Other contributing assets include a 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) in circumference silo and a 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 45 feet ( 14 m ) , both likely built in the early 20th century . A machinery shed dating to the 1960s was specifically listed a non @-@ contributory asset .

 Applewood Farm has served as a farm for over a century , with an 1850 census reporting it produced butter , cheese , rye , Indian corn , oats , wool , Irish potatoes and hay . Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards . After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s , the farm produced fresh fruits and vegetables and poultry , eggs and dairy products . In 1994 , the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup . Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that played an important role in the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house . 
 = Waveguide filter = 
 A waveguide filter is an electronic filter that is constructed with waveguide technology . Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted . Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass ( the passband ) , while others are rejected ( the stopband ) . Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications . These include selection of signals and limitation of noise . Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies , where they are a convenient size and have low loss . Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications , telephone networks , and television broadcasting . 
 Waveguide filters were developed during World War II to meet the needs of radar and electronic countermeasures , but afterwards soon found civilian applications such as use in microwave links . Much of post @-@ war development was concerned with reducing the bulk and weight of these filters , first by using new analysis techniques that led to elimination of unnecessary components , then by innovations such as dual @-@ mode cavities and novel materials such as ceramic resonators . 
 A particular feature of waveguide filter design concerns the mode of transmission . Systems based on pairs of conducting wires and similar technologies have only one mode of transmission . In waveguide systems , any number of modes are possible . This can be both a disadvantage , as spurious modes frequently cause problems , and an advantage , as a dual @-@ mode design can be much smaller than the equivalent waveguide single mode design . The chief advantages of waveguide filters over other technologies are their ability to handle high power and their low loss . The chief disadvantages are their bulk and cost when compared with technologies such as microstrip filters . 
 There is a wide array of different types of waveguide filters . Many of them consist of a chain of coupled resonators of some kind that can be modelled as a ladder network of LC circuits . One of the most common types consists of a number of coupled resonant cavities . Even within this type , there are many subtypes , mostly differentiated by the means of coupling . These coupling types include apertures , [ w ] irises , [ x ] and posts . Other waveguide filter types include dielectric resonator filters , insert filters , finline filters , corrugated @-@ waveguide filters , and stub filters . A number of waveguide components have filter theory applied to their design , but their purpose is something other than to filter signals . Such devices include impedance matching components , directional couplers , and diplexers . These devices frequently take on the form of a filter , at least in part . 
 = = Scope = = 
 The common meaning of waveguide , when the term is used unqualified , is the hollow metal kind , but other waveguide technologies are possible . The scope of this article is limited to the metal @-@ tube type . The post @-@ wall waveguide structure is something of a variant , but is related enough to include in this article — the wave is mostly surrounded by conducting material . It is possible to construct waveguides out of dielectric rods , the most well known example being optical fibres . This subject is outside the scope of the article with the exception that dielectric rod resonators are sometimes used inside hollow metal waveguides . Transmission line [ o ] technologies such as conducting wires and microstrip can be thought of as waveguides , but are not commonly called such and are also outside the scope of this article . 
 = = Basic concepts = = 
 = = = Filters = = = 
 In electronics , filters are used to allow signals of a certain band of frequencies to pass while blocking others . They are a basic building block of electronic systems and have a great many applications . Amongst the uses of waveguide filters are the construction of <unk> , diplexers , [ d ] and multiplexers ; selectivity and noise limitation in receivers ; and harmonic distortion suppression in transmitters . 
 = = = Waveguides = = = 
 Waveguides are metal conduits used to confine and direct radio signals . They are usually made of brass , but aluminium and copper are also used . Most commonly they are rectangular , but other cross @-@ sections such as circular or elliptical are possible . A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components . It has much the same range of applications as other filter technologies in electronics and radio engineering but is very different mechanically and in principle of operation . 
 The technology used for constructing filters is chosen to a large extent by the frequency of operation that is expected , although there is a large amount of overlap . Low frequency applications such as audio electronics use filters composed of discrete capacitors and inductors . Somewhere in the very high frequency band , designers switch to using components made of pieces of transmission line . [ p ] These kinds of designs are called distributed element filters . Filters made from discrete components are sometimes called lumped element filters to distinguish them . At still higher frequencies , the microwave bands , the design switches to waveguide filters , or sometimes a combination of waveguides and transmission lines . 
 Waveguide filters have much more in common with transmission line filters than lumped element filters ; they do not contain any discrete capacitors or inductors . However , the waveguide design may frequently be equivalent ( or approximately so ) to a lumped element design . Indeed , the design of waveguide filters frequently starts from a lumped element design and then converts the elements of that design into waveguide components . 
 = = = Modes = = = 
 One of the most important differences in the operation of waveguide filters compared to transmission line designs concerns the mode of transmission of the electromagnetic wave carrying the signal . In a transmission line , the wave is associated with electric currents on a pair of conductors . The conductors constrain the currents to be parallel to the line , and consequently both the magnetic and electric components of the electromagnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of travel of the wave . This transverse mode is designated TEM [ l ] ( transverse electromagnetic ) . On the other hand , there are infinitely many modes that any completely hollow waveguide can support , but the TEM mode is not one of them . Waveguide modes are designated either TE [ m ] ( transverse electric ) or TM [ n ] ( transverse magnetic ) , followed by a pair of suffixes identifying the precise mode . 
 This multiplicity of modes can cause problems in waveguide filters when spurious modes are generated . Designs are usually based on a single mode and frequently incorporate features to suppress the unwanted modes . On the other hand , advantage can be had from choosing the right mode for the application , and even sometimes making use of more than one mode at once . Where only a single mode is in use , the waveguide can be modelled like a conducting transmission line and results from transmission line theory can be applied . 
 = = = Cutoff = = = 
 Another feature peculiar to waveguide filters is that there is a definite frequency , the cutoff frequency , below which no transmission can take place . This means that in theory low @-@ pass filters cannot be made in waveguides . However , designers frequently take a lumped element low @-@ pass filter design and convert it to a waveguide implementation . The filter is consequently low @-@ pass by design and may be considered a low @-@ pass filter for all practical purposes if the cutoff frequency is below any frequency of interest to the application . The waveguide cutoff frequency is a function of transmission mode , so at a given frequency , the waveguide may be usable in some modes but not others . Likewise , the guide wavelength [ h ] ( λg ) and characteristic impedance [ b ] ( Z0 ) of the guide at a given frequency also depend on mode . 
 = = = Dominant mode = = = 
 The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency of all the modes is called the dominant mode . Between cutoff and the next highest mode , this is the only mode it is possible to transmit , which is why it is described as dominant . Any spurious modes generated are rapidly attenuated along the length of the guide and soon disappear . Practical filter designs are frequently made to operate in the dominant mode . 
 In rectangular waveguide , the TE10 [ q ] mode ( shown in figure 2 ) is the dominant mode . There is a band of frequencies between the dominant mode cutoff and the next highest mode cutoff in which the waveguide can be operated without any possibility of generating spurious modes . The next highest cutoff modes are TE20 , [ r ] at exactly twice the TE10 mode , and TE01 [ s ] which is also twice TE10 if the waveguide used has the commonly used aspect ratio of 2 : 1 . The lowest cutoff TM mode is <unk> [ t ] ( shown in figure 2 ) which is <formula> times the dominant mode in 2 : 1 waveguide . Thus , there is an octave over which the dominant mode is free of spurious modes , although operating too close to cutoff is usually avoided because of phase distortion . 
 In circular waveguide , the dominant mode is TE11 [ u ] and is shown in figure 2 . The next highest mode is <unk> . [ v ] The range over which the dominant mode is guaranteed to be spurious @-@ mode free is less than that in rectangular waveguide ; the ratio of highest to lowest frequency is approximately 1 @.@ 3 in circular waveguide , compared to 2 @.@ 0 in rectangular guide . 
 = = = Evanescent modes = = = 
 Evanescent modes are modes below the cutoff frequency . They cannot propagate down the waveguide for any distance , dying away exponentially . However , they are important in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts , described later , because energy is stored in the evanescent wave fields . 
 = = Advantages and disadvantages = = 
 Like transmission line filters , waveguide filters always have multiple passbands , replicas of the lumped element prototype . In most designs , only the lowest frequency passband is useful ( or lowest two in the case of band @-@ stop filters ) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts . This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out , although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands . Consequently , in any given filter design , there is an upper frequency beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function . For this reason , true low @-@ pass and high @-@ pass filters cannot exist in waveguide . At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter . But , similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency , the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest . 
 The range of frequencies over which waveguide filters are useful is largely determined by the waveguide size needed . At lower frequencies the waveguide needs to be impractically large in order to keep the cutoff frequency below the operational frequency . On the other hand , filters whose operating frequencies are so high that the wavelengths are sub @-@ millimetre cannot be manufactured with normal machine shop processes . At frequencies this high , fibre @-@ optic technology starts to become an option . 
 Waveguides are a low @-@ loss medium . Losses in waveguides mostly come from ohmic dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls . Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide and is usually the preferred format , but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications . Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls . In some applications which require rigorous filtering , the walls are plated with a thin layer of gold or silver to improve surface conductivity . An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss , high selectivity , and linear group delay from their filters . 
 One of the main advantages of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies is the quality of their resonators . Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor , or just Q. The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands , orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators . The resistance of conductors , especially in wound inductors , limits the Q of TEM resonators . This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides , with greater stop band rejection . The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the ohmic losses in the walls described earlier , but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q. 
 Waveguides have good power handling capability , which leads to filter applications in radar . Despite the performance advantages of waveguide filters , microstrip is often the preferred technology due to its low cost . This is especially true for consumer items and the lower microwave frequencies . <unk> circuits can be manufactured by cheap printed circuit technology , and when integrated on the same printed board as other circuit blocks they incur little additional cost .

 The idea of a waveguide for electromagnetic waves was first suggested by Lord Rayleigh in 1897 . Rayleigh proposed that a coaxial transmission line could have the centre conductor removed , and waves would still propagate down the inside of the remaining cylindrical conductor despite there no longer being a complete electrical circuit of conductors . He described this in terms of the wave reflecting repeatedly off the internal wall of the outer conductor in a zig @-@ zag fashion as it progressed down the waveguide . Rayleigh was also the first to realise that there was a critical wavelength , the cutoff wavelength , proportional to the cylinder diameter , above which wave propagation is not possible . Waveguides were first developed , in a circular form , by George Clark Southworth and J. F. Hargreaves in 1932 . 
 The first analogue filter design which went beyond a simple single resonator was created by George Ashley Campbell in 1910 and marked the beginning of filter theory . Campbell 's filter was a lumped @-@ element design of capacitors and inductors suggested by his work with loading coils . Otto Zobel and others quickly developed this further . Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War II . A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937 ; a patent filed by Mason in 1927 may contain the first published filter design using distributed elements . 
 Mason and Sykes ' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires , but other researchers later applied the principles to waveguides as well . Much development on waveguide filters was carried out during World War II driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic countermeasures . A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory ( Rad Lab ) , but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved such as the Telecommunications Research Establishment in the UK . Amongst the well @-@ known scientists and engineers at Rad Lab were Julian Schwinger , Nathan <unk> , Edward Mills Purcell , and Hans Bethe . Bethe was only at Rad Lab a short time but produced his aperture theory while there . Aperture theory is important for waveguide cavity filters , which were first developed at Rad Lab . Their work was published after the war in 1948 and includes an early description of dual @-@ mode cavities by Fano and Lawson . 
 Theoretical work following the war included the commensurate line theory of Paul Richards . Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length ( or in some cases multiples of the unit length ) , although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances . [ a ] Richards ' transformation allows any lumped element design to be taken " as is " and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation . In 1955 K. Kuroda published the transformations known as Kuroda 's identities . These made Richard 's work more usable in unbalanced and waveguide formats by eliminating the problematic series connected elements , but it was some time before Kuroda 's Japanese work became widely known in the English speaking world . Another theoretical development was the network synthesis filter approach of Wilhelm Cauer in which he used the Chebyshev approximation to determine element values . Cauer 's work was largely developed during World War II ( Cauer was killed towards the end of it ) , but could not be widely published until hostilities ended . While Cauer 's work concerns lumped elements , it is of some importance to waveguide filters ; the Chebyshev filter , a special case of Cauer 's synthesis , is widely used as a prototype filter for waveguide designs . 
 Designs in the 1950s started with a lumped element prototype ( a technique still in use today ) , arriving after various transformations at the desired filter in a waveguide form . At the time , this approach was yielding fractional bandwidths no more than about 1 / 5 . In 1957 , Leo Young at Stanford Research Institute published a method for designing filters which started with a distributed element prototype , the stepped impedance prototype . This filter was based on quarter @-@ wave impedance transformers of various widths and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an octave ( a fractional bandwidth of 2 / 3 ) . Young 's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators , but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types . 
 The first published account of a cross @-@ coupled filter is due to John R. Pierce at Bell Labs in a 1948 patent . A cross @-@ coupled filter is one in which resonators that are not immediately adjacent are coupled . The additional degrees of freedom thus provided allow the designer to create filters with improved performance , or , alternatively , with fewer resonators . One version of Pierce 's filter , shown in figure 3 , uses circular waveguide cavity resonators to link between rectangular guide cavity resonators . This principle was not at first much used by waveguide filter designers , but it was used extensively by mechanical filter designers in the 1960s , particularly R. A. Johnson at Collins Radio Company . 
 The initial non @-@ military application of waveguide filters was in the microwave links used by telecommunications companies to provide the backbone of their networks . These links were also used by other industries with large , fixed networks , notably television broadcasters . Such applications were part of large capital investment programs . They are now also used in satellite communications systems . 
 The need for frequency @-@ independent delay in satellite applications led to more research into the waveguide incarnation of cross @-@ coupled filters . Previously , satellite communications systems used a separate component for delay equalisation . The additional degrees of freedom obtained from cross @-@ coupled filters held out the possibility of designing a flat delay into a filter without compromising other performance parameters . A component that simultaneously functioned as both filter and equaliser would save valuable weight and space . The needs of satellite communication also drove research into the more exotic resonator modes in the 1970s . Of particular prominence in this respect is the work of E. L. Griffin and F. A. Young , who investigated better modes for the 12 @-@ 14 GHz band when this began to be used for satellites in the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 Another space @-@ saving innovation was the dielectric resonator , which can be used in other filter formats as well as waveguide . The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965 , using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material . Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s , however , had very poor temperature coefficients , typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of <unk> , which led to instability of filter parameters . Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving . This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s . The first of these was from Massé and <unk> using barium <unk> at Raytheon in 1972 . Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and Murata Manufacturing . Bell Labs ' barium <unk> resonator had a dielectric constant of 40 and Q of 5000 – 10 @,@ 000 at 2 @-@ 7 GHz . Modern temperature @-@ stable materials have a dielectric constant of about 90 at microwave frequencies , but research is continuing to find materials with both low loss and high permittivity ; lower permittivity materials , such as zirconium <unk> titanate ( <unk> ) with a dielectric constant of 38 , are still sometimes used for their low loss property . 
 An alternative approach to designing smaller waveguide filters was provided by the use of non @-@ propagating evanescent modes . Jaynes and Edson proposed evanescent mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s . Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966 . Since then , evanescent mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations . 
 A relatively recent technology being used inside hollow @-@ metal @-@ waveguide filters is finline , a kind of planar dielectric waveguide . Finline was first described by Paul Meier in 1972 . 
 = = = <unk> history = = = 
 <unk> were first described by Fano and Lawson in 1948 . Pierce was the first to describe multiplexers with contiguous passbands . <unk> using directional filters was invented by Seymour Cohn and Frank Coale in the 1950s . <unk> with compensating immittance resonators at each junction are largely the work of E. G. Cristal and G. L. Matthaei in the 1960s . This technique is still sometimes used , but the modern availability of computing power has led to the more common use of synthesis techniques which can directly produce matching filters without the need for these additional resonators . In 1965 R. J. Wenzel discovered that filters which were singly terminated , [ k ] rather than the usual doubly terminated , were complementary — exactly what was needed for a diplexer . [ c ] Wenzel was inspired by the lectures of circuit theorist Ernst Guillemin . 
 Multi @-@ channel , multi @-@ octave multiplexers were investigated by Harold Schumacher at <unk> Corporation , and his results were published in 1976 . The principle that multiplexer filters may be matched when joined together by modifying the first few elements , thus doing away with the compensating resonators , was discovered accidentally by E. J. Curly around 1968 when he <unk> a diplexer . A formal theory for this was provided by J. D. Rhodes in 1976 and generalised to multiplexers by Rhodes and Ralph Levy in 1979 . 
 From the 1980s , planar technologies , especially microstrip , have tended to replace other technologies used for constructing filters and multiplexers , especially in products aimed at the consumer market . The recent innovation of post @-@ wall waveguide allows waveguide designs to be implemented on a flat substrate with low @-@ cost manufacturing techniques similar to those used for microstrip . 
 = = Components = = 
 Waveguide filter designs frequently consist of two different components repeated a number of times . Typically , one component is a resonator or discontinuity with a lumped circuit equivalent of an inductor , capacitor , or LC resonant circuit . Often , the filter type will take its name from the style of this component . These components are spaced apart by a second component , a length of guide which acts as an impedance transformer . The impedance transformers have the effect of making alternate instances of the first component appear to be a different impedance . The net result is a lumped element equivalent circuit of a ladder network . Lumped element filters are commonly ladder topology , and such a circuit is a typical starting point for waveguide filter designs . Figure 4 shows such a ladder . Typically , waveguide components are resonators , and the equivalent circuit would be LC resonators instead of the capacitors and inductors shown , but circuits like figure 4 are still used as prototype filters with the use of a band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop transformation . 
 Filter performance parameters , such as stopband rejection and rate of transition between passband and stopband , are improved by adding more components and thus increasing the length of the filter . Where the components are repeated identically , the filter is an image parameter filter design , and performance is enhanced simply by adding more identical elements . This approach is typically used in filter designs which use a large number of closely spaced elements such as the waffle @-@ iron filter . For designs where the elements are more widely spaced , better results can be obtained using a network synthesis filter design , such as the common Chebyshev filter and Butterworth filters . In this approach the circuit elements do not all have the same value , and consequently the components are not all the same dimensions . Furthermore , if the design is enhanced by adding more components then all the element values must be calculated again from scratch . In general , there will be no common values between the two instances of the design . Chebyshev waveguide filters are used where the filtering requirements are rigorous , such as satellite applications .

 An impedance transformer is a device which makes an impedance at its output port appear as a different impedance at its input port . In waveguide , this device is simply a short length of waveguide . Especially useful is the quarter @-@ wave impedance transformer which has a length of λg / 4 . This device can turn capacitances into inductances and vice versa . It also has the useful property of turning shunt @-@ connected elements into series @-@ connected elements and vice versa . Series @-@ connected elements are otherwise difficult to implement in waveguide . 
 = = = Reflections and discontinuities = = = 
 Many waveguide filter components work by introducing a sudden change , a discontinuity , to the transmission properties of the waveguide . Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point . This arises in the following way : the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction , the ratio of the two being known as the reflection coefficient . This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection . This impedance must be reactive , that is , it must be a capacitance or an inductance . It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed — it is all either transmitted onward or reflected . Examples of components with this function include irises , stubs , and posts , all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur . 
 = = = Impedance step = = = 
 An impedance step is an example of a device introducing a discontinuity . It is achieved by a step change in the physical dimensions of the waveguide . This results in a step change in the characteristic impedance of the waveguide . The step can be in either the E @-@ plane [ f ] ( change of height [ j ] ) or the H @-@ plane [ g ] ( change of width [ i ] ) of the waveguide . 
 = = Resonant cavity filter = = 
 = = = Cavity resonator = = = 
 A basic component of waveguide filters is the cavity resonator . This consists of a short length of waveguide blocked at both ends . Waves trapped inside the resonator are reflected back and forth between the two ends . A given geometry of cavity will resonate at a characteristic frequency . The resonance effect can be used to selectively pass certain frequencies . Their use in a filter structure requires that some of the wave is allowed to pass out of one cavity into another through a coupling structure . However , if the opening in the resonator is kept small then a valid design approach is to design the cavity as if it were completely closed and errors will be minimal . A number of different coupling mechanisms are used in different classes of filter . 
 The nomenclature for modes in a cavity introduces a third index , for example TE011 . The first two indices describe the wave travelling up and down the length of the cavity , that is , they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide . The third index describes the longitudinal mode caused by the interference pattern of the forward travelling and reflected waves . The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths down the length of the guide . The most common modes used are the dominant modes : <unk> in rectangular waveguide , and <unk> in circular waveguide . TE011 circular mode is used where very low loss ( hence high Q ) is required but cannot be used in a dual @-@ mode filter because it is circularly symmetric . Better modes for rectangular waveguide in dual @-@ mode filters are <unk> and <unk> . However , even better is the <unk> circular waveguide mode which can achieve a Q of 16 @,@ 000 at 12 GHz . 
 = = = Tuning screw = = = 
 Tuning screws are screws inserted into resonant cavities which can be adjusted externally to the waveguide . They provide fine tuning of the resonant frequency by inserting more , or less thread into the waveguide . Examples can be seen in the post filter of figure 1 : each cavity has a tuning screw secured with jam nuts and thread @-@ locking compound . For screws inserted only a small distance , the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor , increasing in value as the screw is inserted . However , when the screw has been inserted a distance λ / 4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit . Inserting it further it causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive , that is , the arithmetic sign changes . 
 = = = Iris = = = 
 An iris is a thin metal plate across the waveguide with one or more holes in it . It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity . Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5 . An iris which reduces the width of a rectangular waveguide has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductance , whereas one which restricts the height is equivalent to a shunt capacitance . An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC resonant circuit . A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide . <unk> filters frequently use irises with small holes . These are always inductive regardless of the shape of the hole or its position on the iris . Circular holes are simple to machine , but elongated holes , or holes in the shape of a cross , are advantageous in allowing the selection of a particular mode of coupling . 
 Irises are a form of discontinuity and work by exciting evanescent higher modes . Vertical edges are parallel to the electric field ( E field ) and excite TE modes . The stored energy in TE modes is predominately in the magnetic field ( H field ) , and consequently the lumped equivalent of this structure is an inductor . Horizontal edges are parallel to the H field and excite TM modes . In this case the stored energy is predominately in the E field and the lumped equivalent is a capacitor . 
 It is fairly simple to make irises that are mechanically adjustable . A thin plate of metal can be pushed in and out of a narrow slot in the side of the waveguide . The iris construction is sometimes chosen for this ability to make a variable component . 
 = = = Iris @-@ coupled filter = = = 
 An iris @-@ coupled filter consists of a cascade of impedance transformers in the form of waveguide resonant cavities coupled together by irises . In high power applications capacitive irises are avoided . The reduction in height of the waveguide ( the direction of the E field ) causes the electric field strength across the gap to increase and arcing ( or dielectric breakdown if the waveguide is filled with an insulator ) will occur at a lower power than it would otherwise . 
 = = = Post filter = = = 
 Posts are conducting bars , usually circular , fixed internally across the height of the waveguide and are another means of introducing a discontinuity . A thin post has an equivalent circuit of a shunt inductor . A row of posts can be viewed as a form of inductive iris . 
 A post filter consists of several rows of posts across the width of the waveguide which separate the waveguide into resonant cavities as shown in figure 7 . Differing numbers of posts can be used in each row to achieve varying values of inductance . An example can be seen in figure 1 . The filter operates in the same way as the iris @-@ coupled filter but differs in the method of construction . 
 = = = Post @-@ wall waveguide = = = 
 A post @-@ wall waveguide , or substrate integrated waveguide , is a more recent format that seeks to combine the advantages of low radiation loss , high Q , and high power handling of traditional hollow metal pipe waveguide with the small size and ease of manufacture of planar technologies ( such as the widely used microstrip format ) . It consists of an insulated substrate pierced with two rows of conducting posts which stand in for the side walls of the waveguide . The top and bottom of the substrate are covered with conducting sheets making this a similar construction to the triplate format . The existing manufacturing techniques of printed circuit board or low temperature co @-@ fired ceramic can be used to make post @-@ wall waveguide circuits . This format naturally lends itself to waveguide post filter designs . 
 = = = Dual @-@ mode filter = = = 
 A dual @-@ mode filter is a kind of resonant cavity filter , but in this case each cavity is used to provide two resonators by employing two modes ( two polarizations ) , so halving the volume of the filter for a given order . This improvement in size of the filter is a major advantage in aircraft avionics and space applications . High quality filters in these applications can require many cavities which occupy significant space . 
 = = Dielectric resonator filter = = 
 Dielectric resonators are pieces of dielectric material inserted into the waveguide . They are usually cylindrical since these can be made without machining but other shapes have been used . They can be made with a hole through the centre which is used to secure them to the waveguide . There is no field at the centre when the TE011 circular mode is used so the hole has no adverse effect . The resonators can be mounted coaxial to the waveguide , but usually they are mounted transversally across the width as shown in figure 8 . The latter arrangement allows the resonators to be tuned by inserting a screw through the wall of the waveguide into the centre hole of the resonator . 
 When dielectric resonators are made from a high permittivity material , such as one of the barium <unk> , they have an important space saving advantage compared to cavity resonators . However , they are much more prone to spurious modes . In high @-@ power applications , metal layers may be built into the resonators to conduct heat away since dielectric materials tend to have low thermal conductivity . 
 The resonators can be coupled together with irises or impedance transformers . Alternatively , they can be placed in a stub @-@ like side @-@ housing and coupled through a small aperture . 
 = = = Insert filter = = = 
 In insert filters one or more metal sheets are placed longitudinally down the length of the waveguide as shown in figure 9 . These sheets have holes punched in them to form resonators . The air dielectric gives these resonators a high Q. Several parallel inserts may be used in the same length of waveguide . More compact resonators may be achieved with a thin sheet of dielectric material and printed metallisation instead of holes in metal sheets at the cost of a lower resonator Q. 
 = = = Finline filter = = = 
 Finline is a different kind of waveguide technology in which waves in a thin strip of dielectric are constrained by two strips of metallisation . There are a number of possible topological arrangements of the dielectric and metal strips . Finline is a variation of slot @-@ waveguide but in the case of finline the whole structure is enclosed in a metal shield . This has the advantage that , like hollow metal waveguide , no power is lost by radiation . Finline filters can be made by printing a metallisation pattern on to a sheet of dielectric material and then inserting the sheet into the E @-@ plane of a hollow metal waveguide much as is done with insert filters . The metal waveguide forms the shield for the finline waveguide . Resonators are formed by <unk> a pattern on to the dielectric sheet . More complex patterns than the simple insert filter of figure 9 are easily achieved because the designer does not have to consider the effect on mechanical support of removing metal . This complexity does not add to the manufacturing costs since the number of processes needed does not change when more elements are added to the design . Finline designs are less sensitive to manufacturing tolerances than insert filters and have wide bandwidths . 
 = = Evanescent @-@ mode filter = = 
 It is possible to design filters that operate internally entirely in evanescent modes . This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide , which often forms the housing of the filter , does not need to be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode . Typically , an evanescent mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports . In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter . Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points . In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts . These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of evanescent mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor , thus producing a filtering action . Energy from many different evanescent modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities . However , the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port ; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors . 
 = = Corrugated @-@ waveguide filter = = 
 Corrugated @-@ waveguide filters , also called ridged @-@ waveguide filters , consist of a number of ridges , or teeth , that periodically reduce the internal height of the waveguide as shown in figures 10 and 11 . They are used in applications which simultaneously require a wide passband , good passband matching , and a wide stopband . They are essentially low @-@ pass designs ( above the usual limitation of the cutoff frequency ) , unlike most other forms which are usually band @-@ pass . The distance between teeth is much smaller than the typical λ / 4 distance between elements of other filter designs . Typically , they are designed by the image parameter method with all ridges identical , but other classes of filter such as Chebyshev can be achieved in exchange for complexity of manufacture . In the image design method the equivalent circuit of the ridges is modelled as a cascade of LC half sections . The filter operates in the dominant TE10 mode , but spurious modes can be a problem when they are present . In particular , there is little stopband attenuation of TE20 and <unk> modes . 
 = = = Waffle @-@ iron filter = = = 
 The waffle @-@ iron filter is a variant of the corrugated @-@ waveguide filter . It has similar properties to that filter with the additional advantage that spurious TE20 and <unk> modes are suppressed . In the waffle @-@ iron filter , channels are cut through the ridges longitudinally down the filter . This leaves a matrix of teeth protruding internally from the top and bottom surfaces of the waveguide . This pattern of teeth resembles a waffle iron , hence the name of the filter . 
 = = Waveguide stub filter = = 
 A stub is a short length of waveguide connected to some point in the filter at one end and short @-@ circuited at the other end . Open @-@ circuited stubs are also theoretically possible , but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the stub , resulting in high losses . Stubs are a kind of resonator , and the lumped element equivalent is an LC resonant circuit . However , over a narrow band , stubs can be viewed as an impedance transformer . The short @-@ circuit is transformed into either an inductance or a capacitance depending on the stub length . 
 A waveguide stub filter is made by placing one or more stubs along the length of a waveguide , usually λg / 4 apart , as shown in figure 12 . The ends of the stubs are blanked off to short @-@ circuit them . When the short @-@ circuited stubs are λg / 4 long the filter will be a band @-@ stop filter and the stubs will have a lumped @-@ element approximate equivalent circuit of parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line . When the stubs are λg / 2 long , the filter will be a band @-@ pass filter . In this case the lumped @-@ element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line . 
 = = Absorption filter = = 
 Absorption filters dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat . This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter . Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source . This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter . An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands . A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals . This design is known as a leaky @-@ wave filter . Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band . Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter . Higher frequencies in the unwanted band , however , readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed . These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material . Another , more compact , design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric . 
 = = Filter @-@ like devices = = 
 There are many applications of filters whose design objectives are something other than rejection or passing of certain frequencies . Frequently , a simple device that is intended to work over only a narrow band or just one spot frequency will not look much like a filter design . However , a broadband design for the same item requires many more elements and the design takes on the nature of a filter . Amongst the more common applications of this kind in waveguide are impedance matching networks , directional couplers , power dividers , power combiners , and diplexers . Other possible applications include multiplexers , <unk> , negative @-@ resistance amplifiers , and time @-@ delay networks . 
 = = = Impedance matching = = = 
 A simple method of impedance matching is stub matching with a single stub . However , a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency . This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications . To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used , and the structure then takes on the form of a stub filter . The design proceeds as if it were a filter except that a different parameter is optimised . In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection , passband attenuation , steepness of transition , or some compromise between these . In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match . The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth , but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device . 
 Stubs are not the only format of filter than can be used . In principle , any filter structure could be applied to impedance matching , but some will result in more practical designs than others . A frequent format used for impedance matching in waveguide is the stepped impedance filter . An example can be seen in the duplexer [ e ] pictured in figure 13 . 
 = = = Directional couplers and power combiners = = = 
 Directional couplers , power splitters , and power combiners are all essentially the same type of device , at least when implemented with passive components . A directional coupler splits a small amount of power from the main line to a third port . A more strongly coupled , but otherwise identical , device may be called a power splitter . One that couples exactly half the power to the third port ( a 3 dB coupler ) is the maximum coupling achievable without reversing the functions of the ports . Many designs of power splitter can be used in reverse , whereupon they become power combiners . 
 A simple form of directional coupler is two parallel transmission lines coupled together over a λ / 4 length . This design is limited because the electrical length of the coupler will only be λ / 4 at one specific frequency . Coupling will be a maximum at this frequency and fall away on either side . Similar to the impedance matching case , this can be improved by using multiple elements , resulting in a filter @-@ like structure . A waveguide analogue of this coupled lines approach is the Bethe @-@ hole directional coupler in which two parallel waveguides are stacked on top of each other and a hole provided for coupling . To produce a wideband design , multiple holes are used along the guides as shown in figure 14 and a filter design applied . It is not only the coupled @-@ line design that suffers from being narrow band , all simple designs of waveguide coupler depend on frequency in some way . For instance the rat @-@ race coupler ( which can be implemented directly in waveguide ) works on a completely different principle but still relies on certain lengths being exact in terms of λ . 
 = = = <unk> and <unk> = = = 
 A diplexer is a device used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands into a single signal . This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel , or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another . ( This specific use of a diplexer is called a duplexer . ) The same device can be used to separate the signals again at the far end of the channel . The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self @-@ evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals . Without filtering , some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output . This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch . These problems could be overcome with the use of a 3 dB directional coupler , but as explained in the previous section , a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well . 
 Two widely spaced narrowband signals can be <unk> by joining together the outputs of two appropriate band @-@ pass filters . Steps need to be taken to prevent the filters from coupling to each other when they are at resonance which would cause degradation of their performance . This can be achieved by appropriate spacing . For instance , if the filters are of the iris @-@ coupled type then the iris nearest to the filter junction of filter A is placed <unk> / 4 from the junction where <unk> is the guide wavelength in the passband of filter B. Likewise , the nearest iris of filter B is placed <unk> / 4 from the junction . This works because when filter A is at resonance , filter B is in its stopband and only loosely coupled and vice versa . An alternative arrangement is to have each filter joined to a main waveguide at separate junctions . A decoupling resonator is placed λg / 4 from the junction of each filter . This can be in the form of a short @-@ circuited stub tuned to the resonant frequency of that filter . This arrangement can be extended to multiplexers with any number of bands . 
 For diplexers dealing with contiguous passbands proper account of the crossover characteristics of filters needs to be considered in the design . An especially common case of this is where the diplexer is used to split the entire spectrum into low and high bands . Here a low @-@ pass and a high @-@ pass filter are used instead of band @-@ pass filters . The synthesis techniques used here can equally be applied to narrowband multiplexers and largely remove the need for decoupling resonators . 
 = = = Directional filters = = = 
 A directional filter is a device that combines the functions of a directional coupler and a diplexer . As it is based on a directional coupler it is essentially a four @-@ port device , but like directional couplers , port 4 is commonly permanently terminated internally . Power entering port 1 exits port 3 after being subject to some filtering function ( usually band @-@ pass ) . The remaining power exits port 2 , and since no power is absorbed or reflected this will be the exact complement of the filtering function at port 2 , in this case band @-@ stop . In reverse , power entering ports 2 and 3 is combined at port 1 , but now the power from the signals rejected by the filter is absorbed in the load at port 4 . Figure 15 shows one possible waveguide implementation of a directional filter . Two rectangular waveguides operating in the dominant TE10 mode provide the four ports . These are joined together by a circular waveguide operating in the circular TE11 mode . The circular waveguide contains an iris coupled filter with as many irises as needed to produce the required filter response .

 Characteristic impedance , symbol Z0 , of a waveguide for a particular mode is defined as the ratio of the transverse electric field to the transverse magnetic field of a wave travelling in one direction down the guide . The characteristic impedance for air filled waveguide is given by ,

 where <unk> is the impedance of free space , approximately 377 Ω , λg is the guide wavelength , and λ is the wavelength when unrestricted by the guide . For a dielectric filled waveguide , the expression must be divided by √ κ , where κ is the dielectric constant of the material , and λ replaced by the unrestricted wavelength in the dielectric medium . In some treatments what is called characteristic impedance here is called the wave impedance , and characteristic impedance is defined as proportional to it by some constant .

 = SM UB @-@ 5 = 
 SM UB @-@ 5 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the Imperial German Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. She sank five ships during her career and was broken up in Germany in 1919 . 
 UB @-@ 5 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel in November . UB @-@ 5 was a little more than 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 142 tonnes ( 125 and 140 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . UB @-@ 5 was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly . She was launched and commissioned there as SM UB @-@ 5 in March 1915 . 
 UB @-@ 5 was initially assigned to the Flanders Flotilla in March 1915 and sank five British ships of 996 gross register tons ( GRT ) under the command of Wilhelm Smiths . The U @-@ boat was assigned to the Baltic Flotilla in October 1915 , and relegated to a training role from September 1916 . At the end of the war , UB @-@ 5 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany 's U @-@ boat fleet . She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Dräger at Lübeck , Germany , in 1919 . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the Imperial German Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow environment off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . UB @-@ 5 was part of the initial allotment of eight submarines — numbered UB @-@ 1 to UB @-@ 8 — ordered on 15 October from Germaniawerft of Kiel , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . 
 UB @-@ 5 was laid down by Germaniawerft in Kiel on 22 November . As built , UB @-@ 5 was 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 44 kW ) Daimler 4 @-@ cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 6 @.@ 47 knots ( 11 @.@ 98 km / h ; 7 @.@ 45 mph ) , surfaced , and 5 @.@ 51 knots ( 10 @.@ 20 km / h ; 6 @.@ 34 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 650 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 060 km ; 1 @,@ 900 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 5 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 5 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB @-@ 5 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . 
 After work on UB @-@ 5 was complete at the Germaniwerft yard , UB @-@ 5 was readied for rail shipment . The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars . In early 1915 , the sections of UB @-@ 5 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three @-@ week process . After UB @-@ 5 was assembled and launched sometime in March , she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials . 
 = = Service career = = 
 The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB @-@ 5 on 25 March under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Wilhelm Smiths , a 28 @-@ year @-@ old first @-@ time U @-@ boat commander . UB @-@ 5 soon joined the other UB I boats then comprising the Flanders Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote des Marinekorps U @-@ Flotille Flandern ) , which had been organized on 29 March . When UB @-@ 5 joined the flotilla , Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive , begun in February . During this campaign , enemy vessels in the German @-@ defined war zone ( German : Kriegsgebiet ) , which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom ( including the English Channel ) , were to be sunk . Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag . 
 The UB I boats of the Flanders Flotilla were initially limited to patrols in the Hoofden , the southern portion of the North Sea between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands . UB @-@ 4 made the first sortie of the flotilla on 9 April , and UB @-@ 5 departed on her first patrol soon after . On 15 April , 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ; 6 @.@ 9 mi ) from the North Hinder lightship , UB @-@ 5 scored her first success when she torpedoed and sank the British steamer Ptarmigan . The 784 @-@ ton steamer was carrying a general cargo from Rotterdam to London when she went down with the loss of eight crewmen . 
 After UB @-@ 5 's sister boat UB @-@ 6 pioneered a route around past British anti @-@ submarine nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June , boats of the flotilla began to patrol the western English Channel . UB @-@ 2 , UB @-@ 5 , and UB @-@ 10 soon followed with patrols in the Channel , but were hampered by fog and bad weather . Even though none of the boats sank any ships , by successfully completing their voyages they helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover . 
 On 13 and 14 August , while patrolling in Lowestoft – Cromer area , UB @-@ 5 sank four British fishing smacks with a combined tonnage of just over 200 GRT , the largest being Sunflower and <unk> , each of 60 gross register tons ( GRT ) .

 Germany 's submarine offensive was suspended on 18 September by the chief of the Admiralstab , Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff , In response to American demands after the sinking of the Cunard Line steamer Lusitania in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September .

 = Papal election , 1159 = 
 The Papal election of 4 – 7 September 1159 followed the death of Pope Adrian IV . It resulted in a double election . A majority of the cardinals elected Cardinal Rolando of Siena as Pope Alexander III , but a minority refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate Ottaviano de Monticelli , who took the name Victor IV , creating a schism which lasted until 1178 . 
 The schism was a result of the growing tensions inside the Sacred College of Cardinals concerning the foreign policy of the Holy See . The Papal states in the 12th century were some kind of buffer between two European powers – the Holy Roman Empire and the Norman Kingdom of Sicily . In the period after Concordat of Worms in 1122 the Papacy was allied with Empire rather than with Normans , but during the pontificate of Adrian IV ( 1154 – 59 ) this alliance had broken up because Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa did not fulfil the terms of the treaty of Constance ( 1153 ) that obliged him to help the Papacy to restore its authority in Rome , ruled by the commune , and some other territories of the Papal Patrimony , which fell under the control of the king of Sicily . In these circumstances Adrian IV decided to break the alliance with Emperor and to make peace with William I of Sicily by signing the Treaty of Benevento ( 1156 ) . In the following years there were growing tensions between the papacy and Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa ( e.g. a dispute at the diet of Besançon in 1157 ) . Frederick tried – with significant success – to strengthen his influence on the Church in Germany . The change of the direction of the papal foreign policy resulted with the division of the Sacred College into supporters and opponents of the new policy , who were unable to achieve a compromise after the death of Adrian IV . 
 The election of 1159 had also significant legal consequences . Up to that time , the election of the new Pope required unanimity among the electors , which led to the schism when the existence of factions in the Sacred College made the unanimity impossible . To avoid the schism in the future , Third Lateran Council in 1179 promulgated the decree Licet de <unk> <unk> , which established the rule that the Pope is elected with the majority of two thirds of the cardinals participating in the election . 
 = = Death of Adrian IV = = 
 Pope Adrian IV died on 1 September 1159 . Fearing a possible schism , shortly before his death he recommended to the cardinals the election of Cardinal Bernard of Porto as his successor . 
 = = List of participants = = 
 There were thirty one cardinals in September 1159 . One of them seem not to have participated in the election , leaving the number of thirty electors . : 
 Five electors were created by Pope Innocent II , two by Pope Celestine II , four by Pope Lucius II , eight by Pope Eugenius III and eleven by Pope Adrian IV . 
 = = Absentee = = 
 = = Divisions in the Sacred College = = 
 The College of Cardinals was divided into two factions : the so @-@ called " Sicilian " party , led by chancellor Rolando of Siena and Camerlengo Boso ; they supported pro @-@ Sicilian policy of Adrian IV . The opposite Imperial faction was led by Ottaviano of S. Cecilia . 
 It is known that Sicilian party counted thirteen cardinals . They were chancellor Roland of S. Marco , <unk> Boso of SS . Cosma e Damiano , cardinal @-@ bishops Bernard of Porto , Ubaldo of Ostia , Walter of Albano and Gregorio of Sabina , as well as cardinals <unk> of S. Giorgio , Ubaldo of S. Croce , Ottone of S. Nicola , <unk> of S. Teodoro , Giovanni of S. Anastasia , Ildebrando of SS . Apostoli and Pietro of S. Eustachio . 
 The Imperial party may have counted as many as nine <unk> but only six can be actually identified as its members : Ottaviano of S. Cecilia , Giovanni of SS . Silvestro e Martino , Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere , Imar of Tusculum , Raymond of S. Maria in Via Lata and Simeone of S. Maria in Domnica Guglielmo of S. Pietro in Vincoli was probably the seventh one . Perhaps Cardinal <unk> of S. Adriano also belonged to this faction . The remaining ten cardinals were neutral . 
 It is believed that both factions made some preparations to the election in the last months of the pontificate of Adrian IV , although these attempts are known only from the hostile accounts produced for the polemical purposes during the subsequent schism and it is impossible to verify their factual accuracy . Both sides accused each other of illegal conspiracies . The adherents of Victor IV accused " Sicilians " of receiving the bribes from the king William I of Sicily and the anti @-@ Imperial cities of Brescia , Milan and Piacenza . They ostensibly made an oath not to vote for any candidate outside their circle . On the other hand , " Sicilians " accused imperialists of hatching a plot with the imperial envoy Otto von Wittelsbach , who was present at Rome at the time of the election and gave the significant support to Victor IV in taking control over the Patrimony of St. Peter . It is known that the secular adherents of Cardinal Ottaviano de Monticelli , who was related to the powerful family of the counts of Tusculum , were prepared for the armed confrontation in Rome . Evidently , neither party was prepared for compromise . 
 = = Proceedings = = 
 = = = Election of Alexander III = = = 
 The cardinals assembled in the Vatican Basilica on 4 September , three days after the death of Adrian IV . They had decided that , according to the custom , the election should be unanimous to be valid . It seems that the candidature of Bernard of Porto , recommended by Adrian as acceptable for both factions , had never been even advanced . Both parties put forward candidates mutually unacceptable : the imperial party proposed Ottaviano de Monticelli , while " Sicilians " proposed chancellor Rolando . The cardinals discussed for three days without achieving a compromise . However , the Sicilian party was able to join all the neutral cardinals and probably detached also some members of the imperial faction . On the fourth day ( 7 September ) , Cardinal Rolando of Siena was proclaimed pope by them and took the name Alexander III , although the unanimity had not been achieved and some cardinals still opposed his candidature . According to the manifest of Alexandrine party of October 1159 and an account of Cardinal Boso , on that day Rolando received the votes of all cardinals assembled except three : those of Ottaviano of S. Cecilia , Giovanni of SS . Silvestro e Martino and Guido of S. Maria in Trastevere . Then supporters of Rolando recognized that “ It seemed inappropriate that ... the apostolic see ... should remain any longer without a ruler because of the contentiousness of the aforesaid [ three ] men ” . On the other hand , the opposite party claimed that Ottaviano had still nine votes , and that the Sicilian party , having majority , simply broke the rule that required unanimity for the valid election . However , the version of the imperial cardinals is believed to be less reliable than the version of the Alexandrine party , even if the latter may be also not fully accurate ; based on the subscriptions of the manifests of both parties issued shortly after the election , it is possible to assume that at least twenty @-@ three electors voted for Rolando , and no more than six opposed him . 
 = = = Election of Victor IV = = = 
 The electors of Cardinal Rolando , immediately after proclaiming him Pope , attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which symbolized the assumption of the papal office , but then the election entered the tumultuous stage . Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander ’ s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica . Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter , which was in the hands of Cardinal Boso . In their absence , the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV . The exact number of his electors is not known , but there are good reasons to believe that it amounted six , including Ottaviano himself , since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month . However , it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III . 
 = = = Consecration of Alexander III = = = 
 Pope Alexander III remained in the citadel for a week until he was rescued and escorted from Rome by Odo <unk> , and on September 18 he was eventually bestowed with the purple mantle . On 20 September at the small village of Ninfa , south @-@ east of Velletri , he was consecrated bishop of Rome by Cardinal Ubaldo <unk> , bishop of Ostia e Velletri , and crowned by Cardinal <unk> <unk> , protodeacon of S. Giorgio in <unk> . On 27 September he excommunicated Victor IV and his adherents . 
 = = = Consecration of Victor IV = = = 
 Victor IV was consecrated on 4 October in the abbey of Farfa by Cardinal @-@ Bishop Imar of Tusculum , dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals , assisted by the bishops Ubaldo of Ferentino and Riccardo of Melfi . With the armed assistance of Otto von Wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over the City of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter , while Alexander III took refuge in the territory of the Kingdom of Sicily , and later in France . 
 = = = <unk> of both factions in October 1159 = = = 
 Both rivals together with their adherents defended the legality of their elections . In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects . The “ Alexandrine ” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals , while that of Victorine faction only by five . Supporters of Victor IV , admitting that they were in minority , justified their action by the fact that the opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid . The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction , who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College . 
 = = = Final division of the Sacred College of Cardinals in October 1159 = = = 
 Simeone Borelli joined the obedience of Alexander III already at the end of 1159 . Raymond of S. Maria in Vi Lata did the same between February and April 1160 . Besides , at the end of 1159 Victor IV created at least three new cardinal @-@ deacons : Bernard of SS . Sergio e Bacco , Giovanni of S Maria in Aquiro and Lando of S. Angelo , while Alexander III appointed on February 18 , 1160 cardinal @-@ deacon Milo of S. Maria in Aquiro . 
 = = Schism = = 
 Both popes sent their legates to the catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition . At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I declared himself in favour of Victor IV , and the episcopate of the Empire followed him , with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von <unk> @-@ <unk> and his suffragans . King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV , but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III . It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV . The rest of Europe , namely France , England , Spain , Sweden , Norway , Scotland , Hungary , Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer , recognized Alexander III as true Pope , even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers . The papal schism in Europe was now a fact . 
 The unity of the Church had been restored only after eighteen years , when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice ( 1 August 1177 ) ; shortly thereafter the pro @-@ imperial pope <unk> III ( successor of Victor IV ) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III ( 29 August 1178 ) . Victor IV and his successors Paschal III ( 1164 – 68 ) and <unk> III ( 1168 – 78 ) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church , while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The election of 1159 and the subsequent schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections . The decree Licet de <unk> <unk> issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour of the rule of the majority of two thirds . The decree confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals ( bishops , priests and deacons ) are equal in the papal elections . Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal @-@ priests and cardinal @-@ deacons on equal rights with cardinal @-@ bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election , 1118 , the decree In Nomine Domini ( 1059 ) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal @-@ bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time .

 The first paved road across this portion of Nevada was the Victory Highway , designated in Nevada as State Route 1 . With the formation of the U.S. Highway system , this route was numbered U.S. Route 40 . From the formation of the Interstate Highway System , the highway was gradually upgraded to Interstate Highway standards and signed as Interstate 80 . In 1974 , officials in Utah initiated meetings with officials in Nevada and California to truncate the route of U.S. Route 91 . By that time , US 91 was mostly redundant with Interstate 15 . Nevada officials agreed and further suggested that both US 91 and US 40 be truncated . Nevada officials recommended the changes occur in 1975 , when the last Nevada piece of I @-@ 15 was expected to be completed . The 1976 edition of the Official Highway map for Nevada was the first not showing the US 40 designation . Even though the US Highway designation was removed , the freeway was not yet completed . The last piece of I @-@ 80 in Nevada to be finished was the Lovelock bypass which started construction in 1981 . The 1982 Official Nevada Highway Map was the first to note I @-@ 80 as a contiguous freeway across the state . All of the business loops for I @-@ 80 in Nevada use the historical route of US 40 .

 Nikephoros Phokas ( Greek : Νικηφόρος <unk> , <unk> <unk> ; died 895 / 6 or ca . 900 ) , usually surnamed the Elder to distinguish him from his grandson , Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas , was one of the most prominent Byzantine generals of the late 9th century , and the first important member of the Phokas family . As a youth he was taken into the personal retinue of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian , rising quickly to the posts of protostrator and then governor of Charsianon , whence he fought with success against the Arabs . In ca . 886 he led a major expedition in southern Italy , where his victories laid the foundation for the Byzantine resurgence in the peninsula . After his return , he was raised to the post of Domestic of the Schools , in effect commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , which he led with success against the Arabs in the east and the Bulgarians of Tsar Simeon in the Balkans . He died either in 895 / 6 or , less likely , sometime ca . 900 . Contemporaries and later historians lauded him for his military ability and character . Both of his sons later succeeded him as Domestics of the Schools . His grandsons Nikephoros and Leo were likewise distinguished generals , while the former became emperor in 963 – 969 , spearheading the recovery of several lost provinces from the Arabs .

 = = = Early life and career = = = 
 Nikephoros was the son of the founder of the Phokas family , a man called Phokas , a native of Cappadocia . During one of the campaigns of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian ( reigned 867 – 886 ) sometime in the 870s ( probably ca . 872 ) , Nikephoros ' father caught the emperor 's attention and was raised to the rank of tourmarches . At the same time Nikephoros , still in his youth , was taken into the imperial retinue , and was soon appointed to the guard corps of the <unk> . He possibly participated in Basil 's 873 campaign against Samosata . 
 Shortly after , at any rate before 878 , Nikephoros was promoted to the rank of protostrator and received from the emperor his own palace in the vicinity of the Church of St. Thecla . Eventually he rose to the post of military governor ( strategos ) of the theme of Charsianon , a post from which , according to the continuators of Georgios Monachos , he scored numerous successes against the Arabs . 
 = = = Command in southern Italy = = = 
 Nikephoros remained in command of Charsianon until his appointment as the commander @-@ in @-@ chief ( monostrategos , " single @-@ general " ) against the Arabs in southern Italy in replacement of Stephen Maxentios , who had been defeated by the Arabs . This took place in 885 , according to traditional dating . It is likely , however , that Nikephoros was originally sent to Italy already before that , at the head of a picked detachment of troops from Charsianon , which Theophanes Continuatus records as part of Maxentios ' expeditionary force . His command involved the forces of several western themes ( Thrace , Macedonia , Cephallenia , Longobardia and Calabria ) , but Theophanes Continuatus also reports that Nikephoros received further reinforcements from the themes of Asia Minor , including a Paulician detachment . Nikephoros ' command in Italy lasted until his recall to Constantinople following the accession of Leo VI the Wise , in late 886 . Shaun Tougher however posits that Nikephoros was sent to Italy only after the accession of Leo VI , as Leo in his writings takes credit for his dispatch there , and that his recall was not until ca . 887 . 
 Byzantium had been absent from the affairs of southern Italy for almost a century , but the accession of Basil the Macedonian changed this : from 868 on , the imperial fleet and diplomacy were employed in an effort to secure the Adriatic Sea from Saracen raids , re @-@ establish Byzantine dominance over Dalmatia , and extend Byzantine control once more over parts of Italy . Otranto was taken from the Saracens in 873 , and Bari in 876 . According to the Byzantine sources , during his tenure in Italy Nikephoros recovered numerous towns taken by the Arabs in the previous years , including Taranto , Bari , Santa Severina , Rhegion and Taormina , <unk> and especially <unk> , which Maxentios had previously attacked without success . According to the continuators of Georgios Monachos , he was besieging <unk> when news came of Emperor Basil 's death and his own recall by Leo VI ; Nikephoros kept the news a secret until he had persuaded the Arab garrison to surrender on guarantee of safe passage . During his time in Italy he also took steps to strengthen the Byzantine position by settling many Armenians in the region , as well as 1 @,@ 000 manumitted slaves donated by Emperor Basil 's old benefactor , the widow <unk> . The 11th @-@ century historian John Skylitzes furthermore reports that Nikephoros brought an end to abuse against the local population , by ending the practice of returning Byzantine soldiers carrying off local Italians to be sold off in the East as slaves . According to Skylitzes , the grateful Italians dedicated a church in his honour . By the time of his departure , he had extended Byzantine control over most of Apulia and Calabria . These victories were followed up by his successors and laid the foundation of a resurgence of Byzantine power in southern Italy , culminating in the establishment of the theme of Longobardia in ca . 892 . The regions of Apulia , Calabria and Basilicata would remain firmly under Byzantine control until the 11th century . 
 = = = Domestic of the Schools and the war with Bulgaria = = = 
 His successes in Italy secured Nikephoros a friendly welcome and honours on his return to Constantinople , but he is not mentioned again for several years , until the outbreak of war with Bulgaria in 894 . In the meantime , he was raised to the rank of patrikios and named to the post of Domestic of the Schools , in effect commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Byzantine army , after the death of his predecessor , Andrew the Scythian . 
 In 895 , he was sent against the Bulgarians at the head of a large army . It is unclear whether Nikephoros engaged the Bulgarians in battle , for a Byzantine @-@ instigated invasion by the Magyars from the north , and the activities of the Byzantine navy in the Danube , forced the Bulgarian ruler Simeon to ask for a truce , and the Byzantines withdrew . 
 This is the last campaign associated with Nikephoros Phokas , and Symeon Logothetes reports that he died in 895 / 6 . His death reportedly encouraged Tsar Simeon to reopen hostilities , with devastating success against Nikephoros ' successor as Domestic , Leo Katakalon . The later chronicle of Theophanes Continuatus , however , reports a different story , according to which Nikephoros was disgraced and dismissed from his post after refusing proposals for a marriage alliance with Leo 's powerful chief minister , Stylianos Zaoutzes . After a period out of office , Nikephoros was then appointed strategos either of Charsianon or of the Thracesian Theme , spending his remaining years , until his death around 900 , fighting against the Arabs . Leo VI 's Tactica and the later De <unk> further mention a successful raid into the Arab lands of Cilicia led by Nikephoros , in retaliation of an Arab attack on the fortress of <unk> in the Anatolic Theme . While directing the strategoi of the Anatolics and of the Opsician Theme to deal with the Arab invasion , Nikephoros led his forces to raid the vicinity of Adana , making many prisoners , and confounded the Arabs by following a different course on his return , thereby avoiding the Arab army sent to block his retreat . This undated raid probably took place either in the years before or directly after the Bulgarian war . 
 No definite conclusion as to the date of Nikephoros ' death can be reached today , but most modern scholars , such as Jean @-@ Claude Cheynet , are doubtful of the version of Theophanes Continuatus . It would have been very unusual for a former Domestic to be appointed to the subordinate position of a thematic strategos , and there is reason to doubt the authenticity of the tale of Zaoutzes ' seeing in Nikephoros a potential future emperor and offering the hand of an — otherwise unknown — daughter in marriage . 
 = = = Assessment and family = = = 
 By all accounts , Nikephoros Phokas was a capable soldier . Leo VI lauds his military talents in his Tactica , and he is credited with the invention of a weapon to counter cavalry during his campaign against the Bulgarians , consisting of a sharpened stake driven into the ground . Skylitzes assesses him as a " brave and prudent man , pious towards God and just towards men " . 
 Nikephoros was the father of Bardas Phokas the Elder and Leo Phokas the Elder , both of whom became Domestics of the Schools . So did his grandsons through Bardas , Nikephoros and Leo Phokas the Younger , with the first becoming emperor as Nikephoros II in 963 – 969 . Both Leo and Nikephoros II scored major successes against the Arabs , with Nikephoros in particular leading the recovery of Crete , Cyprus , Cilicia and Antioch .

 Madurai is a major city and cultural headquarters in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India . It is the administrative headquarters of Madurai District and the 31st largest urban agglomeration in India . Madurai is the third largest city by area and third largest city by population in Tamil Nadu . Located on the banks of River Vaigai , Madurai has been a major settlement for two millennia and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world . 
 Madurai is closely associated with the Tamil language , and the third Tamil Sangam , a major congregation of Tamil scholars , is said to have been held in the city . The recorded history of the city goes back to the 3rd century BCE , being mentioned by Megasthenes , the Greek ambassador to India , and Kautilya , a minister of the Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya . Signs of human settlements and Roman trade links dating back to <unk> are evident from excavations by Archeological Survey of India in <unk> . The city is believed to be of significant antiquity and has been ruled , at different times , by the Pandyas , Cholas , Madurai Sultanate , Vijayanagar Empire , Madurai Nayaks , Carnatic kingdom , and the British . 
 The city has a number of historical monuments , with the Meenakshi Amman Temple and Tirumalai Nayak Palace being the most prominent . Madurai is an important industrial and educational hub in South Tamil Nadu . The city is home to various automobile , rubber , chemical and granite manufacturing industries .

 = = Etymology = = 
 The city is referred by various names including " Madurai " , " Koodal " , " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> " and " <unk> " . The word Madurai may be derived from Madhura ( sweetness ) arising out of the divine nectar showered on the city by the Hindu god Shiva from his matted hair . Another theory is that Madurai is the derivative of the word <unk> , which refers to the type of landscape of the Sangam age . A town in the neighbouring Dindigul district is called Vada Madurai ( North Madurai ) and another in Sivagangai district is called Manamadurai . The different names by which the city has been referred to historically are listed in the 7th @-@ century poem <unk> <unk> written by Paranjothi Munivar . 
 Koodal means an assembly or congregation of scholarly people , referring to the three Tamil Sangams held at Madurai . <unk> , meaning the junction of four towers , refers to the four major temples for which Madurai was known for . Tevaram , the <unk> or 8th @-@ century Tamil compositions on Shiva by the three prominent Nayanars ( Saivites ) , namely Appar , Sundarar and Thirugnanasambandar , address the city as <unk> . As per <unk> Mahadevan , a 2nd @-@ century BCE Tamil @-@ Brahmi inscription refers to the city as <unk> , an Old Tamil word meaning a " walled city " derived from an older Dravidian source . 
 = = History = = 
 Madurai has been inhabited since at least the 3rd century BCE . Megasthenes may have visited Madurai during the 3rd century BCE , with the city referred as " <unk> " in his accounts . The view is contested by some scholars who believe " <unk> " refers to the north Indian city of Mathura , as it was a large and established city in the Mauryan Empire . Madurai is also mentioned in Kautilya 's ( 370 – 283 BCE ) Arthashastra . Sangam literature like <unk> records the importance of Madurai as a capital city of the Pandyan dynasty . Madurai is mentioned in the works of Roman historians Pliny the Younger ( 61 – c . 112 CE ) , Ptolemy ( c . 90 – c . CE 168 ) , those of the Greek geographer Strabo ( 64 / 63 BCE – c . 24 CE ) , and also in Periplus of the Erythraean Sea . 
 After the Sangam age , most of present @-@ day Tamil Nadu , including Madurai , came under the rule of the Kalabhra dynasty , which was ousted by the Pandyas around 590 CE . The Pandyas were <unk> from Madurai by the Chola dynasty during the early 9th century . The city remained under the control of the Cholas until the early 13th century , when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital . After the death of Kulasekara Pandian ( 1268 – 1308 CE ) , Madurai came under the rule of the Delhi Sultanate . The Madurai Sultanate then seceded from Delhi and functioned as an independent kingdom until its gradual annexation by the Vijayanagar Empire in 1378 CE . Madurai became independent from Vijayanagar in 1559 CE under the Nayaks . Nayak rule ended in 1736 CE and Madurai was repeatedly captured several times by Chanda Sahib ( 1740 – 1754 CE ) , Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan ( 1725 – 1764 CE ) in the middle of 18th century . 
 In 1801 , Madurai came under the direct control of the British East India Company and was annexed to the Madras Presidency . The British government made donations to the Meenakshi temple and participated in the Hindu festivals during the early part of their rule . The city evolved as a political and industrial complex through the 19th and 20th centuries to become a district headquarters of a larger Madurai district . In 1837 , the fortifications around the temple were demolished by the British . The moat was drained and the debris was used to construct new streets – Veli , Marat and <unk> <unk> streets . The city was constituted as a municipality in 1866 CE . The British government faced initial hiccups during the earlier period of the establishment of municipality in land ceiling and tax collection in Madurai and Dindigul districts under the direct administration of the officers of the government . The city , along with the district , was resurveyed between 1880 and 1885 CE and subsequently , five municipalities were constituted in the two districts and six taluk boards were set up for local administration . Police stations were established in Madurai city , housing the headquarters of the District Superintendent . 
 It was in Madurai , in 1921 , that Mahatma Gandhi , pre @-@ eminent leader of Indian nationalism in British @-@ ruled India , first adopted the loin cloth as his mode of dress after seeing agricultural labourers wearing it . Leaders of the independence movement in Madurai included <unk> Subbaraman and Mohammad Ismail Sahib . The Temple Entry Authorization and Indemnity Act passed by the government of Madras Presidency under C. Rajagopalachari in 1939 removed restrictions prohibiting <unk> and Dalits from entering Hindu temples . The temple entry movement was first led in Madurai Meenakshi temple by independence activist A. <unk> Iyer in 1939 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Madurai is built around the Meenakshi Amman Temple , which acted as the geographic and ritual centre of the ancient city of Madurai . The city is divided into a number of concentric quadrangular streets around the temple . <unk> Nayak ( 1159 – 64 CE ) , the first Madurai Nayak king , redesigned the city in accordance with the principles laid out by Shilpa Shastras ( Sanskrit : <unk> <unk> , also anglicised as <unk> sastra meaning rules of architecture ) related to urban planning . These squares retain their traditional names of Aadi , Chittirai , Avani @-@ <unk> and Masi streets , corresponding to the Tamil month names and also to the festivals associated . The temple <unk> ( outer precincts of a temple ) and streets accommodate an <unk> festival calendar in which dramatic processions <unk> the shrines at varying distances from the centre . The temple chariots used in processions are progressively larger in size based on the size of the concentric streets . Ancient Tamil classics record the temple as the centre of the city and the surrounding streets appearing liken a lotus and its petals . The city 's axes were aligned with the four quarters of the compass , and the four gateways of the temple provided access to it . The wealthy and higher echelons of the society were placed in streets close to the temple , while the poorest were placed in the fringe streets . With the advent of British rule during the 19th century , Madurai became the headquarters of a large colonial political complex and an industrial town ; with urbanisation , the social hierarchical classes became unified .

 In what appears to be an Internet vlog , a teenage girl nicknamed " WeepingWillow17 " ( Michelle Trachtenberg ) and her boyfriend Holden ( Michael <unk> ) are interrupted when two men in masks storm into the room and apparently kidnap them on @-@ camera . Detectives Logan and Wheeler begin investigating the so @-@ called " cyber @-@ kidnapping " , which they and the public suspect could be an Internet hoax . Eventually , the supposed kidnappers release an online video with Willow and Holden tied up , claiming they will kill them both if 100 @,@ 000 people do not purchase their online videos for $ 1 @.@ 99 each within 48 hours . The news media covers the story , and speculates on the possibility that it is a hoax . Eventually , a video is released in which Willow provides her real name , Lisa Willow Tyler , as proof that she is real . Logan and Wheeler visit her parents , who are elderly farmers that believe Willow is doing charity work in Africa ; the police learn Willow has lied to her family and tried to achieve Internet fame to escape her dull life . 
 Wheeler suggests responding to the kidnappers " on their own turf " via a video blog . In response to Wheeler 's video , the kidnappers make another vlog and cut off Holden 's ear on @-@ camera to prove they are serious . Although the ear is mailed to forensics and proven to be real , police quickly discover that Willow and Holden placed an online advertisement seeking actors to play kidnapper roles ; they soon identify actor Reggie Luckman ( Pedro Pascal ) as one of the kidnappers in the WeepingWillow17 videos . Yet another vlog is released , this time with Holden escaping his bonds and shooting one of the kidnappers , before being shot himself by Reggie . Police come to the scene and find Holden alive , along with the dead body of one of the supposed kidnappers named Todd ( Trevor Oswalt ) . Holden insisted the on @-@ camera shooting was fake , and that Reggie shot Todd over a dispute over money after the video was filmed . Holden says the kidnapping videos started as a hoax , but that Reggie has now actually kidnapped Willow . 
 Additional live WeepingWillow17 videos are shown online , which police trace to a van in Union Square , where they find Willow and arrest Reggie . During interrogation , Reggie says he did not know Todd was really dead ; he insists he fired a prop gun with blanks to scare Holden into splitting the money from the videos with them . Police soon learn the wadding from a blank was accidentally fired into Todd , and a horrified Reggie faces manslaughter charges . Willow , claiming to have simply been seeking fame as an actress , is released without criminal charges . The episode ends with Logan and Wheeler watching a video of Larry King interviewing Willow on a giant screen in Times Square .

 " Weeping Willow " was written by René Balcer , Stephanie Sengupta and Warren Leight , who served as the show 's executive producer and head writer . The episode was directed by Tom DiCillo , marking his first time as director with the series ; he would go on to direct the episodes Players , Offense and Last Rites . The story and the character WeepingWillow17 are modeled after Bree , the protagonist from the lonelygirl15 video blogs on YouTube . Originally believed to be a real @-@ life 15 @-@ year @-@ old blogger , Bree was eventually discovered to be a hoax . She was in fact a fictional character played by actress Jessica Lee Rose and created by filmmakers Mesh Flinders and Miles Beckett . 
 " Weeping Willow " analyzes the concept of 15 minutes of fame during the Information Age from the perspective of the Internet celebrity , one who gains fame through the creation of or participation in a popular website . Leight said of the episode , " Forget about 15 minutes of fame : there are hundreds of people who get their 15 inches of bandwidth , people making names for themselves on YouTube and others . ... This blogging phenomenon has created a certain kind of ' <unk> , ' people who don 't have to do anything more than put themselves on the Web and catch a <unk> . We now have a spate of very strange celebrities . " Leight said the episode also focuses on the extent to which one will go to achieve such fame . While the Law & Order shows routinely draw on inspiration from real @-@ life events in an approach the creators call " ripped from the headlines " , Criminal Intent producers referred to this episode as " ' pre @-@ ripping ' from the headlines " , because the script usually took a real @-@ life event ( as the lonelygirl15 phenomenon ) and added to it a fictional dramatic conflict ( the kidnapping ) . 
 The so @-@ called " cyber @-@ kidnapping " portrayed in " Weeping Willow " is believed to be the first such crime ever portrayed on television . While the writers and producers prepared the episode , several district attorneys they consulted said the law was dangerously vague regarding what charges could be filed in the event of such a real @-@ life cyber @-@ kidnapping ; Wright said , " They told me that this is a real problem , that there 's a lag between what 's on the books now and what 's happening out there . " The script also includes a difficulty on the part of the detectives in coping and dealing this new form of cyber @-@ crime and differentiating the truth from the hoax ; Leight said , " Their biggest frustration is trying to understand what 's real and what isn 't . Does this woman , Willow , really exist , and has something happened to her ? Is she playing a character and a game that 's gotten out of hand ? And how do you locate someone in cyberspace ? " 
 Julianne Nicholson , who plays Det . Megan Wheeler , said " Weeping Willow " was her favorite Law & Order : Criminal Intent episode . She described it as " really different from a lot of the ones we 've done before and very exciting and current . " Nicholson also said she enjoyed working with Michelle Trachtenberg and the other supporting actors , as well as director DiCillo , who also directed Living in Oblivion , one of Nicholson 's favorite movies . 
 During one of the kidnappers ' videos featured in the episode , a banner is visible advertising the website <unk> The producers of the show set up a real @-@ life website with that domain , containing eight video blogs starring Trachtenberg and the other cast members . The videos were created from video content filmed for the " Weeping Willow " episode , most of which was ultimately not used in the episode . The producers originally also established a mirror site , <unk> , but it is no longer active .

During the first WeepingWillow17 video shown in the episode 's first scene , the song " Fearless " by The Bravery is played . 
 Ira Whipple ( Gary Patent ) says , " In cyberspace , everyone hears you scream " , a reference to the tagline of the 1979 film Alien : " In space , no one can hear you scream . " A New York Film Academy professor refers to Holden as a " James Cameron @-@ wannabe " , referring to the American director of such films as The Terminator and Aliens . The vlog in which Holden 's ear is cut off is described by one characters as a rip @-@ off of director Quentin Tarantino , a reference to his 1992 feature film debut , Reservoir Dogs . During an interrogation , Mike Logan sarcastically refers to Reggie as James Dean , the famous actor and American cultural icon . Captain Danny Ross refers to the episode 's shooting as " cyber @-@ Rashomon . Reggie says Holden shot Todd , Holden says Reggie did it and Willow doesn 't even believe anyone 's dead . " This references the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon , in which multiple characters describe vastly different interpretations of the same murder . A poster for Grand Illusion , the 1932 Jean Renoir war film , hangs in Holden 's apartment .

 = Mutual Broadcasting System = 
 The Mutual Broadcasting System ( commonly referred to simply as Mutual ; sometimes referred to as MBS , the Mutual Broadcasting Company , or the Mutual Radio Network ; corporate name Mutual Broadcasting System , Inc . ) was an American radio network in operation from 1934 to 1999 . In the golden age of U.S. radio drama , Mutual was best known as the original network home of The Lone Ranger and The Adventures of Superman and as the long @-@ time radio residence of The Shadow . For many years , it was a national broadcaster for Major League Baseball ( including the All @-@ Star Game and World Series ) , the National Football League , and Notre Dame football . From the mid @-@ 1930s and for decades after , Mutual ran a highly respected news service accompanied by a variety of popular commentary shows . Toward the end of its run as a major programmer , it introduced the country to Larry King . 
 In the early 1970s , acting in much the same style as rival ABC had two years earlier ( in 1968 ) , Mutual launched four radio networks : Mutual Black Network ( MBN ; eventually became today 's American Urban Radio Networks ( <unk> ) ) , Mutual Cadena <unk> ( trans . " Mutual Spanish Network " ) , Mutual Southwest Network , & Mutual Lifestyle Radio ( was cancelled in 1983 ) . 
 Of the four national networks of American radio 's classic era , Mutual had for decades the largest number of affiliates , but the least certain financial position ( which prevented Mutual from expanding into television broadcasting after World War II , as the other three networks did ) . For the first 18 years of its existence , Mutual was owned and operated as a cooperative ( A system similar to that of today 's National Public Radio ) , setting the network apart from its competitors . Mutual 's member stations shared their own original programming , transmission and promotion expenses , and advertising revenues . From December 30 , 1936 , when it debuted in the West , the Mutual Broadcasting System had affiliates from coast to coast . Its business structure would change after General Tire assumed majority ownership in 1952 through a series of regional and individual station acquisitions . 
 Once General Tire sold the network in 1957 , Mutual 's ownership was largely disconnected from the stations it served , leading to a more conventional , top @-@ down model of program production and distribution . Not long after the sale , one of the network 's new executive teams was charged with accepting money to use Mutual as a vehicle for foreign propaganda . The network 's reputation was severely damaged , but soon rebounded . Mutual changed hands frequently in succeeding years — even leaving aside larger @-@ scale acquisitions and mergers , its final direct corporate parent , Westwood One , which purchased it in 1985 , was the seventh in a string of new owners that followed General Tire .

 = = = 1934 – 1935 : The launch of Mutual = = = 
 Attempts at establishing cooperatively owned radio networks had been made since the 1920s . In 1929 , a group of four radio stations in the major markets of New York City , Chicago , Cincinnati , and Detroit organized into a loose confederation known as the Quality Network . Five years later , a similar or identical group of stations founded the Mutual Broadcasting System . Mutual 's original participating stations were WOR – Newark , New Jersey , just outside New York ( owned by the Bamberger Broadcasting Service , a division of R.H. Macy and Company ) , WGN – Chicago ( owned by WGN Inc . , a subsidiary of the Chicago Tribune ) , WXYZ – Detroit ( owned by <unk> @-@ Trendle Broadcasting ) , and WLW – Cincinnati ( owned by the Crosley Radio Company ) . The network was organized on September 29 , 1934 , with the members contracting for telephone @-@ line transmission facilities and agreeing to collectively enter into contracts with advertisers for their networked shows . WOR and WGN , based in the two largest markets and providing the bulk of the programming , were the acknowledged leaders of the group . On October 29 , 1934 , Mutual Broadcasting System , Inc. was incorporated , with Bamberger and WGN Inc. each holding 50 % of the stock — five each of the 10 total shares . 
 The three national radio networks already in operation — the Columbia Broadcasting System and the National Broadcasting Company 's NBC Red and NBC Blue — were corporate controlled : programming was produced by the network ( or by advertising agencies of program sponsors that purchased airtime on the network ) and distributed to affiliates , most of which were independently owned . In contrast , the Mutual Broadcasting System was run as a true cooperative venture , with programming produced by and shared between the group 's members . The majority of the early programming , from WOR and WGN , consisted of musical features and inexpensive dramatic serials . WOR had The Witch 's Tale , a horror anthology series whose " <unk> @-@ an ' <unk> @-@ year @-@ old " narrator invited listeners to " douse all [ the ] lights . Now draw up to the fire an ' gaze into the embers ... <unk> into ' em deep ! ... an ' soon ye 'll be across the seas , in th ' jungle land of Africa ... hear that <unk> ' and them savage drums ? " WGN contributed the popular comedy series Lum and Abner . Detroit 's WXYZ provided The Lone Ranger , which had debuted in 1933 and was already in demand . It is often claimed that Mutual was launched primarily as a vehicle for the Western serial , but Lum and Abner was no less popular at the time . What WLW brought was sheer power ; billing itself as " The Nation 's Station , " in May 1934 it had begun night broadcasting at a massive 500 @,@ 000 watts , ten times the clear @-@ channel standard . 
 On May 24 , 1935 , the network aired its inaugural live event — the first @-@ ever night baseball game , between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies . In September , WXYZ dropped out to join NBC Blue , though contractual obligations kept The Lone Ranger on Mutual , airing three times a week , through spring 1942 . The hole in the Detroit market was immediately filled by CKLW in Windsor , Ontario , just across the river . In October , the network began a decades @-@ long run as broadcaster of baseball 's World Series , with airtime responsibilities shared between WGN 's Bob Elson and Quin Ryan and WLW 's Red Barber ( NBC and CBS also carried the series that year ; the Fall Classic would air on all three networks through 1938 ) . Mutual broadcast its first Notre Dame football game that autumn as well , beginning another relationship that would last for decades . As an income @-@ generating business , the Mutual network was a modest endeavor at the start : in the first eleven months of 1935 , the cooperative garnered $ 1 @.@ 1 million in advertising , compared to NBC 's $ 28 @.@ 3 million and CBS 's $ 15 @.@ 8 million . 
 = = = Late 1930s : National expansion = = = 
 In the fall of 1936 , Mutual lost another of its founding members when WLW departed . The network , however , was in the midst of a major expansion : the first outside group of stations to sign on with Mutual was John Shepard 's Colonial Network with its Boston flagship station , WAAB , and thirteen affiliates around New England . There was good reason for this affiliation : Shepard had been involved with the founding of Mutual , and served on its Board of Directors . Cleveland 's WGAR also became an affiliate , as did five Midwestern stations : <unk> – St. Louis , Mo . ; <unk> – Des Moines , Iowa ; <unk> – Cedar Rapids , Iowa ; <unk> – Omaha , Neb . ; and KFOR – Lincoln , Neb . The big prize came in December , when the Don Lee Broadcasting System , the leading regional web on the West Coast , left CBS to become a central participant in Mutual . Don Lee brought its four owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations — KHJ – Los Angeles , KFRC – San Francisco , KGB – San Diego , and <unk> – Santa Barbara — along with six California affiliates and , via shortwave hookup , two more in Hawaii . Mutual now had a nationwide presence . During 1936 , as well , an offer by Warner Bros. to purchase the network was apparently made and rejected . 
 In January 1937 , ownership of WAAB was consolidated with that of another Boston station controlled by Shepard : WNAC was flagship of the Yankee Network , a circuit of New England radio stations whose membership partially overlapped with that of Colonial . Yankee flagship WNAC had been an affiliate of CBS Radio , changing affiliation to NBC Red later in 1937 when CBS purchased WEEI in that city . The Texas Network soon added twenty @-@ three more stations to the Mutual affiliate roster . WGAR dropped out , but the United Broadcasting Company , part of The Plain Dealer business , joined with its lead station , WHK . Within a few years , this new Ohio participant would become one of the network 's central members , a <unk> in Mutual . By the end of 1938 , Mutual had 74 exclusive affiliates ; though the two leading radio network companies discouraged dual hookups , Mutual shared another 25 affiliates with NBC and 5 with CBS . The total of 104 affiliates put Mutual not far behind the leaders . Because of the corporate strength behind NBC and CBS , however , and the fact that the lion 's share of the most powerful stations in the country had already signed with them before Mutual 's emergence ( the exceptional , and soon departed , WLW aside ) , the cooperative network would be at a permanent disadvantage . 
 = = = = Programming : The Shadow and diverse political voices = = = = 
 On the programming front , 1936 saw Mutual launch the first network advice show , The Good Will Hour , hosted by John J. Anthony and sponsored by physical culture guru Bernarr Macfadden . The program was a new take on Ask Mister Anthony , which had aired on a local New York station in 1932 , " dedicated to helping the sufferers from an antiquated and outmoded domestic relations code . " Anthony , whose real name was Lester Kroll , brought a wealth of relevant experience to his work — he had once been jailed for failing to make alimony payments . In July 1937 came the premiere of a seven @-@ part adaptation of Les Misérables , produced , written , and directed by Orson Welles and featuring many of his Mercury Theatre performers — Mercury 's first appearance on the air . September 26 , 1937 , proved a particularly momentous date : that evening , The Shadow came to Mutual . The show would become a mainstay of the network for more than a decade and a half and one of the most popular programs in radio history . For the first year of its Mutual run , Welles provided the voice of The Shadow and his newly created alter ego , Lamont Cranston . He played the part anonymously at first . But , as one chronicler put it , " nothing to do with Welles could remain a secret for very long . " 
 In April 1938 , the network picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ . Mutual gave the twice @-@ a @-@ week series its first national exposure until November 1939 , when it switched to NBC Blue . ( The series would return very briefly to Mutual in the fall of 1940 ) . Mutual also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and his <unk> of Musical Knowledge . Kyser 's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience . By May 1939 , Mutual was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500 . That autumn , Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series . As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the regulatory power of the Federal Communications Commission , Mutual " offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country , including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations . CBS and NBC immediately invoked the ' exclusive affiliation ' clauses of their agreements with these stations , and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games . " This was the first example given in the ruling of " abuses " perpetrated by the two leading broadcast companies . 
 Mutual also began building a reputation as a strong news service , rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget . The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping " trial of the century " in 1935 , heard over Mutual , were highly regarded ; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast , aired nationally five nights a week . In 1936 , also via WOR , Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing , who became one of the country 's leading voices on foreign affairs . In November 1937 , conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr . , heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate <unk> , became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington , D.C. ; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later . In 1938 , Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English @-@ language newscasts from the European mainland . The network also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis , including John Steele , Waverly Root , Arthur Mann , and Victor <unk> . Among these was Sigrid Schultz , the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio .

 Early in 1940 , the corporate organization of Mutual became even more inclusive , as described by scholar Cornelia B. Rose : 
 Until January , 1940 , six groups bore the expense of the network operation in varying degree : stations WGN and WOR owned all the stock of the corporation and guaranteed to make up any deficit ; the Colonial Network in New England , the Don Lee System on the Pacific Coast , and the group of stations owned by the Cleveland Plain Dealer , participated in responsibility for running expenses . A new contract effective February 1 , 1940 , provides for contributing membership by all the above group [ s ] plus station CKLW in Detroit @-@ Windsor . These groups now agree to underwrite expenses and become stockholders in the network .... An operating board for the network is comprised of representatives from each of these groups , together with additional representation appointed by other affiliated stations . 
 The new cooperative structure was also joined by the owners of <unk> in Cincinnati , which had replaced Mutual cofounder WLW in that market . The Mutual corporation now had 100 shares , apportioned as follows : 
 In 1941 , WOR 's official city of license was changed to New York . Within two years , the Colonial Network 's affiliate roster and shares in Mutual had been fully absorbed into the Yankee Network by John Shepard III ; WNAC was the sole flagship , WAAB having been moved to Worcester , in central Massachusetts , to avoid duopoly restrictions . With WBZ taking over the slot as the NBC Red affiliate in Boston , WNAC switched to Mutual . In January 1943 , the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) approved the sale of the Yankee Network — with WNAC , its three other owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations , its contracts with 17 additional affiliates , and its Mutual shares — to the Ohio @-@ based General Tire and Rubber Company . 
 Already by 1940 , Mutual was on a par with the industry leaders in terms of affiliate roster size . Still , because Mutual affiliates were mostly in small markets or lesser stations in big ones , the network lagged way behind in advertising revenue — NBC took in eleven times as much as Mutual that year . In 1941 , the FCC , calling for NBC to divest one of its two networks , observed that the company " has utilized the Blue to forestall competition with the Red .... Mutual is excluded from , or only lamely admitted to , many important markets . " On January 10 , 1942 , Mutual filed a $ 10 @.@ 275 million suit against NBC and its parent company , RCA , alleging a conspiracy " hindering and restricting Mutual freely and fairly to compete in the transmission in interstate commerce of nationwide network programs . " The FCC 's Supreme Court victory in 1943 led to the sale of the Blue Network and Mutual dropping its lawsuit . These developments appear to have been of more symbolic than practical value to Mutual — the transfer of the NBC Blue stations to the new American Broadcasting Company did little to help Mutual 's competitive position . In 1945 it reached 384 affiliates , and by December 1948 , Mutual Broadcasting was heard on more than 500 stations in the United States . But this growth did not reflect any ability on Mutual 's part to attract leading stations from the corporate @-@ controlled networks . Rather , the FCC had eased its technical standards for local stations , facilitating the establishment of new outlets in small markets : between 1945 and 1952 , the number of AM stations rose from around 940 to more than 2 @,@ 350 . It was these new , relatively weak stations Mutual kept picking up . Though by now it had many more affiliates than any other U.S. radio network , for the most part they remained " less desirable in frequency , power , and coverage , " as the Supreme Court had put it . For instance , in the postwar era CBS and NBC covered all of North Carolina each with only four stations . Mutual needed fourteen affiliates to deliver comparable statewide coverage . 
 Late in the decade , there was a brief exploration into the idea of launching a Mutual television network , serious enough to prompt talks with MGM as a potential source of programming talent . In fact , Bamberger Broadcasting 's WOR @-@ TV & <unk> ( the latter a Washington , D.C. video outlet ) maintained letterhead with " Mutual Television " decorating their identifications . There is no confirmation , however , that a cooperative video service was ever <unk> surmounted . The plans never got off the ground and Mutual thus became the only one of the " Big Four " U.S. radio networks not to start ( and eventually be dominated by ) a television network . While there was no Mutual TV network , this did not mean the group did not have an influence over commercial television 's early development . For one thing , several Mutual radio affiliates launched television stations that would often be affiliated with the television networks of ABC , CBS , DuMont , or NBC . For another thing , the cooperative held the rights to a number of valuable radio properties that made the transition to the new medium , including two of the era 's most popular variations on what would later become known as the tabloid talk show and " reality " programming : the crabby <unk> Leave It to the Girls and , in particular , Queen for a Day , which both started on Mutual radio in 1945 . Referred to by some as a " misery show , " Queen for a Day " awarded prizes to women who could come up with the most heart @-@ stabbing stories told by the sick and the downtrodden .... On one show , a mother of nine requested a washing machine to replace one that broke when it fell on her husband and disabled him — and who , by the way , also needed heart surgery . " In May 1947 , a simulcast version began airing on the Don Lee system 's experimental TV station in Los Angeles , <unk> ( later <unk> ) . It was a smash hit , and by the turn of the decade TV stations all along the coast were broadcasting it to high ratings . In the 1950s , Mutual would stare down NBC for four years as the mighty network sought to take control of the show .

 Offscreen , Mutual remained an enterprising broadcaster . In 1940 , a program featuring Cedric Foster joined Mutual 's respected schedule of news and opinion shows . Foster 's claim to fame was as the first daytime commentator to be heard nationally on a daily basis . The network aired that year 's NFL Championship Game on December 8 , the first national broadcast of the annual event . Over the following half decade , Mutual 's war coverage held its own with that of the wealthier networks , featuring field correspondents such as Henry Shapiro and Piet Van T Veer and commentators such as Cecil Brown , formerly of CBS . At 2 : 26 p.m. Eastern time , on Sunday , December 7 , 1941 , Mutual flagship WOR interrupted a football game broadcast with a news flash reporting the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . It was the initial public announcement of the attack heard on the U.S. mainland . The first bombs had dropped 63 minutes earlier . In May 1945 , Sigrid Schultz reported from one of the last Nazi concentration camps to be discovered , Ravensbrück . The following month , Meet the Press premiered with Martha Rountree as moderator . For a year and a half in the late 1940s , William Shirer came over from CBS to do current events commentary after his famous falling out with Edward Murrow . In 1948 , Mutual 's four @-@ part series To Secure These Rights , dramatizing the findings of President Truman 's Committee on Civil Rights , outraged many politicians and the network 's own affiliates in the segregated South . 
 In the field of entertainment , Mutual built on the incomparable success of The Shadow . WGN 's Chicago Theater of the Air , featuring hour @-@ long opera and musical theater productions before a live audience , was broadcast for the first time in May 1940 . By 1943 , the weekly show was being recorded in front of houses 4 @,@ 000 strong , gathered to see performances featuring a full orchestra and chorus . Chicago Theater of the Air would run on Mutual through March 1955 . Mutual provided an early national outlet for the influential , iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan , whose show Here 's Morgan began its network run in October 1940 . Though The Lone Ranger moved over to NBC Blue in May 1942 , within a few months Mutual had another reliable , and no less famous , action hero . The Adventures of Superman , picked up from WOR , would run on the network from August 1942 to June 1949 . In April 1943 , Mutual launched what would turn into one of its longest @-@ lasting shows : debuting as The Return of Nick Carter and later retitled Nick Carter , Master Detective , it would be a network staple through September 1955 . From May 1943 through May 1946 , Mutual aired The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce . An earlier incarnation of the show had run briefly on the network in 1936 ; a less starry version would return to Mutual from September 1947 through June 1949 . The Mysterious Traveler , a proto – Twilight Zone anthology series , aired every week on Mutual from December 1943 until September 1952 . 
 In February 1946 , Mutual introduced a quiz show , Twenty Questions , that would run for more than seven years . In October , the detective series Let George Do It , starring Bob Bailey , launched as a Mutual / Don Lee presentation ; it would also run into the mid @-@ 1950s . For two years , starting in 1946 as well , Steve Allen got his first network exposure on the Mutual / Don Lee morning show Smile Time , out of Los Angeles 's KHJ . In February 1947 , the religiously oriented Family Theater premiered ; with frequent appearances by major Hollywood stars , the series aired on Mutual for ten and a half years . That March , Kate Smith , a major star on CBS since 1931 , moved over to Mutual . During most of her initial run at the network , which lasted until September 1951 , she had two distinct weekday shows , each 15 minutes long : Kate Smith Speaks , at noon , and Kate Smith Sings , later in the hour . The network gave an outlet to radio dramatist <unk> Cooper and his highly regarded suspense anthology Quiet , Please , which ran on Mutual from June 1947 to September 1948 . It also aired actor Alan Ladd 's similarly lauded drama about a crime @-@ solving mystery novelist , Box 13 , which ran for precisely a year . Its 52 episodes , which aired every Sunday beginning August 22 , 1948 , were produced by Ladd 's own company , Mayfair Productions .

 Toward the end of 1950 , the executors of the estate of Thomas S. Lee ( the son of Don Lee , who had died in 1934 ) decided to liquidate the estate 's interests in the broadcasting field . The Don Lee Broadcasting System , with its major station groups KHJ in Los Angeles and KFRC in San Francisco and its shares in the Mutual Broadcasting System , was sold to General Tire ( which already had a stake in Mutual via its Yankee Network holdings ) . Around the same time , Mutual acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All @-@ Star Game for the next six years . Mutual may have been <unk> in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long @-@ standing business relationship ; in either case , the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season 's games at an enormous profit . 
 Early in 1952 , General Tire purchased the Bamberger Broadcasting Service from R.H. Macy and Company . With the deal , General Tire acquired the WOR radio and TV stations and the rights to the name General Teleradio , under which the company merged its broadcasting interests as a new division ( Bamberger had previously sold its TV station in the nation 's capital , <unk> , to CBS and the Washington Post ) . Most importantly , as far as the future of the Mutual Broadcasting System was concerned , WOR 's founding shares in the network , when added to the Yankee and Don Lee holdings , gave General Tire majority control of Mutual . That same year , NBC began its attempts to win the television rights to Queen for a Day from Mutual . As a measure of the afternoon show 's success , its audience at its new Los Angeles home , General Teleradio / Don Lee 's KHJ @-@ TV , was triple that of the city 's six other stations combined . Mutual might not have had a TV network , but it controlled one of the most profitable properties in the early history of commercial television . 
 Mutual was at this point the largest U.S. radio network in affiliate numbers , by far — it had 560 , almost three times as many as its most powerful competitors , CBS ( 194 ) and NBC ( 191 ) . In 1955 , General Tire expanded its media holdings by acquiring RKO Radio Pictures from Howard Hughes , only to close the movie studio a year and a half later ( General Teleradio , renamed RKO Teleradio after the acquisition , would soon be known as RKO General ) . General Tire also decided to spin off its holdings in Mutual and sell it as a programming service even as it retained the stations that had given it control . Indeed , in 1956 , General purchased a governing interest in yet another Mutual shareholder , Western Ontario Broadcasting , and its station in Windsor , CKLW . In July 1957 , General Tire sold the Mutual Broadcasting business to a group led by Dr. Armand Hammer . 
 The network soon changed hands again : in September 1958 , it was acquired by the Scranton Corporation . Scranton was under the control of the F.L. Jacobs Company , whose chairman , Alexander Guterma , envisioned a media empire uniting Mutual with another recent purchase , the Hal Roach movie studio . After being questioned by federal investigators in February 1959 about financial improprieties , Guterma stepped down . Mutual , by this point , was floundering . For some years it had been run by owners who were either uninterested ( General Tire , Armand Hammer ) or now , as a growing amount of evidence would show , criminal . Mutual was also confronted with the situation the entire industry was facing : major advertisers were abandoning radio for television . Commercial rates had been cut . Limited sponsorship packages had been introduced , in which an advertiser could back a show for an abbreviated period rather than an entire season — but there was no reversing the trend . The networks were left with the bills for an increasing number of <unk> programs , known as " sustaining " shows in the industry . The loss of mainstay advertisers was accompanied by what historian Ronald Garay describes as the " mass desertion of network radio talent , management and technicians for television .... [ T ] hese people were taking with them the programming that had popularized the radio networks . " 
 Under its new chairman , Hal Roach Jr . , F.L. Jacobs put Mutual into Chapter 11 bankruptcy . In September 1959 , Guterma , Roach , and Garland Culpepper , a Scranton Corp. vice president , were indicted for failing to register as " foreign agents " ; they were charged with secretly accepting money from Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo that previous January in return for favorable coverage of the country and its government on Mutual news programs . It was never proven that Guterma , who was identified as the primary player on Mutual 's side and pleaded no contest to the charge , actually fulfilled his part of the deal and arranged for slanted coverage . Nonetheless , the incident led to a reported 130 stations cutting their affiliation with Mutual . Whether precipitated by the scandal or not , among the stations cutting its ties with Mutual in 1959 was one of the network 's two original flagships , WOR . Businessman Albert G. McCarthy , meanwhile , had taken over the network , arranging to settle its debts while seeking an owner interested in running it on an ongoing basis . 
 = = = = Programming : Korean War and original drama 's decline = = = = 
 Before the Guterma fiasco , the network had maintained its reputation for running a strong news organization . As the conflict on the Korean peninsula began to heat up in mid @-@ 1950 , Mutual started airing two special reports nightly on the situation , featuring the commentary of Major George Fielding Eliot , military analyst for CBS during World War II . By August , Mutual was represented by six correspondents in Korea , more than ABC or NBC . In June 1958 , just a few months before the Scranton takeover , the network had launched a nightly 25 @-@ minute newscast , The World Today , hosted by Westbrook Van Voorhis , famous as the voice of The March of Time . On occasion , Mutual 's commentary programs made the news : On March 11 , 1954 , Fulton Lewis Jr. featured Senator Joseph McCarthy as his guest , two days after the senator 's ethics had been called into question on the TV show See It Now , hosted by Edward R. Murrow . In his radio interview , McCarthy dismissed Murrow as " the extreme left @-@ wing , bleeding @-@ heart element of television . " 
 By the end of the 1950s , Mutual had forsworn original dramatic programming . Early in the decade , however , it picked up the adventure series Challenge of the Yukon , which had originated at Mutual cofounder WXYZ in 1938 after the station 's departure from the network . The show , subsequently renamed Sergeant Preston of the Yukon , ran on Mutual from January 1950 until its finale in June 1955 . In 1950 as well , Mutual introduced radio listeners to adult science fiction with 2000 Plus , which first aired on March 15 , almost a month before the premiere of NBC 's similarly themed Dimension X. The Shadow 's long run finally ended in December 1954 . In November 1957 , Mutual aired the final episodes of its last two remaining half @-@ hour original dramatic shows , <unk> and Gang Busters , both picked up from other networks earlier in the decade . It would be almost sixteen years before the network again aired a new dramatic series . In 1955 , the famous comedy team Bob and Ray came over from NBC for a five @-@ day @-@ a @-@ week afternoon show . Kate Smith returned in 1958 for her final radio series , which ran from January to August . Sports began to occupy an increasing portion of Mutual 's schedule : the network began regularly airing a Major League Baseball Game of the Day , every day except Sunday . This expansion into daily sports programming would run well into the 1960s . While baseball 's World Series and All @-@ Star Game would go to rival NBC in 1957 , Mutual secured exclusive national radio rights the following year to Notre Dame football , which would remain a cornerstone for the rest of the network 's existence . 
 = = = 1960s – 1970s : <unk> focus = = = 
 In the spring of 1960 , the 3M Company stepped in , purchasing Mutual and restoring much @-@ needed stability to the operation . Despite the recent scandal , Mutual still had 443 affiliates , easily the most of any network . By this time , as historian Jim Cox describes , both Mutual and ABC " had largely wiped their slates clean of most of their network programming — save news and sporting events and a few long @-@ running features " . This would characterize Mutual 's essential approach for the next three and a half decades , through a further series of ownership changes . 
 In July 1966 , 3M sold the network to a privately held company , Mutual Industries , Inc . , headed by John P. <unk> . Upon Mutual Industries 's acquisition of Mutual , it was renamed to " Mutual Broadcasting Corporation " . The following month , after the death of Mutual stalwart Fulton Lewis Jr . , his son Fulton Lewis III took over his Monday @-@ to @-@ Friday , 7 p.m. slot . When ABC Radio " split " into four demographically targeted networks on January 1 , 1968 , Mutual unsuccessfully sued to block the move . Meanwhile , the network was undergoing some management instability , with frequent changes at the top : for example , Matthew J. Culligan was Mutual 's president from October 1966 to June 1968 . He was replaced by Robert R. Pauley , who came over from the American Broadcasting Company 's radio division , where he had served as president for nearly seven years . But Pauley only lasted a year , and resigned after clashes with the board over the need for cost @-@ cutting , and other decisions with which he disagreed . His replacement was Victor C. <unk> , owner of several Mutual @-@ affiliated radio stations and active on the Mutual Affiliates Advisory Council . But <unk> also did not remain in the position of Mutual 's president for very long . Four years later , he was replaced by a new president , a former Miami radio executive named C. Edward Little . Under Little , Mutual began its own niche programming services , taking advantage , like ABC , of the prevailing FCC requirement that all radio stations , of whatever primary format , regularly air news and public affairs ( a responsibility that would be eliminated in the early 1980s ) . 
 In 1967 , Ohio businessman Daniel H. <unk> looked to start his own TV network , and sought a merger with Mutual ; the offer was quickly rebuffed , but three Mutual stockholders joined with eleven other investors to buy Overmyer 's hookup and rename it the United Network . The net ( and its only offering , " The Las Vegas Show " ) folded after only a month on the air . On May 1 , 1972 , the network launched the Mutual Black Network ( MBN ) and Mutual Cadena <unk> ( aka the Mutual Spanish Network ) ; each provided 100 five @-@ minute @-@ long news and sports capsules a week , along with other programming . While the Spanish @-@ language service would last only six months , by 1974 MBN had 98 affiliates . It was eventually spun off and acquired by the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation , leading to the creation of American Urban Radio Networks . Additional targeted services , such as the Mutual Southwest Network and Mutual Lifestyle Radio , followed from Mutual . 
 On September 30 , 1977 , Amway bought the network . Soon after the purchase , Mutual began developing what would become the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network , leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry 's transmission capacity . In 1979 , Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor . For the first time , the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own , and in one of the country 's largest markets . Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year — 950 . This was fewer than ABC , whose <unk> approach had proven very successful , but far in front of NBC and CBS . It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders .

 One of the few primary network programs outside of news and sports that Mutual initiated during this era became one of the most successful in its history : the first nationwide , all @-@ night call @-@ in show , which launched on November 3 , 1975 , with Herb Jepko as host . Jepko , who had run a telephone talk show out of KSL in Salt Lake City for years , so determinedly avoided controversy that some callers simply talked about the weather where they lived . Jepko was briefly succeeded by Long John Nebel , before Mutual tapped a local talk show host at WIOD in Miami . Larry King made his national debut on Mutual on January 30 , 1978 ; by the turn of the decade , he was being carried by 150 stations and credited with attracting many new affiliates to the network . King continued his Mutual call @-@ in show until 1994 , even as he began appearing on television in the mid @-@ 1980s . From 1970 through 1977 , Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for Monday Night Football .

 In 1980 , Amway purchased WHN in New York , giving Mutual a second major @-@ market owned @-@ and @-@ operated station . On a Country Road , a music show hosted by WHN 's Lee Arnold , was introduced and given national distribution . At the beginning of the year , Mutual had begun airing Mutual Radio Theater , formerly Sears Radio Theater , which it had just picked up . A number of well @-@ regarded dramas were produced as part of the anthology series . In 1981 , Mutual launched Dick Clark 's National Music Survey , a three @-@ hour @-@ long weekly program combining music and interviews . Despite these developments and the fact that its satellite network was now fully on line , Amway was making little if any profit out of Mutual . The network 's corporate parent began backing out of the radio business . Mutual Radio Theater , the network 's last ever original dramatic series , had its final show on December 19 , 1981 . In November 1983 , Amway sold off Mutual 's WCFL to Statewide Broadcasting . A year later , a deal was struck for the sale of WHN to Doubleday Broadcasting . 
 In 1985 , Westwood One , a major radio production company and syndicator — that is , a budding network — was looking to expand its operations . Westwood and Mutual were a good match : The demographics of Mutual affiliates tended to be adult ; most of the stations that bought Westwood 's programming , much of it in the pop music field , had substantially younger audiences . Mutual had the news operations that Westwood lacked . And there was Mutual 's size ; though down from its peak , it still commanded 810 affiliates , a strong second among the Big Four . In September 1985 , Amway sold the network to Westwood One for $ 39 million . " It 's a perfect fit , " declared Westwood head Norman J. <unk> . Referring to the united company 's ability to give advertisers access to a broad demographic sweep , he called it " a classic case of two plus two equaling five . " In 1987 , the number got even bigger : Westwood One snapped up Mutual 's long @-@ time competitor , the NBC Radio Network , for $ 50 million . Mutual was now part of a much larger programming service , and its identity was being slowly phased out . In 1993 , when Larry King switched his radio show to the daytime a year before giving it up , the late @-@ night call @-@ in slot went to WCFL alumnus Jim Bohannon ; within a few years , it was a Westwood One – branded show . Westwood One was itself taken over by Infinity Broadcasting in 1994 . In a deal announced in June 1996 and completed that December , CBS 's new parent company , Westinghouse , acquired Infinity for just shy of $ 5 billion . The direct descendants of the three original U.S. network companies had merged . 
 At this point , Mutual was little more than a brand name for certain news and sports programming provided by the new conglomerate 's Westwood One division . Mutual and NBC Radio newscasters sat back to back in the Westwood One studio , the former main Mutual facility in Crystal City , Virginia . In April 1999 , Westwood One announced it was dropping the Mutual brand in favor of CNN Radio , which it began distributing through a deal with Time Warner 's Turner Broadcasting System . A former member of the news team described the end : " Official time of Mutual Radio 's death was Midnight 4 / 17 / 99 . No tribute , no mention it was the last newscast ... it just died . " The Crystal City facility was closed in March 2001 , and Westwood 's primary operations were transferred to the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Some programming on Westwood One , which is now owned by Cumulus Media , can still trace its lineage directly to Mutual . Jim Bohannon remains on the air , hosting his interview / call @-@ in show which is a direct descendant of Herb Jepko 's 1975 launch on Mutual , as well as the morning news magazine , America in the Morning , which premiered on Mutual in 1984 . The current incarnation of Meet the Press , which launched on Mutual in 1945 , has a simulcast on Westwood One . A simulcast of TV 's Larry King Live continued to run until the end of 2009 . Country Countdown USA , founded as a Mutual program after the Westwood One purchase , continues to air in its original format as CMT Country Countdown USA . 
 The radio rights to Notre Dame Fighting Irish football were eventually rebranded as a Westwood One product , years before the end of the Mutual network itself . At the conclusion of the 2007 football season , Notre Dame ended its relationship with Westwood One , citing financial reasons , and subsequently announced a deal with ISP Sports . 
 Mutual founding stations WOR and WLW are now both under the ownership of iHeartMedia , who operates a network of their own , Premiere Networks . WGN syndicates Orion Samuelson farm reports through its Tribune Radio Network , which also carried Chicago Cubs broadcasts until 2014 . WOR syndicated some weekend talk programs through the WOR Radio Network , and several WLW hosts have been syndicated through Premiere . 
 Mutual Broadcasting System LLC , based in Spokane , Washington , uses the Mutual and Liberty names on its two stations , <unk> – Spokane and <unk> – Ephrata . These stations have no connection with the original network . They present adult standards , nostalgia , and some Christian programming , using the Mutual name as part of their old @-@ time radio branding .
