 Patrie 's main battery consisted of four Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 / 96 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The secondary battery consisted of eighteen Canon de 164 mm Modèle 1893 guns ; twelve were mounted in twin turrets , and six in casemates in the hull . She also carried twenty @-@ five 3 @-@ pounder guns . The ship was also armed with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . The ship 's main belt was 280 mm ( 11 @.@ 0 in ) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 350 mm ( 13 @.@ 8 in ) of armor . The conning tower had 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 While Patrie was still conducting sea trials on 29 May 1907 , a condenser pipe in one of her boilers burst . Several stokers were scalded , and the ship had to return to Toulon to have the condenser pipe replaced . After entering service , she was assigned to the 1st Division of the Mediterranean Fleet , along with her sister République and Suffren , the divisional flagship . She was present for the annual summer maneuvers in June – July of that year , where she acted with several other battleships as a hostile force . While in a drydock on 3 July 1907 , the battleship Iéna suffered a catastrophic magazine explosion that destroyed the ship ; Patrie was moored nearby . Her commanding officer attempted to flood the dock to put out the inferno by firing one of Patrie 's secondary guns at the dock gate , but the shell bounced off and did not penetrate it . The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux ( who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship ) managed to open the sluice gates . 
 During the 1910 gunnery training exercises , Patrie suffered mechanical problems with her sighting equipment that disabled one of her main battery turrets . In 1910 the battleship again was in an accident ; while on maneuvers in the Gulf of <unk> , Patrie launched a torpedo that inadvertently struck her sister République . Her hull was damaged , and she was forced to put into Toulon for repairs . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Patrie was assigned to the 1st Division of the 2nd Squadron in the Mediterranean , along with République and the flagship , Vérité ; this was the main battle fleet of the French Navy . The French fleet was initially used to cover the movement of French troops — the XIX Corps — from Algeria to metropolitan France . As a result , the fleet was far out of position to catch the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben . For the majority of the war , the French used their main fleet to keep the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet bottled up in the Adriatic Sea . In 1914 she participated in the Battle of Antivari , where the battle line caught the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta by surprise and sank her . The French battleships then bombarded Austrian fortifications at Cattaro in an attempt to draw out the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , which refused to take the bait . 
 The French operations in the area were hampered by a lack of a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic ; the British had given the French free access to Malta , but it was hundreds of miles away . The Austrians also possessed several submarines , one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914 . The threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic . As the war progressed , the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area . In 1916 the ships supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties to support the Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December . They spent the rest of the war at Salonica and Athens . Patrie became flagship of the French squadron at Salonica in 1918 . During the war , four of Patrie 's 3 @-@ pounder guns were converted into anti @-@ aircraft guns with new high @-@ angle mounts . The six casemate @-@ mounted 164 mm guns were removed and landed at Salonica for use ashore . While off Salonica on 5 May 1916 , Patrie 's anti @-@ aircraft gunners shot down a German zeppelin . Patrie was retained in the French Navy 's inventory and served as a training ship in Toulon for mechanics and <unk> until 1927 . The following year , she stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap .

I wrote ' <unk> ' for Britney [ ... ] and she killed it and I loved it , but I just thought a supergroup of three hot , strong women could just take over the airwaves . " The remix adds heavier bass during the beginning , and starts with Minaj rapping with intensity about a female hater , in lines such as " Told you they 'd revive your career , but somebody lied / I ain 't talkin ' poultry when I say this chicken 's fried . " This continues by Spears singing the first verse , after which Minaj says " It 's Britney , bitch . I 'm Nicki Minaj and that 's Kesha ! " , and the first chorus is sung by the latter . Spears continues with the song and is accompanied by Kesha towards the end of the second verse and the bridge . The remix also features a dubstep breakdown , reminiscent of " Hold It Against Me " . 
 Tina Hart of MSN UK stated that " [ Minaj ] maintain [ s ] her ‘ badass ’ demeanour . Britney ’ s familiar tones greet you on the verse and Kesha sounds perfectly at home on the chorus . " Wesley Case of The Baltimore Sun stated that while Spears sounds processed , " Minaj 's larger @-@ than @-@ life performance matches the in @-@ the @-@ red party production " and Kesha " adds an extra layer of dirt @-@ under @-@ the @-@ nails sheen .

" Samesame.com.au stated that Minaj 's rap was " fantastic " , and that although Kesha 's verse was " a little strange " , it also " works , but [ ... ] further emphasises what a poor choice for single Till The World Ends was in the first place , as the song sounds even more like a B @-@ side to Ke $ ha ’ s Cannibal EP .

" Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly said that " like most remixes , we ’ ll stick with the original " .

Pitchfork Media included the Femme Fatale Remix in their Top 100 Tracks of 2011 list , writing : 
 " ' Till the World Ends ' was already the best Britney single since ' Toxic ' , an ecstatic <unk> floor @-@ filler about wanting to dance until the world ends and other important matters . Then they added the Nicki Minaj verse . In her 45 @-@ second evisceration , Nicki manages to squeeze in chicken noises and the words ' poultry ' , ' Epsom salt ' , and ' Ricki Lake ' -- not to mention the immortal diss ' Sniff , sniff , <unk> / I done slayed your entire fucking <unk> . ' ( Fact : In 2011 , pretty much any song in the world could be made infinitely better by the addition of a Nicki Minaj verse . ) Sprinkle a little bit of Ke $ ha , the song 's co @-@ writer , on the chorus , and you 've got a three @-@ headed diva Hydra that sums up the recent changing of the femme pop guard from airbrushed and perfect to ( relatively ) weird and chaotic .

 The director 's cut premiered on April 6 , 2011 at 03 : 00 EST ( 08 : 00 UTC ) . Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin compared the " Till the World Ends " video to " I 'm Slave 4 U " and added that it takes elements of classic Spears videos , such as " scantily @-@ clad dancers , tightly executed choreography , <unk> sequined outfits , and pouty , overly sincere close @-@ ups of Spears " and " places them in an apocalyptic , end @-@ of @-@ days scenario . " Jocelyn Vena of MTV also highlighted the comparisons to " I 'm a Slave 4 U " , explaining that " the director 's cut of the video is a sexy mash @-@ up of Spears doing what she does best : groping half @-@ naked guys , giving the camera bedroom eyes and being sassy in a number of leather jackets and skintight bodysuits . " Chris <unk> of Time stated that the video " [ i ] s sweaty , at times blinding , yet undeniably enjoyable , adopting many of its key elements from Britney 's coming @-@ of @-@ age ' I 'm a Slave 4 U.

" Gina Serpe of E ! Online also compared the video to " I 'm a Slave 4 U " , saying , " [ There 's ] nothing wrong with a little nod to vintage Britney . Plus , sweaty dancers in underground tunnels pulsing and writhing in sync to the music ? Seems like as good a way as any to survive the apocalypse . " Willa Paskin of New York commented that Spears " tries hard not to make the same mistakes as the inadvertently depressing ' Hold It Against Me . ' There 's more dancing — though it 's still largely arm @-@ related — and much , much more smiling . " The music video was nominated at the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards in the category of International Video of the Year — Artist , but lost to Lady Gaga 's " Judas " . It also received two nominations at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards in the categories of Best Pop Video and Best Choreography .

 The video is similar to the director 's cut , but has a few differences . The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers , and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out . The clip 's ending is also different from the original : instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera , apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the world does end . On April 9 , 2011 , Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version , and was not sure which one she liked best . Ray Kay tweeted on April 14 , 2011 , that the original version of the video was better , " but it 's fun to watch the choreography too . " The video , titled " DANCE Till the World Ends " premiered on April 15 , 2011 . Leah Collins of Dose commented , " sorry , Team Britney , but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears ’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing , this clip isn ’ t exactly going to bring anyone back on side .

 Resident Evil 5 is a third @-@ person shooter with an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder perspective . Players can use a number of weapons ( including handguns , shotguns , automatic rifles , sniper rifles and grenade launchers ) in addition to melee attacks . Wounding an enemy with a firearm often causes them to stagger ; if the player is in close range , an icon will appear with the option of a melee attack such as an uppercut or a somersault kick . Players can make quick 180 @-@ degree turns to evade enemies . Many of the game 's cutscenes and boss battles involve quick time events . 
 Like its predecessor Resident Evil 4 , although players cannot run and shoot at the same time they can upgrade weapons with money and treasure and heal themselves with herbs . New features include infected enemies with guns and grenades , the ability to upgrade weapons at any time from the inventory screen ( rather than finding a merchant ) and the equipping of weapons and items in real time during gameplay .

 Resident Evil 5 supports two @-@ player co @-@ operative gameplay . The first player controls Chris Redfield , and a second player can control Sheva Alomar . If a person plays alone , Sheva is controlled by the game 's artificial intelligence . When the game has been completed once , there is an option to make Sheva the primary character .

Split @-@ screen mode presents the game in two windows with the wide @-@ screen proportions of one @-@ player mode , rather than splitting the screen in two , and the entire screen is not utilized . Players are separated at points during gameplay ; if one player has critical health , only their partner can resuscitate them .

He and his new partner Sheva Alomar are tasked with apprehending Ricardo Irving before he can sell a bio @-@ organic weapon ( BOW ) on the black market . When they arrive , they discover that the locals have been infected by parasites ( those infected are called " Majini " ) and the BSAA Alpha Team have been killed . Chris and Sheva are rescued by BSAA 's Delta Team , which includes Sheva 's mentor Josh Stone . In Josh 's data Chris sees a photograph of Jill Valentine , his old partner , who is presumed dead after a confrontation with Albert Wesker . Chris , Sheva and Delta Team close in on Irving , but he escapes with the aid of a hooded figure . Wesker leaves documents which lead Chris and Sheva to marshy oilfields where Irving 's deal is to occur , but they discover that the documents are a diversion . When Chris and Sheva try to regroup with Delta Team , they find the team slaughtered by a BOW ; Sheva cannot find Josh among the dead . Determined to learn if Jill is still alive , Chris does not report to headquarters . 
 Continuing through the marsh , they find Josh injured but safe and track down Irving 's boat with his help . Irving injects himself with a parasite variant , Las Plagas , and mutates into a huge octopus @-@ like beast . Chris and Sheva defeat him , and his dying words lead them to a nearby cave to learn more . The cave is the source of a flower used to create the Progenitor virus , which led to the T- and G @-@ viruses and has been used to form Uroboros ( a new , powerful strain ) . Chris and Sheva find evidence that Tricell , the company funding the BSAA , took over a former Umbrella Corporation underground laboratory and continued Umbrella 's research . In the facility are thousands of capsules holding human test subjects . Although Chris discovers that one of the capsules is Jill 's , it is empty . When they leave , they discover that Tricell CEO Excella <unk> has been plotting with Wesker to launch missiles with the Uroboros virus across the globe ; it is eventually revealed that Wesker hopes to take a chosen few from the chaos of infection and rule them , creating a new breed of humanity . Chris and Sheva pursue Excella , but are stopped by Wesker and a mind @-@ controlled Jill . Excella and Wesker escape to a Tricell oil tanker ; Chris and Sheva fight Jill , subduing her and removing the mind @-@ control device before she orders Chris to follow Wesker . 
 Chris and Sheva board the tanker and encounter Excella , who escapes after dropping a case of syringes ; Sheva keeps several . When Chris and Sheva reach the main deck , Wesker announces over the ship 's intercom that he has betrayed and infected Excella with Uroboros . She mutates into a giant monster , which Chris and Sheva defeat . Jill radios in , telling Chris and Sheva that Wesker must take precise , regular doses of a virus to maintain his strength and speed ; a larger or smaller dose would poison him . Sheva realizes that Excella 's syringes are doses of the drug . Chris and Sheva follow Wesker to a bomber loaded with missiles containing the Uroboros virus , injecting him with additional doses . Wesker tries to escape on the bomber ; Chris and Sheva disable it , making him crash @-@ land in a volcano . Furious ‚ Wesker exposes himself to Uroboros and chases Chris and Sheva through the volcano . They fight him , and the weakened Wesker falls into the lava before Chris and Sheva are rescued by a helicopter piloted by Jill and Josh . As a dying Wesker attempts to drag the helicopter into the volcano , Chris and Sheva blast the rocket @-@ propelled grenades at Wesker 's position , finally killing him and ending his threat once and for all . In the game 's final cutscene , Chris wonders if the fight is worthwhile . Looking at Sheva and Jill , he decides to live in a world without fear .

 Resident Evil 5 was developed by Capcom and produced by Jun Takeuchi , who had directed Onimusha and produced Lost Planet : Extreme Condition . Keiji Inafune , promotional producer for Resident Evil 2 and executive producer of the PlayStation 2 version of Resident Evil 4 , supervised the project . In February 2007 , members of Capcom 's Clover Studio were asked to help develop the game ; many of the studio 's developers instead worked on Resident Evil : The Umbrella Chronicles , which debuted for the Wii . Several staff members who worked on the original Resident Evil were involved in Resident Evil 5 's development . The game 's scenario was written by Haruo Murata and Yoshiaki Hirabayashi , based on a story idea by concept director Kenichi Ueda . Takeuchi announced that the game would retain the gameplay model introduced in Resident Evil 4 , with themes from the original Resident Evil . Tsukasa Takenaka provided additional story background and created the in @-@ game files . 
 Takeuchi said that about three years of " actual development time " were spent on the game , after a year devoted to concept and planning . At its development peak , about 110 people worked on the project . The decision for co @-@ operative gameplay was made " part @-@ way " through development , for a new experience in a Resident Evil game . Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game 's tension and horror , it was later realized that a second player could increase tension in situations where one player had to be rescued . Takeuchi said that the decision to have both screens in their original 16 : 9 ratio in split @-@ screen mode was influenced by a desire to avoid stacking the screens ( which might be distracting ) , and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension with the inability to move freely . Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down and his experience working on Lost Planet : Extreme Condition as influences on Resident Evil 5 . 
 Although previous Resident Evil games are primarily set at night , the events of Resident Evil 5 occur almost entirely during the day . Director Yasuhiro Anpo said in July 2008 that the game 's daytime setting was due to advanced graphics capabilities , which gave the developers more lighting options . Takeuchi said that the film 28 Days Later , set primarily outdoors during the day , demonstrated that horror could be created without darkness . Anpo said that since Resident Evil 4 was " a very long game " and occasionally tedious , they would try to make Resident Evil 5 " a little shorter " and more exciting . Resident Evil 5 runs on version 1 @.@ 4 of Capcom 's MT Framework engine , with scenes recorded by motion capture . It was the first video game to use virtual cameras , which allowed the developers to see character movements in real time as the motion @-@ capture actors recorded . Actors Reuben Langdon , Karen Dyer and Ken Lally portrayed Chris Redfield , Sheva Alomar and Albert Wesker . Some of the game 's animation could not be recorded with motion capture and was hand @-@ keyed , and motion @-@ capture scenes were often retouched by hand to make them look more realistic or vivid . 
 Kota Suzuki was the game 's principal composer , with additional music by Hideki <unk> , Akihiko Narita and Seiko <unk> . Suzuki said that the daytime setting of Resident Evil 5 did not significantly influence its score , although due to increased visibility it required the precise synchronisation of sound effects and on @-@ screen action . The composer 's electronic score includes 15 minutes of orchestral music , recorded at the Newman Scoring Stage of 20th Century Fox Studios in Los Angeles with the 103 @-@ piece Hollywood Studio Symphony . Additional orchestral music and the orchestral arrangements were by Wataru <unk> , who conducted the orchestra . Capcom recorded in Los Angeles because they wanted a Hollywood @-@ style soundtrack to increase the game 's cinematic value and global interest . Resident Evil 5 's soundtrack features an original theme song , composed by Kota Suzuki and sung by <unk> Niang .

 Resident Evil 5 received positive reviews . Although the game was praised for its graphics and gameplay , it was criticized for issues with its controls . Corey Cohen of Official Xbox Magazine complimented the game 's fast pace , and called the graphics " gorgeous " . It was praised by Joe Juba and Mark Miller of Game Informer , who said that it had the best graphics of any game to date and the music and voice acting helped bring the characters to life . However , Juba said that the inability to move and shoot at the same time seemed more " like a cheap and artificial way to increase difficulty than a technique to enhance tension . " Chris Hudak of Game Revolution reviewed Resident Evil 5 favorably . Lamenting the game 's departure from the survival horror genre , Hudak concluded that " the gorgeous environs , character models and overall visuals , and the adrenaline @-@ soaked cooperative gameplay ( wonky , stodgy Capcom controls and all ) cannot be denied . " 
 Adam Sessler of X @-@ Play said that although the game 's graphics were exceptional , the single @-@ player artificial intelligence was hard to play through and he was disappointed in the controls taken ( he felt ) from Resident Evil 4 . Edge praised Resident Evil 5 's gameplay as exhilarating and frantic , echoing criticism of the control system . For IGN , Ryan Geddes wrote that the split @-@ screen cooperative mode was very confusing but the game had a surprisingly high replay value . According to GameZone 's Louis Bedigian , " The fact that Resident Evil 5 was worth playing through twice in one weekend shows how compelling the gameplay is , and how it 's able to rise above a number of disappointing flaws . " Criticizing the game 's departure from survival horror and its inability to move and shoot ( or stab ) , Brian Crecente of Kotaku blogged : " From beginning to end , this latest Resident Evil delivers a riveting and intense experience well worth the time spent playing it . " 
 James Mielke of 1UP.com compared Resident Evil 5 to Gears of War 2 . He criticized several inconsistencies in the game , such as the enemies ' artificial intelligence and the ability to interact with objects and use cover . Mielke also criticized its controls , saying that aiming was too slow and noting the inability to strafe away from ( or quickly jump back from ) enemies . However , he concluded , " Despite the excruciating detail I 've poured into describing the problems [ Resident Evil 5 ] creates for itself , this is still a very fun game . " Kristan Reed of Eurogamer also criticized aspects of the controls , such as the speed at which 180 @-@ degree turns were performed and difficulty accessing inventory . According to Reed , Resident Evil 5 felt a lot like past games in the franchise and was " just like any other third person action shooter " . 
 Steven Hopper of GameZone rated the " Lost in Nightmares " DLC eight out of ten : " Even though the episode is pretty short , there is some good replay value here and the added multiplayer elements are a nice touch . All in all , this is a worthy investment for fans of the original game . " Samuel Claiborn of IGN rated the " Desperate Escape " DLC seven out of ten : " Despite Desperate Escape 's well @-@ crafted action sequences , I actually found myself missing the unique vibe of Lost in Nightmares . The dynamic between Jill and Josh isn 't particularly thrilling , and the one @-@ liners , banter and endearing kitsch are kept to a minimum . " Resident Evil 5 was nominated as Best Action Game at the 2009 IGN Game of the Year Awards .

 Resident Evil 5 's 2007 E3 trailer was criticized for depicting a white protagonist killing black enemies in a small African village . According to Newsweek editor N <unk> Croal , " There was a lot of imagery in that trailer that dovetailed with classic racist imagery " , although he acknowledged that only the preview had been released . The second trailer for the game ( released on May 31 , 2008 ) revealed a more racially diverse group of enemies and the half @-@ African BSAA agent Sheva , who assists the protagonist . Takeuchi denied that complaints about racism had any effect in altering the design of Resident Evil 5 , saying that the game 's producers were surprised by the controversy . In an interview with MTV , he said that Capcom 's staff was racially diverse and acknowledged that different cultures may have had differing opinions about the trailer . In a Computer and Video Games interview , producer Masachika Kawata also addressed the issue : " We can 't please everyone . We 're in the entertainment business – we 're not here to state our political opinion or anything like that . It 's unfortunate that some people felt that way . " 
 In Eurogamer 's February 2009 preview of Resident Evil 5 , Dan Whitehead expressed concern about controversy the game might generate : " It plays so blatantly into the old clichés of the dangerous ' dark continent ' and the primitive lust of its inhabitants that you 'd swear the game was written in the 1920s " , and " there are even more outrageous and outdated images to be found later in the game , stuff that I was honestly surprised to see in 2009 . " The article also said that the addition of the " light @-@ skinned " Sheva " compounds the problem rather than easing it . " Chris Hudak called the racism allegations " stupid " : " If you are aware from the outset that the game takes place in Africa and yet you are still troubled by any skin @-@ tone @-@ related aspects ... there exists the possibility of simple , congenital retardation on your own part . " 
 Wesley Yin @-@ Poole of VideoGamer.com said that despite the controversy the game was attracting due to alleged racism , no expert opinion had been sought . He asked Glenn Bowman , senior lecturer in social anthropology at the University of Kent , whether he thought the game was racist . Bowman considered the racism accusations " silly " , saying that the game had an anti @-@ colonial theme and those complaining about the game 's racism might be expressing an " inverted racism which says that you can 't have scary people who are black . " It was reported that one cutscene in the game scene showed " black men " dragging off a screaming white woman ; according to Yin @-@ Poole , the allegation was incorrect and the single man dragging the woman was " not obviously black . " The scene was submitted to the British Board of Film Classification for evaluation . BBFC head of communications Sue Clark said , " There is only one man pulling the blonde woman in from the balcony [ and he ] is not black either . As the whole game is set in Africa it is hardly surprising that some of the characters are black ... we do take racism very seriously , but in this case there is no issue around racism . "

 Up ! Close and Personal is the fourth live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain . It was directed by Beth McCarthy @-@ Miller , and produced by team composed of Dan Braun , Cliff Burnstein , Carol Donovan , McCarthy @-@ Miller , Peter Mensch , and Marc Reiter . The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville , Tennessee , with an audience of 300 people . When conceptualizing the show , Twain desired to make the setting intimate and perform the songs acoustically , so she turned to bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station to perform backup during the concert . It was also modeled after Elvis Presley 's ' 68 Comeback Special , with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black , leather jumpsuit . Up ! Close and Personal premiered on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) on November 25 , 2003 , and was high in ratings , being watched by over 9 million viewers in the United States . 
 Nearly a year later , Up ! Close and Personal was released by Mercury Nashville Records , in DVD format , as a video album on November 8 , 2004 to coincide with the release Twain 's Greatest Hits album . The video also served as a source to audio tracks used as B @-@ sides for the singles from Greatest Hits . Up ! Close and Personal received mixed reviews from music critics ( some who believed she was overshadowed by Krauss ' talents , others who complimented her vocal talents ) and positive commercial outcomes . It peaked at number eight on Billboard 's Top Music Video sales chart , and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipment of 100 @,@ 000 copies in the United States .

 On August 19 , 2003 , Twain 's concert film Up ! Live in Chicago premiered on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) and drew in over 8 @.@ 87 million viewers , therefore becoming the second @-@ most @-@ viewed concert film on television , behind Celine Dion 's A New Day ... Live in Las Vegas ( 2003 ) . Following its success on television , NBC was interested again in collaborating with Twain for a second prime time special . Twain accepted the offer , but desired to deviate from high @-@ elaboration , and perform a show much more stripped and intimate than the one filmed for Up ! Live in Chicago or those included in her Up ! Tour ( 2003 – 04 ) . She explained , " I wanted to go back to something stripped @-@ down and rootsy . I 've been doing big concerts for quite a long time , and I love it , but I just want that contrast . " Ergo , she turned to singer and fiddler Alison Krauss , head of the bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station , whom she had collaborated with on numerous instances ; Krauss and her band backed Twain in her performance of " Forever and for Always " at the 2003 CMT Music Awards , and recorded a duet with Twain for a tribute album to Dolly Parton . Twain described her decision to be completely influenced by her desire to " break the music down " , and that Alison Krauss and Union Station were her only choice for the television special . 
 Krauss was apprehensive at first , noting drastic differences between her personal acoustic style and that of Twain . She stated , " It 's so different from what we do , we didn 't know what liberties we were supposed to take . Were we supposed to learn it off the record ? Were we supposed to learn the themes ? " She found aid in Twain 's then @-@ husband and producer Robert John " Mutt " Lange , who told Krauss to perform the songs as if they were her own . While preparing for the show , Krauss said she found the songs very simple to learn because of their catchy melodies that could function in any musical style . While traveling on the Up ! Tour , Twain decided to cover of AC / DC 's " You Shook Me All Night Long " ( 1980 ) for the television special . However , she edited the song 's lyrics to void them of the crudeness she was not fond of singing along to as a teenager . Krauss later expressed her opposing views , saying she would have personally kept the original lyrics . The show was modeled after Elvis Presley 's ' 68 Comeback Special , with a similar stage and Twain being costumed by black , leather jumpsuit . The concert was filmed in November 2003 at a sound stage in Nashville , Tennessee to a crowd of 300 attendants . Up ! Close and Personal was directed by Beth McCarthy @-@ Miller , who also directed Up ! Live in Chicago , and was produced by a team that consisted of Dan Braun , Cliff Burnstein , Carol Donovan , McCarthy @-@ Miller , Peter Mensch , and Marc Reiter .

 Up ! Close and Personal received mixed reviews from music critics . David Bianculli of New York City 's Daily News wrote , " After watching Britney Spears ' [ Live from Las Vegas ( 2002 ) ] special last week , Twain 's act will seem like an exercise in restraint . It 'll also seem like someone singing , rather than lip @-@ syncing . " Roger Catlin of the Hartford Courant gave Up ! Live in Chicago a negative review .

 = Saturday Night Live parodies of Sarah Palin = 
 The sketch comedy television show Saturday Night Live aired several critically acclaimed sketches parodying then Alaskan Governor and vice @-@ presidential nominee Sarah Palin in the lead @-@ up to the 2008 United States presidential election . The sketches featured former cast member Tina Fey , who returned as a guest star to portray Palin . Fey won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her impersonation of Palin .

 Soon after the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign 's August 29 , 2008 announcement that Alaska governor Sarah Palin would be McCain 's vice presidential nominee , people noted a physical resemblance between comedian Tina Fey and Palin . Fey had decided she would play Palin after her daughter saw a picture of the Alaskan governor and mistook her mother for Palin . 
 Viewers began to speculate who would play Palin on SNL during the run up to the November 4 presidential election . Days before the broadcast of the sketch , SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels said " there are [ ongoing ] discussions " about Fey playing Palin . On September 13 , 2008 , NBC announced that Fey would appear in the thirty @-@ fourth season premiere .

 The first sketch , " A Nonpartisan Message from Governor Sarah Palin & Senator Hillary Clinton , " aired during the thirty @-@ fourth season premiere of SNL on September 13 , 2008 . The sketch starred Tina Fey and Amy Poehler as Palin and Clinton , respectively . Fey , the series ' former head writer and repertory player , made her third appearance on the series since officially leaving SNL in 2006 to work on 30 Rock , a series which she created . The sketch was written by Poehler , Fey , and head writer and Weekend Update anchor Seth Meyers . 
 Poehler and Fey are featured in a fictional speech playing New York Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin , respectively . The pair discuss the presence of sexism in the 2008 United States presidential election , and the differences between Palin and Clinton . Governor Palin was the Republican Party vice @-@ presidential nominee and Senator Clinton was a contender for the Democratic Party presidential nomination . Through the course of the message , Palin tries to present herself as the candidate for the job , and Clinton gets progressively more and more disgusted at Palin 's sudden rise to fame as John McCain 's running mate , despite her background . It also features references to Clinton 's campaign .

 The sketch was well received by critics . Erin Fox of TV Guide wrote that Tina Fey " nails [ Sarah ] Palin 's mannerisms and accent . [ Amy ] Poehler is amazing as Hillary [ Clinton ] ; her timing is better than ever . My favorite line was Tina saying ' I can see Russia from my house ! ' " Fox added that " this was a much anticipated and hoped @-@ for pairing and we got it ! " Annie Wu of TV Squad thought that Fey 's " impression wasn 't perfect but it was more accurate than Amy Poehler 's Hillary Clinton , which [ she ] still find [ s ] incredibly off . " Wu added that " the mugging for the camera was absolutely hilarious . " James Poniewozik of Time Magazine wrote that " Fey 's Palin was perfectly good enough " and that " the skit itself did a good job of what SNL — which has lately cultivated a strong set of female comics — tried hard to do through Hillary 's campaign , which is try to address sexism without either simply going for the easy stereotypes or letting female candidates off the hook . " The Huffington Post 's reviewer wrote that " Fey bears a striking resemblance to Palin and nailed the candidate 's distinctive accent . "

 When asked how she felt about Fey 's portrayal , Sarah Palin replied , " I watched with the volume all the way down and I thought it was hilarious ... I didn 't hear a word she said , but the visual was spot on . " Palin " and the press corps watched the sketch in the back of her plane , laughing at Tina and Amy 's satirical take on the two politicians , " and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween . However , Carly Fiorina , a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as " very substantive , " but Fiorina thought , in the case of Sarah Palin , that she was portrayed as " totally superficial . " Fiorina thought the sketch was " disrespectful in the extreme " and " sexist . " 
 In a series of interviews , Palin made some " <unk> " leading her to joke that " [ she ] was just trying to give Tina Fey more material . " She also joked that it was to provide " job security for SNL characters . " Palin later remarked that she should appear on SNL to spoof a series of American Express commercials which featured Tina Fey .

 Due to the popularity of the sketch and Fey 's impression of Palin , Fey reprised her role during the September 27 , 2008 episode of Saturday Night Live . That sketch featured Palin being interviewed by Katie Couric who was played by Amy Poehler ; that sketch parodied an interview which took place between Palin and Couric which aired days before the sketch 's broadcast . In the sketch , Fey quoted near verbatim one of Palin 's answers from the actual interview and mimed Palin 's gestures . The following episode featured a skit parodying the debate between Palin and Joe Biden ( played by Jason Sudeikis ) . Queen Latifah also appeared in the skit as moderator Gwen Ifill . 
 Palin herself appeared on the October 18 , 2008 episode of SNL , along with Fey in the cold opening . Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg also appeared in that sketch as themselves . On the October 23 episode of Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday , Fey as Palin appeared alongside Darrell Hammond as John McCain and Will Ferrell as President George W. Bush . 
 On November 1 , 2008 , Fey once again portrayed Palin , this time in a sketch featuring the real John McCain , the last of numerous sketches featuring the Arizona Senator . In the sketch , McCain poked fun at himself and his campaign , as well as Barack Obama 's purchase of airtime on several major networks earlier in the week . In the sketch , McCain and Palin can only afford to buy airtime on QVC , a home @-@ shopping channel . McCain 's wife , Cindy , also made an appearance in the sketch as herself . 
 After Palin 's memoir , Going Rogue : An American Life , achieved best @-@ seller status through pre @-@ orders , Fey announced she would resume impersonating the former Governor despite having " retired " the act months previously . On April 10 , 2010 , Fey hosted SNL , and once again played Palin , who unveiled her own television network featuring shows such as Hey Journalist , I Gotcha , Todd ! starring her husband Todd Palin ( Jason Sudeikis ) and Are You Smarter than a Half @-@ Term Governor ? Fey hosted SNL in May 2011 while pregnant . A new sketch was made in which parodies of Mitt Romney ( Jason Sudeikis ) , Newt Gingrich ( Bobby Moynihan ) , Michele Bachmann ( Kristen Wiig ) , Palin ( Fey ) , Donald Trump ( Darrell Hammond ) , and Jimmy McMillan ( Kenan Thompson ) fought in a Republican Party debate between undeclared candidates , with Shepard Smith ( Bill Hader ) coordinating . 
 On March 11 , 2012 , on the episode hosted by Jonah Hill , Palin was impersonated by Andy Samberg in the Weekend Update segment . The dialogue leads the audience to think that it was supposed to be another appearance by Fey and that Seth Meyers wasn 't aware of the change , but Samberg convinces Meyers to finish his part . 
 Palin appeared on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special , where Jerry Seinfeld jokingly mistook her for Tina Fey . 
 Fey and Poehler co @-@ hosted SNL in December 2015 , and performed as Palin and Clinton in yet another sketch . 
 In January 2016 , following Palin 's real @-@ life endorsement of Donald Trump , Fey returned to the role to parody the speech given by Palin in Iowa that endorsed Trump . This skit served as the show 's cold open . 
 = Gunpowder Incident = 
 The Gunpowder Incident ( or Gunpowder Affair ) was a conflict early in the American Revolutionary War between Lord Dunmore , the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia , and militia led by Patrick Henry . On April 20 , 1775 , one day after the Battles of Lexington and Concord ( and well before news of that event reached Virginia ) , Lord Dunmore ordered the removal of the gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg , Virginia to a Royal Navy ship . 
 This action sparked local unrest , and militia companies began mustering throughout the colony . Patrick Henry led a small militia force toward Williamsburg to force return of the gunpowder to the colony 's control . The matter was resolved without conflict when a payment of £ 330 was made to Henry . Dunmore , fearing for his personal safety , later retreated to a naval vessel , ending royal control of the colony . 
 = = Background = = 
 Military tensions began to rise in the British colonies of North America in 1774 when a series of legislative acts by the British Parliament known as the Intolerable Acts began to be implemented in the colonies . The colonies , in solidarity with the Province of Massachusetts Bay , which had been singled out for punishment by those acts in the wake of the Boston Tea Party , had organized a Congress to meet in September 1774 . During the meeting of the First Continental Congress word arrived of a militia uprising in Massachusetts that became known as the Powder Alarm . In early September , General Thomas Gage , the royal governor of Massachusetts , had removed gunpowder from a powder magazine in Charlestown ( in a location now in Somerville ) , and militia from all over New England had flocked to the area in response to false rumors that violence had been involved . One consequence of this action was that the Congress called for the colonies to organize militia companies for their defense . Another was that Lord Dartmouth , the Secretary of State for the Colonies , advised the colonial governors to secure their military supplies , and prohibited importation of further supplies of powder . 
 In early 1775 , Virginians began to organize militia companies and seek out military supplies ( weapons , ammunition , and gunpowder ) to arm and equip them . Lord Dunmore , Virginia 's royal governor , saw this rising unrest in his colony and sought to deprive Virginia militia of these supplies . It was not until after Patrick Henry 's " Give me liberty or give me death " speech at the Second Virginia Convention on March 23 that Dunmore " [ thought ] it prudent to remove some Gunpowder which was in a Magazine in this place . " Although British Army troops had been withdrawn from Virginia in the wake of the Powder Alarm , there were several Royal Navy ships in the Virginia waters of Chesapeake Bay . On April 19 , Lord Dunmore quietly brought a company of British sailors into Williamsburg and quartered them in the governor 's mansion . Dunmore then ordered Captain Henry Collins , commander of HMS Magdalen , to remove the gunpowder from the magazine in Williamsburg . 
 = = Removing the gunpowder = = 
 On the night of April 20 , Royal Navy sailors went to the Williamsburg powder magazine , loaded fifteen half barrels of powder into the governor 's wagon , and transported it to the eastern end of the <unk> Road to be loaded aboard the Magdalen in the James River . The act was discovered by townsfolk while underway , and they sounded an alarm . Local militia rallied to the scene , and riders spread word of the incident across the colony . Dunmore had as a precaution armed his servants with muskets , and it was only the calming words of Patriot leaders , including the Speaker of the House of Burgesses , Peyton Randolph , that prevented the assembling crowd from storming Dunmore 's mansion . The city council demanded the return of the powder , claiming it was the property of the colony and not the Crown . Dunmore demurred , stating that he was moving the powder as protection against its seizure during a rumored slave uprising , and would eventually return it . This seemed to satisfy the assembled crowd , and it dispersed peacefully . 
 Unrest however persisted in Williamsburg and spread throughout the countryside . After a second crowd was convinced to disperse by Patriot leaders , Dunmore reacted angrily , warning on April 22 that if attacked , he would " declare Freedom to the Slaves , and reduce the City of Williamsburg to Ashes . " He also told a Williamsburg alderman that he had " once fought for the Virginians " but " By God , I would let them see that I could fight against them . " 
 By April 29 , militia mobilizing in the countryside had learned of the battles at Lexington and Concord . Nearly 700 men mustered at Fredericksburg , and decided to send a messenger to Williamsburg to assess the situation before marching on the capital . Peyton Randolph advised against violence , and George Washington , a longtime leader of the Virginia militia , concurred . In response to their advice , the Fredericksburg militia voted by a narrow margin not to march . However , militia from other parts of the colony did march to Williamsburg . The Hanover County militia , led by Patrick Henry , voted on May 2 to march on Williamsburg . Henry dispatched a small company to the home of Richard Corbin , who was the Deputy Collector of the Royal Revenue in Virginia , in a bid to force him to pay for the powder from Crown revenue in his possession ; the remainder of the Hanover County militia , numbering about 150 , marched toward Williamsburg , arriving about 15 miles ( 24 km ) away on May 3 . That day Dunmore 's family escaped Williamsburg to Porto Bello , Lord Dunmore 's hunting lodge on the York River , and from there to the HMS Fowey , lying at anchor in the York River . 
 Corbin was not at home — he was in Williamsburg , meeting with Dunmore . Henry was advised by Carter Braxton , Corbin 's son @-@ in @-@ law and a Patriot member of the House of Burgesses , not to enter the city , while Braxton rode into the city and negotiated a payment . The next day , May 4 , Henry received a bill of exchange for £ 330 signed by a wealthy plantation owner , as payment for the powder ( he refused the offer of payment from Crown accounts ) . Henry then departed to take his place as a member of Virginia 's delegation to the Second Continental Congress , promising to deliver the money to " the Virginia Delegates at the General congress " . On May 6 Dunmore issued a proclamation charging Henry with extortion of the £ 330 , and forbidding the citizenry to assist Henry in any way . Henry was offered protection by several counties , and was escorted by several companies of militia to the Maryland border as he made his way to Philadelphia . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The incident burnished Henry 's reputation while worsening Dunmore 's popularity . Although his family briefly returned to Williamsburg on May 12 as a sign of good faith , relations between Dunmore and the House of Burgesses continued to deteriorate . On June 8 , Dunmore and his family fled the governor 's mansion in the middle of the night and took up residence aboard the Fowey . The Burgesses had been deliberating the <unk> Resolution , a proposal that was an attempt by the North Ministry to divide the colonies . In the wake of Dunmore 's flight , the Burgesses rejected the proposal . 
 Dunmore continued to make vigorous attempts to regain control of the colony , but after a decisive defeat of British forces at Great Bridge in December , he was reduced to raiding operations and eventually abandoned the colony for good in August 1776 . Virginia 's government was first taken over by a Committee of Safety , chosen by the Third Virginia Convention in July 1775 ; Patrick Henry became the independent state 's first governor in July 1776 .

 Executive producer Jeff Pinkner and supervising producer Drew Goddard co @-@ wrote " The Glass Ballerina " , while cinematographer Paul Edwards served as the director . It featured recurring stars Byron Chung , Tony Lee , Michael Bowen , and <unk> <unk> Lee , as well as the first of two appearances by guest actress Paula Malcomson . Though her character Colleen Pickett is shot in the episode , she does not die until the season 's fourth episode , " Every Man for Himself " . 
 Leading up to the premiere of the new season , showrunners Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof foreshadowed the episode 's adultery storyline in an interview ; Cuse mentioned , " How truthful has [ Sun ] been with Jin about her past ? " , to which Lindelof added , " And related to that , is the baby his ? " . Previously , a season two episode had seemed to confirm that Jin was infertile , leading to ramped up speculation online that Sun was pregnant by her lover Jae Lee . A later episode in the third season would resolve this storyline , showing that Jin was cured of his infertility and is the father of their baby . Sun 's deception over the affair would later be resolved in the season four episode " Ji Yeon " , when Juliet tells Jin about Sun and Jae Lee . 
 Actor Daniel Dae Kim enjoyed the fight scene between him and guest actor Tony Lee , commenting that " I really appreciate the fact that [ Jin ] ' s just a down @-@ and @-@ dirty street fighter . I think his style of fighting fits his character " . He continued " it was great to see a different layer to Sun 's character .

 It was originally scheduled to air on October 18 , 2006 , but was swapped with the episode " Further Instructions " and broadcast one week earlier . When " The Glass Ballerina " first aired , it was the seventh most watched episode of the week in the United States , with 16 @.@ 890 million viewers and a 6 @.@ 9 rating in the key demographic of adults ages 18 – 49 . 
 Lost critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine noted that like the season premiere , the episode " mostly serves to add uncomfortable wrinkles to one of the show 's saints , going so far as to make the consistently sympathetic Sun quite unlikable . " He added " While I ... question the need for the flashbacks , I must confess to finding this particular episode more wonderfully twisted than usual . " Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly wrote " Last week 's Jin / Sun episode was something of a disappointment , not because it was a bad episode of Lost , per se ( I would give it a solid B ) , but because it wasn 't as good as the exhilarating season premiere ( which I would give an A + ) . " 
 IGN 's Chris Carabott rated the episode 6 @.@ 8 / 10 , explaining that after the premiere 's " exciting , new direction " of an episode , " The Glass Ballerina " helped Lost " take a step back [ as it ] delivers nothing new or substantial " . He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and " a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television " , but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as " the only compelling scene in the whole episode " . On a list ranking all the Lost episodes , the Los Angeles Times ranked " The Glass Ballerina " 80 out of 110 episodes , explaining " A good flashback ( to Sun and her pre @-@ island lover ) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can 't make up for a listless on @-@ island plot . " On a similar list , IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes , writing " it felt appropriate for Lost 's third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack , Sawyer and Kate , since their abduction by the Others was a big part of Season 2 's conclusion . But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three , with almost no plot momentum , was frustrating and rather uninteresting . Meanwhile , we do pick up with Sayid , Sun and Jin , but it 's really only for yet another ' Sun and Jin have had a lot of big issues in their marriage ' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point . " 
 Daniel Dae Kim and Yunjin Kim each submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series respectively for the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards . 
 = Avonmouth railway station = 
 Avonmouth railway station is on the Severn Beach Line and serves the district of Avonmouth in Bristol , England . It is 9 @.@ 0 miles ( 14 @.@ 5 km ) from Bristol Temple Meads . Its three letter station code is AVN . The station has two platforms , on either side of two running lines . As of 2015 it is managed by Great Western Railway , which is the third franchise to be responsible for the station since privatisation in 1997 . They provide all train services at the station , mainly a train every forty minutes to Bristol Temple Meads and one every two hours to Severn Beach . 
 The station was opened in 1877 by the Bristol Port Railway and Pier , a railway which ran along the River Avon from Hotwells to a pier at Avonmouth . The station , originally known as Avonmouth Dock , had a single platform , but was rebuilt with two platforms by the Great Western and Midland Railways in 1885 when they began services via Clifton Down . The station was enhanced numerous times in the early part of the twentieth century , and by 1913 employed 72 staff . Facilities included a goods yard , signal box and engine shed . 
 The Severn Beach Line declined over the latter half of the twentieth century , with passenger numbers falling significantly . Goods services at Avonmouth ended in 1966 , and all staff were withdrawn in 1967 . Services had decreased to 10 per day each direction by 2005 , but have since increased to 25 trains per day . 
 = = Description = = 
 The station is located in the Avonmouth district of Bristol , an area of mixed industrial and residential usage . The station sits to the south of the junction of Gloucester Road and <unk> Road , the tracks running to parallel to <unk> Road and crossing Gloucester Road at a level crossing . The station is on the Severn Beach Line from Bristol Temple Meads to Severn Beach , 9 miles 02 chains ( 14 @.@ 5 km ) from Temple Meads and 4 miles 42 chains ( 7 @.@ 3 km ) from Severn Beach . It is the eighth station from Temple Meads . The next station towards Temple Meads is Shirehampton ; the next towards Severn Beach is St Andrews Road . 
 The station is on a north @-@ west / south @-@ east alignment , with two platforms separated by two running lines . The southern " up " platform , adjacent to the " Up Main " line , is used for trains towards Severn Beach . The northern " down " platform , adjacent to the " Down Main " line , is <unk> signalled , allowing it to be used by terminating trains and those heading towards Bristol . Both platforms have significant portions of their length fenced off , giving usable lengths of 91 yards ( 83 m ) for the southern platform and 70 yards ( 64 m ) for the northern . 
 Facilities at the station are minimal – there is a wooden canopy and bench seating on the northern platform , with a small metal shelter on the southern . Timetable information is provided ; help points show next train information and allow users to contact railway staff . There is no ticket office or other means for buying or collecting tickets . There is a car park with six spaces , as well as stands for four bicycles . The nearest bus stops are 150 metres ( 160 yd ) away on Avonmouth Road . 
 The line through Avonmouth has a speed limit of 30 miles per hour ( 48 km / h ) for locomotive @-@ hauled trains and 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) for diesel multiple units . The line , which is not electrified , handles less than 5 million train tonnes per year , has a loading gauge of W6 and a route availability of 7 . In the 2013 / 14 financial year , more than 110 @,@ 000 passengers used Avonmouth station , making it the <unk> busiest station in the country and the sixth busiest within the Bristol unitary authority area . This was an increase of 175 % from the 2002 – 03 financial year , and reflected a general rise in usage of the Severn Beach Line . The 2014 @-@ 15 estimates of station usage saw a further increase of 8 % to 120 @,@ 000 making it the <unk> busiest station in the country . 
 = = Services = = 
 Services at Avonmouth are all operated by Great Western Railway , using mainly Class 150 Sprinter units . Avonmouth is the main terminus of the Severn Beach Line ; as of 2015 there are 25 trains to and from Bristol Temple Meads each day from Monday to Friday , a service of three trains every two hours , giving a train every 40 minutes on average . Of these , one train every two hours runs to and from Severn Beach . Most services start at Bristol , but one evening service to Avonmouth starts at Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . On Saturdays there is a similar level of service , at 24 trains per day . Sunday sees a roughly hourly service to and from Bristol , ten trains per day , with only two services extending to Severn Beach , except during the May – September timetable period when all services are extended .

 Most trains from Avonmouth to Temple Meads call at all stations , but some services omit Lawrence Hill . Trains making the journey to and from Severn Beach call at St Andrews Road alternately on the outward or return leg . The typical journey time to Bristol Temple Meads is roughly 30 minutes , and 12 minutes to Severn Beach . In 2012 , the single fare to Clifton Down or Severn Beach was £ 1 @.@ 50 , and £ 3 return for the whole line .

 = = = Construction and early operations = = = 
 The railways first came to Avonmouth in 1865 , when services began on the Bristol Port Railway and Pier ( BPRP ) , a self @-@ contained railway which ran along the north bank of the River Avon to a deep water pier on the Severn Estuary . The BPRP line ran through the site of the current station and 1 mile 72 chains ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) beyond to a terminus at the first Avonmouth station . The BPRP ran into trouble by 1871 when the terminal pier at Avonmouth became difficult to use due to a build @-@ up of silt . With no prospect of a proper dock being funded without a connection to the national rail network , the Clifton Extension Railway ( CER ) was approved . This was a joint venture by the BPRP , Great Western Railway ( GWR ) and Midland Railway ( MR ) which ran from Sneyd Park Junction , south of Sea Mills , via Clifton Down , to join up with the national network at Narroways Hill Junction . The link opened in 1877 , but initially only for goods trains . The route from Sneyd Park Junction to Clifton Down was subsequently cleared for passenger use on 3 August 1878 , but the Midland and Great Western Railways did not think the BPRP track was in a suitable condition and so refused to run any passenger trains beyond Clifton Down . 
 The station , originally known as Avonmouth Dock , was opened in 1877 , shortly after the opening of the Avonmouth Docks in February that year . It was built on , or very near to , the site of a halt built in 1868 for the Docks ' construction workers . The local area was still mostly rural – there were a few buildings around the station area , as well as the docks , with the closest extent of the Bristol conurbation 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away at Shirehampton . The station cost £ 275 to build , and was merely a platform on the south side of the single track , served by eight trains per day between Hotwells and the BPRP 's Avonmouth terminus , increasing to ten per day from 1887 . The Great Western and Midland Railways considered the station inadequate for the passenger numbers expected , and so purchased additional land to enhance the station with extra tracks . The new station comprised a wide island platform – the northern face on the original through line , the southern face being for a new terminal line . The station , now known as Avonmouth Dock Joint , was constructed using mainly wood and corrugated iron . It was opened on 1 September 1885 , coinciding with the beginning of passenger services beyond Clifton Down . The Great Western initially offered six trains per day each direction between Avonmouth Dock and Bristol Temple Meads . Fearing competition , the BPRP did not allow passengers to use GWR services between its stations . The Midland Railway did not run any passenger services beyond Clifton Down , apart from a one @-@ month trial service in September 1885 . Despite the increased traffic the BPRP suffered financially , and was taken over by the CER in 1890 . The BPRP 's Avonmouth terminus closed to the public in 1902 , after which all trains terminated at Avonmouth Dock . 
 = = = Early twentieth century = = = 
 The station went through numerous enhancements in the first part of the twentieth century . A new platform canopy and urinal were provided in 1900 at a cost of £ 250 . Further improvements followed in 1902 at a cost of £ 80 ; and in August 1904 significant enhancements to the station buildings and an extension of the platform cost a total of £ 1 @,@ 570 . A 60 feet ( 18 m ) turntable was constructed in December 1903 , with a signal box , known as Avonmouth Dock Passenger , installed at the end of the platform . Dedicated goods staff were employed from the start of 1904 , with that year also seeing the installation of a run @-@ around loop for the terminal platform . A small engine shed was added in January 1905 . In 1910 , some passenger trains once again began to run beyond Avonmouth Dock , continuing towards Henbury on the newly opened Henbury Loop Line , which allowed goods trains to the docks to avoid the steep Clifton Down Tunnel . Other trains arrived from London via the loop , connecting with steamer services to Canada and Jamaica . At this point there were 17 trains from Bristol to Avonmouth Dock and 15 back each day ; increasing to 21 and 19 respectively by 1920 . The station was well @-@ staffed , with 25 station staff and 47 goods staff in 1913 . Positions included stationmaster ; booking clerks ; posters ; and outdoor porters , who took goods to ships in the docks . 
 During the First World War , an Army Remount Service depot was located near Shirehampton . Over the course of the war , Avonmouth Dock Joint handled 35 @,@ 000 animals , mainly horses and mules , en route to the depot . July 1917 saw the introduction of platform tickets , to capitalise on people using the station to bid farewell to friends heading overseas , or to welcome those returning . The platform was lengthened to 330 feet ( 100 m ) in December 1917 . A second through track was added in 1918 , and so a new cinder @-@ covered platform was built on the north side of the line . The two platforms were linked by a footbridge and a level crossing . The cost of the new platform and the lengthening works was £ 7 @,@ 420 . 
 After the war , construction of the Bristol Portway along the Avon Gorge necessitated the closure of the line from Sneyd Park Junction to Hotwells , with trains along it ceasing on 3 July 1922 . By this point there were nine trains per day from Hotwells , and eight return . To compensate for the loss of service , the Great Western provided an additional four trains daily from Avonmouth Dock to Bristol and six return . In 1923 , grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London , Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) , and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS . The engine shed was closed in 1924 . 
 By the mid @-@ 1920s , the station was proving inadequate for the passenger numbers , and so work began on a comprehensive rebuild in 1926 . The new buildings were made of brick ; with a large , four @-@ <unk> building containing most of the facilities ; as well as a separate parcels office . The northern platform had a wooden awning built , which is still in place today . 
 From 1928 many services to Avonmouth Dock were extended to Severn Beach . By 1947 , just before the railways were nationalised , there were 33 services each direction between Avonmouth Dock and Temple Meads , with 18 on Sundays . Some trains made circular trips to and from Temple Meads via Clifton Down and Henbury or Pilning . 
 = = = British Rail and privatisation = = = 
 When the railways were nationalised in 1948 , services at Avonmouth Dock came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways . By 1955 , service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from Bristol and 29 return , but the services were at regular intervals . Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase , and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted , which lost more passengers . A year later in 1963 , the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line , but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn . Goods services from the station ended on 20 June 1966 , the same day that the station was renamed " Avonmouth " . The bay platform was taken out of use and the land later taken for industrial buildings . From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line , including Avonmouth , with tickets issued by the train guard . The station buildings on the island platform survived into the 1970s , as did the footbridge , but with the exception of the parcels office , all were later demolished . The parcels office was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon . The signal box was closed in January 1969 , and in September 1973 the wooden level crossing gates were replaced by automatic lifting barriers . By 1974 , service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction , with no Sunday services to Severn Beach . 
 British Rail was split into business @-@ led sectors in the 1980s , at which time operations at Avonmouth passed to Regional Railways . At this time , all trains ran to Severn Beach , but the service pattern was irregular . This changed in 1995 when an hourly timetable was introduced for peak times , but northbound services were terminated at Avonmouth . 
 When the railway was privatised in 1997 , local services were franchised to Wales & West , which was succeeded by Wessex Trains , an arm of National Express , in 2001 . Following action by Friends of Severn Beach Railway and a string of protests , services had increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005 , with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains . The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006 , and responsibility passed to First Great Western , a subsidiary company of FirstGroup , subsequently rebranded as Great Western Railway in 2015 . A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement , ensuring an hourly service along the line , and this has since been increased to three trains every two hours ( 25 trains per day ) . Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored in 2010 . 
 = = Future = = 
 The last remaining station building , the old parcels office , is threatened with demolition by Network Rail , which owns the station . Network Rail states that the building is beyond economic repair , but local rail campaigners , including Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways and MP Charlotte Leslie , have petitioned to prevent the demolition . 
 First Great Western declined a contractual option to continue the Greater Western passenger franchise ( of which services at Avonmouth are a part ) beyond 2013 , citing a desire for a longer @-@ term contract due to the impending upgrade to the Great Western Main Line . The franchise was put out to tender , but the process was halted and later scrapped due to the fallout from the collapse of the InterCity West Coast franchise competition . A two @-@ year franchise extension until September 2015 was agreed in October 2013 , and subsequently extended until March 2019 . 
 With the coming upgrade to the Great Western Main Line , the main line from London to Bristol is due to be electrified by 2016 . However , the electrification will not extend beyond the main lines , so Avonmouth will continue to be served by diesel trains , with the current " Sprinter " units expected to be replaced by Class 165 and 166 " Networker Turbo " units . Stephen Williams , MP for Bristol West ; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the electrification being extended to the Severn Beach Line . 
 Improved services at Avonmouth are called for as part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme , a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area . There is an aspiration for half @-@ hourly services , with trains towards Bristol terminating alternately at Portishead and Bath Spa , however due to the large sections of the Severn Beach Line which are single @-@ track , and to the congested main line from Temple Meads , such frequency is not currently feasible . The enhancement scheme was given the go @-@ ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal , whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government . There are also calls for the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line , which could allow a direct service from Avonmouth to Bristol Parkway . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board , however Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion . 
 = Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project = 
 The Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration seeks to correct and add new information about past North Atlantic hurricanes . It was started around 2000 to update HURDAT , the official hurricane database for the Atlantic Basin , which has become outdated since its creation due to various systematic errors introduced into the database over time . This effort has involved reanalyses of ship observations from the International Comprehensive Ocean @-@ Atmosphere Data Set ( <unk> ) as well as reanalyses done by other researchers over the years . It has been ongoing for fourteen years now , and should last another four years . 
 = = Inaccuracies and omissions in existing data = = 
 = = = Errors = = = 
 HURDAT contains a number of errors which need to be corrected , such demonstrated by the outliers in the a pressure vs. wind speed graph of <unk> in the database ( right ) . Some of these errors have existed since the database 's creation during NASA 's Apollo Program , where it was used to help produce probabilities of tropical cyclone @-@ induced winds in critical areas such as Cape Kennedy ( now Cape Canaveral ) . 
 = = = New information = = = 
 A significant amount of new data for systems between 1851 and 1886 became available after a major basin @-@ wide reanalysis in 1996 , a project led by Jose Fernandez @-@ <unk> with the collaboration of Henry Diaz . The new data was constructed using old newspaper articles and the hemispheric weather map series . Hurricane histories for individual states had been constructed by the 1990s as well , which proposed new storms and increased the knowledge of tropical cyclones already in the database . Due to this profusion of relevant information not included in HURDAT , and evolving definitions for tropical and subtropical cyclones over the decades , the project was started around 2000 to update the official database . Since then , the International Comprehensive Ocean @-@ Atmosphere Data Set has been utilized to check for older ship reports which were either not utilized nor available to previous researchers . 
 = = = <unk> of dataset = = = 
 As early as 1957 , it was recognized that an increasing trend in the number of tropical cyclones each season in the Atlantic Basin was at least partially tied to increasing observations and better records . By analyzing the density of ship tracks over time , it has been estimated that between 1900 and 1966 , an average of two storms per year are missing from HURDAT . This is mainly due to a lack of satellite imagery and lack of reconnaissance aircraft prior to 1943 . An additional storm per year is likely missing prior to the advent of new technologies . These technologies include satellite @-@ derived <unk> winds , satellite @-@ derived temperature profile information , and Robert Hart 's cyclone phase space diagrams , which have led to a recent increase in tropical cyclone detection . <unk> was launched in 1999 , and has been credited with allowing Chantal to be named during the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season . The last two help determine whether or not a low pressure area is an extratropical cyclone , subtropical cyclone , or tropical cyclone . 
 Christopher Landsea noted that the efforts to <unk> the Atlantic hurricane database 
 will not be able to recover observations of open ocean tropical cyclones that were just never taken . Researchers cannot assume that the Atlantic tropical cyclone database presents a complete depiction of frequency of events before the advent of satellite imagery in the mid @-@ 1960s . Moreover , newly available advanced tools and techniques are also contributing toward monitoring about one additional Atlantic tropical cyclone per year since 2002 . Thus large , long @-@ term ' trends ' in tropical cyclone frequency are primarily manifestations of increased monitoring capabilities and likely not related to any real change in the climate in which they develop . 
 = = Progress = = 
 The project has currently reanalyzed storms from the period 1886 to 1955 , and has extended HURDAT back to 1851 . In 2001 , data for the years 1851 – 1885 were added to the official database from the Fernández @-@ Partagás series of publications . Also , a <unk> conference was held at the University of South Carolina which proposed to increase the scope of HURDAT from a starting year of 1851 to a start of 1800 . The conference also discussed ways of exchanging information for the inclusion of older tropical cyclones , such as via compact disc or a Wikipedia @-@ style website . While the reanalysis has mostly proceeded sequentially , notable exceptions have been made for the reanalysis of some significant tropical cyclones . In 2002 , for the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Andrew , the reanalysis was completed for the hurricane , which upgraded the cyclone to a Category 5 hurricane . In 2014 , a similar reanalysis was completed for Hurricane Camille . 
 Work by Michael Chenoweth , in collaboration with Cary Mock , increased knowledge of tropical cyclones in the Caribbean Sea for 1750 to 1786 . Chenoweth conducted a basin @-@ wide reassessment for old source material from the 1700 to 1855 period by using surface weather observations mainly in the form of ship reports , newspapers , and various diaries and journals from the region around the Caribbean Sea . 
 = = = Future efforts in other basins = = = 
 There is agreement within tropical cyclone circles of doing an " Atlantic @-@ style " reanalysis for other ocean basins . Some efforts are underway to start similar reanalyses across the western and eastern north Pacific Ocean , but are likely to take longer to complete . This is due to the need for coordination between the multiple Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres , which have the responsibility for tracking and forecasting tropical cyclones across that ocean . These tropical cyclone reanalyses are important , as theories concerning climate change and tropical cyclone trends hinge upon the quality of these databases .

 = American Cream Draft = 
 The American Cream Draft is a rare draft horse breed , the only such breed developed in the United States that is still in existence . It is recognized by its cream color , known as " gold champagne " , produced by the action of the champagne gene upon a chestnut base color , and by its amber eyes , also characteristic of the gene ; the only other color found in the breed is chestnut . Like several other breeds of draft horses , the American Cream is at risk for the autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa . 
 The breed was developed in Iowa during the early 20th century , beginning with a cream @-@ colored mare named Old Granny . The Great Depression threatened the breed 's existence , but several breeders worked to improve the color and type of the breed , and in 1944 a breed registry was formed . The mechanization of farming in the mid @-@ 20th century led to a decrease in the breed 's population and the registry became inactive for several decades . It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then . However , population numbers are still considered critical by The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 American Creams have refined heads , with flat facial profiles that are neither concave nor convex . They have wide chests , sloping shoulders and short , strong backs . Their ribs are well sprung , and they are short @-@ coupled with well @-@ muscled hindquarters and with strong well @-@ proportioned legs set well apart . They are sure @-@ footed with strong hooves , and their movement is free and easy . According to enthusiasts , the breed has a calm , willing temperament , particularly suited for owners who are new to handling draft horses . Mares stand 15 – 16 hands ( 60 – 64 inches , 152 – 163 cm ) high and weigh 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 pounds ( 680 – 730 kg ) , while stallions and geldings stand 16 – 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 64 – 67 inches , 163 – 170 cm ) and weigh 1 @,@ 800 pounds ( 820 kg ) or more . 
 The ideal coat color for the breed is a medium cream with pink skin , amber eyes and a white mane and tail . The characteristic cream color of the breed is produced by the champagne gene . Recognized colors include light , medium and dark cream , with amber or hazel eyes . A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may be accepted by the registry as foundation stock , while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered . Purebred American Cream foals that are too dark to be accepted into the main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry . The appendix will also accept half @-@ bred Cream Draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements , and the registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes , increase breed numbers , and allow more diversified bloodlines . 
 = = = Color genetics = = = 
 The champagne gene produces diluted color , and the gold champagne body color , light skin , light eyes , and ivory mane and tail associated with the American Cream Draft are produced by the action of the champagne gene on a chestnut base coat . In the adult horse , the skin is pink with abundant dark freckles or mottling , and the eyes are hazel or amber . The eyes of champagne foals are blue at birth , darkening as they age , and a foal 's skin is bright pink . The breed registry describes foals ' eyes as " almost white " , which is consistent with the nature of the champagne blue foal eye , which is creamier than other types of blue eye . 
 Champagne is a dominant trait , based on a mutation in the <unk> gene . The mapping of the gene was announced in 2008 , and the American Cream Draft cross was among the breeds studied . The authors of this study noted that it was difficult to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous animals , thus distinguishing champagne from incomplete dominant dilutions such as the cream gene . However they noted that homozygotes may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color than heterozygotes . Anecdotal reports also note mild differences , including lighter <unk> , skin and hair coat , though eye color remains the same . 
 Dark @-@ skinned American Cream Draft horses are actually chestnuts , as the breed is not homozygous for the champagne gene ; only one allele is needed to produce the proper color . Champagne dilutes any base coat color , and in the American Cream Draft , the underlying genetic base color is chestnut . As of 2003 , scientists have not found the breed to carry the cream gene , even though breeders refer to the desired color as " cream " . The American Cream Draft is never cremello or white , and though the gold coat color with a white mane and tail resembles palomino , the breed 's defining characteristics are the result of the champagne gene . 
 = = = <unk> epidermolysis bullosa = = = 
 The autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa ( JEB ) has been found in some American Cream Drafts . This is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities , normally leading to euthanasia of the animal . It is most commonly associated with Belgian horses , but is also found in other draft breeds . A DNA test was developed in 2002 , and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another . The American Cream registry states that it has " been pro @-@ active in testing its registered animals since JEB was discovered " . 
 = = Breed history = = 
 The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence today . The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny . She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905 , and was first noticed at an auction in Story County , Iowa , in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin , a well known stock dealer . She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell , Iowa . Her breeding is not known , but she was cream @-@ colored and many of her foals were as well ; they sold for above @-@ average prices because of their color . Her cream @-@ colored coat , pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed , and the color is now known as gold champagne . In 1946 , two years after the breed registry was formed , 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny . 
 In 1920 , a colt of Old Granny 's named Nelson 's Buck No. 2 impressed veterinarian Eric Christian to the point that Christian asked the Nelsons not to geld him . They agreed to let him remain a stallion , and he sired several cream @-@ colored foals , though only one was registered : a colt named Yancy No. 3 , whose dam was a black mare of Percheron breeding . Yancy sired Knox 1st , born in 1926 to an unregistered bay mare of mixed Shire ancestry . From this sire line , in 1931 , a great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Nelson 's Buck was born , named Silver Lace No. 9 . Silver Lace was to become one of the most influential stallions of the American Cream breed . His dam was a Belgian mare with light chestnut coloring , and she is credited with Silver Lace 's size – at 2 @,@ 230 pounds ( 1 @,@ 010 kg ) he weighed considerably more than most of his bloodline . Silver Lace quickly became a popular stallion in Iowa . However , stallions standing for public stud service in Iowa were required to be registered with the Iowa Department of Agriculture , and this agency only allowed horses of recognized breeds . As Silver Lace was not registered with any breed registry , his owners created a breeding syndicate , and mare owners who bought shares in the " Silver Lace Horse Company " could breed their mares to him . However , his main breeding career coincided with the economic struggles of the Great Depression , and Silver Lace was at one point hidden in a neighbor 's barn to prevent his sale at auction . Another significant foundation stallion was <unk> 's Captain , whose bloodlines appear in about one @-@ third of all American Cream Drafts . 
 Around 1935 , despite the Depression , a few breeders started to <unk> and <unk> cream @-@ colored horses to fix their color and type . In particular , C.T. <unk> began buying cream @-@ colored mares sired by Silver Lace and developing the American Cream breed in earnest . In 1944 , a breed association , the American Cream Association , was formed by 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter in the state of Iowa . In 1950 , the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture , based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board . 
 The mechanization of farming in the mid @-@ 20th century led to a decrease in the overall draft horse population , and with <unk> 's death in 1957 , American Cream Draft numbers began to decline . By the late 1950s there were only 200 living American Creams registered , owned by only 41 breeders . The registry became inactive until 1982 , when three families who had retained their herds reactivated and reorganized the registry . In 1994 , the organization officially changed its name to the American Cream Draft Horse Association ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = 1990s to the present = = = 
 In 1982 , owners began blood @-@ typing their horses , and by 1990 , genetic testing found that " compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data , the Creams form a distinct group within the draft horses . " The American Cream Draft was found to have a genetic relationship with the Belgian breed that was no closer than the ones it had with the Percheron , Suffolk Punch and Haflinger breeds . Registry records dating to the early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding . As of 2000 there were 222 registered horses , a number that increased to 350 as of 2004 . Of these , 40 were " tracking horses " – either purebred American Creams that did not meet color requirements or crossbred horses that mix American Cream and other draft blood , but still meet the physical requirements for the registry . These tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock , with the resulting foals able to be registered as purebred American Creams . Around 30 new horses are registered each year . The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at " critical " status , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2 @,@ 000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the US . The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be " critical " , meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today . To help replenish numbers , the <unk> has developed regulations to permit foals to be registered when produced via methods such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer . Careful use of the appendix registry also allows numbers to increase . 
 The American Creams that live in Colonial Williamsburg have been called " the most famous of all American Cream Draft horses " . In the village they are used for wagon and carriage rides , and as of 2006 there is a breeding program run by Colonial Williamsburg that is working to increase breed numbers .

From Spokane Valley , the roadway continues to the Idaho state border , where it becomes Idaho State Highway 53 . 
 The current route of SR 290 was formerly county roads between 1901 and 1937 , when it became Secondary State Highway 2H ( SSH 2H ) . The highway ran from U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) and US 395 in Downtown Spokane to Idaho until a 1964 renumbering of state highways , which re @-@ designated SSH 2H as SR 290 .

 SR 290 begins as a short divided highway at a directional T @-@ interchange with Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) east of downtown Spokane . This interchange was originally built for a planned North Spokane Corridor in the 1970s . The freeway continues north to an interchange with 2nd Avenue that only allows eastbound traffic to enter and westbound traffic to exit the freeway . The highway is named Hamilton Street and travels north over Sprague Avenue , BNSF Railway tracks , and the Spokane River before intersecting Trent Avenue , the former route of the roadway prior to 2005 . At the intersection , located near Gonzaga University , SR 290 turns east and becomes Trent <unk> before crossing the Spokane River again . Trent Avenue travels northeast through an industrial district , paralleling the Spokane International branch of the Union Pacific Railroad , through Millwood before intersecting SR 27 , locally named Pines Road . The highway crosses the Spokane River a third time and enters the <unk> neighborhood of Spokane Valley , where it intersects Sullivan Road by way of a diamond interchange . From Spokane Valley , the roadway travels northeast through farmland to Newman Lake , where it crosses into Idaho and becomes Idaho State Highway 53 , which continues east to Rathdrum as Trent Road . 
 Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year .

 A road following the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway line from Spokane to the Idaho state border at Newman Lake has existed since 1901 . In 1937 , the road became Secondary State Highway 2H ( SSH 2H ) and ran from Primary State Highway 2 in Spokane to Wellesley Avenue at the Idaho state border . SSH 2H was scheduled to be designated SR 290 in 1970 after a highway renumbering in 1964 . The new designation was made to align with the sign route , now state route , system . In 1967 , the eastern terminus of SSH 2H was shifted north to align with Idaho State Highway 53 ( ID 53 ) . In 1970 , the state route system came into effect and SR 290 was established along with a spur route connecting the main highway to Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) .

The EP contains the songs " Independent " , " July 1st " and " Hanabi " , all written and co @-@ composed by Hamasaki ( under the alias Crea ) , alongside composer Dai Nagao and producer Max Matsuura . Hamasaki had written and recorded the three songs when she was still hurt and influenced by the events of the September 11 attacks and the completion of her fourth studio album I Am ... ( 2002 ) . 
 The attacks influenced Hamasaki 's lyrical and musical direction , and had made her decide to create more worldly @-@ inspired music . The EP utilizes dance and pop music , with each song being influenced by pop rock , electronica , and trip hop music . Like Rainbow , it contains ambient @-@ influenced sounds such as handclaps and cheering . The lyrical content deals with freedom , fun and sadness , continuing themes seen on her previous album . 
 The EP received mostly positive reviews from music critics , who commended the production value . Many critics praised it as being one of Hamasaki 's career highlights . The EP was commercially successful in her native Japan , peaking at number one on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart . It became the only single in 2002 the same year to sell over one million units in Japan , and was certified by the Recording Industry Association of Japan for one million copies shipped to stores .

 On New Years Day 2002 , Hamasaki released her fourth studio album I Am ... from Avex Trax . The album saw a new direction for Hamasaki , whose first three studio albums was dominated by a pop rock sound , and lyrics based on loneliness , confusion , sadness , relationships and individualism . The result was not well @-@ received from critics , who felt the effort was " unassuming " , particularly on her debut release A Song for × × ( 1999 ) . After being affected emotionally by the September 11 attacks , Hamasaki quickly changed the album 's planned musical direction , and updated the album cover to support world peace . This effort was Hamasaki 's first album to focus on lighter themes , such as faith , humanity and serenity . I Am ... became a success and sold over 2 @.@ 3 million copies in Japan , and was certified triple million by the RIAJ . 
 Hamasaki begun work on Rainbow the same year , and intended to focus on the same themes again . While promoting I Am ... , Hamasaki performed for the first time outside Japan at the 2002 MTV Asia Music Awards in Singapore . Her performance has been seem as an influencing factor for Japanese musical acts to begin performing overseas . At the ceremony , Hamasaki felt that by only writing Japanese lyrics , she was not able to bring her " message " to other countries and decided to write in English . Rainbow contained three songs with English lyrics ; " Real Me " , " <unk> " and " Over " . Despite this , none of the three songs on H feature English lyrics . 
 Three months before the release of H , Hamasaki released her first single from Rainbow , " Free & Easy " , on April 24 , 2002 . The song received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success , peaking at number one on the Oricon Charts and selling over 400 @,@ 000 copies . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The September 11 attacks influenced Hamasaki 's writing for her studio albums I Am ... and Rainbow . I Am ... focused on world peace and political aspects and featured " A Song Is Born " , a song particularly influenced by the event which had been included on Song Nation , a non @-@ profit album funded by her label Avex Trax for the September 11 victims . The song itself sold over 400 @,@ 000 units in Japan and the profits were donated towards the American government to help with the damages . 
 Rainbow and the H tracks were recorded in Tokyo at Avex Studios , Prime Sound Studio , JVC Victor Studios , as well as at other recording studios in Japan . " Hanabi " and " Independent " was mixed by Yasuo Matsumoto , while " July 1st " was mixed by Koji Morimoto . In order to expand her creative control , she had composed nine tracks on Rainbow and subsequently co @-@ composed all the tracks from H. " Independent " was the first song recorded for the studio album . Avex Trax director Yasuyuki Tomita and Hamasaki had discussed having a song with a baseball theme . While she was convinced by his idea , Tomita later reconsidered the idea and scrapped it . Japanese producer Dai Nagao , who had co @-@ composed Hamasaki 's album Loveppears , thought of a similar concept and suggested the idea to Hamasaki , which she accepted . The single version of " Independent " was not featured on Rainbow , a version of the song titled " Independent + " was included as a hidden track . This was the third time Hamasaki had included a song as a hidden track , after " <unk> " on Loveppears ( 1999 ) . The song discusses independence and adulthood . 
 The second track , " July 1st " was composed by Nagao and Hamasaki . Japanese disc jockey Cool @-@ K also included additional scratching on the track . As H was released during the Japanese summer , Hamasaki decided to incorporate a " summer vibe " to the tracks and , according to Tomita , " July 1st " was her strongest song to feature this . These themes had also been explored throughout I Am .... The lyrical content is " uplifting and cheerful " and talks about fun experiences ; Hamasaki commented , " This was the first time I had ever written a song [ " July 1st " ] from this viewpoint , and I even surprised myself ! " " Hanabi " talks about Hamasaki 's views of the world , and discusses personal nostalgia . Hamasaki wanted the songs to be deeper , and Tomita commented that " Hanabi " was the first time he saw Hamasaki feel more engaged with global artists and incorporating those influences , rather than simply being influenced by Japanese music . " Hanabi " ' s title was written in English characters , and is the Japanese word for fireworks . The title was re @-@ used on her single & for the track " Hanabi ( Episode II ) " . 
 = = Musical styles = = 
 H incorporates different genres including trip hop , dance @-@ rock and electronica . " Independent " is a pop rock song with elements of modern electronica . The song features more " relaxed " vocals and " softer " lyrical content . According to Tomita , Hamasaki had placed microphones in Tokyo Dome during one of her concerts , to recorded the audience 's voices and " cheerleader " hand claps , as a way to incorporate inspiration from her fans . 
 " July 1st " is a Eurodance and dance @-@ pop influenced song . According to CDJournal , the song starts with a " natural breezy " guitar flow . " Hanabi " is inspired by British trip hop and dub music , and is also strongly influenced by ambient music . The song 's lyrical content and composition were based on the theme of nostalgia , which Hamasaki felt was one of her more deep songs . She felt that putting " Hanabi " after " July 1st " was perfect because it interrupted the emotions created by the " summery vibe " of " July 1st " ; Hamasaki herself had stated that her idea was to create " a summer that ends in deep sadness . " Tomita felt that Hamasaki was trying to move outside of the Japanese domestic market by incorporating British trip hop influences .

 At the end of 1905 football looked about to be abolished due to all of the reoccurring violence during games .

Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season . 
 As a result , the 1906 season was played under a new set of rules . The rules governing intercollegiate football were changed to promote a more open and less dangerous style of play . An intercollegiate conference , which would become the forerunner of the NCAA , approved radical changes including the legalization of the forward pass , allowing the punting team to recover an on @-@ side kick as a live ball , abolishing the dangerous flying wedge , creating a neutral zone between offense and defense , and doubling the first @-@ down distance to 10 yards , to be gained in three downs .

 On Thanksgiving , the Commodores reached the season 's high point and beat the Carlisle Indians 4 – 0 . Just a week before the contest , Vanderbilt negotiated a game with Carlisle to fill an open date . The Nashville Banner predicted it would be : " the greatest game the south ever saw . " The game started forty @-@ five minutes late to accommodate the large crowd . 
 Vanderbilt won by a single , 17 @-@ yard Bob Blake field goal 4 – 0 . In the first two minutes of play , the Indians drove the ball to Vanderbilt 's 3 @-@ yard line , but the Commodores line held and they got no further . Frank Mount Pleasant , one of the first regular spiral pass quarterbacks , attempted four field goals , but missed them all . 
 Atlanta Constitution sporting editor A. W. Lynn wrote : " The general surprises are numerous enough , but the largest particular one was the Commodore – Indian contest , when Vanderbilt took off the greatest honors ever falling to the lot of a southern football team in the hardest battle ever fought on a southern gridiron . John Heisman wrote : " Manier bucked the Indians ' line . Costen handled the ball surely and well downed Mt . Pleasant in his tracks on most of Blake 's punts ... I am still convinced that outside Yale and Princeton , the Commodores would have an even break with any other team in the country . " Vanderbilt running back Honus Craig called this his hardest game , giving special praise to Albert <unk> as : " the fastest end I ever saw . " 
 One source claims the Carlisle Indians failed to receive supplies on the trip to Nashville , including their receiving <unk> emptied of water . " The Indians had the poorest kind of accommodations at Nashville , and on account of the change of water every one of them became ill . "

 Vanderbilt won an SIAA championship . Coach McGugin called the Carlisle victory " the crowning feat of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association season . " 
 Dan Blake , Owsley Manier , and Joe Pritchard all graduated . Manier went on to receive an M. D. from the University of Pennsylvania , and played one season on the football team . " But his effectiveness at Pennsylvania was lessened by the attempt of the coaches to change his style of bucking a line from the low , plunging dive to running into it erect , knees drawn high and great dependence upon his companion backs to " hike " him . " At Penn he was shifted to halfback , and mostly used for swift plunges into the line . Penn defeated Michigan , exacting revenge for the multiple losses suffered by Manier to Michigan at Vanderbilt . 
 Dan Blake went on to coach at Hopkinsville High School in Hopkinsville , Kentucky . While there he was manager of the electric light and gas plants of the Kentucky Public Service Company . Pritchard coached at LSU for part of one season and was later a Presbyterian dental missionary at <unk> in the Congo until he was forced to return to the United States due to poor health sometime before 1915 .

 = Matthew Hale ( jurist ) = 
 Sir Matthew Hale SL ( 1 November 1609 — 25 December 1676 ) was an influential English barrister , judge and lawyer most noted for his treatise Historia Placitorum Coronæ , or The History of the Pleas of the Crown . Born to a barrister and his wife , who had both died by the time he was 5 , Hale was raised by his father 's relative , a strict Puritan , and inherited his faith . In 1626 he matriculated at Magdalen Hall , Oxford ( now Hertford College ) , intending to become a priest , but after a series of distractions was persuaded to become a barrister like his father thanks to an encounter with a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law in a dispute over his estate . On 8 November 1628 he joined Lincoln 's Inn , where he was called to the Bar on 17 May 1636 . As a barrister , Hale represented a variety of Royalist figures during the prelude and duration of the English Civil War , including Thomas Wentworth and William Laud ; it has been hypothesised that Hale was to represent Charles I at his state trial , and conceived the defence Charles used . Despite the Royalist loss , Hale 's reputation for integrity and his political neutrality saved him from any repercussions , and under the Commonwealth of England he was made Chairman of the Hale Commission , which investigated law reform . Following the Commission 's dissolution , Oliver Cromwell made him a Justice of the Common Pleas . 
 As a judge , Hale was noted for his resistance to bribery and his willingness to make politically unpopular decisions which upheld the law . He sat in Parliament , either in the Commons or the Upper House , in every Parliament from the First Protectorate Parliament to the Convention Parliament , and following the Declaration of Breda was the Member of Parliament who moved to consider Charles II 's reinstatement as monarch , sparking the English Restoration . Under Charles , Hale was made first Chief Baron of the Exchequer and then Chief Justice of the King 's Bench . In both positions , he was again noted for his integrity , although not as a particularly innovative judge . Following a bout of illness he retired on 20 February 1676 , dying ten months later on 25 December 1676 . 
 Hale is almost universally appreciated as an excellent judge and jurist , with his central legacy coming through his written work , published after his death . His Historia Placitorum Coronæ , dealing with capital offences against the Crown , is considered " of the highest authority " , while his Analysis of the Common Law is noted as the first published history of English law and a strong influence on William Blackstone 's Commentaries on the Laws of England . Hale 's jurisprudence struck a middle @-@ ground between Edward Coke 's " appeal to reason " and John Selden 's " appeal to contract " , while refuting elements of Thomas Hobbes 's theory of natural law . His thoughts on marital rape , expressed in the Historia , continued in English law until 1991 , and he was cited in court as recently as 1993 .

 = = = Early life and education = = = 
 Hale was born on 1 November 1609 in West End House ( now known as The Grange or Alderley Grange ) in Alderley , Gloucestershire to Robert Hale , a barrister of Lincoln 's Inn , and Joanna Poyntz . His father gave up his practise as a barrister several years before Hale 's birth " because he could not understand the reason of giving colour in pleadings " . This refers to a process through which the defendant would refer a case over the validity of his title to land to a judge instead of a jury , through claiming a ( false ) allegation about this right . Such an allegation would be a question of law rather than a question of fact , and as such decided by the judge with no reference to the jurors . Although in common use , Robert Hale apparently saw this as deceptive and " contrary to the exactness of truth and justice which became a Christian ; so that he withdrew himself from the inns of court to live on his estate in the country " . John Hostettler , in his biography of Matthew Hale , points out that his father 's concerns about giving colour in pleadings could not have been very strong " since he not only retired to his estate at Alderley where he managed to live on his wife 's inherited income , but also directed in his will that Matthew should make a career in the law " . 
 Both of Hale 's parents died before he was five ; Joanna in 1612 , and Robert in 1614 . It was then revealed that Robert had been so generous in giving money to the poor that at his death his estate provided only £ 100 of income a year , of which £ 20 was to be paid to the local poor . Hale thus passed into the care of Anthony Kingscot , one of his father 's relatives . A strong Puritan , Kingscot had Hale taught by a Mr. Stanton , the vicar of Wotton known as the " scandalous vicar " due to his extremist puritan views . On 20 October 1626 , at the age of 16 , Hale matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Magdalen Hall , with the goal of becoming a priest . Both Kingscot and Stanton had intended this to be his career , and his education had been conducted with that in mind . He was taught by Obadiah Sedgwick , another Puritan , and excelled in both his studies and fencing . Hale also regularly attended church , private prayer @-@ meetings , and was described as " simple in his attire , and rather aesthetic " . After a company of actors came to Oxford , Hale attended so many plays and other social activities that his studies began to suffer , and he began to turn away from Puritanism . In light of this , he abandoned his desire to become a priest and instead decided to become a soldier . His relatives were unable to persuade him to become a priest , or even a lawyer , with Hale describing lawyers as " a barbarous set of people unfit for anything but their own trade " . 
 His plans to become a soldier died after a legal battle concerning his estate , in which he consulted John Glanville . Glanville successfully persuaded Hale to become a lawyer , and , after leaving Oxford at the age of 20 before obtaining a degree , he joined Lincoln 's Inn on 8 November 1628 . Fearing that the theatre might dissuade him from his legal studies as it had at Oxford , he swore " never to see a stage @-@ play again " . At around this time he was drinking with a group of friends when one of them became so drunk he fainted ; Hale prayed to God to forgive and save his friend , and forgive him for his previous excesses . His friend recovered , and Hale was restored to his Puritan faith , never drinking to someone 's health again ( not even drinking to the King ) and going to church every Sunday for 36 years . He instead settled into his studies , working for up to 16 hours a day during his first two years at Lincoln 's Inn before reducing it to eight hours due to health concerns . As well as reading the law reports and statutes , Hale also studied the Roman civil law and jurisprudence . Outside of the law , Hale studied anatomy , history , philosophy and mathematics . He refused to read the news or attend social events , and occupied himself entirely with his studies and visits to church .

 On 17 May 1636 , Hale was called to the Bar by Lincoln 's Inn , and immediately became the pupil of William Noy . Hale and Noy became close friends , to the point where he was referred to as " the young Noy " , and more crucially he also met and befriended John Selden , a " man of almost universal learning , whose theories were to dominate much of [ Hale 's ] later thought " . Selden persuaded him to continue with his studies outside the law , and much of Hale 's written work is concerned with theology and science as well as legal theory . Hale gained a good legal practise , although he allowed his Christian faith to govern his work . He sought to help the court reach a just verdict , whatever his client 's concerns , and normally returned half his fee or charged a standard fee of 10 shillings rather than allow costs to inflate . He refused to accept unjust cases , and always tried to be on the " right " side of any case ; John Campbell wrote that " If he saw that a cause was unjust , he for a great while would not meddle further in it but to give his advice that it was so ; if the parties after that would go on , they were to seek another counsellor , for he would assist none in acts of injustice " . 
 Despite this , he was wealthy enough to purchase land worth £ 4 @,@ 200 in 1648 . He was in great demand ; law reporters began recording his cases and in 1641 he advised Thomas Wentworth , the first Earl of Strafford , over his attainder for high treason . Although unsuccessful , Hale was then called to represent William Laud , the Archbishop of Canterbury , during his impeachment by the House of Lords in October 1644 . Hale , along with John Herne , argued that none of Laud 's alleged offences constituted treason , and that the Treason Act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons . John Wilde , arguing for the prosecution , admitted that none of Laud 's actions amounted to treason , but argued that all of them together did . Herne , in his arguments written by Hale , retorted that " I crave your mercy , [ Wilde ] . I never understood before this time that two hundred couple of black rabbits would make a black horse ! " The case against Laud began to fail , but Parliament issued an Act of Attainder which declared him guilty , and sentenced him to death . After the capture of Charles I , Hale was expected to defend him , and indeed offered to do so ; the King refused to submit to the court , claiming he did not recognise its jurisdiction . Edward Foss writes , based on the statement of Charles <unk> , that it was Hale who actually provided the King with this defence , and that it was only because the defence prevented any counsel being called for the King that Hale did not appear in court . 
 When it became clear that the King was losing the Civil War , and only Oxford held out , Hale decided to act as a commissioner to negotiate its surrender , fearing that the city might otherwise be destroyed . Thanks to his intercession , honourable terms were reached , and the libraries preserved . Despite practising in the politically charged environment of the English Civil War and primarily defending opponents of the resulting Commonwealth of England , Hale 's reputation did not suffer . First , he largely kept out of the war , even ignoring news of its progress , and instead translating The Life and Death of <unk> Atticus into English . Second , he was acknowledged as universally able and of high integrity during his cases , retorting to those who complained of his defence of the Royalists that he was " pleading in defence of the laws which they professed they would maintain and preserve ; and that he was doing his duty to his client and was not to be daunted by such <unk> " . 
 = = = = Hale Commission = = = = 
 During the rule of both the Commonwealth and the Protectorate , there was considerable desire for law reform . Many judges and lawyers were corrupt , and the criminal law followed no real reason or philosophy . Any felony was punishable by death , proceedings were in a form of Norman French , and judges regularly imprisoned judges for reaching a verdict they disagreed with . Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament aimed to establish a " new society " , which included reforming the law . To that end , on 30 January 1652 Hale was appointed chairman of a commission to investigate law reform , which soon became known as the Hale Commission . The Commission 's official remit was defined by the Commons ; " taking into consideration what inconveniences there are in the law ; and how the mischiefs which grow from delays , the <unk> and irregularities in the proceedings in the law may be prevented , and the speediest way to reform the same , and to present their opinions to such committee as the Parliament shall appoint " . The Commission consisted of eight lawyers and 13 laymen , which sat from 23 January approximately three times a week . 
 The Commission recommended various changes , such as reducing the use of the death penalty , allowing defendants access to legal counsel , legal aid and the abolition of peine forte et dure as a torture mechanism . Dissolved on 23 July 1652 after producing 16 bills , none of the Commission 's recommendations immediately made it into law , although two ( to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages ) were brought into force through statutes by the Barebone 's Parliament . Almost all of the recommendations eventually became part of English law , with John Hostettler , in his biography of Hale , writing that if the measures had been put into law immediately , " we would have been honouring such pioneers for their farsightedness in enhancing our legal system and the concept of justice " . 
 = = = = Justice of the Common Pleas = = = = 
 Oliver Cromwell , noting Hale 's abilities , asked him to become a Justice of the Common Pleas . Although Hale considered that taking this commission would make others think he supported the Commonwealth , he was persuaded to do so , replacing John <unk> . Only Serjeants @-@ at @-@ Law could become judges , and as such Hale was made a Serjeant on 25 January 1653 . He was formally appointed a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas , one of the three principal Westminster courts , on 31 January 1653 , on the condition that he " would not be required to acknowledge the usurper 's authority " . He also refused to put people to death for offences against the government ; he believed that because the government authorising him to do so was an illegal one , " putting men to death on that account was murder " . William Blackstone later wrote that " if judgment of death be given by a judge not authorized by lawful commission , and execution is done accordingly , the judge is guilty of murder ; and upon this argument Sir Matthew Hale himself , though he accepted the place of a judge of the Common Pleas under Cromwell 's government , yet declined to sit on the crown side at the assizes , and try prisoners , having very strong objections to the legality of the usurper 's commission " . Hale also made decisions which negatively impacted on the Commonwealth , executing a soldier for murdering a civilian in 1655 , and actively refusing to attend a court hearing outside term time . On another occasion , Cromwell personally selected a jury in a trial he was concerned with , something contrary to law ; as a result , Hale dismissed the jury and refused to hear the case . On 15 May 1659 , Hale chose to retire , and was replaced by John Archer . 
 = = = = Member of Parliament = = = = 
 On 3 September 1654 , the First Protectorate Parliament was called ; of the 400 English members , only two were lawyers — Hooke , a Baron of the Exchequer , and Hale , who was elected Member of Parliament for his home county of Gloucestershire . Hale was an active MP , persuading the Commons to reject a motion to destroy the Tower of London 's archives , and introducing several motions to preserve the authority of Parliament . The first was that the government should be " in a Parliament and a single person limited and restrained as the Parliament should think fit " , and he later proposed that the English Council of State be subject to re @-@ election every three years by the House of Commons , that the militia should be controlled by Parliament , and that supplies should only be granted to the army for limited periods . While these proposals got support , Cromwell refused to allow any MPs into the Commons until they signed an oath recognising his authority , which Hale refused to do . As such , none of them were passed . Dissatisfied with the First Protectorate Parliament , Cromwell dissolved it on 22 January 1655 . 
 A Second Protectorate Parliament was called on 17 September 1656 , which wrote a constitution titled Humble Petition and Advice that called for the creation of an Upper House to perform the job of the former House of Lords . Cromwell accepted this constitution , and in December 1657 nominated the Upper House 's members . Hale , as a judge , was called to it . This new House 's extensive jurisdiction and authority was immediately questioned by the Commons , and Cromwell responded by dissolving the Parliament on 4 February 1658 . On 3 September 1658 , Oliver Cromwell died and was replaced by his son , Richard Cromwell . Richard Cromwell summoned a new Parliament on 27 January 1659 , and Hale was returned as MP for Oxford University . Richard Cromwell was a weak leader , however , and ruled for only 8 months before resigning . On 16 March 1660 General Monck forced the Parliament to vote for its own dissolution and call new elections . At the same time , Charles II made the Declaration of Breda , and when the Convention Parliament met on 25 April 1660 ( with Hale a member from Gloucestershire again ) it immediately began negotiations with the King . Hale moved in the Commons that " a committee might be appointed to look into the overtures that had been made , and the concessions that had been offered , by [ Charles I ] " and " from thence to digest such propositions , as they should think fit to be sent over to [ Charles II ] " who was still in Breda . On 1 May Parliament restored the King , and Charles II landed in Dover three weeks later , prompting the English Restoration .

 Hale 's first task in the new regime was as part of the Special Commission of 37 judges who tried the 29 regicides not included in the Declaration of Breda , between 9 and 19 October 1660 . All were found guilty of treason , and 10 of them were hanged , drawn and quartered . Sitting as a judge in this trial led to some viewing Hale as hypocritical , with F.A. <unk> later writing " I confess to a feeling of pain at finding [ Hale ] in October 1660 , sitting as a judge at the Old Bailey , trying and condemning to death batches of the regicides , men under whose orders he had himself acted , who had been his colleagues in Parliament , with whom he had sat on committees to alter the law " . Perhaps as reward for this , he became Chief Baron of the Exchequer on 7 November 1660 , replacing Sir Orlando Bridgeman . Hale had no wish to receive the knighthood that accompanied this appointment and so tried to avoid being near the King ; in response , the Lord Chancellor Lord Clarendon invited him to his house , where the King was present . Hale was knighted on the spot . 
 There were many instances of parties to a case attempting to bribe Hale . When a Duke approached him before a case " to help the judge understand a case that was to come before him " , Hale said that he would only hear about cases in court . In another case , he was sent venison by a party . After noticing the man 's name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison , Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food . When Sir John Croke , suspected in engaging in a conspiracy , sent him some sugar loaves to excuse his absence from a case , Hale remarked that " I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King 's Justices come into the country to take bribes . Some other person , having a design to put a trick upon him , sent them in his name " . Hale returned the loaves , and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him . Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety , and through doing so " secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen " . His knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of the law , and Lord Nottingham , considered the " father of equity " , " worshipped Hale as a great master " . 
 On 2 September 1666 , the Great Fire of London broke out . Over 100 @,@ 000 people were made homeless , and by the time the fire ended over 13 @,@ 000 houses and 400 streets had been destroyed . An Act of Parliament enacted on 8 February 1667 constituted a Court of Fire , tasked with dealing with property disputes over ownership , liability and the rebuilding of the city . Hale was tasked with sitting in this court , which met in Clifford 's Inn , and heard 140 of the 374 cases the court dealt with during its first year in operation . 
 On 18 May 1671 , Hale was made Chief Justice of the King 's Bench after the death of John <unk> . Edward <unk> replaced him as Chief Baron of the Exchequer . Hale was not noted as a particularly innovative judge , but took pains to ensure that his decisions were easy to understand and informative . Roger North wrote that " I have known the Court of King 's Bench sitting every day from eight to 12 , and the Lord Chief Justice Hale 's managing matters of law to all imaginable advantage to the students , and in that he took a pleasure or rather pride ; he encouraged arguing when it was to the purpose , and used to debate with counsel , so that the court might have been taken for an academy of sciences as well as the seat of justice " . He was noted for allowing counsel to fix any problems with pleadings , and for letting them correct him if he made an error in his summing up . He disliked eloquence , writing that " If the judge or jury has a right understanding it signifies nothing but a waste of time and loss of words , and if they are weak , and easily wrought upon , it is a more decent way of corrupting them by bribing their fancies and <unk> their affections . " As a judge , however , he was noted by Lord Nottingham as the greatest orator on the bench . 
 = = = = Retirement and death = = = = 
 By 1675 , Hale had begun to suffer from ill @-@ health ; his arms became swollen , and although a course of bloodletting relieved the pain temporarily , by the next February his legs were so stiff he could not walk . His initial attempts to resign as Chief Justice were declined by the King , but when Hale applied for a writ of ease the King reluctantly allowed him to retire on 20 February 1676 , granting him a pension of £ 1 @,@ 000 a year . He was replaced as Chief Justice by Richard <unk> . After suffering for ten more months , Hale died on 25 December 1676 at his country home , The Lower House ( now the site of the present day Alderley House ) . He was buried next to his first wife 's tomb in the churchyard of St Kenelm 's , the church which adjoined his home at Alderley , with a monument erected that reads : 
 Here is buried the body of Matthew Hale , Knight , the only son of Robert Hale , and Joanna his wife ; born in this parish of Alderley on the 1st day of November , in the year of our Lord 1609 , and died in the same place on the 25th day of December in the year of our lord 1676 ; in the 67th year of his age . 
 His estate was largely left for his widow , with his legal texts given to his grandson Gabriel if Gabriel chose to study the law , and his more valuable manuscripts and books given to Lincoln 's Inn . The male line of his family died out in 1784 with the death of Matthew Hale , his great grandson ; also a barrister . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 In 1642 Hale married Anne Moore , the daughter of Sir Henry Moore , a Royalist soldier , and the granddaughter of Sir Francis Moore , a Serjeant @-@ at @-@ Law under James I. Moore and Hale had 10 children , but she was evidently a highly extravagant woman , with Hale warning his children that " an idle or expensive wife is most times an ill bargain , though she bring a great portion " . Moore died in 1658 , and in 1667 Hale married Anne Bishop , his housekeeper . Descriptions of Bishop differ ; Roger North wrote that " [ Hale ] was unfortunate in his family ; for he married his own servant made , and then , for an excuse , said there was no wisdom below the girdle " . Richard Baxter , on the other hand , described Anne as " one of [ Hale 's ] own judgment and temper , prudent and loving , and fit to please him ; and that would not draw on him the trouble of much acquaintance and relations " . Hale himself described her as a " most dutiful , faithful , and loving wife " who was appointed an executrix on his death . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Hale is universally considered an excellent judge and jurist , particularly due to his writings . Edward Foss wrote that he was an " eminent judge , whom all look up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law , as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life " . Similarly , John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England , wrote that Hale was " one of the most pure , the most pious , the most independent , and the most learned " of judges . Henry Flanders , writing in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review , describes Hale during his lifetime as " the most learned , the most able , the most honorable man to be found in the profession of the law " . Hale 's writings have been cited as recently as 1993 , in the case of R v Kingston , where the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that " drunkenness is not a defence " to uphold a conviction . William Holdsworth argues that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him to work so effectively ; because he had seen other legal systems at work , he " could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before " . Hale 's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed to his Puritanism , and his support of the common law ; " Regimes come and go , the common law abides ... For Hale ... legal continuity was vital for civic identity " . 
 Much comparison has been made of Hale with Edward Coke . Campbell considered Hale to be the superior lawyer , because while he failed to engage in public life he treated law as a science , and maintained judicial independence and neutrality . Hostettler , while considering Hale a better lawyer than Coke and more influential , says that Coke was better overall . While Hale was in possession of judicial impartiality , and his written works are considered highly important , his lack of venture into public affairs limited his progressive influence . Coke 's active intervention allowed him to " breath new life into medieval law and use it to oppose conciliar justice " , encouraging judges to be more independent and " unfettered except by the common law whose supremacy it was their duty to uphold " . J.H. Corbett , writing in the Alberta Law Quarterly , notes that with Hale 's popularity at the time ( Parliamentary constituencies " fought over the privilege of returning him " ) he could have been just as successful as Coke if he had chosen to take an active role in public affairs . 
 = = = Writings = = = 
 Hale 's posthumous legacy is his written work . He wrote a variety of texts , treatises and manuscripts , the most major of which are A History and Analysis of the Common Law of England , published in 1713 , and the Historia Placitorum Coronæ , or The History of the Pleas of the Crown , published in 1736 . 
 The Analysis was based on lectures he gave to students , and was most likely not intended to be published ; it is considered the first history of English law ever written . Divided into 13 chapters , the book dealt with the history of English law and some suggestions for reform . William Blackstone , when writing his Commentaries on the Laws of England , noted in his preface that " of all the earlier schemes for digesting the Laws of England the most natural and scientific , as well as the most comprehensive , appeared to be that of Sir Matthew Hale in his posthumous Analysis of the Law " . Hale proposed the creation of county courts , and also drew a strong distinction between written laws , such as statutes , and customary , unwritten laws . He also argued that the common law was subject to Parliament , far before the confirmation of Parliamentary supremacy , and that the law should protect the rights and civil liberties of the King 's subjects . He also argued for the confirmation of trial by jury , which he described as " the best mode of trial in the world " , while the 13th chapter divided the law into the laws of persons and of property , and dealt with the rights , wrongs and remedies recognised by the law at the time . William Holdsworth , himself considered one of the greatest common law historians , described it as " the ablest introductory sketch of a history of English law that appeared till the publication of Pollock and Maitland 's volumes in 1895 " . 
 The Historia is perhaps Hale 's most famous work . Pleas of the Crown were capital offences committed " against the peace of our Lord the King , his Crown and dignity " ; as such , the book dealt with capital crimes and the associated procedure . The 710 @-@ page work followed the pattern of Coke 's Institutes of the Lawes of England , but was far more methodical ; James Fitzjames Stephen said that Hale 's work " was not only of the highest authority but shows a depth of thought which puts it in quite a different category from Coke 's Institute ... [ it ] is far more of a treatise and far less of an index or mere work of practice " . The book dealt with the criminal capacity of infants , insanity and idiocy , the defence of drunkenness , capital offences , treason , homicide and theft . In the 19th century , Andrew Amos wrote a critique of the Historia titled Ruins of Time exemplified in Sir Matthew Hale 's History of the Pleas of the Crown , which both criticised and praised Hale 's work while directing the main criticism at the judges and lawyers who cited the Historia without considering that it was dated . 
 Hale also reorganised the first of Coke 's Institutes , which dealt with Thomas de Littleton 's Treatise on <unk> ; Hale 's edition was the most commonly used , and the first to extract Coke 's broader philosophical points . His written works , however , were fragmentary , and did not individually lay out his jurisprudence . Harold J. Berman , writing in the Yale Law Journal , notes that it is only " possible by a study of the entire corpus of Hale 's writings to reconstruct the coherent legal philosophy that underlies them " . 
 Hale 's writings on witchcraft and marital rape were extremely influential . In 1662 , he was involved in " one of the most notorious of the seventeenth century English witchcraft trials " , where he sentenced two women ( Amy <unk> and Rose Callender ) to death for witchcraft , sorcery and " unnatural love " . The judgment of Hale in this case was extremely influential in future cases , and was used in the Salem witch trials to justify the forfeiture of the accused 's lands . G. <unk> , writing in the British Journal of Law and Society , ties Hale 's opinions on witchcraft in with his writings on marital rape , which are found in the Historia . Hale believed that a marriage was a contract , which merged the legal entities of husband and wife into one body . As such , " The husband cannot be guilty of a rape committed by himself upon his lawful wife , for by their mutual consent and contract the wife hath given up herself in this kind unto her husband , which she cannot retract " . This exception to the law of rape existed in England and Wales until 1991 , primarily due to his influence , until it was repealed by the House of Lords in R v R. 
 There are still dozens of volumes of Hale 's manuscripts that have not been published , including numerous theological treatises . The majority of these manuscripts are found in the <unk> Papers at the Lambeth Palace Library . His largest work in manuscript , " De Deo " ( ca . 1662 @-@ 1667 ) , consists of ten books filling five volumes and is estimated to contain nearly a million words . There are also three copies of a treatise on natural law at the British Library . A critical edition of this treatise on natural law has been published as Of the Law of Nature ( 2015 ) , which contains chapters on law in general and the law of nature . In the same work , Hale criticizes the reduction of natural law to self @-@ preservation as " the only <unk> Law ” ( the view normally associated with Thomas Hobbes ) , cites John Selden 's De jure <unk> et gentium juxta <unk> <unk> repeatedly , and appears to share conceptual continuities with both Hugo Grotius 's De jure belli ac <unk> and Francisco Suárez 's Tractatus de <unk> ac deo <unk> . 
 = = = Jurisprudence = = = 
 During Hale 's period as a barrister and judge , the general conclusion in England was that the repository of the law and conventional wisdom was not politics , as in Renaissance Europe , but the common law . This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke , who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge @-@ made law . Coke asserted that judge @-@ made law had the answer to any question asked of it , and as a result , " a learned judge ... was the natural arbiter of politics " . This principle was known as the " appeal to reason " , with " reason " referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws . Coke 's theory meant that certainty of the law and " intellectual beauty " was the way to see if a law was just and correct , and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable . John Selden held similar beliefs , in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England . However , he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it , and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect . The law was nothing more than a contract made by the English people ; this is known as the " appeal to contract " . Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke 's theory . Along with Francis Bacon , he argued for natural law , created by the King 's authority , not by any individual judge . Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers , and that the law could be understood not through Coke 's " reason " ( the method used by lawyers ) but through understanding the King 's instructions . While the judges did make law , this was only valid because it was " tacitly confirmed ( because not disapproved ) by the [ King ] " . 
 Hale 's legal theory was highly influenced by both Coke and Selden . He argued that the making of the law was a contract , but that it was subject to a test of " reasonable " character , something that only the judges could rule on . In this way , he sat in a middle ground between Selden and Coke . This was in conflict with the argument of Hobbes . In 1835 , Hale 's " Reflections on Hobbes ' Dialogue " was discovered ; Frederick Pollock posits that since Hobbes ' Dialogue was first published in 1681 , six years after Hale 's death , Hale must have seen an early copy or draft . <unk> Yale , writing in the Cambridge Law Journal , suggests that Chief Justice Vaughan had access to the Dialogue , and may have passed a copy on to Hale before his death . In his Reflections , Hale agreed with Coke that the judge 's task was to bring the reason of the common law ( the coherence of the legal system ) in line with the reason of the law in question ( to justify that law ) . He disagreed with Hobbes that a layman could understand the law , saying that " he that hath been educated in the study of the law hath a great advantage over those that have been otherwise exercised " . The distinction between Coke and Hale is that Hale agreed with Selden that law was created through agreement , and disagreed that reason had an inherent binding power . Hale agreed with Hobbes that the interpretation of the law could not be left to individual reason , and that the law is not an exact science ; the best that can be produced is a set of laws which give a reasonable outcome in the majority of cases .

 = Middlesex = 
 Middlesex ( / <unk> / , abbreviation : <unk> ) was a county in southeast England that is now mostly part of Greater London , with small sections in neighbouring counties . It was established in the Anglo @-@ Saxon system from the territory of the Middle Saxons . The historic county included land stretching north of the River Thames from 3 miles ( 5 km ) east to 17 miles ( 27 km ) west of the City of London with the rivers Colne and Lea and a ridge of hills as the other boundaries . The largely low @-@ lying county , dominated by clay in its north and alluvium on gravel in its south , was the second smallest by area in 1831 . 
 The City of London was a county in its own right from the 12th century and was able to exert political control over Middlesex . Westminster Abbey dominated most of the early financial , judicial and ecclesiastical aspects of the county . As London grew into Middlesex , the Corporation of London resisted attempts to expand the city boundaries into the county , which posed problems for the administration of local government and justice . In the 18th and 19th centuries the population density was especially high in the southeast of the county , including the East End and West End of London . From 1855 the southeast was administered , with sections of Kent and Surrey , as part of the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works . When county councils were introduced in England in 1889 about 20 % of the area of Middlesex , along with a third of its population , was transferred to the new County of London and the remainder became an administrative county governed by the Middlesex County Council that met regularly at the Middlesex Guildhall in Westminster , in the County of London . The City of London , and Middlesex , became separate counties for other purposes and Middlesex regained the right to appoint its own sheriff , lost in 1199 . 
 In the interwar years suburban London expanded further , with improvement and expansion of public transport , and the setting up of new industries . After the Second World War , the population of the County of London and inner Middlesex was in steady decline , with high population growth continuing in the outer parts . After a Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London , almost all of the original area was incorporated into an enlarged Greater London in 1965 , with the rest transferred to neighbouring counties . Since 1965 various areas called Middlesex have been used for cricket and other sports . Middlesex was the former postal county of 25 post towns .

 The name means territory of the middle Saxons and refers to the tribal origin of its inhabitants . The word is formed from the Anglo @-@ Saxon , i.e. Old English , ' <unk> ' and ' <unk> ' ( cf . Essex , Sussex and Wessex ) . In an 8th @-@ century charter the region is recorded as <unk> and in 704 it is recorded as <unk> . 
 = = = Early settlement = = = 
 There were settlements in the area of Middlesex that can be traced back thousands of years before the creation of a county . Middlesex was formerly part of the Kingdom of Essex It was recorded in the Domesday Book as being divided into the six hundreds of Edmonton , Elthorne , Gore , Hounslow ( Isleworth in all later records ) , Ossulstone and Spelthorne . The City of London has been self @-@ governing since the thirteenth century and became a county in its own right , a county corporate . Middlesex also included Westminster , which also had a high degree of autonomy . Of the six hundreds , Ossulstone contained the districts closest to the City of London . During the 17th century it was divided into four divisions , which , along with the Liberty of Westminster , largely took over the administrative functions of the hundred . The divisions were named Finsbury , Holborn , Kensington and Tower . The county had parliamentary representation from the 13th century . The title Earl of Middlesex was created twice , in 1622 and 1677 , but became extinct in 1843 . 
 = = = Economic development = = = 
 The economy of the county was dependent on the City of London from early times and was primarily agricultural . A variety of goods were provided for the City , including crops such as grain and hay , livestock and building materials . Recreation at day trip destinations such as Hackney , Islington , Highgate and Twickenham , as well as coaching , inn @-@ keeping and sale of goods and services at daily shops and stalls to the considerable passing trade provided much local employment and also formed part of the early economy . However , during the 18th century the inner parishes of Middlesex became suburbs of the City and were increasingly urbanised . The Middlesex volume of John Norden 's Speculum Britanniae ( a chorography ) of 1593 summarises : 
 This is plentifully stored , as it seemeth beautiful , with many fair and comely buildings , especially of the merchants of London , who have planted their houses of recreation not in the meanest places , which also they have cunningly contrived , curiously beautified with divers [ e ] devices , neatly decked with rare inventions , <unk> with orchards of sundry , delicate fruits , gardens with delectable walks , <unk> , alleys and a great variety of pleasing dainties : all of which seem to be beautiful ornaments unto this country . 
 Similarly Thomas Cox wrote in 1794 : 
 We may call it almost all London , being chiefly inhabited by the citizens , who fill the towns in it with their country houses , to which they often resort that they may breathe a little sweet air , free from the fogs and smoke of the City . 
 In 1803 Sir John Sinclair , president of the Board of Agriculture , spoke of the need to cultivate the substantial Finchley Common and Hounslow Heath ( perhaps prophetic of the Dig for Victory campaign of World War II ) and fellow Board member Middleton estimated that one tenth of the county , 17 @,@ 000 acres ( 6 @,@ 900 ha ) , was uncultivated common , capable of improvement . However William Cobbett , in casual travel writing in 1822 , said that " A more ugly country between <unk> ( Surrey ) and Kensington would with great difficulty be found in England . Flat as a pancake , and until you come to Hammersmith , the soil is a nasty , stony dirt upon a bed of gravel . Hounslow Heath which is only a little worse than the general run , is a sample of all that is bad in soil and villainous in look . Yet this is now enclosed , and what they call ' cultivated ' . Here is a fresh robbery of villages , hamlets , and farm and labourers ' buildings and abodes . " Thomas Babington wrote in 1843 , " An acre in Middlesex is worth a principality in Utopia " which contrasts neatly with its agricultural description . 
 The building of radial railway lines from 1839 caused a fundamental shift away from agricultural supply for London towards large scale house building . Tottenham , Edmonton and Enfield in the north developed first as working @-@ class residential suburbs with easy access to central London . The line to Windsor through Middlesex was completed in 1848 , and the railway to Potters Bar in 1850 ; and the Metropolitan and District Railways started a series of extensions into the county in 1878 . Closer to London , the districts of Acton , Willesden , Ealing and Hornsey came within reach of the tram and bus networks , providing cheap transport to central London . 
 After World War I , the availability of labour and proximity to London made areas such as Hayes and Park Royal ideal locations for the developing new industries . New jobs attracted more people to the county and the population continued to rise , reaching a peak in 1951 . 
 = = Governance = = 
 = = = The Metropolis = = = 
 By the 19th century , the East End of London had expanded to the eastern boundary with Essex , and the Tower division had reached a population of over a million . When the railways were built , the north western suburbs of London steadily spread over large parts of the county . The areas closest to London were served by the Metropolitan Police from 1829 , and from 1840 the entire county was included in the Metropolitan Police District . Local government in the county was unaffected by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , and civic works continued to be the responsibility of the individual parish vestries or ad hoc improvement commissioners . In 1855 , the parishes of the densely populated area in the south east , but excluding the City of London , came within the responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works . Despite this innovation , the system was described by commentators at the time as one " in chaos " . In 1889 , under the Local Government Act 1888 , the metropolitan area of approximately 30 @,@ 000 acres ( 120 km2 ) became part of the County of London . The Act also provided that the part of Middlesex in the administrative county of London should be " severed from [ Middlesex ] , and form a separate county for all non @-@ administrative purposes " . 
 The part of the County of London that had been transferred from Middlesex was divided in 1900 into 18 metropolitan boroughs , which were merged in 1965 to form seven of the present @-@ day inner London boroughs : 
 Camden was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hampstead , Holborn and St Pancras 
 Hackney was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hackney , Shoreditch and Stoke Newington 
 Hammersmith ( known as Hammersmith and Fulham from 1979 ) was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham 
 Islington was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Finsbury and Islington 
 Kensington and Chelsea was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Chelsea and Kensington 
 Tower Hamlets was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Bethnal Green , Poplar and Stepney 
 The City of Westminster was formed from the metropolitan boroughs of Paddington and St Marylebone and the City of Westminster . 
 = = = Extra @-@ metropolitan area = = = 
 Middlesex outside the metropolitan area remained largely rural until the middle of the 19th century and so the special boards of local government for various metropolitan areas were late in developing . Other than the Cities of London and Westminster , there were no ancient boroughs . The importance of the hundred courts declined , and such local administration as there was divided between " county business " conducted by the justices of the peace meeting in quarter sessions , and the local matters dealt with by parish vestries . As the suburbs of London spread into the area , unplanned development and outbreaks of cholera forced the creation of local boards and poor law unions to help govern most areas ; in a few cases parishes appointed improvement commissioners . In rural areas , parishes began to be grouped for different administrative purposes . From 1875 these local bodies were designated as urban or rural sanitary districts . 
 Following the Local Government Act 1888 , the remaining county came under the control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken Hadley , which became part of Hertfordshire . The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly . Middlesex did not contain any county boroughs , so the county and administrative county ( the area of county council control ) were identical . 
 The Local Government Act 1894 divided the administrative county into four rural districts and thirty @-@ one urban districts , based on existing sanitary districts . One urban district , South Hornsey , was an exclave of Middlesex within the County of London until 1900 , when it was transferred to the latter county . The rural districts were Hendon , South Mimms , Staines and Uxbridge . Because of increasing urbanisation these had all been abolished by 1934 . Urban districts had been created , merged , and many had gained the status of municipal borough by 1965 . The districts as at the 1961 census were : 
 After 1889 the growth of London continued , and the county became almost entirely filled by suburbs of London , with a big rise in population density . This process was accelerated by the Metro @-@ land developments , which covered a large part of the county . The expanding urbanisation had , however , been foretold in 1771 by Tobias Smollett in The Expedition of Humphry Clinker , in which it is said : 
 Pimlico and Knightsbridge are almost joined to Chelsea and Kensington , and , if this infatuation continues for half a century , then , I suppose , the whole county of Middlesex will be covered in brick . 
 Public transport in the county , including the extensive network of trams , buses and the London Underground came under control of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933 and a New Works Programme was developed to further enhance services during the 1930s . Partly because of its proximity to the capital , the county had a major role during the Second World War . The county was subject to aerial bombardment and contained various military establishments , such as RAF Uxbridge and RAF Heston , which were involved in the Battle of Britain . 
 = = = County town = = = 
 Middlesex arguably never , and certainly not since 1789 , had a single , established county town . London could be regarded as its county town for most purposes and provided different locations for the various , mostly judicial , county purposes . The County Assizes for Middlesex were held at the Old Bailey in the City of London . Until 1889 , the High Sheriff of Middlesex was chosen by the City of London Corporation . The sessions house for the Middlesex Quarter Sessions was at Clerkenwell Green from the early 18th century . The quarter sessions at the former Middlesex Sessions House performed most of the limited administration on a county level until the creation of the Middlesex County Council in 1889 . New Brentford was first promulgated as the county town in 1789 , on the basis that it was where elections of Knights of the Shire ( or Members of Parliament ) were held from 1701 . Thus a traveller 's and historian 's London regional summary of 1795 states that ( New ) Brentford was " considered as the county @-@ town ; but there is no town @-@ hall or other public building " . Middlesex County Council took over at the Guildhall in Westminster , which became the Middlesex Guildhall . In the same year , this location was placed into the new County of London , and was thus outside the council 's area of jurisdiction . 
 = = = Arms of Middlesex County Council = = = 
 Coats of arms were attributed by the mediaeval heralds to the Kingdoms of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Heptarchy . That assigned to the Kingdom of the Middle and East Saxons depicted three " seaxes " or short notched swords on a red background . The <unk> was a weapon carried by Anglo @-@ Saxon warriors , and the term " Saxon " may be derived from the word . These arms became associated with the two counties that approximated to the kingdom : Middlesex and Essex . County authorities , militia and volunteer regiments associated with both counties used the attributed arms . 
 In 1910 , it was noted that the county councils of Essex and Middlesex and the Sheriff 's Office of the County of London were all using the same arms . Middlesex County Council decided to apply for a formal grant of arms from the College of Arms , with the addition of an heraldic " difference " to the attributed arms . Colonel Otley Parry , a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and author of a book on military badges , was asked to devise an addition to the shield . The chosen addition was a " Saxon Crown " , derived from the portrait of King Athelstan on a silver penny of his reign , stated to be the earliest form of crown associated with any English sovereign . The grant of arms was made by letters patent dated 7 November 1910 . 
 The undifferenced arms of the Kingdom were eventually granted to Essex County Council in 1932 . <unk> were also used in the insignia of many of the boroughs and urban districts in the county , while the Saxon crown came to be a common heraldic charge in English civic arms . On the creation of the Greater London Council in 1965 a Saxon crown was introduced in its coat of arms . <unk> appear in the arms of several London borough councils and of Spelthorne Borough Council , whose area was in Middlesex . 
 = = = Creation of Greater London = = = 
 The population of inner London ( then the County of London ) had been in decline as more residents moved into the outer suburbs since its creation in 1889 , and this continued after the Second World War . In contrast , the population of Middlesex had increased steadily during that period . From 1951 to 1961 the population of the inner districts of the county started to fall , and the population grew only in eight of the suburban outer districts . According to the 1961 census , Ealing , Enfield , Harrow , Hendon , Heston & Isleworth , Tottenham , Wembley , Willesden and Twickenham had each reached a population greater than 100 @,@ 000 , which would normally have entitled each of them to seek county borough status . If this status were to be granted to all those boroughs it would mean that the population of the administrative county of Middlesex would be reduced by over half , to just under one million . 
 Evidence submitted to the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London included a recommendation to divide Middlesex into two counties of North Middlesex and West Middlesex . However , the commission instead proposed abolition of the county and merging of the boroughs and districts . This was enacted by Parliament as the London Government Act 1963 , which came into force on 1 April 1965 . 
 The Act abolished the administrative counties of Middlesex and London . The Administration of Justice Act 1964 abolished the Middlesex magistracy and lieutenancy , and altered the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court . In April 1965 , nearly all of Middlesex became part of Greater London , under the control of the Greater London Council , and formed the new outer London boroughs of Barnet ( part only ) , Brent , Ealing , Enfield , Haringey , Harrow , Hillingdon , Hounslow and Richmond upon Thames ( part only ) . The remaining areas were Potters Bar Urban District , which became part of Hertfordshire , and Sunbury @-@ on @-@ Thames Urban District and Staines Urban District , which became part of Surrey . Following the changes , local acts of Parliament relating to Middlesex were henceforth to apply to the entirety of the nine " North West London Boroughs " . In 1974 , the three urban districts that had been transferred to Hertfordshire and Surrey were abolished and became the districts of Hertsmere ( part only ) and Spelthorne respectively . In 1995 the village of <unk> was transferred from Spelthorne to the Berkshire borough of Slough . Additionally , since 1965 the Greater London boundary to the west and north has been subject to several small changes . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The county lay within the London Basin and the most significant feature was the River Thames , which formed the southern boundary . The River Lea and the River Colne formed natural boundaries to the east and west . The entire south west boundary of Middlesex followed a gently descending meander of the Thames without hills . In many places " Middlesex bank " is more accurate than " north bank " — for instance at Teddington the river flows north @-@ westward , so the left ( Middlesex ) bank is the south @-@ west bank . In the north , the boundary ran along a WSW / ENE aligned ridge of hills broken by Barnet or ' Dollis ' valleys . ( South of the boundary , these feed into the Welsh Harp Lake or Brent Reservoir which becomes the River Brent ) . This formed a long protrusion of Hertfordshire into the county . The county was thickly wooded , with much of it covered by the ancient Forest of Middlesex . The highest point was the High Road by Bushey Heath at 502 feet ( 153 m ) , which is now one of the highest points in London . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 " Middlesex " is used in the names of organisations based in the area such as Middlesex County Cricket Club , the Middlesex Cricket Board and Middlesex University . ( The last two of these were formed some time after Middlesex was abolished as an administrative county . ) There is a Middlesex County Football Association , and two teams that are now within Surrey , Staines Town and Ashford Town ( Middlesex ) as well as Potters Bar Town in Hertfordshire , compete in the Middlesex County Cup . Sir John Betjeman , a native of North London and Poet Laureate , published several poems about Middlesex and the suburban experience . Many were featured in the televised readings Metroland . 
 As part of a 2002 marketing campaign , the plant conservation charity Plantlife chose the wood anemone as the county flower . In 2003 , an early day motion with two signatures noted that 16 May is the anniversary of the Battle of Albuera and in recent years has been celebrated as " Middlesex Day " , commemorating the valiant efforts of the Middlesex Regiment ( the " Die @-@ hards " ) in that battle . The idea is to recognise and celebrate the historic county . On its creation in 1965 , Greater London was divided into five commission areas for the administration of justice . One was named " Middlesex " and consisted of the boroughs of Barnet , Brent , Ealing , Enfield , Haringey , Harrow , Hillingdon and Hounslow . This was abolished on 1 July 2003 . For genealogical research it was assigned Chapman code MDX , except for the City of London which was assigned code <unk> . 
 = = = Former postal county = = = 
 Middlesex ( abbreviated <unk> ) was a former postal county . This was an element of postal addressing in routine use until 1996 , intended to avoid confusion between post towns , and no longer required for the routing of the mail . The postal county did not match the boundaries of Middlesex because of the presence of the London postal district , which stretched into the county to include Tottenham , Willesden , Hornsey and Chiswick . Addresses in this area included " LONDON " but did not include a county . In 1965 Royal Mail retained the postal county because it would have been too costly to amend addresses throughout Greater London . Exceptionally , the Potters Bar post town was transferred to Hertfordshire . Geographically the postal county consisted of two unconnected areas , 6 miles ( 10 km ) apart . These were the smaller area around Enfield and the larger area to the west . It comprised 25 post towns : 
 † = postal county was not required 
 The postal county had many border inconsistencies where its constituent post towns encroached on neighbouring counties , such as the villages of Denham in Buckinghamshire , <unk> in Berkshire and Eastbury in Hertfordshire which were respectively in the post towns of Uxbridge , Staines and Northwood and therefore in the postal county of Middlesex . <unk> Hythe , Surrey also had postal addresses of Staines , Middlesex . Conversely , Hampton Wick was conveniently placed in Kingston , Surrey with its sorting offices just across the river . Nearby Hampton Court Palace has a postal address of East Molesey , therefore associating it with Surrey . 
 The Enfield post town in the EN postcode area was in the former postal county . All post towns in the HA postcode area and UB postcode area were in the former postal county . Most of the TW postcode area was in the former postal county . 
 = Oryzomys peninsulae = 
 Oryzomys peninsulae , also known as the Lower California rice rat , is a species of rodent from western Mexico . Restricted to the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula , it is a member of the genus Oryzomys of family Cricetidae . Only about twenty individuals , collected around 1900 , are known , and subsequent destruction of its riverine habitat may have driven the species to extinction . 
 Medium in size for its genus , it was first described as a separate species , but later lumped into other , widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009 . It is distinctive in fur color — grayish brown on the forequarters and reddish brown on the hindquarters — and in some dimensions of its skull , with a high braincase , robust zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) , and long incisive foramina ( perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars ) . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Oryzomys peninsulae was first collected in 1896 and Oldfield Thomas described it in 1897 as a full species of Oryzomys . It was retained as a distinct species related to O. couesi and O. palustris until 1971 , when Philip Hershkovitz swept it , and other outlying populations of the same species group , as subspecies under an expanded concept of O. palustris . Raymond Hall concurred in the second edition ( 1981 ) of Mammals of North America , arguing that O. peninsulae differed less from mainland Oryzomys populations ( currently classified as O. couesi mexicanus ) than some other forms he included in O. palustris differed from each other . After studies of the contact zone between North American O. palustris and Central American O. couesi in southern Texas and northeastern Tamaulipas ( by Benson and Gehlbach in 1979 and Schmidt and Engstrom in 1994 ) made clear that the two are distinct from each other , O. peninsulae remained as a subspecies of O. couesi . In 2009 , Michael Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo @-@ Cabrales reviewed the classification of western Mexican Oryzomys and used morphological and morphometrical data to characterize four distinct Oryzomys species in the region . O. peninsulae and another isolated population , O. nelsoni from the Islas Marías , were both retained as separate species , as was O. albiventer from montane mainland Mexico . They kept the population in the coastal lowlands as a subspecies , O. couesi mexicanus , of Oryzomys couesi . 
 The genus Oryzomys currently includes about eight species distributed from the eastern United States ( O. palustris ) into northwestern South America ( O. gorgasi ) . O. peninsulae is part of the O. couesi section , which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions . Many aspects of the systematics of this section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the group 's true diversity . Oryzomys was previously a much larger genus , but most species were progressively removed in various studies , culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus . Oryzomys and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 = = Description = = 
 Oryzomys peninsulae is a medium @-@ sized member of the genus , smaller than O. albiventer but larger than O. couesi mexicanus . Its fur is grayish @-@ brown on the forequarters , but reddish @-@ brown on the hindquarters ; this coloration pattern is unique among western Mexican Oryzomys . The underparts are a dirty white , the feet white above , and the tail dark or brownish above and dirty white below . 
 In the skull , the braincase is high , the zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) are broad and squared , and the incisive foramina , which perforate the palate between the incisors and the molars , are long and broad . The upper incisors are orthodont , with their cutting edge nearly vertical . <unk> , the skull of O. peninsulae is sharply distinct from other western Mexican Oryzomys . 
 In fourteen specimens measured by Carleton and Arroyo @-@ Cabrales , total length was 227 to 305 mm ( 8 @.@ 9 to 12 @.@ 0 in ) , averaging 265 @.@ 6 mm ( 10 @.@ 46 in ) ; head and body length was 113 to 152 mm ( 4 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 0 in ) , averaging 128 @.@ 9 mm ( 5 @.@ 07 in ) ; tail length was 114 to 156 mm ( 4 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 1 in ) , averaging 136 @.@ 8 mm ( 5 @.@ 39 in ) ; hindfoot length was 29 to 34 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 3 in ) , averaging 32 @.@ 0 mm ( 1 @.@ 26 in ) ; and occipitonasal length ( a measure of total skull length ) was 27 @.@ 8 to 34 @.@ 3 mm ( 1 @.@ 09 to 1 @.@ 35 in ) , averaging 31 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 24 in ) . 
 = = Distribution , ecology , and status = = 
 Twenty @-@ one specimens of O. peninsulae are known : six were caught at Santa Anita in 1896 by D. Coolidge , and Edward William Nelson and Edward Alphonso Goldman obtained fifteen additional individuals in 1906 at San José del Cabo . The two localities , which are about 13 km ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) apart , were both located along the Río San José , a river in southernmost Baja California Sur , near the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula . Like other Oryzomys species , O. peninsulae is semiaquatic , spending much of its time in the water , but suitable habitat for such a species is estimated to be no more than 13 km2 ( 5 @.@ 0 sq mi ) on the arid Baja California peninsula . 
 Río San José no longer exists , having fallen prey to irrigation projects , and touristic development of its estuary has resulted in pollution . Biologists working in the area in 1979 and from 1991 to 1993 failed to find O. peninsulae , casting doubt on its continued existence . The lack of records for over a century , small distribution , and destruction of the only known habitat led Carleton and Arroyo @-@ Cabrales to consider the conservation status of O. peninsulae as " critically endangered , if not extinct " . They noted that the status of the species had previously been obscured because it had been lumped for decades with O. couesi , a widely distributed and secure species . 
 = = Origin = = 
 It is uncertain how Oryzomys peninsulae arrived at its recent locale in Baja California Sur . In 1922 , Nelson suggested that it may have been introduced from another part of Mexico in a shipment of farm products , but this hypothesis is disproved by the clear differentiation from other western Mexican Oryzomys that the species exhibits . 
 The species 's range may be relictual in nature : while Oryzomys is currently found along the eastern coast of the Gulf of California only as far north as coastal southern Sonora , the past distribution of the genus may have extended further northward , perhaps even into the southwestern United States , and from there south into Baja California . Subsequent <unk> of Oryzomys from the northern regions would have led to its observed disjunct distribution , with O. peninsulae isolated on the peninsula . This possibility is supported by the relatively close resemblance between O. peninsulae and O. couesi mexicanus , from coastal western Mexico . 
 Alternatively , the ancestor of Oryzomys peninsulae may have arrived by rafting during the late Miocene , about six million years ago , when the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula was an island located near what is now Nayarit and Jalisco in western Mexico . Some plants and birds from the area may have a similar biogeographic heritage . 
 = Battle of Mycale = 
 The Battle of Mycale ( Ancient Greek : Μάχη τῆς <unk> ; Machē tēs <unk> ) was one of the two major battles that ended the second Persian invasion of Greece during the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . It took place on or about August 27 , 479 BC on the slopes of Mount Mycale , on the coast of Ionia , opposite the island of Samos . The battle was fought between an alliance of the Greek city @-@ states , including Sparta , Athens and Corinth , and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I. 
 The previous year , the Persian invasion force , led by Xerxes himself , had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium , and conquered Thessaly , Boeotia and Attica ; however , at the ensuing Battle of Salamis , the allied Greek navies had won an unlikely victory , and therefore prevented the conquest of the Peloponnese . Xerxes then retreated , leaving his general Mardonius with a substantial army to finish off the Greeks the following year . 
 In the summer of 479 BC , the Greeks assembled a huge army ( by contemporary standards ) , and marched to confront Mardonius at the Battle of Plataea . At the same time , the allied fleet sailed to Samos , where the demoralised remnants of the Persian navy were based . The Persians , seeking to avoid a battle , beached their fleet below the slopes of Mycale , and , with the support of a Persian army group , built a palisaded camp . The Greek commander Leotychides decided to attack the Persians anyway , landing the fleet 's complement of marines to do so . 
 Although the Persian forces put up stout resistance , the heavily armoured Greek hoplites again proved themselves superior in combat , and eventually routed the Persian troops , who fled to their camp . The Ionian Greek contingents in the Persian army defected , and the camp was assailed and a large number of Persians slaughtered . The Persian ships were then captured and burned . The complete destruction of the Persian navy , along with the destruction of Mardonius 's army at Plataea ( allegedly on the same day as the Battle of Mycale ) , decisively ended the invasion of Greece . After Plataea and Mycale , the allied Greeks would take the offensive against the Persians , marking a new phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . Although Mycale was in every sense a decisive victory , it does not seem to have been attributed the same significance ( even at the time ) as , for example the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Greek defeat at Thermopylae . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Greek city @-@ states of Athens and Eretria had supported the unsuccessful Ionian Revolt against the Persian Empire of Darius I in 499 @-@ 494 BC . The Persian Empire was still relatively young , and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples . Moreover , Darius was a usurper , and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule . The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire , and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved ( especially those not already part of the empire ) . Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece . A preliminary expedition under Mardonius , in 492 BC , to secure the land approaches to Greece ended with the re @-@ conquest of Thrace and forced Macedon to become a client kingdom of Persia . An amphibious task force was then sent out under Datis and Artaphernes in 490 BC , successfully sacking Naxos and Eretria , before moving to attack Athens . However , at the ensuing Battle of Marathon , the Athenians won a remarkable victory , which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia . 
 Darius therefore began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece . However , he died before the invasion could begin . The throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I , who quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece , including building two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont . In 481 BC , Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece asking for earth and water as a gesture of their submission , but making the very deliberate omission of Athens and Sparta ( both of whom were at open war with Persia ) . Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states . A congress of city states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC , and a confederate alliance of Greek city @-@ states was formed ( hereafter referred to as ' the Allies ' ) . This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world , especially since many of the city @-@ states in attendance were still technically at war with each other . 
 The Allies initially adopted a strategy of blocking the land and sea approaches to southern Greece . Thus , in August 480 BC , after hearing of Xerxes 's approach , a small Allied army led by the Spartan king Leonidas I blocked the Pass of Thermopylae , whilst an Athenian @-@ dominated navy sailed to the Straits of Artemisium . Famously , the vastly outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae against the Persians army for six days in total , before being outflanked by a mountain path . Although much of the Greek army retreated , the rearguard , formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents , was surrounded and annihilated . The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium , consisting of a series of naval encounters , was up to that point a stalemate ; however , when news of Thermopylae reached them , they also retreated , since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point . 
 Following Thermopylae , the Persian army had proceeded to burn and sack the Boeotian cities which had not surrendered , Plataea and Thespiae , before taking possession of the now @-@ evacuated city of Athens . The allied army , meanwhile , prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth . Xerxes wished for a final crushing defeat of the Allies to finish the conquest of Greece in that campaigning season ; conversely the allies sought a decisive victory over the Persian navy that would guarantee the security of the Peloponnese . The ensuing naval Battle of Salamis ended in a decisive victory for the Allies , marking a turning point in the conflict . 
 Following the defeat of his navy at the Salamis , Xerxes retreated to Asia with , according to Herodotus at least , the majority of the army . Herodotus suggests that this was because he feared the Greeks would sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges , thereby trapping his army in Europe . He thus left Mardonius , with handpicked troops , to complete the conquest of Greece the following year . Mardonius evacuated Attica , and wintered in Thessaly ; the Athenians then reoccupied their destroyed city . Over the winter , there seems to have been some tension among the Allies . In particular , the Athenians , who were not protected by the Isthmus , but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnese , felt hard done by , and demanded an allied army march north the following year . When the Allies failed to commit to this , the Athenian fleet refused to join the Allied navy in spring . The navy , now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides , thus skulked off Delos , whilst the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos , both sides unwilling to risk battle . Similarly , Mardonius remained in Thessaly , knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless , whilst the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponnese . 
 Mardonius moved to break the stalemate by trying to win over the Athenians and their fleet through the mediation of Alexander I of Macedon , offering peace , self @-@ government and territorial expansion . The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was also on hand to hear the offer , and rejected it : 
 The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the Medes ' strength is hardly something you need to bring to our attention . We are already well aware of it . But even so , such is our love of liberty , that we will never surrender . 
 Upon this refusal , the Persians marched south again . Athens was again evacuated and left to the Persians . Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis . Athens , along with Megara and Plataea , sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance , and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not . According to Herodotus , the Spartans , who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus , delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest , <unk> of Tegea , who pointed out the danger to all of Greece if the Athenians surrendered . When the Athenian emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans the next day , they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already en route ; the Spartan army was marching to meet the Persians . 
 In response , the Athenian navy under Xanthippus joined with the Allied fleet off Delos . They were then approached by a delegation from Samos , who suggested that the Ionian cities would revolt if the Allied fleet successfully engaged the Persian fleet . They furthermore pointed out the poor morale and reduced seaworthiness of the Persian fleet . Leotychides decided to attempt this , and sailed for Samos . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 When the Persians heard that the Allied fleet was approaching , they set sail from Samos towards the Ionian mainland . According to Herodotus , this was because they had decided in council that they could not beat the Allies in a naval battle . They sent the Phoenician ships away ( Herodotus does not explain why ) , and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale . Xerxes had left an army there , under the command of Tigranes , to guard Ionia . The Persians beached their ships , built a palisade around them , and prepared to guard the makeshift fort . 
 Finding the Persian fleet gone from Samos , the Allies were thrown into uncertainty . Eventually they resolved that they would sail to the mainland , and equipped themselves for a naval battle . However , when the Allies approached Mycale , the Persians did not attempt to engage them , and remained guarding their camp . Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible , and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians : 
 " Men of Ionia , you who hear us , understand what I say , for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle ; first of all it is right for each man to remember his freedom and next the battle @-@ cry Hebe : and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it . " 
 Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold ; firstly to encourage the Ionians , unbeknownst to the Persians , to fight for the Allies ( or at least not to fight against them ) ; or , if the message became known to the Persians , to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians . 
 Following this appeal , the Allies also beached their ships , and began to prepare to assault the camp . The Persians , guessing that their Samian contingent would support the allies , took away their armour . Furthermore , they sent the Milesians to guard the passes over Mycale , suspecting that the Milesians might also defect . Thus rid of two potential internal threats , the Persians left their camp , and prepared for battle . It is probable that the relatively small number of marines that the Allies had disembarked for the battle made them overconfident , encouraging the Persians to leave the safety of their camp . 
 Herodotus reports that as the Allies approached the Persian camp , rumour spread amongst them of an Allied victory at Plataea ; Diodorus also claims that Leotychides informed the Allies of victory at Plataea before the battle began . Their morale boosted by this omen , they set forth to win their own victory . Various explanations have been attempted to explain this occurrence , and also the alleged fact that Plataea and Mycale took place on the same day . Green suggests that following the victory at Plataea , the Allied commander Pausanias took control of the Persian beacon system that Xerxes had used to communicate with Asia , and used it to send tidings of Plataea to the Allied fleet . This would explain the rumour of victory and near simultaneous attack , but is only one possible theory . 
 = = Opposing Forces = = 
 = = = The Persians = = = 
 The number of Persian ships and men involved with the battle are , as so often in the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , somewhat problematic . It is clear that the Persian fleet did not dare conduct operations against the Greeks , and thus must have been approximately equal to , or smaller than the Greek fleet . Herodotus gives the size of the Persian fleet at 300 ships ; the Greeks had 378 at Salamis , but must have suffered significant losses , and so they probably also had around 300 in total ( though not necessarily all these ships formed part of the allied fleet for 479 BC ) . The Phoenician ships were dismissed from the Persian fleet before the battle , which reduced its strength further . 
 Diodorus tells us that to guard the camp and the ships the Persians gathered 100 @,@ 000 men in total , while Herodotus suggests that there were 60 @,@ 000 men in the army under the command of Tigranes . Squaring these two accounts , might suggest that there were c . 40 @,@ 000 men with the fleet . Given that the Persian fleet appears to have been undermanned in the aftermath of Salamis , 200 @-@ 300 ships would indeed give this number of naval personnel ( using Herodotus 's standard complement of 200 men per ship ) . However , this total of 100 @,@ 000 is probably too high ; to accommodate 100 @,@ 000 men and 200 + ships , the Persian camp would have to have been enormous . Estimates made of Mardonius 's huge camp at Plataea , which was planned and built with plenty of time , suggest it might have accommodated 70 @,@ 000 @-@ 120 @,@ 000 men ; it is improbable that such a large camp could have been built at Mycale in the time @-@ frame that Herodotus suggests . It is therefore possible that the 60 @,@ 000 quoted by Herodotus is actually the total number of Persians present at Mycale ; the Persians certainly outnumbered the Allies , emerging from the palisade in confidence after seeing the smaller number of the Allied troops . 
 = = = The Greeks = = = 
 Numbers of ships and men for the Allies are also somewhat problematic . Herodotus claims that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command . However , the previous year , the allies had fielded 271 triremes at the Battle of Artemisium , and then 378 at the Battle of Salamis . We are also told that the Allies had " command of the sea " after Salamis , which implies that they could at least equal the Persian fleet . Diodorus , on the other hand , tells us the allies had 250 ships , which is more consistent with their force levels of the previous year . These two numbers can be reconciled by assuming that Leotychides had 110 triremes under his command before being joined by Xanthippus and the Athenian ships , after the Allied army had marched out from the Peloponnesus . This is the approach taken by Holland , and gives a naval force which might well match the remnants of the Persian fleet . 
 Although the Athenians had sent 8 @,@ 000 hoplites to Plataea , they would still have had ample manpower to man a large fleet of triremes , especially since rowers tended to be of the lower classes ( the thetes ) who could not afford the equipment to fight as hoplites . The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men , including 14 marines . In the second Persian invasion of Greece , each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines , and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes . Furthermore , the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each . This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 40 – 45 soldiers — triremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight . Combining these numbers yields a range of 22 @,@ 000 – 58 @,@ 000 men for the Allies , with 3 @,@ 300 – 11 @,@ 250 more heavily armoured marines . Estimates of around 40 @,@ 000 men are given in some sources , which is approximately the median of the possible range , and seems as likely a number as any . However , since only the marines were expected to fight hand to hand , the rowers in the Allied fleet were probably not equipped to fight in a land battle ; it is likely therefore that it was only the marines who contested the battle . 
 = = Strategic & tactical considerations = = 
 From a strategic point of view , battle was not necessary for either side ; the main strategic theatre was mainland Greece itself . Although destroying the enemy navy would result in a clear strategic advantage for both sides , attempting this risked the loss of their own navy . The actions of the two sides thus reflect more upon their morale and confidence than on any strategic considerations . The Persians , seeing little to gain in battle , demoralised and riven with dissent , thus sought to avoid a naval battle . Conversely , the Allies , who had initially been as nervous of a battle as the Persians , sought to press home their morale advantage once they were informed of the state of the Persian fleet . 
 Tactically , the Persian fleet should have held the advantage at sea , since the Athenian part of the Greek fleet was , despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis , still raw in seamanship . However , whether because of their low morale , or because they were in fact outnumbered , the Persians sought instead the tactical advantage of joining up with the army under Tigranes , and fortifying a position . However , when the Greeks chose to fight on land , the Persians then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight the Greeks in the open field . Furthermore , as Marathon and Thermopylae had shown , large numbers conferred little advantage against the more heavily armoured hoplites ; thus , as the battle began , it was the Greeks who had the tactical upper hand . 
 = = The battle = = 
 The Allies seem to have formed into two wings ; on the right were the Athenians , Corinthians , Sicyonians and <unk> , and on the left were the Spartans with other contingents . The right wing marched across level ground straight towards the Persian camp , whilst the left wing attempted to outflank the Persians by passing through more broken ground . The right wing thus began fighting with the Persians while the left wing was still approaching . Herodotus reports that the Persians fought well at first , but that the Athenians and the contingents with them wished to win the victory before the Spartans arrived , and thus attacked ever more zealously . 
 Although the Persians stood their ground for a while , they eventually broke and fled to the palisade . The soldiers of the right wing followed them into the camp , at which point many of the Persian army fled from the camp , except the ethnic Persian troops , who grouped together and fought the Allied soldiers who entered the camp . Finally , the left wing arrived , outflanking the camp and falling on the rear of the remaining Persian forces , thereby completing the rout . 
 Herodotus tells us that , on seeing the outcome of the battle hung in the balance , the disarmed Samians had joined in on the side of the allies , doing what they could . This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well . At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear ; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line ( being disarmed ) , so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp . Meanwhile , the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians . At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops ; then , perhaps seeing the outcome of the battle was certain , they began killing the fleeing Persians . 
 Herodotus does not mention specific figures for casualties , merely saying that losses were heavy on both sides . The Sicyonians in particular suffered , also losing their general <unk> . On the Persian side , the admiral <unk> and the general Tigranes were both killed , though <unk> escaped . Herodotus says that a few Persians troops escaped the battle and made their way to Sardis . Diodorus claims that there were 40 @,@ 000 Persian casualties , and also suggests that the survivors made their way to Sardis . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When the Spartans arrived , the Persian camp was looted and their beached ships destroyed . Returning to Samos they then discussed their next moves . Leotychides proposed that they evacuate the cities of the Ionian Greeks and bring the population to the Greek mainland , since it would be difficult to defend Ionia against further Persian attacks . Xanthippus however vehemently objected to this , since the Ionian cities were originally Greek colonies . The Ionian Greeks later joined the Athenians in the " Delian League " against Persia . 
 With the twin victories of Plataea and Mycale , the second Persian invasion of Greece was over . Moreover , the threat of a future invasion was abated ; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again , over time it became apparent that the Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished . 
 After the victory at Mycale , the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges , but found that this was already done . The Peloponnesians sailed home , but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos , still held by the Persians . The Persians in the region , and their allies , made for Sestos , the strongest town in the region , and the Athenians laid siege to them there . After a protracted siege , Sestos fell to the Athenians , marking the beginning of a new phase in the Greco @-@ Persian Wars , the Greek counterattack . Herodotus ended his Histories after the Siege of Sestos . Over the next 30 years , the Greeks , primarily the Athenian @-@ dominated Delian League , would expel ( or help expel ) the Persians from Macedon , Thrace , the Aegean islands and Ionia . Peace with Persia finally came in 449 BC with the Peace of Callias , finally ending the half @-@ century of warfare . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Mycale and Plataea have great significance in ancient history as the battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece , thereby swinging the balance of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks . The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest , but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat . However , neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae , Salamis or Marathon . The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear ; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought . The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers ; Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds , and in dire strategic situations . Conversely , the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength , and against lesser odds ; perhaps the Greeks were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow . 
 Militarily , the major lesson of both Mycale and Plataea ( since both were fought on land ) was the repeated confirmation of the superiority of the hoplite over the more lightly armed Persian infantry , as had first been demonstrated at Marathon . Taking on this lesson , after the Greco @-@ Persian Wars the Persian empire started recruiting and relying on Greek mercenaries . This was amply illustrated later on by the Ten Thousand and Xenophon .
