 = = = Parliamentary representation = = = 
 Northallerton was formerly a parliamentary borough . Its first representatives were John le Clerk and Stephen Maunsell , who were elected to the parliament of King Edward I in 1298 , but for some reason or other no subsequent return was made until 1640 , when the privilege was again resumed by order of the House of Commons . From 1640 to 1885 The town formed the parliamentary borough of Northallerton , returning two Members of Parliament until 1832 , and one thereafter . Following the Great Reform Act of 1832 , boundaries were extended to include neighbouring Brompton and Romanby and its representation was reduced to a single member . In 1885 the constituency was abolished and was absorbed into the Richmond division of the North Riding . The serving member for Richmond constituency is the Conservative , Rishi <unk> , who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague . In modern times it has been an ultra @-@ safe seat for the Conservative Party with them having held it continually since 1929 . Richmond is included in the Yorkshire and the Humber constituency for elections to the European Parliament . It currently elects six members using the d 'Hondt method of party @-@ list proportional representation .

 = = = Topography = = = 
 Northallerton lies north of the Vale of York , just south of County Durham and in the Vale of Mowbray . To the west lie the Pennines , a range of hills which rises to around 2 @,@ 000 ft ( 610 m ) and to the east lie the North York Moors which rise to around 1 @,@ 500 ft ( 460 m ) . The proximity of these hills is significant in the climatology of the area . To the west of the town runs the River Wiske which services the River Swale , in turn it is serviced by Brompton Beck , <unk> Beck , Willow Beck and North Beck which run through the town . Although small in nature these have been the focus of flash flooding in the town and in Brompton village in recent years . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 According to the Köppen classification the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters . Compared with other parts of the country , The Vale of York is slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and <unk> in the winter . Owing to its inland position , and sheltered by the Pennines to the west , North Yorkshire is one of the driest counties in the UK , receiving , on average , around 600 mm ( 24 in ) of rain per year . The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is three hours and 42 minutes . 
 There are two distinct local weather phenomena , marked downslope lee winds caused by the proximity of the Pennines , leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60 KT ( 70 mph ) , most commonly in winter and spring . In the winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense , persistent fog to form which can last for several days . 
 The nearest official Met Office weather station to Northallerton is Leeming , about 6 mi ( 10 km ) to the west . Temperature extremes have ranged from 33 @.@ 5 ° C ( 92 @.@ 3 ° F ) during August 1990 , down to − 17 @.@ 9 ° C ( − 0 @.@ 2 ° F ) during December 2010 . 
 The new 1981 @-@ 2010 ( as apposed to 1971 @-@ 2000 ) averages from the Met Office show how the climate of Leeming has changed dramatically compared with most places in the UK . The average April maximum temperature is only 12 @.@ 3 ° C , compared with 14 @.@ 1 ° C previously . The average yearly temperature has decreased to 9 @.@ 45 ° C compared to 9 @.@ 55 ° C previously and in contrast most places of the UK have become warmer . The days have become cooler and the nights warmer . Winters have become much milder , summers cooler . Leeming now gets an additional 44 @.@ 7 mm of rain per year , although also 62 @.@ 3 more hours of sunshine . The climate of Leeming has generally lost its characteristics of being drier and with more seasonal variation , compared with the rest of the UK . Leeming recorded its warmest December temperature on record in 2015 .

 The following is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801 , which demonstrates a trend of slow population growth in the 19th century and more rapid growth in the 20th century . In particular over the past 40 years , in which the population of Northallerton has more than doubled . The fall in population between 1851 and 1871 has been attributed to the collapse in coaching as the railways became popular .

 = = = Northallerton School = = = 
 Northallerton School 's roots can be traced as far back as 1322 . Originally sited near the Parish Church , its initial role was to train boys in grammar and song . The school flourished in the 17th century under the mastership of Thomas Smelt , and notable alumni of that period include theologian George Hickes , historiographer royal Thomas Rymer , John Radcliffe , doctor to King William of Orange and theologian Thomas Burnet . The school struggled in the 19th century and almost closed at the start of the 20th century with the number of pupils in single figures . However following the 1902 Education Act the North Riding Education Committee resolved to build and restructure the grammar school . To that end a new school was built near the Thirsk Road , which opened in 1909 with 104 pupils , half of whom were girls , the first time that they had been admitted . The school expanded throughout the 20th century . Following the 1944 Education Act , the school entry was based on the Eleven plus exam with all fees and charges being abolished . In 1973 the grammar school merged with the Secondary Modern Allertonshire School , which opened in 1941 , with the Allertonshire taking pupils aged 11 – 14 and the grammar school ages 14 – 18 . By 1976 the comprehensive system was adopted and in 1994 the grammar school was renamed Northallerton College to better reflect the school 's role in the community . In 2015 Northallerton College merged with Allertonshire School to become a full secondary school , and continues to operate over both former school sites .

 = Washington : A Life = 
 Washington : A Life is a 2010 biography of George Washington , the first President of the United States , written by American historian and biographer Ron Chernow . The book is a " one @-@ volume , cradle @-@ to @-@ grave narrative " that attempts to provide a fresh portrait of Washington as " real , credible , and charismatic in the same way he was perceived by his contemporaries " . 
 Chernow , a former business journalist , was inspired to write the book while researching another biography on Washington 's long @-@ time aide Alexander Hamilton . Washington : A Life took six years to complete and makes extensive use of archival evidence . The book was released to wide acclaim from critics , several of whom called it the best biography of Washington ever written . In 2011 , the book won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography , as well as the New @-@ York Historical Society 's American History Book Prize . 
 = = Background = = 
 The book 's author , Ron Chernow , is a former freelance business journalist who later became a self @-@ described " self @-@ made historian " . His 1990 history of financier J.P. Morgan 's family , The House of Morgan , won the National Book Award for Nonfiction . In 2004 , he published a biography of American Founding Father Alexander Hamilton , for which he won the inaugural $ 50 @,@ 000 George Washington Book Prize . 
 Chernow conceived the idea of a book on Washington while researching Hamilton 's life ; the two men had worked together closely , and Chernow had come to believe that " Hamilton is the protagonist of the book but Washington is the hero of the book " . On discovering a letter about a quarrel between Hamilton and Washington , Chernow concluded that there was a more temperamental side to the president than had previously been portrayed . In a later C @-@ SPAN interview , he said that he came to see Washington as " a man of many moods , of many passions , of fiery opinions . But because it was all covered by this immense self @-@ control , people didn 't see it . " Despite what he estimated to be more than nine hundred books written on Washington , Chernow decided to write another , with the goal of providing a fresh portrait . 
 In writing the book that would become Washington : A Life , Chernow made extensive use of the archival evidence left by Washington 's meticulous record @-@ keeping . These documents included recently discovered written correspondence , maps , and images from the Papers of George Washington , made available by a University of Virginia research project , which began in 1968 . Washington : A Life took six years to complete , the first four years of which were spent purely on research . In June 2009 , near the end of his work on the book , Chernow slipped on a stair and broke his ankle in the three places . He was unable to do anything but read for the following months , and later attributed the injury with allowing him to return to the book with a fresh perspective and improve the manuscript . 
 = = Summary = = 
 The prelude of Washington : A Life draws a parallel between Gilbert Stuart 's portraits of George Washington and Chernow 's attempts to give a fresh portrait of his character in a biography . Stuart , Chernow argues , was not deceived by Washington 's " aura of cool command " , but painted him as " a sensitive , complex figure , full of pent @-@ up passion " ; Chernow states his intention to do the same , presenting Washington as " real , credible , and charismatic in the same way he was perceived by his contemporaries " . 
 Chernow presents Washington as " a man capable of constant self @-@ improvement " , rising from a provincial childhood to the presidency of the United States . Beginning with his boyhood , the biography discusses the major events of Washington 's in largely chronological order : his early life and service in the British Army during the French and Indian War ; his career as a planter and his growing dissatisfaction with British rule of the American colonies ; his service in the Continental Congress and as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolution ; his resignation and brief retirement following the revolution 's successful conclusion ; his return to public life at the Constitutional Convention ; his two terms as the first president of the United States , in which he set a number of important precedents for the office ; and the final years of his life . Chernow describes Washington 's accomplishments as president as " simply breathtaking " : 
 He had restored American credit and assumed state debt ; created a bank , a mint , a coast guard , a customs service , and a diplomatic corps ; introduced the first accounting , tax , and budgetary procedures ; maintained peace at home and abroad ; inaugurated a navy , bolstered the army , and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure ; proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties ; protected frontier settlers , subdued Indian uprisings , and established law and order amid rebellion , scrupulously adhering all the while to the letter of the Constitution ... Most of all he had shown a disbelieving world that republican government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule . 
 Several chapters also detail Washington 's complex feelings about slavery , an institution on which he relied but which he also despised ; he left provisions for his slaves to be freed after his death , the only slave @-@ owning founding father to do so . The personal aspects of Washington 's life covered by Chernow include the design , creation , and management of Mount Vernon ; his leisure activities and hobbies ; his difficult relationship with his mother ; his personal relationship with the married Sally Cary Fairfax , with whom Washington fell in love just before his marriage to Martha Dandridge Custis ; and his relationships with his adopted children , stepchildren , and grandchildren . Chernow also describes the relationships between the childless Washington and a succession of " surrogate sons " such as Alexander Hamilton , the Marquis de Lafayette , and Tobias Lear .

 In 2011 , Washington : A Life won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography , which included a cash prize of $ 10 @,@ 000 . The three jury members for the biography award were Elizabeth Frank , who won the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Biography , and historians Arthur L. Herman and Geoffrey Ward . The book was also honored by the New @-@ York Historical Society as the 2011 recipient of the American History Book Prize , which included an award of $ 50 @,@ 000 and the title of American Historian Laureate for Chernow . 
 The book received positive reviews from Andrew Cayton and Janet Maslin of The New York Times . Both felt that Chernow had been able to show an intimate side of Washington that had previously been unrecognized in biographies of the man . Maslin stated that Chernow presented Washington as a " more human and accessible " individual , and Cayton wrote that " [ m ] ost readers will finish this book feeling as if they have actually spent time with human beings . " 
 Aram <unk> of The Washington Times and T. J. Stiles of the Washington Post gave opposing reviews of the book . <unk> felt that Washington : A Life " does full justice to the one truly indispensable man in our nation 's history " . Stiles was less enthusiastic , stating that while the book offered a purposeful presentation of the life of Washington , he felt that the book was too long . He also criticized Chernow 's writing style , which he considered to contain uneven prose and too many cliches . 
 Simon Sebag Montefiore of the The Daily Telegraph and historian W. Ralph Eubanks both commented that Chernow 's access to the recently unearthed Papers of George Washington brought a " fresh analysis " and perspective of Washington . Eubanks stated in a review for National Public Radio that " few [ books ] have given as complete a picture of our first president as Ron Chernow 's compelling new biography , Washington : A Life " . Gordon S. Wood , recipient of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for History , wrote in a review for The New York Review of Books that the book was : 
 " [ t ] he best , most comprehensive , and most balanced single @-@ volume biography of Washington ever written ... One comes away from the book feeling that Washington has finally become comprehensible ... [ Chernow 's ] understanding of human nature is extraordinary and that is what makes his biography so powerful . " 
 Max Byrd , writing for Salon , also called it the " best biography of George Washington yet " , concluding , " Chernow 's narrative is so rich , its scale so massive and epic , that what is new fits seamlessly into the wider picture ... Chernow has gone into Washington 's world , almost into his mind , and inhabited it . " 
 = Northern Command ( RAAF ) = 
 Northern Command was one of several geographically based commands raised by the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) during World War II . Established in April 1944 , it evolved from No. 9 Operational Group , which had been the RAAF 's primary mobile formation in the South West Pacific theatre since September 1942 , but had lately become a garrison force in New Guinea . Northern Command was headquartered initially at Milne Bay and then , from August 1944 , in Madang . It conducted operations in New Guinea , New Britain , and Bougainville until the end of the war . Re @-@ designated Northern Area in December 1945 , it was headquartered in Port Moresby from March 1946 and disbanded in February 1947 . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to World War II , the Royal Australian Air Force was small enough for all its elements to be directly controlled by RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne . When war broke out , the RAAF began to decentralise its command structure , commensurate with expected increases in manpower and units . Between March 1940 and May 1941 , Australia and Papua were divided into four geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control zones : Central Area , Southern Area , Western Area , and Northern Area . The roles of the area commands were air defence , protection of adjacent sea lanes , and aerial reconnaissance . Each was led by an Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) who controlled the administration and operations of air bases and units within his boundary . By mid @-@ 1942 , Central Area had been dissolved , Northern Area had been split into North @-@ Eastern Area and North @-@ Western Area , and Eastern Area was created , making a total of five commands . 
 The static area command system was well suited to defence , but less so for an offensive posture . In September 1942 , therefore , the Air Force created a large mobile formation known as No. 9 Operational Group , to act as a self @-@ contained tactical air force that would be able to keep pace with Allied advances through the South West Pacific theatre . By September 1943 , however , No. 9 Group had become a static garrison force in New Guinea , similar to the area commands on mainland Australia , and a new mobile group was required to support the advance north towards the Philippines and Japan . This was formed in November 1943 as No. 10 Operational Group ( later the Australian First Tactical Air Force ) , which initially came under No. 9 Group 's control . To better reflect No. 9 Group 's new status , the head of RAAF Command , Air Vice Marshal William Bostock , recommended renaming it Northern Area . RAAF Headquarters did not agree to this at first , but on 11 April 1944 settled on calling it Northern Command , under the same AOC who commanded No. 9 Group , Air Commodore Frank Lukis . On its formation the command was headquartered at Milne Bay . 
 By July 1944 , No. 10 Group 's position in western New Guinea was complicating Northern Command 's efforts to supply it , and the group was made independent of the command . The next month , Northern Command headquarters transferred to Madang . In September , No. 71 Wing was detached from No. 10 Group to Northern Command , which had been given the task of supporting the Australian 6th Division in the Aitape – Wewak campaign . Headquartered at Tadji in northern New Guinea , No. 71 Wing comprised Nos. 7 , 8 and 100 Bristol Beaufort Squadrons , augmented by a flight of CAC Boomerangs from No. 4 ( Army Cooperation ) Squadron . No. 74 ( Composite ) Wing , which had been formed in August 1943 and was headquartered at Port Moresby , also came under the aegis of Northern Command . The command 's other major operational formation was No. 84 ( Army Cooperation ) Wing , which began moving from Australia to Torokina on Bougainville in October 1944 . By this time , Northern Command controlled six squadrons in the New Guinea area . No. 79 Wing , equipped with B @-@ 25 Mitchells , was earmarked for transfer from North @-@ Western Area to Northern Command , to undertake operations in New Britain , but its proposed airfield was not ready and it was instead transferred to the First Tactical Air Force at Labuan the following year . 
 Air Commodore Allan Walters took over Northern Command from Lukis in February 1945 . Walters directed operations in New Guinea , New Britain and Bougainville until the end of hostilities . Group Captain Val Hancock assumed command of No. 71 Wing in April . To maximize support to Australian ground troops in the lead @-@ up to the final assault on Wewak , the wing 's three extant Beaufort squadrons were joined by two more , Nos. 6 and 15 . Approximately sixty Beauforts and Boomerangs struck Japanese positions behind Dove Bay prior to amphibious landings on 11 May to cut off retreating enemy troops . Over the entire month , the wing dropped more than 1 @,@ 200 tons of bombs and flew in excess of 1 @,@ 400 sorties . The wing suffered fuel and ordnance shortages ; at one stage its squadrons had to load their Beauforts with captured Japanese bombs . No. 84 Wing , commanded by Group Captain Bill Hely and comprising No. 5 ( Tactical Reconnaissance ) Squadron , flying mainly Boomerangs , and two reconnaissance and transport units , also suffered shortages of equipment , as well as pilots . Augmented by a detachment of No. 36 Squadron , flying C @-@ 47 Dakotas , its aircraft flew slightly over 4 @,@ 000 sorties during the Bougainville campaign up to the end of June 1945 . That month , Northern Command was tasked with acting in reserve for Operation Oboe Six , the invasion of Labuan . In July , No. 11 Group was formed as a " static command " headquartered on Morotai in the Dutch East Indies , using elements of Northern Command and the First Tactical Air Force ; this freed the latter from garrison duties while its combat units advanced towards Borneo . 
 No. 71 Wing continued operations until the last day of the Pacific War , flying its final mission involving thirty Beauforts only hours before news arrived of the Allied victory on 15 August 1945 . No. 74 Wing was disbanded in Port Moresby the same day . No. 71 Wing squadrons subsequently dropped leaflets to remaining pockets of Japanese resistance , making them aware of the surrender ; the wing was disbanded at Tadji in January 1946 . No. 84 Wing suffered morale problems following the end of the war owing to inactivity and the uncertainties of demobilisation ; as a result , the wing 's commanding officer sent Northern Command headquarters a frank report , its tone earning a rebuke from Walters . No. 84 Wing left Bougainville in February 1946 and disbanded in Melbourne the next month . 
 Northern Command was redesignated Northern Area on 1 December 1945 , and its headquarters transferred to Port Moresby in March the following year . Walters handed over command in June 1946 . The area headquarters was disbanded at Port Moresby on 27 February 1947 . 
 = Battle of Wisconsin Heights = 
 The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the penultimate engagement of the 1832 Black Hawk War , fought between the United States state militia and allies , and the Sauk and Fox tribes , led by Black Hawk . The battle took place in what is now Dane County , near present @-@ day Sauk City , Wisconsin . Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties , Black Hawk 's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River . This reprieve was temporary ; when the militia finally caught up with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre at the mouth of the Bad Axe River . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 1831 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return to Iowa but events overtook him and led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed , and the militias of Michigan Territory and Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's band . 
 After an inconclusive skirmish in late June at Kellogg 's Grove , Black Hawk and his band fled the approaching militia through Wisconsin . They had passed through what are now Beloit and Janesville , then followed the Rock River toward Horicon Marsh , where they headed west toward the Four Lakes region ( near modern @-@ day Madison ) . The band camped for the night near Pheasant Branch . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The U.S. force of 600 @-@ 750 militia men had picked up Black Hawk 's trail following the Battle of Pecatonica . Colonel Henry Dodge and James D. Henry pursued the band up the Rock River , engaging in minor skirmishes along the way . The militia marched 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Four Lakes the day of the battle , discovering the body of a dead Native American along the way , in whose pouch they found the watch of George Force , a lieutenant who was killed in an attack at Fort Blue Mounds on June 20 . Ahead of the main party of militia , a small band of U.S. allied Ho @-@ Chunk warriors had been sent ahead to scout the area with Pierre Pauquette , a trader from Portage , Wisconsin . Rumors that Black Hawk 's band was at Lake Koshkonong persisted and Dodge and his men attempted to intercept Black Hawk there . Although Black Hawk 's band had already moved on by the time the militia arrived at the lake , they found evidence of his presence and picked up his trail again , continuing their pursuit toward the Wisconsin River . 
 Unable to remain in one place long enough to receive provisions , Black Hawk 's group were in poor health and some of them starved to death on the road . Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that at this point in the war he had every intention of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River , but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with no choice but to fight . His intention was to allow the non @-@ combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On July 21 , 1832 , the militia caught up with Black Hawk 's band as they attempted to cross the Wisconsin River , near present @-@ day Roxbury , in Dane County , near Sauk City , Wisconsin . As the militia approached the battleground , warriors appeared on the surrounding hillsides , attempting to divert their attention . According to Dodge 's account , before the militia met the main body of Black Hawk 's band , three U.S. scouts crossed a small band of Sauk or Fox warriors and pursued them to within a mile of their camp . Scouts also killed two Sauk warriors before the real battle began . 
 The scouts who had pursued the three Sauk back toward their camp returned when warriors from the camp pursued them on horseback . Dodge dismounted his troops and ordered his men to advance to higher ground . The band of warriors , under Black Hawk , moved toward the militia ; when they were within 30 yards ( 27 m ) the militia and its allies opened fire . Black Hawk ordered his men to " stand their ground , and never yield it to the enemy . " Black Hawk 's resolve saved the lives of the bulk of Sauk and Fox present that day at Wisconsin Heights ; the warriors fought with the militia while the majority of the civilians escaped , via rafts , across the Wisconsin River . 
 In the first volley of the battle , one of Black Hawk 's warriors was killed instantly and one or two others wounded . Black hawk 's warriors returned fire as they withdrew @-@ straight into the charging militia . Dodge and a Major Ewing came upon the battlefield at Wisconsin Heights first and captured an elevated area that later acquired the name " Militia Ridge " . The militia occupied a solid position as General Henry arrived , accompanied by three regiments of mounted Illinois Militia . Henry formed his men into a right angle firing line and exchanged gunfire with Black Hawk 's men for around 30 minutes . A Dodge @-@ led bayonet charge ended the battle , sending the remaining warriors scattering @-@ to be pursued by militia - several of whom were killed . The troops did not pursue Black Hawk , Dodge stated , " after consulting with Genl . Henry it was agreed to defer a further attack on the enemy until the next morning . " 
 Dodge noted the number of Sauk dead at 40 , possibly more ; he reported that Ho @-@ Chunk scouts and militia men took at least that number of scalps after the battle . U.S. allied Ho @-@ Chunk , during the night following the battle , scalped another 11 Sauk who had been killed by the militia , and Dodge had seen Sauk wounded being carried from the battlefield during the fighting . Dodge 's forces suffered one dead and 8 wounded , of whom one was injured during the march to Wisconsin Heights , before the battle . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The U.S. militia decided to wait until the following day to pursue Black Hawk . To their surprise , when morning arrived , their enemy had disappeared . Shortly before dawn one of the leaders accompanying Black Hawk , a Sauk chieftain named Neapope , had attempted from the knoll on which the band had taken refuge to explain to the militia officers that his group wanted only to end the fighting and go back across the Mississippi River . In a " loud shrill voice " he delivered a conciliatory speech in his native Ho @-@ Chunk language , assuming Pauquette and his band of Ho @-@ Chunk guides were still with the militia . However , the U.S. troops did not understand him , because their Ho @-@ Chunk allies had already departed the battlefield . 
 The one militia man killed in battle , Thomas Jefferson Short , was later buried somewhere on the site where the battle occurred . The battle was devastating for Black Hawk and his band , despite the fact that much of his band escaped across the Wisconsin River ; casualty estimates were as high as 70 dead Sauk and Fox , including those killed in action and those drowned . Even so , at least one source called the battle , along with Stillman 's Run , one of Black Hawk 's major military triumphs . 
 The early 20th @-@ century book Wisconsin in Three Centuries was already calling the battle a " massacre " in 1906 . Specifically , it cited an incident in which captured warriors and civilians from Black Hawk 's band were slaughtered by a group of 300 Menominee , who had aligned with the white militia . In addition , as many were drowned trying to cross the Wisconsin as were killed and captured during the battle . 
 The militia regrouped at Blue Mounds Fort and picked up Black Hawk 's trail again on July 28 near Spring Green , Wisconsin . When they finally caught up with Black Hawk 's " British Band " it would lead to the decisive clash of the war at Bad Axe . At the mouth of the Bad Axe River , hundreds of men , women and children would be killed by pursuing soldiers , their Indian allies , and a U.S. gunboat . 
 The site of the Battle of Wisconsin Heights is preserved in northwestern Dane County , two miles ( 3 km ) southeast of present @-@ day Sauk City on State Highway 78 , is owned by the Department of Natural Resources , and is open to the public . It is the only intact battle site from the American Indian Wars found in the U.S. Midwest . The Wisconsin Heights Battlefield was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on January 31 , 2002 . 
 The location of the battle is confirmed in the Township ( Exterior ) Notes of US Deputy Surveyor John H. Mullet . The line ( between Roxbury ( Section 19 of <unk> , <unk> ) and <unk> ( Section 24 of <unk> , <unk> ) was run north right through the battle site on October 23 , 1832 , just 3 months after the battle . Because of this coincidence , only happening every 6 miles , there is contemporary and sworn proof of the battle site 's location . 
 = 1995 – 96 South Pacific cyclone season = 
 The 1995 – 96 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone season 's on record , with only four tropical cyclones occurring within the South Pacific Ocean to the east of 160 ° E. The season officially ran from November 1 , 1995 until April 30 , 1996 . The first storm developed on January 12 , while the last one dissipated on April 2 . During the season the most intense tropical cyclone was Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti , which reached a minimum pressure of 935 hPa ( 27 @.@ 61 inHg ) as it affected New Caledonia . After the season ended Beti 's name was the only name to be retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists and was replaced with <unk> , after it inflicted over 5 @.@ 6 million ( USD ) worth of damage to Australia , Vanuatu , New Caledonia and New Zealand . 
 During the season , tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center ( RSMC ) in Nadi , Fiji , and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers ( TCWC ) in Brisbane , Australia and Wellington , New Zealand . Throughout the season the United States Navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings , through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and Oceanography Center ( NPMOC ) . Tropical cyclones that were located between 160 ° E and 120 ° W as well as the Equator and 25 ° S were monitored by RSMC Nadi while any that were located to the south of 25 ° S between 160 ° E and 120 ° W were monitored by TCWC Wellington . During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160 ° E and 180 ° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between the 180 ° and the American coast . RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale , and measured windspeeds over a 10 @-@ minute period during the season , while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1 @-@ minute period . 
 = = Seasonal summary = = 
 Because of a weak – moderate La Niña episode , most tropical cyclones that developed within the season occurred within the Coral Sea . The weak La Nina also affected the amount of tropical cyclones that occurred during the year with only 4 tropical cyclones occurring the season as a whole became one of the most inactive tropical cyclone seasons since 1969 @-@ 70 . The first tropical cyclone of the season , Yasi , developed on January 12 as a tropical depression before it was named on January 16 . As a tropical cyclone , Yasi brought significant rain to both Fiji and Tonga before it dissipated on January 19 to the south of <unk> in French Polynesia . After Yasi dissipated , no tropical cyclones were recorded in the basin until March 9 ; however on February 12 , a tropical low developed to the west of New Caledonia . Over the next 24 hours the low deepened to about 1002 hPa before it crossed 160 ° E and moved into the Australian region where it became known as the Queen Elizabeth II storm . On February 22 and 23 , a shallow tropical depression moved around the Fijian archipelago and caused some flooding of low @-@ lying areas in Vanua Levu . On March 9 and 10 , Tropical Cyclones Zaka and Atu both developed near New Caledonia , about 1 @,@ 000 km ( 620 mi ) apart and took similar tracks towards the southeast before becoming extratropical . On March 21 , the final tropical cyclone of the season developed to the northeast of Vanuatu . Over the next couple of days the depression gradually developed further and was named as Beti , before it passed over Vanuatu and New Caledonia . On March 29 , after it had passed over New Caledonia , Beti degenerated into an extratropical cyclone , before dissipating on April 2 . After the season ended the name Beti was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists .

 On January 12 , RSMC Nadi reported that a tropical depression had developed over the Fijian island of Vanua Levu , about 430 km ( 270 mi ) to the south of Labasa . Over the next few days , the depression moved towards the southeast before it started to affect Tonga on January 15 . During the following day , the depression rapidly developed further as it interacted with the South Pacific Convergence Zone , before the NPMOC initiated warnings on the system and designated it as <unk> . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the NPMOC reported that the depression had reached its peak 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) while RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical cyclone while it was located about 510 km ( 320 mi ) to the southeast of Nukualofa , Tonga . However RSMC Nadi did not name it Yasi for another 12 hours , while the system reached its peak 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . After it was named on January 17 , Yasi accelerated towards the southeast , before it moved out of RSMC Nadi 's area of responsibility . During January 18 , the NPMOC issued their final warning because Yasi had degenerated into an extratropical cyclone . TCWC Wellington monitored Yasi 's remnants for another day , before they dissipated about 1520 km ( 940 mi ) to the south of <unk> , French Polynesia . Although no major damage was reported from any of the islands affected some minor damage was reported in Tonga , after Yasi caused heavy rainfall there .

 On March 9 , RSMC Nadi started to monitor a tropical depression had developed within an active convergence zone , about 150 km ( 95 mi ) to the northwest of Noumea , New Caledonia . During that day an upper level trough moved over New Zealand which brought the jet stream over New Caledonia . As a result , this made the depression hard to locate with satellite imagery . However , later that day despite the system being poorly organized , RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a tropical cyclone and named it Zaka . As they named it RSMC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) with further development of the system restricted by strong vertical wind shear . Early on March 10 , the JTWC designated Zaka as Tropical Cyclone <unk> , while it had its peak 1 @-@ minute windspeeds of 75 km / h ( 45 mph ) . RSMC Nadi then issued their final advisory at 0600 UTC , as Zaka had weakened into a tropical depression and was moving into TCWC Wellingtons area of responsibility . TCWC Wellington and the JTWC monitored Zaka for another day before it was last noted during March 11 as it became an extratropical cyclone . Zaka dumped 376 mm ( 14 @.@ 8 in ) of rain on Vanuatu in just 24 hours . 
 = = = Tropical Cyclone Atu = = = 
 On March 4 , the JTWC started to monitor an area of disturbed weather that had developed within the Australian region about 900 km ( 560 mi ) , to the southeast of Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea . Over the next few days , the system remained weak and gradually moved southeast before it crossed 160 ° E and moved into the basin on March 9 . During the next day , both the JTWC and RSMC Nadi started to monitor the system as a tropical depression as it moved through the Loyalty Islands . On March 11 , the depression intensified into a tropical cyclone as it moved southeastward , prompting RSMC Nadi to name it Atu at 1800 UTC . Early on March 12 , the JTWC reported that Atu had reached its peak 1 @-@ minute windspeeds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Later that morning RSMC Nadi reported that Atu had reached its peak 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . After it had peaked in intensity , Atu weakened under the influence of strong vertical windshear before the JTWC and RSMC Nadi issued their final advisories during March 13 as Atu had become extratropical . Atu 's remnants were then monitored by RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington until they dissipated on March 18 . 
 = = = Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti = = = 
 On March 19 , the JTWC started to monitor a tropical disturbance that was located about 1145 km ( 710 mi ) to the northwest of Suva , Fiji . Over the next couple of days the system moved towards the south and gradually developed further in an area of low vertical windshear , before the system was designated as Tropical Depression 23P by the JTWC and RSMC Nadi on March 21 . Over the next couple of days , 23P moved further towards the south , before the depression started to move towards the southwest as a ridge of high pressure strengthened on March 23 . Later that day , RSMC Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category 1 tropical cyclone and named it as Beti . During that day , Beti continued to develop further before the system moved into the Coral Sea on March 24 , after passing over the Vanuatuan islands of Pentecost and <unk> . As Beti moved into the Coral Sea , the system quickly intensified further , with RSMC Nadi reporting on March 25 that Beti had intensified into a category 3 severe tropical cyclone . As Beti intensified into a severe tropical cyclone , the ridge of high pressure weakened as it interacted with an upper level trough of low pressure . As a result , the system started to move towards the south @-@ southeast . 
 Over the next couple of days Beti continued to intensify as it moved towards New Caledonia , before the JTWC reported at 1800 UTC on March 26 , that Beti had reached its peak 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . Six hours later , RSMC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone with 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Later on March 27 , Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti made landfall on the Grande Terre island of New Caledonia near its peak intensity and quickly weakened into a category 2 tropical cyclone . During the next day , Beti moved towards the southeast under the influence of the trough , reemerging into the Coral Sea as a weakening tropical cyclone that had started to transition into an extratropical cyclone . Later on March 28 , RSMC Nadi passed the primary warning responsibility of the cyclone to TCWC Wellington , before the JTWC issued their final advisory on Beti as it had become extratropical . Over the next few days , TCWC Wellington continued to monitor Beti 's remnants , as they came under the influence of a high pressure area and moved around New Zealand 's East Coast , before they were last noted on April 2 while located about 1400 km ( 870 mi ) to the southeast of Wellington . 
 While it was active , Cyclone Beti was responsible for 2 deaths and caused damage in Australia , New Caledonia , New Zealand , and Vanuatu . The most significant damage occurred in New Caledonia where wind and flooding destroyed crops , gardens and caused disruption to the electricity network , water supply , road and telephone communications . Many homes and roads were also badly damaged , with over 50 % of lower standard housing on the outskirts of Noumea damaged after rivers and creeks burst their banks . Press reports indicated that Beti inflicted between FF 22 @-@ 27 million ( US $ 4 @.@ 3 - 5 @.@ 3 million ) in damage to New Caledonia and that only a few injuries had occurred . Within Vanuatu , Beti caused about <unk> million , ( US $ 41 thousand ) in damage to food gardens and shelters . As an extratropical cyclone , Beti generated a high surf and long period swells that hit both eastern Australia and New Zealand . Within Australia , the high surf left several competitors in the Australian life surfing championships injured , while another competitor was killed after his boat was swamped by large waves . Within New Zealand , Beti 's remnants caused flooding and mud @-@ slips , which led to several roads being closed . A helicopter and its pilot were lost at the height of the storm , while they were travelling from Napier to Gisborne .

 Lieutenant General Sir Reginald George Pollard , KCVO , KBE , CB , DSO ( 20 January 1903 – 9 March 1978 ) was a senior commander in the Australian Army , serving as Chief of the General Staff from 1960 to 1963 . Born in Bathurst , New South Wales , Pollard graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in 1924 . A regular officer , he served as adjutant / quartermaster in several battalions of the Citizens Military Forces ( CMF ) during the 1920s and 1930s . In 1938 he was posted to England to undertake staff training , which was cut short by the outbreak of the Second World War . Pollard joined the Second Australian Imperial Force in 1940 , and the following year saw action with the 7th Division in the Middle East , where he was mentioned in despatches . Promoted to colonel in 1942 , he became senior staff officer of the 7th Division in New Guinea , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions . He spent much of the remainder of the war in staff and training positions in Australia . 
 Pollard 's early post @-@ war roles involved recruit training , land / air warfare , administration , and planning . In 1953 , he was promoted to brigadier and took command of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . He joined the Military Board as a major general in 1954 , and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the following year . In 1957 he was promoted to lieutenant general and took charge of Eastern Command in Sydney ; two years later he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath . Knighted in 1961 , as Chief of the General Staff he presided over the Army 's reorganisation as a pentropic structure , and worked towards making Duntroon a degree @-@ granting institution . In 1962 , he oversaw deployment of the first team of Australian military advisors to South Vietnam . After retiring from the military in 1963 , Pollard became Honorary Colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment ; he served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II during the Royal Visit in 1970 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order the same year . He died at Wyrallah , New South Wales , in 1978 .

 Reginald George Pollard was born on 20 January 1903 in Bathurst , New South Wales , the third son of Albert Edgar Pollard , an English accountant , and his Australian wife Thalia Rebecca , née McLean . Schooled in Bathurst , Reg entered the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in 1921 , and graduated with the Sword of Honour for " exemplary conduct and performance " in 1924 . Pollard and fellow graduate Frederick Scherger , winner of the King 's Medal and future air chief marshal , applied to transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) under a scheme designed to augment the RAAF 's officer corps , but only Scherger was accepted . The previous year , Pollard and Scherger had inaugurated a Duntroon tradition when they found a horse 's jawbone during a field exercise . Inspired by the Biblical tale in which Samson slays the Philistines with the jawbone of an ass , they declared their find a lucky charm and brought it back to the college as a mascot ; it became known as " <unk> " ( reportedly because " jawbone seemed so commonplace , an <unk> sounded much more interesting and spelt backwards sounded both mysterious and respectable " ) . 
 Ranked lieutenant in the Permanent Military Force ( PMF ) , Pollard was appointed adjutant / quartermaster of the 17th Battalion ( Citizens Military Forces ) , headquartered at North Sydney , in July 1925 . He married Daisy Ethel Potter , a typist , at St Andrew 's Anglican Church , Strathfield , on 31 October ; The Bathurst Times reported that Daisy cut the cake with her husband 's Sword of Honour . Pollard departed for India on attachment to the British Army in September 1927 , serving with the Royal Fusiliers and the York and Lancaster Regiment . He returned to Sydney in November the following year and was posted as adjutant / quartermaster to , successively , the 18th Battalion ( CMF ) and , in September 1932 , the 44th Battalion ( CMF ) . In December 1932 , while serving with the 44th in Western Australia , he was promoted to captain . Pollard was camp commandant of the National Rifle Association of Western Australia from 1934 to 1936 . He was transferred to Army Headquarters , Melbourne , in October 1936 . His next posting , in July 1938 , was as General Staff Officer Grade 3 , Training and General Duties , at the 2nd District Base , Sydney . In November 1938 , Pollard travelled to England to attend Staff College , Camberley ; he graduated in September 1939 , the planned two @-@ year course having been curtailed owing to the outbreak of the Second World War .

 Following the declaration of war , Pollard served as Assistant Military Liaison Officer at the Australian High Commission , London ; during this posting he spent two weeks attached to the British Expeditionary Force in France . Promoted major , he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) in June 1940 . The provisions of the Defence Act ( 1903 ) prohibited members of the PMF ( or the CMF ) fighting outside Australian territory except as volunteers in the AIF . Pollard was appointed brigade major of the 25th Brigade , an Australian infantry formation raised in England mostly from logistics personnel to help combat a possible invasion by Nazi Germany . The brigade became part of the Australian 9th Division , and in January 1941 sailed for the Middle East ; it was transferred to the 7th Division on arrival . In March , Pollard was assigned to the 7th Division 's headquarters staff in Libya under Lieutenant General John Lavarack . On 24 April , towards the end of the campaign in Cyrenaica , Pollard led a raiding party on Giarabub , Libya , to remove Senussi civilians and destroy wells and ammunition . He took command of the 2 / 31st Battalion at the end of June 1941 , during the Syrian campaign , after the battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Selwyn Porter , was wounded . A cease @-@ fire on 12 July ended the campaign in Syria , and Pollard was mentioned in despatches for his service ; the award was gazetted on 30 December 1941 . 
 Pollard was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1941 , and was responsible for establishing the AIF Junior Staff School in Palestine . He was raised to temporary colonel in March 1942 and posted to the AIF Staff in Ceylon , where the 16th and 17th Brigades had been garrisoned while on their way back to Australia from the Middle East . Returning to Australia in August , Pollard was appointed General Staff Officer Grade 1 of the 6th Division ; he served on its headquarters in Papua from September until mid @-@ November 1942 , when he became Major General George Vasey 's senior staff officer at the 7th Division . Pollard received the Distinguished Service Order for his actions in operations at Gona and Sanananda , during which he " displayed unlimited energy and ascertained vital information for use in future operations " ; the award was promulgated on 21 December 1943 . At the conclusion of the Papuan campaign in January 1943 , Pollard was posted to Queensland with the 6th Division , which was undergoing training and reinforcement . He was Chief Instructor of the Senior Staff School at Duntroon from December 1943 until February 1945 , when he became Deputy Director of Military Operations at General Sir Thomas Blamey 's Allied Land Forces Headquarters , based in Melbourne .

It was redesignated the School of Land / Air Warfare in March 1948 and relocated to RAAF Station Williamtown , New South Wales . Pollard was appointed Director of Personnel Administration at Army Headquarters in January 1949 . One of his tasks was to prepare the ground for the reintroduction of compulsory national service ; the new scheme was enacted in 1951 and remained in force until 1959 . Pollard 's lieutenant @-@ colonelcy had been made substantive in September 1946 and his colonelcy in July 1949 . He attended the Imperial Defence College , London , throughout 1951 ; he served as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to King George VI from April that year until August 1952 , and in the same capacity for Queen Elizabeth II until April 1954 . 
 In January 1952 , Pollard succeeded Colonel John Wilton as Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters , and became Chairman of the Joint Planning Committee . That August he was one of the Australian delegates joining the Minister for External Affairs , Richard Casey , for the inaugural meeting of the ANZUS Council in Honolulu ; the US and New Zealand delegations were led , respectively , by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Minister for External Affairs Clifton Webb . Pollard also took part in planning for the atomic test at Montebello , Western Australia , in October 1952 . Promoted to temporary brigadier in March 1953 , Pollard acted as Australian military advisor to Prime Minister Robert Menzies at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers ' Conference in London that June . From July to November he served as commander of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea ; the role was responsible for managing the turnover of Australian troops in the theatre and the upkeep of their personal records . Pollard was later appointed Deputy Adjutant General at Army Headquarters , and his rank of brigadier became substantive in December 1953 . 
 In September 1954 , Pollard was promoted to temporary major general and appointed Quartermaster General and Third Military Member of the Military Board . At fifty @-@ two , he was the youngest member of the Board . His promotion to major general was made substantive in December 1954 . Inspecting conditions for Australian troops deployed to Malaya in December 1955 , Pollard was quoted as saying that there were " one or two " serious complaints but that he was " amazed how few there were , considering that the average soldier complains considerably all the time " . In August 1957 , he was promoted lieutenant general and succeeded Eric Woodward as General Officer Commanding Eastern Command , upon Woodward 's appointment as Governor of New South Wales . Headquartered in Sydney , Eastern Command covered the state of New South Wales and was the superior headquarters for the 2nd Division ( CMF ) . Pollard was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen 's Birthday Honours promulgated on 9 June 1955 , and a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the Birthday Honours promulgated on 13 June 1959 . 
 = = = Chief of the General Staff = = = 
 On 1 July 1960 , Pollard succeeded Lieutenant General Sir Ragnar Garrett as Chief of the General Staff ( CGS ) , and was raised to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen 's Birthday Honours promulgated on 2 June 1961 . Although favoured by Garrett , Pollard 's succession had not been a foregone conclusion . The Minister for the Army , John Cramer , attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty , a retired CMF officer , but the proposal was defeated in cabinet on the advice of the Minister for Defence , Athol Townley , who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army . 
 As CGS , Pollard oversaw a major restructure of the Army . Following the lead of the US military , in 1960 the Australian Army replaced its " triangular " divisional structure of three infantry battalions under brigade headquarters , with a " pentropic " organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters . The reorganisation had been sponsored by Garrett and agreed to by Townley in December 1959 . According to historian Chris Clark , Pollard was " personally ambivalent " about the change , which was intended to rationalise resources and strengthen the battalions for overseas deployments but also resulted in the disbandment of the citizens ' brigades and many other militia units . The US in any case abandoned the pentropic system in June 1961 , and the Australian Army ultimately returned to the triangular formation following a review commissioned by Pollard 's successor as CGS , Lieutenant General Wilton , in October 1964 . Another of Pollard 's focus areas as CGS was the academic qualifications of Army officers . Concerned that Duntroon graduates would begin to fall behind their tertiary @-@ educated peers in the community , he worked to make the college a degree @-@ granting institution , though this did not come to fruition until 1968 . 
 In December 1961 , Pollard told the Secretary of the Defence Committee that he considered the Army 's strength inadequate to support the government 's policy of " forward defence " , which involved meeting Communist aggression in South East Asia , well away from the Australian mainland . The CMF , he contended , was not properly equipped to provide relief for regular forces deployed overseas , and conscription " would appear to be politically and economically out of the question " . Nevertheless , the government reintroduced conscription in 1964 . As the threat of South Vietnam falling to a Communist takeover became more apparent , the Army began in 1962 to exercise specifically to combat counter @-@ insurgency operations , a type of warfare Pollard characterised as " frustrating groping at an elusive enemy " ; he added that " no purely military solution to a Communist insurgency situation is possible " . In May that year , the Federal government agreed to South Vietnam 's request for military instructors ; Pollard was responsible for laying down guidelines for the thirty advisors deployed in August as part of the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , led by his friend Colonel Ted Serong . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of sixty , Pollard left the military on 20 January 1963 , having recommended Wilton as his successor . He became a grazier on a farm at <unk> , Victoria . In July 1965 , he was made Honorary Colonel ( later Colonel Commandant ) of the Royal Australian Regiment , in which capacity he visited Australian troops in South Vietnam . He served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II for the Royal Visit in 1970 , and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in recognition of his services ; the honour was promulgated on 29 May 1970 , backdated to 3 May . In 1974 , he moved to a new property , which he christened Duntroon , at Wyrallah , New South Wales . Pollard died suddenly at his Wyrallah home on 9 March 1978 . He was survived by his wife and two sons , and cremated .

 For the battleship of the same name , see SMS Friedrich der Grosse ( 1911 ) . 
 SMS Friedrich der Grosse ( or Große ) was an armored frigate of the German Kaiserliche Marine . She was the second of three Preussen @-@ class ironclads , in addition to her two sister @-@ ships Preussen and Grosser Kurfürst . Named for Frederick the Great , she was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel in 1871 and completed in 1877 . Her main battery of four 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns was mounted pair of twin gun turrets amidships . 
 Friedrich der Grosse served with the fleet from her commissioning until 1896 , though she was frequently placed in reserve throughout her career . The ship was a regular participant in the annual fleet training maneuvers conducted with the exception of the mid @-@ 1880s , when she was temporarily replaced by newer vessels . She participated in several cruises in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas , often escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on official state visits . The ship was removed from active service in 1896 , after which she was used in secondary roles until 1919 , when she was stricken from the naval register and sold to a scrapyard . Friedrich der Grosse was broken up for scrap the following year . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Friedrich der Grosse was ordered by the Imperial Navy from the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel ; her keel was laid in 1871 under construction number 1 . The ship was launched on 20 September 1874 and commissioned into the German fleet on 22 November 1877 . Although laid down a year before her sister Preussen , Friedrich der Grosse was not completed until a year after ; this was because she was built at a newly established and inexperienced Imperial Dockyard , while Preussen was built by AG Vulcan , an experienced private shipbuilder . The ship cost the German government 7 @,@ 303 @,@ 000 gold marks . 
 The ship was 96 @.@ 59 meters ( 316 @.@ 9 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 16 @.@ 30 m ( 53 @.@ 5 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 12 m ( 23 @.@ 4 ft ) forward . Friedrich der Grosse was powered by one 3 @-@ cylinder single expansion steam engine , which was supplied with steam by six coal @-@ fired transverse trunk boilers . The ship 's top speed was 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) , at 4 @,@ 998 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 727 kW ) . She was also equipped with a full ship rig . Her standard complement consisted of 46 officers and 454 enlisted men . 
 She was armed with four 26 cm ( 10 @.@ 2 in ) L / 22 guns mounted in a pair of gun turrets placed amidships . As built , the ship was also equipped with two 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) L / 25 chase guns . After being rebuilt in 1888 – 1890 , her armament was increased by six and later ten 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns , a pair of machine guns , and five 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes , all placed in the ship 's hull below the waterline . Preussen 's armor was made of wrought iron and backed with teak . The armored belt was arrayed in two strakes . The upper strake was 203 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) thick ; the lower strake ranged in thickness from 102 to 229 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 to 9 @.@ 0 in ) . Both were backed with 234 to 260 mm ( 9 @.@ 2 to 10 @.@ 2 in ) of teak . The gun turrets were protected by 203 to 254 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 to 10 @.@ 0 in ) armor on the sides , backed by 260 mm of teak . 
 = = Service history = = 
 After her commissioning in November 1877 , Friedrich der Grosse served with the fleet . In April 1878 , Friedrich der Grosse was reactivated to participate in the annual summer fleet maneuvers , under the command of Rear Admiral Carl Ferdinand Batsch . Her newly commissioned sister @-@ ship , Grosser Kurfürst , joined the squadron shortly before maneuvers were scheduled to begin . At the time , Friedrich der Grosse suffered from mechanical problems , and on 22 May , she ran aground off Nyborg while steaming from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven . The ship suffered serious damage to her hull , which , coupled with her chronic engine problems , forced her to miss the fleet maneuvers . While the squadron steamed in the English Channel on 31 May , the armored frigate König Wilhelm accidentally rammed Grosser Kurfürst ; the latter quickly sank with the loss of 276 men . 
 In the aftermath of the loss of Grosser Kurfürst , the Navy canceled the summer 1878 maneuvers . Apart from the small ironclad Hansa , all armored warships were put in reserve until the following year . In May 1879 , the armored squadron was reactivated , under the command of Rear Admiral Franz Kinderling . Friedrich der Grosse and Preussen were joined by the older ironclads Friedrich Carl and Kronprinz ; the squadron remained in the Baltic for the majority of the training period . Kinderling took his four ships out into the North Sea in June for a visit to Norway . The four ships returned to Kiel in September , when the squadron was disbanded for the winter . 
 In the spring of 1880 , the squadron was again reestablished . The new armored corvette Sachsen replaced Kronprinz in the squadron that year . Wilhelm von Wickede , a former Austrian naval officer , replaced Kinderling as the squadron commander . In June , the Italian frigate Cristoforo Colombo visited the armored squadron in Kiel . Again , the squadron remained in the Baltic for the summer cruise , with the exception of a short visit to Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven in August . The summer cruise in 1881 followed the same pattern as the year previous , though Kronprinz returned in place of Sachsen , which was plagued with engine problems . Wickede again served as the commander . In July , the ships hosted a visit by the British reserve squadron , which by this time included the first British ironclad , HMS Warrior . Preussen and the rest of the squadron visited Danzig in September during a meeting between Kaiser Wilhelm I and the Russian Tsar Alexander III . 
 The 1882 summer cruise included the same four ironclads from the previous year , and was again commanded by Wickede , who had by then been promoted to Rear Admiral . Friedrich der Grosse was kept in reserve during the annual summer maneuvers starting in 1883 , as new ships , including the rest of the Sachsen @-@ class ironclads entered service . The ship was reactivated in July 1888 to participate in a tour of the Baltic for the newly enthroned Kaiser Wilhelm II . The voyage included visits to St. Petersburg , Stockholm , and Copenhagen . They met Tsar Alexander III and the Swedish King Oscar II , who inspected the German warships and conferred decorations on the senior officers . 
 In August 1889 , Friedrich der Grosse participated in Kaiser Wilhelm II 's visit to Great Britain . The ship was assigned to the II Division , along with her sister Preussen and the central battery ironclads Kaiser and Deutschland , under command of Rear Admiral Friedrich Hollmann . The fleet then conducted maneuvers in the North Sea before returning to Germany . Friedrich der Grosse and the rest of the II Division became the training squadron for the fleet in 1889 – 1890 , the first year the Kaiserliche Marine maintained a year @-@ round ironclad force . The squadron escorted Wilhelm II 's imperial yacht to the Mediterranean ; the voyage included state visits to Italy and the Ottoman Empire . The squadron remained in the Mediterranean until April 1890 , when it returned to Germany . 
 Friedrich der Grosse participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890 . She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September , where the entire eight @-@ ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel . The II Division , including Friedrich der Grosse , served as the training squadron in the winter of 1890 – 1891 . The squadron again cruised the Mediterranean , under the command of Rear Admiral Wilhelm Schröder . Friedrich der Grosse again saw service in the II Division in the winter of 1891 – 1892 and the 1892 maneuvers , under the command of Rear Admiral Hans Koester . 
 The ship participated in the 1893 maneuvers , which included a simulation of a French naval attack in the North Sea . The following year , Friedrich der Grosse , König Wilhelm , and Deutschland joined the new battleship Brandenburg as re @-@ designated II Division of the Maneuver Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Otto von Diederichs . The ships simulated a Russian attack on Germany 's Baltic coast in the 1894 maneuvers . She was reduced to a harbor ship on 16 November 1896 . The ship was stricken from the active register on 21 May 1906 , after which she was used as a coal hulk for torpedo boats . Friedrich der Grosse served in this capacity until after the end of World War I ; she was removed from the naval register on 27 January 1919 . She was sold to shipbreakers and broken up for scrap the following year in Rönnebeck . 
 = Brazilian cruiser Bahia = 
 Bahia was the lead ship of a two @-@ vessel class of cruisers built for Brazil by the British company Armstrong Whitworth . In November 1910 , just six months after her commissioning , crewmen aboard Bahia , Marechal Deodoro , Minas Geraes , and São Paulo mutinied , beginning the Revolta da Chibata ( Revolt of the Lash ) . During the four @-@ day rebellion , Brazil 's capital city of Rio de Janeiro was held hostage by the possibility of a naval bombardment , leading the government to give in to the rebel demands , which included the abolition of flogging in the navy . During the First World War , Bahia and her sister ship Rio Grande do Sul were assigned to the Divisão Naval em <unk> de Guerra ( Naval Division in War Operations ) , the Brazilian Navy 's main contribution in that conflict . Based out of Sierra Leone and Dakar , the squadron escorted convoys through an area believed to be heavily patrolled by U @-@ boats . 
 In the mid @-@ 1920s , Bahia was extensively modernized . She received three new Brown – Curtis turbine engines and six new Thornycroft boilers , and , in the process , was converted from coal @-@ burning to oil . The refit resulted in a striking aesthetic change , with the exhaust being trunked into three funnels instead of two . The armament was also modified ; three 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Madsen guns , a 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) Hotchkiss machine gun , and four 533 mm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added . In the 1930s , she served with government forces during multiple revolutions . 
 In the Second World War , Bahia was once again used as a convoy escort , sailing over 100 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 190 @,@ 000 km ; 120 @,@ 000 mi ) in the span of about a year . On 4 July 1945 she was acting as a plane guard for transport aircraft flying from the Atlantic to Pacific theaters of war . While Bahia 's gunners were firing at a kite for anti @-@ aircraft practice , one aimed too low and hit depth charges stored near the stern of the ship , resulting in a massive explosion that incapacitated the ship and sank her within minutes . Only a small portion of the crew survived the blast , and even fewer were still living when their rafts were discovered days later . 
 = = Construction and commissioning = = 
 Bahia was part of a large 1904 naval building program by Brazil . Also planned as part of this were the two Minas Geraes @-@ class dreadnoughts , ten Pará @-@ class destroyers , three submarines and a submarine tender . With a design that borrowed heavily from the British Adventure @-@ class scout cruisers , Bahia 's keel was laid on 19 August 1907 in Armstrong Whitworth 's Elswick , Newcastle upon Tyne yard . Construction took about a year and a half , and she was launched on 20 January 1909 . The process of fitting out pushed her completion date to 2 March 1910 , after which she sailed to Brazil , arriving in Recife on 6 May . The new cruiser — the third ship of the Brazilian Navy to honor the state of Bahia — was commissioned into the navy shortly thereafter on 21 May 1910 . As a class , Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were the fastest cruisers in the world when they were commissioned , and the first in the Brazilian Navy to utilize steam turbines for propulsion . 
 = = Mutiny = = 
 Brazil 's economy was suffering from a severe recession at the same time Bahia was commissioned . This economic hardship , along with the racism prevalent in all branches of the Brazilian armed forces , and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships , spawned a mutiny known as the Revolta da Chibata ( Revolt of the Whip ) among sailors on the most powerful ships . 
 Unhappy with the violent treatment they were receiving , black sailors on the dreadnought battleship Minas Geraes began planning an uprising early in 1910 , choosing João Cândido Felisberto — an experienced sailor later known as the " Black Admiral " — as their leader . In mid @-@ November , a sailor was sentenced to be flogged in front of his fellow sailors , even though the practice had been banned by law . The punishment was administered and continued even after the sailor fainted , infuriating the nascent mutineers . Although they were not ready and could not revolt immediately , they quickened their preparations and rebelled on 21 November , earlier than originally planned . They killed several officers and the captain of Minas Geraes , while other officers were forced off the ship . The revolt quickly expanded to the battleship São Paulo , the elderly coastal defense ship Marechal Deodoro , and Bahia . While joining the revolt , the crew of the scout cruiser murdered one of their officers . During this time , discipline on the rebelling ships was not relaxed ; daily drills were conducted and Felisberto ordered all liquor to be thrown overboard . 
 The crews of the torpedo boats remained loyal to the government , and army troops moved to the presidential palace and the coastline , but neither group could stop the mutineers . The fact that many who manned Rio de Janeiro 's harbor defenses were sympathetic to the mutineers ' cause , coupled with chance that the capital might be bombarded by the mutinous ships , forced the National Congress of Brazil to give in to the rebels ' demands . These included the abolition of flogging , improved living conditions , and the granting of amnesty to all mutineers . The government also issued official pardons and a statement of regret ; its submission resulted in the rebellion 's end on 26 November , when control of the four ships was handed back to the navy . 
 = = First World War = = 
 In the opening years of the First World War , the Brazilian Navy was sent out to patrol the South Atlantic with French , British and American naval units , although its ships were not supposed to engage any threat outside territorial waters as Brazil was not at war with the Central Powers . The country also tried to ensure that it remained totally neutral ; Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were sent to Santos in August 1914 to enforce neutrality laws when it was reported that the German raider Bremen was lying in wait off that port for British and American merchant ships . Brazil joined the Entente and declared war on the Central Powers on 26 October 1917 . 
 On 21 December 1917 , the Brazilian Navy — at the behest of the British — formed a small naval force with the intent of sending it to the other side of the Atlantic . On 30 January 1918 , Bahia was made the flagship of the newly organized Divisão Naval em <unk> de Guerra ( Naval Division in War Operations , abbreviated as DNOG ) , under the command of Rear Admiral Pedro Max Fernando Frontin . The other ships assigned to the squadron were Bahia 's sister Rio Grande do Sul , Pará @-@ class destroyers Piauí , Paraíba , Rio Grande do Norte and Santa Catarina , tender Belmonte , and tugboat Laurindo Pita . 
 The DNOG sailed for the British colony of Sierra Leone on 31 July . Since other allied countries helped with logistics , little was provided by Brazil aside from the ships themselves and the men crewing them . Despite the threat of a U @-@ boat attack , they were forced to stop several times so Belmonte could transfer necessities such as coal and water to the other ships . They reached Freetown safely on 9 August and remained in the port until 23 August when they departed for Dakar . While on this section of the voyage , Bahia , Rio Grande do Sul , Rio Grande do Norte , Belmonte and Laurindo Pita spotted an apparent torpedo heading for Belmonte , but it missed . Rio Grande do Norte then fired several shots and depth @-@ charged what the force believed to be a U @-@ boat . While the official Brazilian history of the ship definitively claims to have sunk a submarine , author Robert Scheina notes that this action was never confirmed , and works published about U @-@ boat losses in the war do not agree . 
 After arriving in Dakar on 26 August , the DNOG was tasked with patrolling a triangle with corners at Dakar , Cape Verde and Gibraltar ; the Allies believed that this area was rife with U @-@ boats waiting for convoys to pass through . As such , the Brazilian unit 's mission was to patrol for mines laid by German minelaying submarines and to make sure that convoys passing through would be safe . Complications arose when both Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul had problems with their condensers , a matter which was made much worse by the hot , tropical climate in which the ships were serving . 
 In early September , the squadron was struck by the Spanish flu pandemic . The contagion began aboard Bahia , spread to the other ships of the squadron and remained present for seven weeks . At one point , 95 % of some of the ships ' crews were infected ; 103 died overseas , and 250 died in Brazil after returning there . On 3 November , Bahia , three of the four destroyers , and the tugboat were sent to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean Sea . They arrived on 9 or 10 November , escorted by the American destroyer Israel , but the fighting ceased on the 11th when the Armistice with Germany was signed . Sometime in early 1919 , Bahia , accompanied by four destroyers , voyaged to Portsmouth , England ; they then traveled across the English Channel to Cherbourg , arriving there on 15 February . The commander of the squadron , Admiral Pedro Max Fernando Frontin , met with the Maritime Prefect prior to the commencement of " social events " ; these lasted until 23 February , when the ships moved to Toulon and Frontin journeyed overland to Paris . The DNOG was dissolved on 25 August 1919 . 
 = = Modernization and inter @-@ war years = = 
 In 1925 – 26 , Bahia underwent significant modernization . The original five turbines were replaced by three Brown – Curtis turbines , while the original ten boilers were replaced by six Thornycroft oil @-@ burning boilers , which necessitated the addition of a third funnel . The former coal bunkers , along with some of the space freed up by the decrease in boilers , were converted to hold 588 @,@ 120 litres ( 155 @,@ 360 US gal ) of oil . These modifications resulted in Bahia 's top speed increasing to 28 knots ( 52 km / h ) . All of the boats on board were replaced , and three 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Madsen guns , a 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) Hotchkiss machine gun , and four 533 mm ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes were added to give the ship a defense against aircraft and more power against surface ships , respectively . Still , in 1930 The New York Times labeled Bahia and the other warships in Brazil 's navy as " obsolete " and noted that nearly all were " older than the ages considered effective by powers signatory to the Washington and London Naval Treaties . " 
 On 28 June 1926 , the Ludington Daily News reported that Bahia would pay a visit to Philadelphia , accepting an invitation from the United States government to participate in the sesquicentennial celebrations . In mid @-@ 1930 , Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul — under the command of <unk> Belford Gomes — escorted Brazil 's President @-@ elect Júlio Prestes to the United States . Traveling on board the Brazilian @-@ Lloyd ocean liner Almirante <unk> , Prestes was returning American then @-@ President @-@ elect Herbert Hoover 's visit to Brazil in December 1928 . The cruisers USS Trenton and Marblehead met the three ships about 100 miles ( 160 km ) off of Sandy Hook and honored Prestes with a 21 @-@ gun salute . After spending five hours in the Ambrose Channel due to fog , Prestes traveled on a launch to a pier , during which Bahia rendered one 21 @-@ gun salute and Fort Jay offered two . After arriving ashore , he traveled to City Hall before speeding down to Washington , D.C. He stayed in the United States for eight days before departing for France on the White Star Line 's Olympic . Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul were berthed at the Brooklyn Navy Yard for the visit . 
 During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 , Bahia served with Rio Grande do Sul — until that ship defected — and five or six destroyers off the coast of Santa Catarina ; they were once again commanded by Belford Gomes . Two years later , when the state of São Paulo rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution , Bahia — under the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre <unk> — and other vessels blockaded the rebel @-@ held port of Santos . Bahia was under repair from 1934 into 1935 . In November 1935 , Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul sailed to Natal , the capital of Rio Grande do Norte , to lend support against another rebellion . As part of their mission , they were ordered to sink the steamship Santos on sight , as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board . 
 From 17 – 22 May 1935 , Bahia and Rio Grande do Sul — joined at an unknown point by the Argentine battleships Rivadavia and Moreno , the heavy cruisers Almirante Brown and Veinticinco de Mayo , and five destroyers — escorted São Paulo , with Brazilian President Getúlio <unk> Vargas embarked , up the Río de la Plata ( River Plate ) to Buenos Aires , the capital of Argentina . Vargas was returning visits from the presidents of Argentina and Uruguay , Agustín Pedro Justo and Gabriel Terra . Vargas and Justo planned to be present at the opening session of the Pan @-@ American Commercial Conference on 26 May , and open a Chaco War peace conference , before São Paulo conveyed Vargas to Montevideo , Uruguay for meetings with Terra . 
 On 2 March 1936 , Bahia escorted Veinticinco de Mayo , which had the Argentine Navy Minister Rear Admiral Eleazar Videla embarked , and Almirante Brown in the last part of their journey to Rio de Janeiro . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 After Brazil 's entrance into the Second World War on 21 August 1942 , which took effect on 31 August , Bahia was used extensively at campaign of Atlantic for escorts and patrols ; sources conflict as to the actual number — either 67 and 15 or 62 and 11 . In total , she traveled 101 @,@ 971 nmi ( 188 @,@ 850 km ; 117 @,@ 346 mi ) in 358 days , and played a role in shepherding over 700 merchant ships , though she and Rio Grande do <unk> were labeled by the United States Naval Institute 's magazine Proceedings as being " oversized destroyers " that were " relatively slow " . 
 Bahia was modernized again twice during the war , in both 1942 and 1944 ; these modernizations were not as extensive as those of the 1920s . Two of her 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns were replaced with 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 23 AA guns , her Madsen guns were replaced with seven Oerlikon 20 mm cannons in single mounts , and a director for these guns was installed . Two depth charge tracks were added , improved range @-@ finders were added to the 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns , and sonar and radar were fitted , in addition to other minor modifications . The Brazilian Navy 's official history of the ship reports these modifications , but does not specify which were undertaken in which year . 
 On 3 June 1943 , while Bahia was escorting the convoy BT 12 , she located an underwater mine and destroyed it with one of her 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Madsen guns . On 10 July , while at 26 ° 15 ′ S 43 ° 35 ′ W , Bahia received a sonar contact and depth @-@ charged what the Brazilian Navy 's official history of the ship reports might have been the German submarine U @-@ 199 , which was sunk later that month in the same area ( off Rio de Janeiro ) by American and Brazilian aircraft . In November 1944 , Bahia joined the American light cruiser Omaha and destroyer escort Gustafson in the <unk> of the General M. C. Meigs troopship , which was carrying the 4th <unk> of BEF 's troops heading to Italy . 
 = = = Loss = = = 
 At the end of hostilities in the European theater in May 1945 various warships of the Allied nations , including Brazil 's , were assigned to patrol in the Atlantic as rescue ships , standing by near routes frequented by military transport aircraft carrying personnel from Europe to the continuing war in the Pacific . Bahia was one such ship ; on 4 July 1945 , she was stationed northeast of Brazil around 0 ° N 30 ° W , near the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago . For anti @-@ aircraft target practice , crewmen were firing the ship 's 20 mm guns at a kite that was being towed behind the ship . One of them shot it down , but also accidentally hit the depth charges on the stern — a direct consequence of the lack of guide rails that would normally prohibit the guns from being aimed at the ship . The resulting explosion knocked out all power on the ship and sank her in about three minutes . 
 The survivors of the blast endured four or five days of no food , high temperatures and full exposure to the sun on their makeshift rafts . The New York Times reported that some were driven mad by these conditions and simply jumped into the water , where they were devoured by sharks . From this point on , sources vary greatly . According to an article in Time , Bahia 's loss was not discovered until 8 July , when 22 survivors were picked up by a freighter , Balfe . Naval historian Robert Scheina , however , says that the disaster was revealed when Rio Grande do Sul arrived on station four days after the sinking to take Bahia 's place and could not find her . 
 Sources also disagree on the number rescued and final death toll . The official history of the ship gives 36 rescued and 336 dead , and the <unk> de Guerra <unk> gives 36 and 339 . Contemporary news articles also published varying numbers ; in an article published a day after the accident became known , The Evening Independent stated that the ship carried 383 men , though it did not give any more information . The New York Times gave figures of 28 saved and 347 lost , while the St. Petersburg Times gave 32 and 395 . Sources do agree , however , that four American sound technicians were killed . 
 Rescued crewmen believed that they had hit a mine that detonated one of the ship 's magazines . Vice Admiral Jorge Dodsworth Martins — Brazil 's chief of naval intelligence — thought that Bahia could have been mined or torpedoed by U @-@ 530 , which surrendered under strange circumstances in Mar del Plata , Argentina , on 10 July ( some two months after Germany 's surrender ) , but the Argentine Naval Ministry stated that it would have been impossible for the submarine to travel from the site of the sinking to Mar del Plata in six days ( 4 – 10 July ) . The U @-@ 977 , which crew was also heading to Argentina seeking for asylum , was also accused of sinking Bahia . However , Military investigations carried out by both US and Brazilian Navies , concluded that the cruiser had been indeed sunk due to the above described gunnery accident .

 The Hills was an American reality television series that aired for six seasons on MTV from May 31 , 2006 , until July 13 , 2010 . Developed as a spin @-@ off of Laguna Beach : The Real Orange County , the series aired six seasons and focused on the personal and professional lives of several young women residing in Los Angeles , California . Its premise was conceived by Adam DiVello , while Liz Gateley and Sean Travis served as executive producers . 
 The series originally focused on Lauren Conrad , who appeared in its predecessor , as she pursued a career in the fashion industry . It additionally placed emphasis on her housemate Heidi Montag and their friends Audrina Patridge and Whitney Port . Conrad 's friend Lo Bosworth and Montag 's boyfriend Spencer Pratt developed major positions as part of the supporting cast in the second season , while his sister Stephanie Pratt was added in the third . Port left the series at the conclusion of the fourth season , moving to New York City and starring in her own spin @-@ off , The City , which aired for two seasons . 
 Looking to pursue other career opportunities , Conrad left the series halfway through the fifth season , and was subsequently replaced by fellow Laguna Beach : The Real Orange County cast member Kristin Cavallari . Bosworth and Stephanie Pratt joined Cavallari and Patridge as primary cast members in the sixth and final season , while Montag and her husband Pratt were removed from the series after displaying erratic behavior . Conrad briefly returned to the series during an alternate ending for its finale . 
 The Hills received moderately favorable reviews from critics , and has been recognized as a " guilty pleasure " by several media outlets . However , the series was often criticized for tending towards a narrative format more commonly seen in scripted genres including soap operas , and appearing to fabricate much of its storyline . The show has produced several spin @-@ offs , as well as distributed all seasons to DVD . 
 In June 2016 , it was announced that The Hills would return for a reunion special , entitled The Hills : That Was Then , This Is Now . Lauren Conrad will star in the special , and it is scheduled to air on MTV on August 2 , 2016 .

 In 2004 , the reality television series Laguna Beach : The Real Orange County premiered on MTV . The program was created by Liz Gateley and documented the lives of several students attending Laguna Beach High School as they completed secondary education . The series proved among the network 's most successful programming , though the entire original cast left after the second season and were replaced by another group of teenagers for the following season . 
 Television producer Adam DiVello developed the spin @-@ off program The Hills to follow one of its predecessor 's original cast members , Lauren Conrad , as she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the fashion industry .

 The Hills chronicles the lives of several young women living in Los Angeles , California . Every installment commences with a voice @-@ over narrative from series leads Lauren Conrad ( seasons 1 – 5 ) or Kristin Cavallari ( seasons 5 – 6 ) , foreshadowing the theme of the episode . Each season concludes with a finale , typically involving a major event such as a progressing relationship or a personnel departure . Most installments revolve around the women 's everyday lives , with the intention of balancing coverage of their personal and professional endeavors . 
 Throughout its run , the series was led by three ( season 5 ) and four ( seasons 1 – 4 , 6 ) primary cast members , who were credited by their first names . Its original main cast members were Conrad , Heidi Montag , Audrina Patridge , and Whitney Port . Upon the conclusion of the fourth season , Port moved to New York City after receiving employment with Diane von Fürstenberg and was commissioned to star in the spin @-@ off The City . 
 During this time , Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities , though she filmed ten episodes in the following season to close her storylines . After departing halfway through the fifth season , she was replaced by Cavallari , a fellow former Laguna Beach : The Real Orange County cast member . The sixth and final season saw Conrad 's friends Lo Bosworth and Stephanie Pratt , who were respectively featured as supporting roles since the second and third seasons , become primary cast members . Halfway through the season , Montag left the series after the cast looked to disassociate themselves from her uncharacteristic antics . 
 The aforementioned women 's storylines were largely developed by a number of supporting cast members . Spencer Pratt , originally credited as " Heidi 's boyfriend " and later " Heidi 's husband " , was added in the second season . Also that season , Brody Jenner was introduced as " Spencer 's friend " . After establishing a friendship with Conrad , he became known as " Lauren 's friend " . Jenner was later credited as " Kristin 's ex @-@ boyfriend " when Cavallari assumed Conrad 's position in the fifth season . 
 In the third season , Frankie Delgado was established as " Brody 's friend " . His title was adjusted as " Lauren 's friend " the following season , and was eventually reverted to " Brody 's friend " during the fifth season . Since the third season , Justin " Justin @-@ Bobby " Brescia was recognized as " Audrina 's ex " , " Audrina 's boyfriend " , or " Audrina 's ex @-@ boyfriend " Holly Montag , credited as " Heidi 's sister " , was added to the series in the fourth season . 
 In the fifth season , Stacie Hall was introduced to the series as " bartender " when working at The Dime , and later became " the bartender " after the conflict between herself , Montag , and Pratt came to fruition . After the conflict settled , Hall remained on the series as " Kristin 's friend " .

 In its series premiere , The Hills first introduced Lauren Conrad , who moved from Laguna Beach , California to Los Angeles to pursue a career in the fashion industry . She and her housemate Heidi Montag originally planned to attend the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising , though the latter left the college after receiving employment with Bolthouse Productions . Montag befriended their neighbor Audrina Patridge , while Conrad bonded with her fellow Teen Vogue intern Whitney Port . The remainder of the first season highlighted romantic relationships , including Montag 's and Patridge 's brief relationships with Jordan Eubanks and Brian Drolet respectively . The season concluded with Conrad 's rejection of a summertime internship in Paris to reunite with her former boyfriend Jason Wahler . Consequentially , Port was offered and accepted the position in Conrad 's place . 
 By the beginning of the second season , Conrad and Wahler had ended their relationship , while Montag began dating Spencer Pratt . Montag increasingly spent more time with Pratt and neglected her friendship with Conrad , which placed a strain on the pair 's friendship . Consequentially , Conrad strengthened her relationship with her friend Lo Bosworth and took a romantic interest in Pratt 's friend Brody Jenner . Montag and Pratt moved into an apartment together in the season finale , at which point Patridge became Conrad 's new housemate . 
 In the third season , Conrad ended her friendship with Montag after suspecting that she and Pratt fabricated rumors of a sex tape involving herself and Wahler . The ensuing feud between the women became a central focus of the series , and was carried through each subsequent season in which Conrad appeared . Montag and Pratt became engaged , while Patridge resumed a turbulent romantic relationship with her friend Justin " Justin Bobby " Brescia . After Conrad established <unk> with Jenner and his friend Frankie Delgado , Pratt severed ties with both men . 
 In light of the building feud , Spencer 's sister Stephanie Pratt initially took a disliking to Conrad . However , she later apologized to Conrad for an earlier confrontation , and the pair became friends . Their relationship put a burden on Pratt 's relationship with her brother and Montag , who reacted by beginning to alienate her . Conrad and Port eventually left their positions at Teen Vogue after receiving employment from Kelly Cutrone 's PR firm People 's Revolution . By the end of the season , Conrad and Patridge had moved out of their apartment and purchased a home , with new housemate Bosworth becoming a distancing factor between the former two . 
 The fourth season saw Patridge reconcile with Bosworth and repair her relationship with Conrad before moving into a separate residence . Holly Montag moved from her hometown of Crested Butte , Colorado into her sister and Pratt 's apartment , which created tension between the sisters and Pratt . Montag was later fired from her job with Bolthouse after becoming drunk during a company event . While vacationing in Mexico , an intoxicated Montag and Pratt elope . In the season finale , Conrad and Montag appear to have reconciled , though Conrad 's suspicions regarding the rumors continued to inhibit a reconciliation . Port eventually relocated to New York City to accept a position with Diane von Fürstenberg . 
 As the fifth season began , Spencer Pratt developed a flirtatious bond with a local bartender Stacie Hall , to the dismay of Montag . Per Montag 's request to salvage their relationship , Pratt agreed to attend couples ' therapy . As they became re @-@ engaged and decided to officially marry , Conrad initially declined an invitation to the wedding . In an attempt to change her mind , Pratt called Conrad and apologized for spreading the rumors . After much additional deliberation , Conrad made her final appearance on the series during the mid @-@ season finale , where she attended the nuptials and reconciled with Montag . 
 Kristin Cavallari caught the bouquet at the wedding , and assumed the series ' lead beginning in the second half of the season . She began a casual relationship with Brescia , at which point Patridge severed ties with him . Afterwards , the women developed a feud that continued through the remainder of the season . Meanwhile , Montag and Pratt purchased a new house and clashed over the decision to begin a family ; Montag wished to have children , while Pratt opposed the thought . 
 Before filming for the sixth season commenced , Montag garnered significant criticism after undergoing ten cosmetic surgery procedures in one day . In the premiere , she traveled to her hometown Crested Butte to unveil the results to her family . After unexpectedly receiving much disapproval , she and her husband Pratt alienated themselves from their relatives . Having later displayed additional instances of erratic and unusual behavior , their respective sisters decided to exclude them from their lives . Having dated several years prior , Cavallari and Jenner become flirtatious once more , though the former was taken aback after the latter started seeing another woman . 
 Meanwhile , Stephanie Pratt struggled to begin dating after being arrested for driving under the influence , but later became involved in a relationship . Patridge became involved in a brief relationship with singer Ryan Cabrera and settled as friends with Brescia , while Bosworth moved in with her boyfriend Scott . 
 During the final episode of the series , Cavallari decides to move to Europe . In the final scene , Jenner is shown to be watching the limousine bringing Cavallari to the airport travel down her street . With the camera on Jenner , the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away , while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot . In reality , the vehicle had not driven off and Cavallari stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner . 
 An alternate ending to the series was broadcast in August 2013 . The scene depicts Jenner returning to his apartment after seeing Cavallari 's limousine off to Europe . Conrad is revealed to be sitting on his couch , and comforts him that " it 's hard to say goodbye " to a " friend of [ his ] " , before the camera focuses on a smiling Conrad .

 The Hills was moderately well received among critics . The series ' first season holds a score of 52 out of 100 on Metacritic , indicating " mixed or average reviews " , based on eight reviews . Robert Abele of LA Weekly complimented the program for being " insanely watchable " , while Variety 's Brian Lowry criticized the storylines as being " as old as they come " . The second season garnered more favorable feedback , with Virginia <unk> of The New York Times opining that Conrad " now registers as charm " . After the falling @-@ out between Conrad and Montag in the third season , Heffernan also commented that The Hills " is more convincing than Friends and just about any other comedy about female relationships because — as anyone who has ever been a young woman knows — undying friendships die " . 
 The decision to replace the departing Conrad with Cavallari halfway through the fifth season was met with a mixed response . Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly expressed interest in the route the series would take , writing that the latter would " be fully prepared to stir things up " . After the premiere of the first episode under her lead , a writer from PopSugar criticized Cavallari 's " sassy , bad @-@ girl attitude " for lacking originality and preferred Conrad for " [ keeping ] it real " . In contrast , Amy Kaufman from Los Angeles Times opined that Cavallari was more intriguing than Conrad , whose storylines she felt had been overshadowed as the series progressed . 
 The original series finale during the sixth season garnered a generally negative critical response . Emily Exton from Entertainment Weekly described it as " probably a bit confusing " for the series ' earlier viewers , in light of the casting adjustments in later seasons . A writer for Gawker criticized that " as the camera zooms out into the South California nothingness , nothing has changed , and neither audience nor cast is for the better " . However , a writer from People was more positive , feeling that the conclusion was a " surprise twist " . 
 Similarly , critics were ambivalent towards the alternate finale . Jenna Mullins from E ! praised Conrad 's return as being " shocking and glorious at the same time " , and felt that " clearly [ viewers ] should all prefer the ending with Lauren Conrad " . Kaitlin Reilly from Bustle described the suggestion of another love triangle involving Conrad and Cavallari to " [ feel ] vaguely like the ending to a horror movie " in that " it 's starting again " , but nonetheless appreciated the ending as " a wink to loyal fans " . Billy Niles from Zap2It noted that there was " no winking nod to a soundstage " , and opined that " nothing that freaking awesome happened " . Sonya Sorich of the Ledger @-@ Enquirer preferred the original conclusion , commenting that the revised clip was not as " startling " as the first . Lindsey Weber from Vulture suggested that the footage felt like a " total soap opera " in that it seemingly acknowledged that portions of the series were fabricated . 
 During its run , The Hills received several accolades from media outlets . It was recognized at number 82 on Entertainment Weekly 's list of the 100 New TV Classics . The series has been labeled as a guilty pleasure by writers for The Huffington Post , MSN , and BuzzSugar .

 The Hills was often criticized for appearing to fabricate much of its storyline . In one instance , the president of entertainment for MTV , Brian Graden , commented that the series benefits from the media coverage it receives in between seasons , which he described as a " six @-@ month commercial for the show that doesn 't give away the narrative in full . " He elaborated that MTV wants " viewers to watch Lauren and the girls as the characters we know instead of in a show about being the stars of The Hills " ; the sex tape rumors were consequently presented like a personal conflict between the women , and was intentionally not addressed as a highly publicized controversy . 
 In 2008 , Patridge noted that a producer offered her a position on the series to become friends with Conrad and Montag . She later appeared on an episode of Chelsea Lately , where Chelsea Handler suggested the program was improvised . When pressed further , Patridge replied , " We 're put in situations where however we 'd react and that 's what comes up [ on TV ] " , and additionally stated that the series was unscripted . In 2008 , Montag and Pratt acknowledged that their Mexican elopement was " entirely symbolic " , while their civil ceremony was filmed after office hours without a county court judge present . Additionally , the Associated Press noted that neither person had filed for a marriage record at the time . An additional source of suspicion arose during the fifth season , where Conrad was shown to be moving out of her house the day prior to Montag and Pratt 's nuptials . However , Conrad and Bosworth had actually left the property several months prior in January , leading to speculation that addressing the wedding as " the next day " was pre @-@ planned . 
 After leaving The Hills , Conrad appeared on The View in June 2009 , where she was asked how she felt about her apology from Pratt involving the sex tape rumors . She replied , " To be perfectly honest , I wasn 't on the other line of that call [ ... ] I didn 't even know about it until [ afterwards ] , so no , I didn 't get an apology , he 's lying " . At Montag and Pratt 's wedding , it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other 's presence , though the latter commented that they gave each other " a big hug , and that 's it " . She also stated that when she joined The Hills , " It 's work ! And drama sells . I think that 's why they 're bringing me in , because I know what works " . 
 In February 2011 , Cavallari told Access Hollywood that the cast followed a " schedule " of events to be filmed on a given day , adding , " We only filmed The Hills three days a week , and we did three different scenes each day and a change of clothes to film a specific scene [ ... ] They were pushing it as far as they could go without an actual script ... They give you a schedule like , ' You have lunch with Heidi [ Montag ] at 3 to talk about the party coming up ' or whatever the situation may be " . She had earlier commented that she felt viewers " need to understand it 's all entertainment " and she " would never put [ her ] close friends or a real relationship on a show " . 
 Cavallari later told Ryan Seacrest that her relationships with Jenner and Brescia were fabricated , and make a point of saying that it was very difficult for her to pretend to be romantically interested in the unattractive and unlikable Brescia . In October 2012 , in an interview with Allure , Conrad stated that while " the story told wasn 't a dishonest one , the way [ the producers ] did it sometimes was " . She elaborated that scenes would be reenacted if cameras were not present for a significant occurrence between cast members , and commented that her relationship with Jenner was " pretty brief " and " definitely [ edited ] to drag it out " . In July 2013 , when discussing the filming of several alternate finale endings , MTV acknowledged that " maybe the term ' reality TV ' didn 't perfectly apply to The Hills " .

 However , during production of The City , Port wanted to feature her private life to emphasize that " [ her ] head is still screwed on straight " . During the first half of the debut season , the program highlighted her transition to New York City after receiving employment from Diane von Fürstenberg . However , Port later left her position and returned to People 's Revolution with Kelly Cutrone . 
 The series underwent several casting adjustments for the second half of the first season .

 = Fortress of Mimoyecques = 
 The Fortress of Mimoyecques is the modern name for a Second World War underground military complex built by the forces of Nazi Germany between 1943 and 1944 . It was intended to house a battery of V @-@ 3 cannons aimed at London , 165 kilometres ( 103 mi ) away . Originally codenamed Wiese ( " Meadow " ) or <unk> 711 ( " Construction Project 711 " ) , it is located in the commune of Landrethun @-@ le @-@ Nord in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region of northern France , near the hamlet of Mimoyecques about 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . It was constructed by a mostly German workforce recruited from major engineering and mining concerns , augmented by prisoner @-@ of @-@ war slave labour . 
 The complex consists of a network of tunnels dug under a chalk hill , linked to five inclined shafts in which 25 V @-@ 3 guns would have been installed , all targeted on London . The guns would have been able to fire ten dart @-@ like explosive projectiles a minute – 600 rounds every hour – into the British capital , which Winston Churchill later commented would have constituted " the most devastating attack of all " . The Allies knew nothing about the V @-@ 3 but identified the site as a possible launching base for V @-@ 2 ballistic missiles , based on reconnaissance photographs and fragmentary intelligence from French sources . 
 Mimoyecques was targeted for intensive bombardment by the Allied air forces from late 1943 onwards . Construction work was seriously disrupted , forcing the Germans to abandon work on part of the complex . The rest was partly destroyed on 6 July 1944 by No. 617 Squadron RAF , which used ground @-@ penetrating 5 @,@ 400 @-@ kilogram ( 11 @,@ 900 lb ) " Tallboy " earthquake bombs to collapse tunnels and shafts , entombing hundreds of slave workers underground . 
 The Germans halted construction work at Mimoyecques as the Allies advanced up the coast following the Normandy landings . It fell to the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division on 5 September 1944 without resistance , a few days after the Germans withdrew from the area . 
 The complex was partly demolished just after the war on Churchill 's direct orders ( and to the great annoyance of the French , who were not consulted ) , as it was still seen as a threat to the United Kingdom . It was later reopened by private owners , first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984 . A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole , a former V @-@ 2 rocket base turned museum near Saint @-@ Omer , took over its management . It continues to be open to the public as a vast underground museum complex . 
 = = Background = = 
 In May 1943 Albert Speer , the Reich 's Minister of Armaments and War Production , informed Adolf Hitler of work that was being carried out to produce a <unk> capable of firing hundreds of shells an hour over long distances . The newly designed gun , codenamed the <unk> ( " High Pressure Pump " , HDP for short ) and later designated as the V @-@ 3 , was one of the V @-@ weapons – <unk> ( " retaliation weapons " ) – developed by Nazi Germany in the later stages of the war to attack Allied targets . Long @-@ range guns were not a new development , but the high @-@ pressure detonations used to fire shells from previous such weapons , including the Paris gun , rapidly wore out their barrels . 
 In 1942 , August <unk> , inspired by previous designs of multi @-@ chamber guns , suggested that the gradual acceleration of the shell by a series of small charges spread over the length of the barrel might be the solution to the problem of designing very long @-@ range guns . <unk> proposed the use of electrically activated charges to eliminate the problem of the premature ignition of the subsidiary charges experienced by previous multi @-@ chamber guns . The HDP would have a smooth barrel over 100 metres ( 330 ft ) long , along which a 97 @-@ kilogram ( 214 lb ) finned shell ( known as the <unk> <unk> ) would be accelerated by numerous small low @-@ pressure detonations from charges in branches off the barrel , each fired electrically in sequence . Each barrel would be 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter . 
 The gun was still in its prototype stages , but Hitler was an enthusiastic supporter of the idea and ordered that maximum support be given to its development and deployment . In August 1943 he approved the construction of a battery of HDP guns in France to supplement the planned V @-@ 1 and V @-@ 2 missile campaigns against London and the south @-@ east of England . Speer noted afterwards : 
 On my suggestion , the Führer has decided that the risk must be stood to award contracts at once for the " high @-@ pressure pump , " without waiting for the results of firing trials . Maximum support is to be accorded to the experimental ranges at <unk> and <unk> , and especially to the completion of the actual battery . 
 To reach England , the weapon needed barrels 127 metres ( 417 ft ) long , so it could not be moved ; it would have to be deployed from a fixed site . A study carried out in early 1943 had shown that the optimal location for its deployment would be within a hill with a rock core into which inclined drifts could be tunneled to support the barrels . 
 The site was identified by a fortification expert , Major Bock of the <unk> @-@ Pionier @-@ Stab 27 of the Fifteenth Army LVII Corps based in the Dieppe area . A limestone hill near the hamlet of Mimoyecques , 158 metres ( 518 ft ) high and 165 kilometres ( 103 mi ) from London , was chosen to house the gun . It had been selected with care ; the hill in which the facility was built is primarily chalk with very little topsoil cover , and the chalk layer extends several hundred metres below the surface , providing a deep but easily tunnelled rock layer . The chalk is easy to excavate and strong enough to dig tunnels without using timber supports . Although the site 's road links were poor , it was only a few kilometres west of the main railway line between Calais and Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . 
 The area was already heavily militarised ; as well as the fortifications of the Atlantic Wall on the cliffs of Cap Gris Nez to the northwest , there was a firing base for at least one conventional Krupp K5 railway gun about 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) to the south in the nearby quarries of <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Construction began in September 1943 with the building of railway lines to support the work , and excavation of the gun shafts began in October . The initial layout comprised two parallel complexes approximately 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) apart , each with five drifts which were to hold a stacked cluster of five HDP gun tubes , for a total of 25 guns . The smoothbore design of the HDP would enable a much higher rate of fire than was possible with conventional guns . The entire battery would be able to fire up to 10 shots a minute , capable in theory of hitting London with 600 projectiles every hour . Both facilities were to be served by an underground railway tunnel of standard gauge , connected to the Calais @-@ Boulogne main line , and underground ammunition storage galleries which were tunneled at a depth of about 33 m ( 108 ft ) . The western site was abandoned at an early stage after being disrupted by Allied bombing , and only the eastern complex was built . 
 The drifts were angled at 50 degrees , reaching a depth of 105 m ( 344 ft ) . Owing to technical problems with the gun prototype , the scope of the project was reduced ; drifts I and II were abandoned at an early date and only III , IV and V were taken forward . They came to the surface at a concrete slab or Platte 30 m ( 98 ft ) wide and 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) thick , in which there were narrow openings to allow the projectiles to pass through . The openings in the slab were protected by large steel plates , and the railway tunnel entrances were further protected by armoured steel doors . Each drift was oriented on a bearing of 299 ° , to the nearest degree – a direct line on Westminster Bridge . Although the elevation and direction of the guns could not be changed , it would have been possible to alter the range by varying the amount of propellant used in each shot . This would have brought much of London within range . 
 The railway tunnel ran in a straight line for a distance of about 630 m ( 2 @,@ 070 ft ) . Along its west side was an unloading platform which gave access to ten cross galleries ( numbered 3 – 13 by the Germans ) , driven at right angles to the main tunnel at intervals of 24 metres ( 79 ft ) . Each gallery was fitted with a 600 mm ( 1 ft 11 5 ⁄ 8 in ) gauge railway track . On the east side of the tunnel were chambers intended to be used as store rooms , offices and quarters for the garrison . Trains would have entered the facility and unloaded shells and propellant for the guns . 
 Galleries 6 – 10 , the central group , gave access to the guns , while galleries 3 – 5 and 11 – 13 were intended for use as access tunnels and perhaps also storage areas . They were all connected by Gallery No. 2 , which ran parallel to the main railway tunnel at a distance of 100 metres ( 330 ft ) . Galleries 6 – 10 were additionally connected by a second passageway , designated Gallery No. 1 , running parallel to the main tunnel at a distance of 24 @.@ 5 metres ( 80 ft ) . Further workings existed at depths of 62 m ( 203 ft ) , 47 m ( 154 ft ) and 30 m ( 98 ft ) , each serving different purposes associated with the drifts and the guns . The 62 m workings were constructed to facilitate the removal of spoil from the drifts , while those at 47 m were connected with the handling of exhaust gases from the guns and those at 30 m gave access to the breeches of the guns . The lower levels of the workings were accessed via lift shafts , and mining cages were used during construction . 
 The construction work was carried out by over 5 @,@ 000 workers , mostly German engineers drafted in from several companies including Mannesmann , Gute <unk> , Krupp and the Vereinigte <unk> , supplemented by 430 miners recruited from the Ruhr and Soviet prisoners of war who were used as slave labourers . The intensive Allied bombing campaign caused delays , but construction work continued nonetheless at a high pace underground . The original plans had envisaged having the first battery of five guns ready by March 1944 and the full complement of 25 guns by 1 October 1944 , but these target dates were not met .

 In 1943 French agents reported that the Germans were planning to mount an offensive against the United Kingdom that would involve the use of secret weapons resembling giant mortars sunk in the ground and served by rail links . The first signs of abnormal activity at Mimoyecques were spotted by analysts at the Allied Central Interpretation Unit in September 1943 , when aerial reconnaissance revealed that the Germans were building railway loops leading to the tunnels into the eastern and western sites . Further reconnaissance flights in October 1943 photographed large @-@ scale activity around the tunnels . 
 An analyst named André Kenny discovered a series of shafts when he saw from a reconnaissance photograph that a haystack concealing one of them had disintegrated , perhaps through the effects of a gale , revealing the entrance , a windlass and pulley . The purpose of the site was unclear , but it was thought to be some kind of shelter for launching rockets or flying bombs . An MI6 agent reported that " a concrete chamber was to be built near one of the tunnels for the installation of a tube , 40 to 50 metres long , which he referred to as a ' rocket launching cannon ' " . The shafts were interpreted as " air holes to allow for the expansion of the gases released by the explosion of the launching charge . " 
 The Allies were unaware of the HDP gun and therefore of the Mimoyecques site 's true purpose . Allied intelligence believed at the time that the V @-@ 2 rocket had to be launched from tubes or " projectors " , so it was assumed that the inclined shafts at Mimoyecques were intended to house such devices . 
 The lack of intelligence on Mimoyecques was frustrating for those involved in Operation Crossbow , the Allied effort to counter the V @-@ weapons . On 21 March 1944 the British Chiefs of Staff discussed the shortage of intelligence but were told by Reginald Victor Jones , one of the " Crossbow Committee " members , that little information was leaking out because the workforce was predominantly German . The Committee 's head , Duncan Sandys , pressed for greater efforts and proposed that the Special Operations Executive be tasked to kidnap a German technician who could be interrogated for information . The suggestion was approved , but was never put into effect . 
 In the end the Chiefs of Staff instructed General Eisenhower to begin intensive attacks on the so @-@ called " Heavy Crossbow " sites , including Mimoyecques , which was still believed to be intended for use as a rocket @-@ launching site . 
 The Allied air forces carried out several bombing raids on Mimoyecques between November 1943 and June 1944 but caused little damage . The bombing disrupted the construction project and the initial raids of 5 and 8 November 1943 caused work to be delayed for about a month . The Germans subsequently decided to abandon the western site , where work had not progressed very far , and concentrated on the eastern site . On 6 July 1944 the Royal Air Force began bombing the site with ground @-@ penetrating Tallboy bombs . One Tallboy hit the concrete slab on top of Drift IV , collapsing the drift . Three others penetrated the tunnels below and substantially damaged the facility , causing several of the galleries to collapse in places . 
 Around 300 Germans and forced labourers were buried alive by the collapses . Adding to the Germans ' difficulties , major technical problems were discovered with the HDP gun projectiles . They had been designed to exit the barrels at a speed of about 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) per second , but the Germans found that a design fault caused the projectiles to begin " tumbling " in flight at speeds above 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) per second , causing them to fall well short of the target . This was not discovered until over 20 @,@ 000 projectiles had already been manufactured . 
 After the devastating raid of 6 July , the Germans held a high @-@ level meeting on the site 's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site 's development . On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be installed in a single drift . The two others were to be reused to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces , <unk> out to a smooth bore with a diameter of 310 millimetres ( 12 in ) , which were to use a new type of long @-@ range rocket @-@ propelled shell . A pair of <unk> missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances . These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques , and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work . 
 The Allies were unaware of this and mounted further attacks on the site as part of the United States Army Air Forces experimental Operation Aphrodite , involving radio @-@ controlled B @-@ 24 Liberators packed with explosives . Two such attacks were mounted but failed ; in the second such attack , on 12 August , Lt Joseph P. Kennedy , Jr . – the elder brother of future US President John F. Kennedy – was killed when the drone aircraft exploded prematurely . By the end of the bombing campaign , over 4 @,@ 100 tons of bombs had been dropped on Mimoyecques , more than on any other V @-@ weapons site . 
 The Mimoyecques site was never formally abandoned , but German forces left it at the start of September 1944 as the Allies advanced northeast from Normandy towards the Pas de Calais . It was captured on 5 September by the Canadian 3rd Infantry Division . 
 = = Subsequent investigations and attempted demolition = = 
 In September 1944 , Duncan Sandys ordered the constitution of a Technical Inter @-@ Services Mission under Colonel T.R.B. Sanders . It was given the task of investigating the V @-@ weapons sites at Mimoyecques , Siracourt , Watten , and Wizernes , collectively known to the Allies as the " Heavy Crossbow " sites . Sanders ' report was submitted to the War Cabinet on 19 March 1945 . 
 Even at this stage the true purpose of the site was unclear . Claims that it had been intended to be used for " electro @-@ magnetic projectors " ( <unk> ) , firing huge shells at London , were debunked by Lord Cherwell , Winston Churchill 's scientific adviser , who calculated that it would take sixty times the output of Battersea Power Station to fire a one @-@ ton shell . Sanders ' investigation brought to light the V @-@ 3 project for the first time , to the alarm of the British government . He concluded that although the site had been damaged it " could be completed or adapted for offensive action against this country at some future date , and [ its ] destruction is a matter of importance . " Sandys brought the matter to the attention of Churchill and advised : " Since this installation constitutes a potential threat to London , it would be wise to ensure that it is demolished whilst our forces are still in France . " Churchill later commented that the V @-@ 3 installation at Mimoyecques " might well have launched the most devastating attack of all on London . " 
 The discovery of the site 's true purpose produced some recriminations in London , as – unlike the V @-@ 1 and V @-@ 2 projects – the V @-@ 3 had not been uncovered by Allied intelligence before the war 's end . The British scientist and military intelligence expert Reginald Victor Jones later commented that " techniques that had been used against the flying bomb and the rocket appeared to have failed against HDP [ V @-@ 3 ] , and there had to be a reason . Basically it was that with our limited effort we had to concentrate on the most urgent problem , and thus on catching weapons not so much at the research stage ( although we sometimes achieved this ) as in the development stage – which usually meant when trials were showing promise . " He concluded at the time , in April 1945 , that the intelligence failure had not made much practical difference given the fact that the Germans had failed to develop the HDP into an effective weapon : " there was little warning ; [ but ] there was little danger . " 
 Following the recommendation that the site should be destroyed , the Royal Engineers stacked ten tons of British 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bombs and captured German plastic explosive in the tunnels at Mimoyecques and detonated them on 9 May . This failed to achieve the desired effect , and on 14 May , a further 25 tons of explosives were used to bring down the north and south entrances to the railway tunnel into the site . A subsequent investigation by the British Bombing Research Mission concluded that the entrances had been heavily blocked and that it would be a very difficult and lengthy engineering task to reinstate them . The British action was taken without informing the French beforehand and infuriated Charles de Gaulle , who considered it a violation of France 's national sovereignty . 
 = = Reopening as a museum = = 
 After the war , the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned . Much of the equipment left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal . A complete set of four steel plates , weighing 60 tons , that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by the manager of the <unk> @-@ <unk> quarries to be cut up for use in rock @-@ crushing machinery . Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s , they remained at the quarries until 2010 , when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques , where they are now on display . 
 Despite the closure of the railway tunnel entrances it was still possible for many years to get into the complex by climbing down one of the inclined drifts . In 1969 , Marie @-@ Madeleine Vasseur , a farmer from Landrethun , had the southern entrance excavated so that the tunnels could be used as a mushroom farm . 30 metres ( 98 ft ) of the southern tunnel had to be removed to clear the blockage ; the entrance now visible is not the original one built by the Germans . The southern entrance had been bricked up again by the 1970s . Moved to discover this forgotten construction , Vasseur , helped by family and friends , cleared the tunnels and installed an electricity supply . The société à <unk> <unk> " La <unk> de Mimoyecques " was constituted in 1984 to operate the site as a museum under the name of <unk> de Mimoyecques — Un Mémorial International . 
 The museum closed at the end of the 2008 season when the owner retired . Subsequently , the nonprofit organisation Conservatoire d <unk> <unk> du Nord et Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais ( Conservatory of natural sites of the Nord and Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais ) purchased it at a cost of € 330 @,@ 000 , with funding provided by the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais regional council , the European Union and a private benefactor . The Conservatory 's interest was due to the presence on the site of a large bat colony that included rare species , such as the Greater Horseshoe Bat , Geoffroy 's Bat and the Pond Bat . 
 The <unk> of the Terre des Deux Caps and the authorities in nearly Landrethun set up a partnership to operate the site under the management of the existing museum of La Coupole near Saint @-@ Omer . The director of the latter , historian Yves le Maner , designed the contents of a new museum that was constructed at a cost of € 360 @,@ 000 . 
 The site reopened to the public on 1 July 2010 . As well as presenting a history of the V @-@ weapons and of the site , the museum enables visitors to see some of the tunnels and a mock @-@ up of the HDP gun . The tunnels also house memorials to Joseph Kennedy , the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site , and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction . In 2011 , the museum had about 11 @,@ 000 visitors , of whom 53 % were French , 18 % Belgian and 16 % British .

 = Milwaukee @-@ class monitor = 
 The Milwaukee @-@ class monitors were a class of four riverine ironclad monitors built during the American Civil War . Several supported Union forces along the Mississippi River in mid @-@ 1864 before participating in the Battle of Mobile Bay in August . Chickasaw and Winnebago bombarded Confederate coastal fortifications during the battle and during subsequent operations as well as engaging the ironclad Tennessee II . The other two ships arrived at Mobile Bay after the battle and all four supported the land attacks on Mobile in March – April 1865 . Milwaukee struck a torpedo during this time and sank . The surviving three ships were sold in 1874 ; Chickasaw was converted into a ferry and survived until 1944 when she was scuttled . Her wreck was discovered in 2004 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Milwaukee @-@ class monitors had their origin in an order from Gideon Welles , Secretary of the Navy , to Commodore Joseph Smith , Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks , on 16 April 1863 to recommend four more river ironclads that could mount four 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) Dahlgren guns on a draft no more than 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) . James Eads received the contract to build four iron @-@ hulled , twin @-@ turreted ironclads , partly due to the influence of Missouri Congressman Frank P. Blair , Jr . Eads retained two of the ships , but subcontracted the other two to other builders . 
 The Milwaukee @-@ class ships were 229 feet ( 69 @.@ 8 m ) long overall and had a beam of 56 feet ( 17 @.@ 1 m ) . They had a depth of hold of 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) and a draft of six feet . The ships were 970 tons burthen and displaced 1 @,@ 300 long tons ( 1 @,@ 300 t ) . 
 They were powered by two 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal non @-@ condensing steam engines , each driving two 7 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) propellers , using steam generated by seven tubular boilers . The engines were designed to reach a top speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . They had a bore of 26 inches ( 660 mm ) and a stroke of 24 inches ( 610 mm ) . They carried 156 long tons ( 159 t ) of coal . 
 The ships ' main armament consisted of four smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 11 @-@ inch Dahlgren guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets . The fore turret in each ship , except Chickasaw , was designed by Eads while the aft turret was the standard Ericsson design used in most Union monitors . Unlike the latter , which rested its entire weight on a central spindle that had to be elevated in order for the turret to rotate , Eads ' design better distributed its weight because it rested on a number of ball bearings underneath the outer edge of the turret . The structure of the Eads turret extended down to be bottom of the ship and the entire structure rotated . The guns in the Eads turret were mounted on a steam @-@ powered platform that moved up and down , so that the guns could be reloaded below deck , safe from enemy interference . Both turrets used steam engines to rotate , but the Eads design also used it to power virtually every function in the turret , including running out the guns , absorbing the recoil from firing , and opening the gun ports to allow the guns to fire . The ability to adjust the level of the turret floor doubled the elevation of the guns to + 20 ° compared to the + 10 ° allowed in an Ericsson turret . Another advantage was that the Eads turret only required a crew of six men , far fewer than the Ericsson design . Each gun weighed approximately 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . They could fire a 136 @-@ pound ( 61 @.@ 7 kg ) shell up to a range of 3 @,@ 650 yards ( 3 @,@ 340 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° . 
 The cylindrical turrets were protected by eight layers of wrought iron 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates above the deck . Below the deck the side of the Eads turret was only a single layer thick and had holes through which the guns were loaded . The sides of the hull consisted of three layers of one @-@ inch plates , backed by 15 inches ( 380 mm ) of pine . The deck was heavily cambered to allow headroom for the crew on such a shallow draft and it consisted of iron plates .75 inches ( 19 mm ) thick . Milwaukee and Winnebago had an additional layer of armor to give them a total of 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) . The pilothouse , positioned behind and above the fore turret , was protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor .

 Chickasaw and Winnebago , the first two ship to be commissioned , spent some time patrolling the Mississippi River and supporting Union forces operating along its length before they were transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in early July 1864 to support the impending attack on the defenses of Mobile , Alabama Rear Admiral David Farragut organized the four monitors present into a separate column leading his wooden ships to engage Fort Morgan while the other ships proceeded into the Bay itself . Winnebago and Chickasaw were the third and fourth monitors in line , respectively , as the two more heavily armored Canonicus @-@ class monitors , Tecumseh and Manhattan , preceded them . Tecumseh struck a torpedo in front of the fort and a small boat from the gunboat Metacomet rescued 10 survivors and delivered them to Winnebago . The latter 's aft turret had jammed during her bombardment of Fort Morgan while Chickasaw 's funnel had been riddled with holes , significantly reducing her speed . 
 The Confederate ironclad Tennessee attacked Farragut 's wooden ships without much effect after they had passed the Confederate forts and she was engaged by Winnebago before she disengaged and briefly took shelter under Fort Morgan 's guns . About a half @-@ hour later , the ironclad attacked Farragut 's ships again . The monitors were not initially engaged , but Chickasaw managed to assume a position by the Tennessee 's stern and fired repeatedly at point @-@ blank range . Her shots failed to penetrate the Tennessee 's armor , but they did jam the armored shutter for the stern gun port and cut her exposed steering chains , rendering her unable to steer . When the crew attempted to <unk> the shutter , one shell struck the edge of the shutter , creating fragments that killed the machinist attempting to knock out the shutter 's retaining pin and broke Admiral Franklin Buchanan 's leg . This damage , together with damage inflicted by the other Union ships , persuaded Commander James D. Johnston to surrender his ship . The two monitors remained in Mobile Bay and subsequently bombarded Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines until they surrendered less than three weeks later . 
 The other two monitors were commissioned too late to participate in the battle . After supporting forces near the mouth of the Red River during the summer , Kickapoo was transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron in October for operations against Mobile itself ; Milwaukee was also transferred to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron that same month . 
 Union forces were too weak to attack the city itself until March 1865 . The monitors moved up the Blakeley River at the end of the month to cut off Confederate communications with Spanish Fort while Union troops besieged the fort . Milwaukee and Winnebago sortied upriver on 28 March to attack a Confederate transport and Milwaukee struck a torpedo while returning from the sortie . Her entire crew survived and was rescued by Kickapoo . The following day Kickapoo rescued the crew of the monitor Osage which had also struck a torpedo and sunk . After the occupation of Selma , Alabama in early April , Winnebago escorted a troop convoy to Selma and Montgomery , Alabama and then blockaded the Tombigbee River to prevent the ironclad Nashville and other Confederate ships from interfering with Union forces . 
 After the war , the three surviving ships were decommissioned and later sold on 12 September 1874 . Chickasaw 's new owners converted her to sidewheel propulsion and she became a coal and railroad ferry until 1944 when she was scuttled . Her wreck was discovered in 2004 . Milwaukee 's wreck was salvaged after the war and some of her iron was used in building the Eads Bridge over the Mississippi at St. Louis . 
 = Emeco 1006 = 
 The Emeco 1006 ( pronounced ten @-@ oh @-@ six ) , also known as the Navy chair is an aluminum chair manufactured by Emeco . The 1006 was originally built for Navy warships during World War II , but later became a designer chair used in high @-@ end restaurants and by interior designers . In the 1990s , the company began creating designer versions of the 1006 chair , such as the stackable Hudson chair and the 111 Navy Chair made from recycled plastic . Emeco also makes stools , tables , and other furniture . As of 2012 , more than one million Emeco 1006 chairs have been produced . 
 = = History = = 
 Emeco founder Wilton C. <unk> developed the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 in collaboration with the Aluminum Company of America ( <unk> ) . It was originally designed for the US Navy , which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast to the side of the ship . The chairs had eye bolts under the seat , so they could be attached to a ship @-@ deck using cables . 
 After the war , Emeco started selling 1006 chairs to prisons , hospitals and government offices . The chair was sold to restaurants in the 1980s and 1990s , under Jay <unk> 's leadership , then as a designer chair in the 2000s after Emeco was acquired by his son , Gregg . French designer Philippe Starck designed a total of 14 chairs and 4 tables for Emeco . 
 In 2006 Coca @-@ Cola began a collaboration with Emeco to create a 1006 @-@ based chair made out of recycled Coca @-@ Cola bottles , which was released in 2010 . Metropolis Magazine said it was a public relations effort by Coke to make a durable product out of their bottles ; they also hoped to encourage other manufacturers to do the same . 
 In 2005 , Target started selling an Emeco 1006 imitation product supplied by Euro Style . The supplier said it planned to modify the chair 's style to avoid a legal dispute over alleged trademark infringement . In October 2012 , Emeco filed a lawsuit against Restoration Hardware for allegedly making unauthorized reproductions of the 1006 Navy chair . Restoration Hardware removed the chair from its website , stopped selling the chair , and reached an undisclosed settlement with Emeco . 
 The Emeco 1006 chair is featured regularly in design magazines and movies , such as The Matrix , Law & Order and CSI . In Europe the original 1006 chair is sometimes referred to as " the prison chair " due to its use in government prisons and in prison @-@ related movie scenes . 
 = = Description = = 
 The original Emeco 1006 chair has a curved back with three vertical struts and a slight curve on the back legs . It weighs about seven pounds and is guaranteed to last 150 years . Most of the original chairs from the 1940s are still in use . The traditional aluminum chairs are made mostly out of recycled aluminum , but also silicon , iron , copper , magnesium , chromium , titanium and zinc . Emeco 111 chairs are made out of 60 percent recycled plastic and 30 percent glass fiber . The Emeco 111 chair was named based on it being made of at least 111 recycled Coca Cola bottles . 
 As of 2014 , there are approximately 88 Emeco chair models . The first designer version of the 1006 chair in the " Emeco by Starck " line was the Hudson chair , named after the Hudson Hotel that put a Hudson chair in every room . It has a similar silhouette as the original 1006 , but has a reflective or brushed aluminum surface , a solid backrest and is stackable . It also came in swivel and upholstered versions . The reflective glossy versions of the 1006 chair are polished for eight hours , substantially increasing their cost . There are also Emeco @-@ brand <unk> , swivel chairs , rocking chairs and armchairs . 
 Emeco 's chairs are manufactured by hand in Hanover , Pennsylvania through a two @-@ week , 77 @-@ step process . Eames Demetrios , the grandson of designer Charles Eames , published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called " 77 Steps . " Many believe the chair is cast from a single form , but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces . Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes , cut to length , and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines . Various notches and <unk> are made so pieces can fit together before welding . Workers grind down the welding joints to give it a smooth finish , creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece . The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum . The chairs are also anodized . Originally swivel chair bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier , but in the 1950s , Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in @-@ house .

" Quiero " was recorded between several studios in Miami and Mexico City , and mixed and mastered in New York City . The song was called " bohemian " and " hippie " by website ADN Mundo , stating that it was " a love story that doesn 't speak about love " . 
 " Quiero " became a moderate commercial success , reaching number 12 on the US Billboard Top Latin Songs chart , and number eight at the Latin Pop Songs chart . It also managed to appear at number 11 on the Latin Tropical Airplay chart , and received an American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers for Pop / Ballad Song of the year in 2009 . Its accompanying music video , directed by Ricardo Calderón and featuring Dominican model and former Miss Dominican Republic Massiel Taveras , was filmed in the Dominican Republic and premiered in November 2007 .

 = AJ 's Infinite Summer = 
 AJ 's Infinite Summer is an animated television pilot created by Toby Jones for Cartoon Network . The pilot follows AJ , whose new job during the summer drives him crazy with power . It is loosely based on Jones ' 2006 film , AJ Goes to France . Both the film and the pilot star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character . Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo , North Dakota , and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends . The pilot was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16 , 2014 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Summer vacation starts for AJ and his friends Danny and Morgan , who live in the city of Downer . When AJ wants to be spontaneous for his plans to spend the vacation , he impulsively decides to get a job . The trio comes across a corporate office . AJ wants to apply for the corporation that owns it , but Danny and Morgan suggest that he prepares for the interview . AJ turns to his father , Peter , for advice . He equips AJ with an oversized business suit , and afterward the trio enter the office to help AJ apply . AJ shows his resume , and immediately he is hired by the Instructor of First Impressions . Workers of the office welcome AJ , who wears the same style of business suit as they do . When he sees that each worker has their own assistant , AJ hires Morgan as his " secretary " and tells her to fetch papers . Meanwhile , he asks " towel boy " Danny to wipe the sweat off his brow . 
 After this demonstration of power , AJ is promoted by his manager . A montage of AJ being promoted for doing absurd tasks follows . Soon , AJ is promoted to a rank with a private office . Danny and Morgan refuse to work for AJ further , finding him corrupt with power . AJ throws them out , and afterward he is promoted to CEO by a former officer — a decrepit man within a robotic business suit . AJ floats to the top of the suit , from which he spots a beach ball @-@ destroying machine to the side . He hallucinates the beach balls as the heads of Morgan and Danny , who say that he has destroyed the spirit of summer . Realizing his mistake , AJ rejects the promotion . He returns to his friends outside , and together they plan the rest of their summer . 
 = = Production = = 
 AJ 's Infinite Summer was created by Toby Jones . Produced by Nate <unk> at Cartoon Network Studios , the pilot had Robert Alvarez as timing director , Sue Mondt as art director , and Phil Rynda as creative director . AJ Thompson provided the voice for the eponymous character , Wallace Langham for Danny , Mae Whitman for Morgan , Chris Parnell for Peter , and David Hill for various characters . 
 Jones had previously <unk> AJ Goes to France , a 2006 live @-@ action independent film that also has Thompson as the leading actor . It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead , Minnesota , where Jones majored in film . Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo , North Dakota , to Minneapolis in 2005 , after he graduated from Fargo South High School . For AJ 's Infinite Summer , Jones was inspired by his hometown , as well as the comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends , Danny Davy and Morgan . Additionally , the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson , Jones ' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader . Secret Cities , a Fargo @-@ based band in which Jones ' friends play , provided the score for the pilot . Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend 's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot . 
 Jones moved to Los Angeles in 2011 to work for Cartoon Network . He has written and storyboarded for Regular Show , another production on the network . His work on it gave Jones the foresight to pitch another show he knew the network would want . Initially unsure if he was ready to pitch AJ 's Infinite Summer , the network rejected the pilot the first time he did but approved it on the second , after he had reworked it throughout a few months . Jones contrasted the physical limitations of animating in time and energy to the animation of the pilot itself . He cited having the character of AJ run up a wall in one scene as an example of this .

 AJ 's Infinite Summer was released without announcement on May 16 , 2014 , on the official website of Cartoon Network . Long Live the Royals , another pilot , was released on the same day . This pilot was created by Sean <unk> , who has also worked on Regular Show . Jason Krell of io9 found that the plot for AJ 's Infinite Summer was simple yet flexible . He described its take on life during summer vacation as " charming " and comparable with an " aged @-@ up Phineas and Ferb " . He said that he was amazed by both and that his viewership will be granted for both , should they be picked up as full series . John Lamb of The Forum of Fargo @-@ Moorhead recognized features of Fargo in the pilot , namely the high school , which he found analogous to Fargo South where Jones attended . Meanwhile , Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew expected that the pilot would not have continuity from AJ Goes to France . 
 After the pilot was released , Jones found that people back in Fargo were amused to spot the differences in landmarks between their city and Downer . Jones told Lamb that since he worked in animation , he has been " surrounded by these people that I 've looked up to for years as a fan , and having them tell me they enjoyed it is the greatest thing ever " . As of June 2014 , Jones is still mainly working on Regular Show but said that he would like it very much to have the network commission it as a series . He expressed interest in submitting it at the Fargo Film Festival . The pilot was listed in the ballot for " Outstanding Short @-@ Format Animated Program " at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards , although it did not win . The Long Live the Royals pilot did win in this category , however , and the network later commissioned it as a miniseries of the same name . 
 = HMS Audacious ( 1869 ) = 
 HMS Audacious was the lead ship of the Audacious @-@ class ironclads built for the Royal Navy in the late 1860s . They were designed as second @-@ class ironclads suitable for use on foreign stations and the ship spent the bulk of her career on the China Station . She was decommissioned in 1894 and hulked in 1902 for use as a training ship . The ship was towed to Scapa Flow after the beginning of the First World War to be used as a receiving ship and then to Rosyth after the war ended . Audacious was sold for scrap in 1929 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Audacious @-@ class ironclads were laid out as central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships . They were the first British ironclads to have a two @-@ deck battery with the upper deck guns sponsoned out over the sides of the hull . The ships were fitted with a short , plough @-@ shaped ram and their crew numbered 450 officers and men . 
 HMS Audacious was 280 feet ( 85 @.@ 3 m ) long between perpendiculars . She had a beam of 54 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 m ) and a draught of 23 feet ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) . The ship was first British ironclad to be completed below her designed displacement ; this meant that she was top heavy and required 360 long tons ( 370 t ) of cement ballast to raise her metacentric height . Audacious , and her sisters , were the steadiest gun platforms among the large British ironclads of their era . Audacious was given an experimental zinc sheath for her hull in an attempt to reduce biofouling that proved unsuccessful . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Audacious had two 2 @-@ cylinder horizontal return connecting rod steam engines made by Ravenhill , each driving a single 16 @-@ foot @-@ 2 @-@ inch ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) propeller . The bronze four @-@ bladed Mangin propellers were not arranged in the usual radial cross shape , but rather in two pairs , one behind the other , on an elongated boss in an attempt to reduce their drag when the ship used her sails . They were later replaced by two @-@ bladed Griffiths propellers . Six rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 31 psi ( 214 kPa ; 2 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines produced a total of 4 @,@ 021 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 998 kW ) during sea trials on 21 October 1870 and Audacious reached a maximum speed of 12 @.@ 83 knots ( 23 @.@ 76 km / h ; 14 @.@ 76 mph ) . The ship carried 460 long tons ( 470 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 260 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 330 km ; 1 @,@ 450 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The Audacious @-@ class ironclads were initially ship rigged and had a sail area of 25 @,@ 054 square feet ( 2 @,@ 328 m2 ) . After the loss of HMS Captain in a storm in 1870 , the ships were modified with a barque rig which reduced their sail area to 23 @,@ 700 square feet ( 2 @,@ 202 m2 ) . They were slow under sail , only 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) , partly due to the drag of the twin screws , and their shallow draft and flat bottom meant that they were <unk> when close @-@ hauled . The three ships , Audacious , Vanguard , and Invincible , with balanced rudders were described as unmanageable under sail alone . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 HMS Audacious was armed with ten 9 @-@ inch and four 64 @-@ pounder rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Six of the 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) guns were mounted on the main deck , three on each side , while the other four guns were fitted above them on the upper deck . Their gun ports were in each corner of the upper battery and could be worked in all weathers , unlike like the guns on the main deck below them . The 64 @-@ pounder guns were mounted on the upper deck , outside the battery , as chase guns . The ship also had six 20 @-@ pounder Armstrong guns for use as saluting guns . 
 The shell of the 14 @-@ calibre 9 @-@ inch gun weighed 254 pounds ( 115 @.@ 2 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 12 long tons ( 12 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 11 @.@ 3 inches ( 287 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 16 @-@ calibre 64 @-@ pounder gun weighed 3 @.@ 2 long tons ( 3 @.@ 3 t ) and fired a 6 @.@ 3 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) , 64 @-@ pound ( 29 @.@ 0 kg ) shell that had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 125 ft / s ( 343 m / s ) . 
 In 1878 Audacious received four 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo launchers that were carried on the main deck , outside the armoured battery . When the ship was refitted in 1889 – 90 she received eight 4 @-@ inch breech @-@ loading guns as well as four quick @-@ firing 6 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss and six 3 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns for defence against torpedo boats . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Audacious had a complete waterline belt of wrought iron that was 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick amidships and tapered to 6 inches ( 152 mm ) thick at the bow and stern . It only protected the main deck and reached 3 feet ( 1 m ) above the waterline at full load and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) below . The guns were protected by a section of 8 @-@ inch armour , 59 feet ( 18 @.@ 0 m ) long , with a 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) transverse bulkhead forward and a 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) bulkhead to the rear . The armour was backed by 8 – 10 inches ( 200 – 250 mm ) of teak . The total weight of her armour was 924 long tons ( 939 t ) . 
 = = Service = = 
 HMS Audacious was ordered on 29 April 1867 from Robert Napier in Govan , Glasgow . She was laid down on 26 June 1867 and launched on 27 February 1869 in a gale . The winds caught the rear of the ship as she was about halfway down the slipway and twisted her enough that some plates and frames of her bottom were damaged . The ship was completed on 10 September 1870 and commissioned the following month . She cost £ 256 @,@ 291 to build . 
 Upon completion she became guard ship of the First Reserve at Kingstown , Ireland ( modern Dún Laoghaire ) , but was transferred the following year to Hull where she remained until 1874 . The ship was ordered to the Far East that year to serve as the flagship for the China Station under the flag of Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alfred Phillips Ryder . Despite the presence of escorting tugs , Audacious grounded twice while she was transiting through the Suez Canal . She relieved her sister Iron Duke in Singapore , and later collided with a merchant ship during a typhoon in Yokohama . Iron Duke relieved her in turn in 1878 . Audacious returned to her previous post in Hull in 1879 , relieving HMS Endymion . She served there until she began a lengthy refit which included new boilers and the addition of a poop deck . 
 The ship 's refit was complete in March 1883 and she again relieved Iron Duke as flagship of the China Station later that year . Audacious remained there until 1889 when she returned to Chatham where she was refitted , rearmed and replaced her masts and rigging with simple pole masts fitted with fighting tops . Upon the completion of her refit in 1890 she returned to Hull for the third time until the ship was decommissioned in 1894 . Audacious was relegated to 4th class reserve until her engines were removed and she was converted to an <unk> depot ship in 1902 / 3 . She then acted as depot ship for destroyers at Felixstowe until 1905 , when she paid off ; in April 1904 she had been renamed Fisgard ( after the French translation of the Welsh town Fishguard ) . In 1906 , she was <unk> as part of the four @-@ ship Fisgard boy artificers training establishment at Portsmouth . The ship was towed to Scapa Flow in 1914 after the start of the First World War to be used as a receiving ship and was renamed Imperieuse . In 1919 she was to be renamed Victorious , but the renaming was cancelled . She was towed from Scapa to Rosyth on 31 March 1920 , where she remained as storeship until 15 March 1927 , when sold to Ward of Inverkeithing for scrap . 
 = Shay Given = 
 Séamus John James " Shay " Given ( born 20 April 1976 ) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Premier League club Stoke City and the Republic of Ireland national team . 
 Having surpassed the total of 100 caps required for membership , he is part of the FIFA Century Club . Given gained his first international cap in 1996 and played in goal during every match for his country during the 2002 FIFA World Cup campaign , helping them reach the knockout stage . He was later on the pitch in Paris when the Republic of Ireland were knocked out of the play @-@ offs for a spot in the 2010 FIFA World Cup by France before helping his team qualify for UEFA Euro 2012 . He was selected in Martin O 'Neill 's 23 @-@ man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 but didn 't appear in any of Ireland 's four matches at the tournament . Given is the second most capped Republic of Ireland player ( after Robbie Keane ) . He holds 134 caps and has kept 52 clean sheets as of June 2016 . 
 Given started his career at Celtic , however he never made a first @-@ team appearance and he was released and signed by Blackburn Rovers on a free transfer in 1994 . Given was part of both the Sunderland team who won the Football League First Division title in 1995 – 96 and the Swindon Town team who won the Football League Second Division title that same season , while on loan from Blackburn Rovers . He was signed by Newcastle United in 1997 for a fee of £ 1 @.@ 5 million , and it was there that he began competing to be a first @-@ choice Premier League goalkeeper . Given was part of the teams who came runners @-@ up in the 1998 and 1999 FA Cup campaigns , and was named in the Premier League Team of the Season for 2001 – 02 and 2005 – 06 . He played in the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Cup with Newcastle , and was involved in the club 's title challenge in 2001 – 02 . Although he submitted a transfer request during the 2000 – 01 campaign after losing his position in the starting line @-@ up , it was denied , and Given went on to regain his place . 
 On 1 February 2009 , Given transferred to Manchester City for £ 6 million on a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract . While Given was at Manchester City , the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history after finishing third in the Premier League , as well as winning the FA Cup , though he did not appear in the league in the campaign that City reached the Champions League , nor did he play in the FA Cup . On 18 July 2011 , he joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around £ 3 @.@ 5 million , signing a five @-@ year contract . Four years later , Given joined Stoke City in July 2015 .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Born in Lifford , County Donegal , Given 's footballing career began at local amateur side Lifford Celtic where he shot to notoriety for conceding seven goals on his debut . He was propelled into the limelight when he played in the Football Association of Ireland 's Junior Cup for Lifford Celtic in the semi @-@ final in Dundalk . At 14 , his performances for the club attracted attention from Celtic , and he was invited to train with their youth side during a pre @-@ season tour of Ireland in 1991 . Given signed for the club a year later . Despite being named to the substitutes bench for the Old Firm derby against Rangers on 1 January 1994 , Given never made a first @-@ team appearance . 
 His performances for Celtic 's youth team did bring him to the attention of Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish , and he signed for the English side on a free transfer in the summer of 1994 . 
 = = = Blackburn Rovers = = = 
 The season after Given 's arrival saw Blackburn win the Premier League title and Given was unable to oust first @-@ choice goalkeeper and England international Tim Flowers from the team . He made two loan moves to Swindon Town . Given acted as understudy during his first spell at the Wiltshire club but helped them start their Championship winning Division Two campaign during the 1995 – 96 season . He played in five games for the Swindon before returning to Blackburn at the end of 1995 . Given was sent on loan again in January 1996 , this time to Division One side Sunderland . Given kept 12 clean sheets during his 17 games for the club , and formed part of the team who won promotion to the Premier League as champions . His performances on loan impressed Kenny Dalglish , who had recently been appointed manager of Newcastle United , and prompted him to sign Given again . Given signed for the North @-@ East club in the summer of 1997 for a fee of £ 1 @.@ 5 million . 
 = = = Newcastle United = = = 
 Given was one of the first signings of then @-@ newly appointed manager Dalglish . Given made his debut in Newcastle 's 2 – 1 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday on 9 August 1997 and immediately established himself in the first team , beating fellow goalkeepers Pavel Srníček , Shaka Hislop and Steve Harper to the position . Newcastle advanced to the final of the FA Cup , and Given played the whole match as the team were defeated 2 – 0 by league champions Arsenal . The club also progressed to the final the following year , but Given was replaced by Steve Harper as Newcastle lost 2 – 0 in the final , this time to Manchester United . 
 In November 1997 , Given conceded a strange goal against Coventry City when , after collecting a cross , he rolled the ball out in preparation to make a long clearance . However , he had forgotten that Coventry striker Dion Dublin was still behind him , and Dublin quickly took advantage of the situation by rolling the ball into the empty net . The coincidence of the goalscorer 's name quickly led to the popular word game among football fans that Given " is the only Irishman who doesn 't know where Dublin is " and the goal itself is still regularly featured on lists compiled of bizarre goals . 
 Given submitted a written transfer request in December 2000 , after failing to regain his place in the first @-@ team from Steve Harper after a thigh injury had ruled him out of a match against Leeds United . Manager Sir Bobby Robson stated at the time : " A lot of clubs have a very good goalkeeper and one who stands by . I think we have two keepers — and Harper is proving that — who can play in the Premiership " . The club rejected Given 's request , which was then withdrawn by the goalkeeper , who later stated that his " intention was simply to express [ his ] frustration at being left out of the team , " and that he " never had any intention of actually leaving the club . " An injury to Harper led to Given being recalled to the first team , and he kept his place for the rest of the season . 
 In the 2001 – 02 season , Given played in every Premier League match as Newcastle 's previously unexpected title challenge ended in a fourth @-@ place finish in the league . Given was selected in the PFA Team of the Year and Newcastle 's league position meant that they would enter the qualifying stages of the UEFA Champions League the following season . 
 During the summer he competed in the 2002 FIFA World Cup , but could not prevent the Republic of Ireland being eliminated by Spain after a penalty shoot @-@ out . 
 Given again found himself competing with Steve Harper during the following season . After a 5 – 0 qualifying round win , Newcastle progressed to the group stages of the Champions League . He played in the first three group matches , all of which Newcastle lost . Given found himself out of the team for the next two games , as Harper replaced him in goal . Given returned for the final group match against Feyenoord in the Netherlands , and Newcastle 's 3 – 2 win meant that they qualified for the second round . Internazionale scored four times past Given as Newcastle lost 1 – 4 in their opening match in the second group stage . Newcastle conceded a further three times away to Barcelona , beat Bayer Leverkusen at home and in Germany ( with Given saving an Oliver Neuville penalty in the home tie ) , and drew with Inter at San Siro , however a 2 – 0 loss at home against Barcelona meant that the club finished third in their group and failed to qualify for the knockout stages . Given played every game in the second round . Given played all 38 league games for the club , as well as his 12 European appearances , as the team finished in third place in the Premier League , meaning the club would enter the Champions League qualifying round in 2003 – 04 . 
 Having finished third in the league in May 2003 , Given and Newcastle lost 4 – 3 on penalties to Partizan Belgrade early in the 2003 – 04 season , meaning that Newcastle failed to reach the group stages of the Champions League . The club instead qualified for the UEFA Cup , where they reached the semi @-@ finals . A fifth @-@ place finish in the league meant that the club qualified for the following season 's UEFA Cup competition . Given played in every one of the club 's league matches for a third successive season , as well as all 13 European games . The following year saw Graeme Souness replace Sir Bobby Robson as Newcastle manager after an early spell of poor form . Given overtook Alan Shearer as having played in the most European matches for the club on 16 September 2004 in a game against Bnei Sakhnin , and Given 's 12 European and 3 FA Cup appearances helped Newcastle reach the UEFA Cup quarter @-@ final and the FA Cup semi @-@ final . Given missed two Premier League games as the club finished in 14th place . 
 Although the club entered the Intertoto Cup in 2005 – 06 , a defeat by Spanish club Deportivo de La Coruña meant that they did not qualify for further European competition that season . Given played in all of the club 's league matches as they finished in seventh position and he signed a new five @-@ year contract with the club in the summer . His performances for Newcastle led to Given being named in the Premier League 's Team of the Season . Given played in all of the club 's FA Cup games as they reached the quarter @-@ finals , and captained the team for three games during Alan Shearer 's absence . 
 On 17 September 2006 , Given suffered a one @-@ centimeter tear in his bowel after a tackle by West Ham United striker Marlon Harewood . Doctors likened the injury to one more likely to happen in a car crash . Then @-@ manager Glenn Roeder signed ex @-@ Newcastle veteran Srníček as cover for Harper , and youth goalkeeper Tim Krul played a full match in Newcastle 's 0 – 1 UEFA Cup win at Palermo on 2 November . Given returned on 18 November for Newcastle 's 1 – 1 Premier League draw at Arsenal , and ended the season with 22 league appearances as the club finished in 13th place , and reached the last 16 of the UEFA Cup . Given did make his 400th appearance for the club during the season , however , in a New Year 's Day match . Given 's 2007 – 08 season was prematurely ended by injury in February when he had an occurrence of an old groin injury in the game with Manchester United . 
 The opening months of Newcastle 's 2008 – 09 season were blighted by ownership and managerial turmoil , as well as numerous injury problems . This manifested itself on the pitch as the club struggled to direct itself clear of the relegation zone . On 2 January 2009 , following the 5 – 1 defeat at home against Liverpool , the player 's lawyer released a statement saying that his client was " considering his future " at Newcastle , and requested permission to talk to representatives of Manchester City on 28 January after the club made a bid of £ 5 million which was subsequently rejected . Newcastle manager Joe Kinnear had already stated that the club was " not interested at all in selling him " , and described the amount on offer for Given as " insulting " . However , on 30 January , it was reported that Newcastle had given permission for Given to enter talks with his suitors . After a transfer fee initially reported to be around £ 8 million was agreed between the clubs , Given signed for Manchester City on 1 February , with the transfer window set to close the following day . The news was disappointing for Newcastle fans who felt that Given left the club in a poor situation with many thinking that had Given delayed his decision to leave until the summer then Newcastle would have subsequently survived relegation to the Championship because Given was such a fantastic goal keeper who could have stopped many of the goals that the Toon conceded towards the end of the dreadful campaign . Although the fee for Given was expected to be around £ 8 million , in February 2009 Newcastle United Managing Director Derek Llambias revealed at a supporters panel meeting that Given had been sold for an initial £ 5 @.@ 9 million . Given was 34 games away from breaking Newcastle United 's appearance record held by Jimmy Lawrence . 
 = = = Manchester City = = = 
 On 1 February 2009 Given signed with Manchester City on a four @-@ half @-@ year @-@ contract for £ 6 million . He was formally paraded as a Manchester City player on 5 February 2009 , and was assigned squad number 37 . In the subsequent press conference , he criticised Newcastle 's management for not trying hard enough to keep him at the club . He also said that " By coming here I thought I could be at a club that is challenging for honours . I didn 't want to finish my career regretting not taking up this offer . " Given kept a clean sheet in a man of the match performance in his debut , a 1 – 0 win against Middlesbrough on 7 February . 
 With Joe Hart leaving the club on loan , Given was given the squad number 1 for the 2009 – 2010 season . He made his 400th League appearance on 5 October 2009 against Aston Villa . On 5 December 2009 , he made an outstanding penalty save from Frank Lampard to deny Chelsea an equalising goal . City went on to win 2 – 1 . The same month , Daily Telegraph football correspondent Henry Winter named Given as Premier League Goalkeeper of the Noughties . While team captain Kolo Touré was on international duty , Given was given the captain 's armband by manager Roberto Mancini , who described the Donegal @-@ born player as " one of the five best goalkeepers in the world " . He dislocated his shoulder during a match against Arsenal on 24 April , ruling him out for the rest of the season . On 14 August 2010 , Given was dropped from the Manchester City starting XI for their opening league game against Tottenham and replaced by Joe Hart . Hart became City 's permanent first choice keeper , although Given played enough during the season to receive an FA Cup winners ' medal . Given played only one game for City since being put on the bench – a defeat to West Brom in the League Cup . He challenged Hart to the first choice spot , though missed out . He played two Europa League matches that season as well . 
 = = = Aston Villa = = = 
 On 18 July 2011 , Given joined Aston Villa for a fee believed to be around £ 3 @.@ 5 million . He signed a five @-@ year contract , meaning that he will be 40 when his contract expires . Given made his Villa debut in a pre @-@ season friendly victory over Walsall on 21 July . He was substituted at half time for Andy Marshall , keeping a clean sheet as the score was 2 – 0 to Villa . Given kept another clean sheet on 27 July 2011 in the 2011 Barclays Asia Trophy in Hong Kong in which Aston Villa beat Blackburn Rovers 1 – 0 . This was his second clean sheet in two appearances for Aston Villa . On 13 August 2011 , Given played his first Premier League match for Aston Villa . They played Fulham in a 0 – 0 draw which means he kept his first clean sheet for Aston Villa in his first start for them . In September 2011 , Given was reunited with Terry Gennoe at Aston Villa . After four years out of the game , Gennoe was named as the new first team goalkeeping coach , replacing Rafa Gonzalez . He had previously coached Given at Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United . On 3 December , Given suffered a torn hamstring , leaving him out of the team until January . 
 After a disappointing start to the 2012 – 13 season , Given lost his first team place to Brad <unk> after two league games . However , on 5 January 2013 , he appeared in a 2 – 1 home win against Ipswich Town in the FA Cup third round proper match . Three days later , Given also played for Villa in a 1 – 3 away defeat against Bradford City in the first leg of the League Cup semi @-@ final match . Despite winning the second leg 2 – 1 , Villa were eliminated from the competition . 
 On 15 April 2014 , Given was appointed temporary assistant to Paul Lambert after the club suspended Ian Culverhouse and Gary <unk> , pending an internal investigation for an undisclosed reason . 
 Given played in all of Aston Villa 's 2014 – 15 FA Cup fixtures that led to an appearance in the 2015 FA Cup Final at the age of 39 , which Villa lost 4 – 0 to Arsenal . The cup run began with a 1 – 0 victory over Blackpool , and continued with 2 – 1 victories over both Bournemouth and Leicester City , and a 2 – 0 win over derby rivals West Bromwich Albion . In the semi @-@ final , Villa came from a goal down to defeat Liverpool 2 – 1 , putting the club in their first FA Cup final since 2000 .

He missed most of Stoke 's 2015 – 16 campaign after needing to undergo knee surgery in October 2015 . Given returned towards the end of the campaign and due to injury to Jack Butland he shared goalkeeping duties with Jakob Haugaard .

 Given represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level before earning five caps for the Republic of Ireland national under @-@ 21 team . Although he did not become a regular first team player for Blackburn Rovers , Given 's performances while on loan at Swindon and Sunderland led to him being called up to the Republic of Ireland squad in 1996 . He made his debut for the national team on 27 March 1996 , in a game against Russia . Although Ireland failed to qualify for the 1998 FIFA World Cup or UEFA Euro 2000 , Given established himself as first @-@ choice goalkeeper . He played in all of his nation 's games at the 2002 FIFA World Cup . With draws against Cameroon and Germany and a 3 – 0 win against Saudi Arabia , the team reached the second round of the competition . Meeting Spain in the knockout round , Ireland forced penalties with the score at 1 – 1 at the end of extra time . Three missed penalties for Ireland ended their participation in the tournament , and Spain progressed to the next round . 
 Given was part of the team for most of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign ; however a draw with Switzerland meant Ireland failed to qualify for the finals of the competition in Germany . He equalled Packie Bonner 's record of 80 caps against Slovakia on 28 March 2007 . Given obtained his 100th cap against Montenegro at Croke Park , Dublin on 14 October 2009 in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying game . Ireland reached a qualifying play @-@ off against France , but were controversially eliminated by a goal scored after Thierry Henry handled the ball . 
 Given was part of the team that secured qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 with a play @-@ off victory against Estonia . Given played in the Euro 2012 championship as Ireland were eliminated in the group stage .

 On 13 August 2012 , Given announced on Twitter his decision to retire from international football , describing it as an unforgettable experience to play for his country . Given retired holding the record for the most capped Irishman , though Robbie Keane was closing in on the record . 
 Due to Given 's lack of playing time with his club Aston Villa , there was speculation that he would make himself available for selection as part of Ireland 's 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign . On 14 January 2013 , it was announced that Given was once again available for international selection . 
 On 30 August 2014 , still not having played a league game with Aston Villa , three games into the 2014 – 15 Premier League season , he was selected by Martin O 'Neill in his 27 @-@ man squad for a friendly against Oman and Ireland 's first Euro 2016 qualifier in Georgia . It came after a two @-@ year international absence , after retiring following the disappointing Euro 2012 , where Ireland failed to progress from the group stages . He was one of four goalkeepers in the squad . On 2 September 2014 , Given made his first start for Ireland since the Euros in a 2 – 0 win against Oman . However , he did not start against Georgia in O 'Neill 's first competitive game with David Forde getting the nod . Ireland won 2 – 1 in <unk> thanks to an Aiden <unk> brace . On 18 November 2014 , Given started the 4 – 1 win against the United States in Dublin . 
 On 29 March 2015 , Given regained his place in the starting line @-@ up for the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier against Poland . The game finished 1 – 1 with Shane Long scoring a last minute equaliser .

 = Albany Pine Bush = 
 The Albany Pine Bush , referred to locally as the Pine Bush , is one of the largest of the 20 inland pine barrens in the world . It is centrally located in New York 's Capital District within Albany and Schenectady counties , between the cities of Albany and Schenectady . The Albany Pine Bush was formed thousands of years ago , following the drainage of Glacial Lake Albany . 
 The Albany Pine Bush is the sole remaining undeveloped portion of a pine barrens that once covered over 40 square miles ( 100 km2 ) , and is " one of the best remaining examples of an inland pine barrens ecosystem in the world . " By 2008 it included all parcels of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve ( a state nature preserve spanning 3 @,@ 200 acres ( 1 @,@ 300 ha ) ) , the properties that connect these protected parcels , and some of the surrounding areas that abut the preserve . The 135 @-@ acre ( 55 ha ) Woodlawn Preserve and surrounding areas in Schenectady County are the western sections of the Pine Bush ; they are separated geographically by other properties from the Albany Pine Bush Preserve in Albany County . 
 The Pine Bush has been a historical , cultural , and environmental asset to the Capital District and Hudson Valley regions of New York . Pioneers moving west passed through the pine barrens , which later was crossed by the first passenger railroad in the United States . The Pine Bush is home to the Karner Blue butterfly , an endangered species first identified by author Vladimir Nabokov in 1944 using a type specimen from the Pine Bush . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = European colonization = = = 
 Around 10 @,@ 000 years ago Native Americans moved into the Pine Bush area . When Europeans arrived in the early 17th century , two groups lived in the immediate area : the Mohawk nation of the Iroquois to the west along the Mohawk River , and the Mahican to the east , along the Hudson River . The Dutch traded with both native groups from their outpost at Fort Orange ( present @-@ day Albany ) , which was established in 1624 . For the natives the Pine Bush was an important source of firewood and animal pelts to trade with the Dutch . By 1640 the natives were having trouble finding enough animals in the Pine Bush to supply the growing European demand . The Mohawk referred to the settlement at Fort Orange as <unk> , meaning " beyond the pine plains , " referring to the large area of the Pine Bush between the Hudson and Mohawk rivers . 
 The Dutch granted a patent in 1661 under the name of Schenectady to a settlement on a bend in the Mohawk River to the west of the Pine Bush and about 20 miles from Fort Orange . To the settlers at Fort Orange , the settlement on the Mohawk River started by Arent van Curler was " beyond the pine plains " , and therefore the name Schenectady ( in various spelling connotations ) became associated with the village at that site . In 1664 , the Dutch surrendered their entire colony of New Netherland , including Albany and Schenectady , to the English . 
 What became known as the King 's Highway were a series of foot paths which the Mohawk had long used to get from west in the valley through the Pine Bush to trade with other tribes at the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers . This area was later the site of the Dutch Fort Orange . After the founding of Schenectady , the name was used for what became a major route between the two settlements but , until the mid @-@ 18th century , it was not improved beyond a foot path . During the war from 1699 to 1707 , Albany residents collected firewood from the Pine Bush for the large army that was camped at Fort Frederick . 
 In 1710 , Germans immigrated from Palatine to the Albany area ; some were sent to work camps in the Pine Bush in order to harvest pines for pitch and rosin for the construction of English naval vessels and pay off their passage . Some of these immigrants named the Helderberg Escarpment and settled Schoharie County . Others in 1723 settled further west in the valley , west of Little Falls on the <unk> Patent . ( Most of the latter were from work camps in Dutchess County along the Hudson River . 
 During the French and Indian Wars , the British military improved the road significantly for use by its forces . After the war it was used by numerous settlers moving west into the Mohawk Valley . During the late @-@ 18th century , taverns and the occasional homesteader began to dot the Pine Bush along the King 's Highway , while development began to encroach on the Pine Bush at the Albany and Schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow . The highway and the Pine Bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous even after the end of the war . Starting in 1765 , militiamen took turns escorting travelers through the area to protect them from outlaws , bandits , smugglers , and other dangers . During the American Revolutionary War , the Bush was home to Loyalists of the British Crown . Among the taverns established in the 1760s catering to Pine Bush travelers was the Truax Tavern owned by Isaac Truax , a descendant of French Huguenots and a Tory sympathizer ; he said that he was " not a Tory , but a man for the King " . Rumors circulated of several murders / robberies being carried out at the tavern . 
 Travel became easier in 1793 following the revolution , when a stage coach began carrying passengers between the two cities and through the Pine Bush for three cents per mile . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 The 19th century saw great improvements in modes of transportation for traveling through the Pine Bush with better roads and soon thereafter railroads . Beginning in 1799 the Great Western Turnpike ( today 's US Route 20 ) and the Albany @-@ Schenectady Turnpike ( New York Route 5 ) were built through the Pine Bush . The Western Turnpike connected Albany west across the state to the American Midwest , while the Albany @-@ Schenectady Turnpike replaced the King 's Highway to Schenectady . In 1826 , in order to reduce travel time between Schenectady and Albany along the Erie Canal , the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad was chartered ; it was the first railroad in the state of New York , and the fourth in the United States . On July 2 , 1830 , the DeWitt Clinton became the first passenger train in the United States , traveling over the 16 @-@ mile ( 26 km ) route through the heart of the Pine Bush . 
 Over time , the turnpikes and railroad opened up parts of the Pine Bush to settlement , farming , and land speculation . One of the earliest residents was <unk> <unk> , who owned a large farm and manor in what is now the hamlet of <unk> , just outside Albany in the town of Colonie . He claimed that the sandy soil of the Pine Bush was " the best land for fruits in the world . " Further west , part of the Pine Bush was carved up in 1858 into 860 plots as part of what is now known as the " Great Land Swindle " and sold to buyers outside the region . When they came to inspect their land , they thought the barrens were useless for agriculture ; they tried to recoup their money by selling the land to other unsuspecting outsiders . 
 Pressures through direct settlement and roads for passersby were not the only disturbance of the Pine Bush during the 19th century . These changes cut through and disrupted its habitat . As in the colonial period , the Pine Bush continued to be tapped for its natural resources ; whereas in earlier centuries its primary resources were firewood and wildlife , water was now valued the most . The Patroon Creek , roughly where three feeder streams joined in the heart of the Pine Bush along Albany 's northern border , was dammed in 1850 to form Rensselaer Lake . 
 In 1871 , the northwestern portion of Albany , west from Magazine Street , consisting of mostly undeveloped Pine Bush , was annexed to the neighboring Town of Guilderland after the Town of Watervliet refused annexation of said territory . 
 When portions of this territory were ceded to Albany in 1910 , the current border was established . The law ( Chapter 375 of the Laws of New York , 1910 ) described the Pine Bush as " being a territory lying to the west of the present boundary line of the city and which is in large part waste and unoccupied land , the ownership of which is uncertain . " This law authorized Albany to lay out the newly annexed territory into lots and to acquire land for a park system to connect the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property to the old city border . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 As part of the Great Migration of African Americans out of the rural South to industrial cities in the early 20th century , the Reverend Louis W. Parson and his wife migrated in 1927 from Mississippi to Albany , where he founded the First Church of God in Christ . In four trips to Mississippi , Parson encouraged friends and family to move to Albany and join the church , which many did during the 1930s and 1940s . The reverend felt that the mores of Albany 's South End , where they originally settled , was not conducive to religious life . He started a community in the Pine Bush along Rapp Road , purchasing two 14 @-@ acre ( 5 @.@ 7 ha ) undeveloped properties in 1930 and 1933 . It is a rare example of a chain migration community surviving from the Great Migration . This narrow entity is today designated as the Rapp Road Community Historic District , listed on both the state and the National Register of Historic Places . 
 In 1912 , the city of Albany commissioned a study by notable architect Arnold W. Brunner and landscape architect Charles Downing Lay for beautification of the city ; it was published as Studies for Albany . Brunner and Lay proposed using the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property as the core of a new 1 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 400 ha ) natural park , preferably leaving much of the grounds in their natural state ; " [ i ] n fact the less done to it the better . " The city never acquired more land for a park here , and portions of the original waterworks property were sold off piecemeal and developed over the following century . 
 In the 1950s , the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 ) was built through the Pine Bush , disrupting habitat and ecology . Further development took place in the 1950s and 60s with the construction of the W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus and the SUNY Albany uptown campus . In the 21st century , the remaining Pine Bush represents only about 10 % of the undeveloped land that existed prior to 1950 . 
 In the 1960s , longtime Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd pushed forward the Washington Avenue Extension , a four @-@ lane divided highway extending Washington Avenue westward from Fuller Road through the Pine Bush to New Karner Road ( NY Route 155 ) . This opened the heart of the Pine Bush and the western section of the city to development and has been described as " a knife through the heart of the Pine Bush " . Soon afterward , Neil Hellman , a race horse magnate and major developer in the city , proposed a huge " city within a city " on 390 acres ( 160 ha ) that would have apartments , stores , an office park , one or two schools , and fire and police stations . Mayor Corning estimated between 10 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 persons would live there . Environmentalists and neighborhood groups fought and ultimately defeated this proposal . 
 Mayor Corning gave archaeologist Don Rittner a $ 500 donation in 1972 to excavate the Truax Tavern along the King 's Highway . Rittner disproved the prevailing historical beliefs concerning the sophistication and structure of the tavern . He discovered several skeletons under the tavern 's floor , which may confirm rumors of murders having taken place at the <unk> ref name = Culture / > As a result of this project , Rittner was appointed as Albany 's first municipal archaeologist , possibly the first of such a position in the nation . 
 While Mayor Corning supported the largest purchases of Pine Bush land as a city preserve , he also approved placing the Albany landfill in the Pine Bush , the construction of the Washington Avenue Extension , and authorizing much of the development that occurred during his 42 years in office as mayor . These all had adverse effects on the Bush . In 1967 , a portion of Albany 's waterworks / Pine Bush property in the town of Colonie along Central Avenue was sold to developers who built the Northway Mall . Two years later the city moved its dump to the Pine Bush . The Dunes , a single @-@ family housing development in the middle of the Pine Bush off the Washington Avenue Extension , was built in the mid @-@ 1970s . In response to these developments , concerned citizens worried about the future of the habitat formed Save the Pine Bush in 1978 . The organization filed lawsuits for the next several decades to stop further developments in the barrens . 
 The activist group opposed construction of Crossgates Mall in the town of Guilderland . First proposed in 1978 , it was finished in 1984 . It was expanded to double the original size in 1994 to become the third @-@ largest mall in New York at 1 @.@ 5 million square feet . Widespread regional opposition rose against plans in the late 1990s to increase the size of the Crossgates Mall with over 2 million additional square feet of retail space , plus a 12 @-@ story hotel , and activities such as bowling , ice skating , miniature golf and soccer ; the project was finally dropped in 1999 . 
 In 1985 , a bill to establish a state @-@ controlled preserve to protect Pine Bush lands never made it out of committee . The bill was proposed the following year by Assemblyman Robert Connor ( D ) <unk> City . Among the local politicians who opposed the bill was Albany Mayor Thomas Whalen III , who sparred with Assemblyman Connors in a series of letters . Connors stated , " if the mayor allows the final destruction of the Pine Bush , the city of Albany will be an ancient archaeological ruin before the pine barren is replaced . " Assemblyman Arnold <unk> ( R ) <unk> , whose district included portions of the proposed preserve , opposed on the grounds that the bill was creating another state agency ( like the Adirondack Park Agency ) that would wrest control from local communities over their own development . 
 The legislature established the Albany Pine Bush Preserve Commission in 1988 . Its members consist of representatives of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation , the New York State Office of Parks , Recreation and Historic Preservation , The Nature Conservancy , the towns of Colonie and Guilderland , and the city of Albany , Albany County ; and four private citizens appointed by the governor . In 2001 , the State Employees Federal Credit Union ( <unk> ) bank branch on New Karner Road was taken under eminent domain by the state to be adapted for use as the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center . 
 Located since 1969 in the Pine Bush , the Albany landfill has been expanded several times , the latest by 15 acres ( 6 @.@ 1 ha ) in 2010 . As of 2010 , the landfill is expected to have seven years of operating life remaining . Fees paid by other jurisdictions and businesses enable the landfill to generate $ 4 – 5 million annually to the Albany budget ; city residents are provided with free trash collection . The city committed to spending $ 18 million to restore Pine Bush habitat in exchange for gaining approval of the 2010 expansion . 
 In 1969 , when Albany opened its landfill , the city of Schenectady set aside its only patch of Pine Bush as the Woodlawn Preserve , designating the 135 @-@ acre ( 55 ha ) as a forever wild preserve . Since then , numerous developers have approached the city with proposals for development . In 2009 Schenectady County acted to protect as parkland 24 acres ( 9 @.@ 7 ha ) in the neighboring town of <unk> ; this is part of the Woodlawn Pine Barrens – Wetlands Complex which borders the Woodlawn Preserve . The county deeded this property to the town . This action complemented larger plans to connect the Complex to the larger Pine Bush Preserve in Albany County

 The Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center is a nature center in Albany , New York with exhibits and activities about the Albany Pine Bush Preserve ’ s natural history , geologic and cultural significance . The center offers public programs , programs for school groups , guided hikes , lectures and after school programs . It occupies a former <unk> credit union bank branch on New Karner Road .

 The Pine Bush is within the Hudson Valley section of the Appalachian Valley and Ridge Province in the state of New York , and occupies parts of the city of Albany and the towns of Colonie and Guilderland within Albany County . The Pine Bush includes not only pine barrens , but also grasslands of prairie grasses , northern and southern successional forests , and numerous ravines with some wetlands . The Pine Bush ranges in elevation from 260 feet ( 79 m ) to 360 feet ( 110 m ) above sea level . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock consisting of shale and siltstone , laid down 450 million years ago during the Middle Ordovician . The bedrock is covered by <unk> deposits which make up the sandy <unk> of the barrens . 
 As the glaciers of the Wisconsin glaciation began to recede from the Hudson Valley area , a glacial lake known today as Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake . Along the shoreline of the lake , lacustrine sands were deposited between the present @-@ day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls ; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain . Relieved from the weight of the glacier , the land began to rebound , and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River . The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes . Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes . The Pine Bush originally occupied 40 square miles ( 100 km2 ) , or 60 @,@ 000 acres , at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Flora = = = 
 Less than half of the protected areas of the Albany Pine Bush ( 42 % , or 952 acres ( 385 ha ) ) are currently pitch pine @-@ scrub oak barrens , with an additional 680 acres ( 280 ha ) of disturbed areas with invasive plant growth . As this area is now under protection , it can be restored to the status of pine barrens , especially with the use of controlled burning . The remaining pine barrens are dominated by pitch pine ( Pinus rigida ) , a tall shrub layer consisting of bear oak and dwarf chestnut oak ( Quercus ilicifolia and Quercus <unk> ) , and a low shrub layer composed of <unk> blueberries ( Vaccinium angustifolium and Vaccinium pallidum ) , black huckleberry ( Gaylussacia baccata ) , and sweet fern ( <unk> peregrina ) . Between areas of pitch pine @-@ scrub oak barrens are small patches of grassland dominated by prairie grasses , including big bluestem ( Andropogon <unk> ) , little bluestem ( <unk> scoparium ) , <unk> ( <unk> nutans ) , as well as small trees like the shrubby willows ( Salix humilis and Salix tristis ) . Characteristic flowering plants include bush clover ( <unk> capitata ) , goat 's @-@ rue ( Tephrosia virginiana ) , and wild lupine ( Lupinus perennis ) . 
 Due to prolonged periods of natural fire suppression , much of the Pine Bush has evolved into northern or southern hardwood forests . These forests , often dominated by invasive species , occupy roughly 500 acres ( 200 ha ) of the Albany Pine Bush Preserve . The southern hardwood forests are dominated by black locust ( Robinia <unk> ) , which is exotic , and black cherry ( Prunus serotina ) ; with lesser numbers of native oaks ( Quercus ) and maples ( Acer ) , and the exotic , invasive tree of heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ) . The shrub layer is dominated by black raspberry ( Rubus occidentalis ) and other brambles ( Rubus sp . ) . In contrast the northern hardwood forests are dominated by aspen ( Populus ) , black cherry , red maple ( Acer rubrum ) , white pine ( Pinus strobus ) , gray birch ( Betula <unk> ) , green ash ( Fraxinus <unk> ) , and oaks . 
 Ravines within the Pine Bush contain mixed forests of pine @-@ northern hardwoods and Appalachian oak @-@ pine . The pine @-@ hardwood forests are dominated by species such as white pine and yellow birch ( Betula <unk> ) , mixed with scattered red maple , a shrub layer dominated by witch @-@ hazel ( <unk> virginiana ) , and a herbaceous layer composed of a variety of herbs , mosses , and lichens . The Appalachian oak @-@ pine forest has a tree canopy of one or more oak species , primarily black oak , white oak , and red oak ( Quercus velutina , Quercus alba , and Quercus rubra ) ; these are mixed with pitch pine and some white pine , and a shrub layer dominated by heath shrubs , typically blueberries and black huckleberry . Marshes and wetlands occur along the northern boundary of the Pine Bush and along the bottoms of ravines . Roughly 35 acres ( 14 ha ) of vernal pools have been mapped , these are ground @-@ water fed ponds that are dominated by grasses , sedges , herbs , and low shrubs . 
 The Pine Bush is home to bog bluegrass ( Poa <unk> ) , a Federal Species of Concern , as well as the rare red @-@ rooted flatsedge ( Cyperus <unk> ) , Houghton 's umbrella @-@ sedge ( Cyperus <unk> ) , and Schweinitz 's flatsedge ( Cyperus <unk> ) . Bog bluegrass occurs at the bottom of a ravine in the Pine Bush and is the only place in the New York Bight watershed where this plant appears . Bayard 's <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well . 
 = = = Fauna = = = 
 The Albany Pine Bush is home to hundreds of species of Lepidoptera ( moths ) , including over 40 Noctuidae considered to be pine barrens specialists . The most well @-@ known species in the area is the Karner Blue ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , discovered in the 1940s and named by the author Vladimir Nabokov . The butterfly is now on the Endangered Species List . Once found in large numbers throughout the grassy openings of the pine barrens , it is today extremely rare and found in a handful of sites . Attempts to reintroduce the butterfly focus on the food and host plant for its larvae – the wild blue lupine , which needs frequent forest fires to maintain its habitat . Other regionally rare butterflies include the dusted skipper ( <unk> <unk> ) , Henry 's Elfin ( <unk> <unk> ) , Frosted Elfin ( <unk> <unk> ) , and Edward 's <unk> ( Satyrium edwardsii ) . The inland barrens buck moth ( <unk> <unk> ) is a state @-@ listed special concern animal ; and other rare moths include the broad @-@ lined <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , several noctuid moths ( <unk> purpurea , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) , bird dropping moth ( <unk> <unk> ) , and a <unk> moth ( <unk> ) . The <unk> dagger moth was last seen in the Pine Bush in 1983 and is presumed locally extinct . 
 The Pine Bush is also home to 30 of the 44 species of amphibians and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County . Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York . Three species of salamander , the Jefferson salamander ( Ambystoma <unk> ) , blue @-@ spotted salamander ( Ambystoma laterale ) , and spotted salamander ( Ambystoma maculatum ) , are state @-@ listed special concern animals . Two species of turtle , the spotted turtle ( Clemmys guttata ) and wood turtle ( Clemmys insculpta ) , are also special concern animals . About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush ( according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas ) and are fairly common species for the area . About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush . 
 = Mew ( Pokémon ) = 
 Mew ( <unk> , Myū ) is one of the fictional species of creatures from Nintendo 's and Game Freak 's Pokémon media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri . Mew is a small , pink , Psychic @-@ type Mythical Pokémon . It was added to Pokémon Red and Green by its creator , Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto , as a secret character . As such , its presence has been surrounded by rumors and myths , which contributed to make the Pokémon franchise a success . For years , Mew could not be legitimately obtained in the games except from Pokémon distribution events . 
 Mew 's first film appearance was in Pokémon : The First Movie as a main character alongside Mewtwo . The movie revealed that a fossilized Mew hair , found in the Guyana jungle by a team of scientists , was used to create Mewtwo , a genetically enhanced Mew clone . Mew later appeared in Pokémon : Lucario and the Mystery of Mew as a main character alongside Lucario ; the backstory of the film revolves around Mew 's mysterious history and how it came to be so powerful . Pokémon : The Mastermind of Mirage Pokémon had a mirage Mew appear as a main character in the movie who helped Ash and friends try to defeat the Mirage Master . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 Unlike other characters in the Pokémon franchise , Mew 's development was not overseen by Ken Sugimori , but by Game Freak programmer Shigeki Morimoto . Morimoto programmed Mew into the game secretly , as a prank amongst the staff just prior to its release in Japan , intending it to be a Pokémon only Game Freak staff members would know about and be able to obtain . Mew was added at the very end of the development of Pokémon Red and Blue after the removal of debug features , freeing up just enough space to add the character despite being told not to alter the game any further at this point . Though not intended by the developers to be obtainable , due to a glitch , players were able to encounter it . 
 In the spring of 1996 , Game Freak 's president Satoshi Tajiri used the Japanese manga journal CoroCoro Comic as an experimental exhibition of Mew and distributed the first cards of it for the card game as free giveaways , which surprised many at Game Freak , including Morimoto . Due to the success of the experiment on April 15 , 1996 , Game Freak announced a contest to publicly release Mew to 151 winners . Tajiri described using Mew to create hype around an " invisible character " within the game and to keep interest alive in the title and create rumors and myths about the game passed around by word of mouth , which resulted in increased sales for the game . 
 = = = Design and characteristics = = = 
 Like Mewtwo , Mew is a Psychic @-@ type Pokémon with high stats . Morimoto designed it as a pale pink , with large eyes and a long , thin tail that broadens at the end , though blue specimens have been seen in the games . Its skin is covered with a layer of short , fine hair which may only be viewed under a microscope . Its DNA combines the genetic composition of all existing Pokémon species ; the game states that scientists within the game view it as being the single ancestor of all other Pokémon . It is shy and rarely seen by humans . It is a legendary Pokémon from the first generation , along with Articuno , <unk> , <unk> , and Mewtwo . Mew 's number in the National Pokédex is 151 , the last of the first @-@ generation Pokémon , with 150 being Mewtwo and 152 being Chikorita . In the first generation games and their remakes , the player can find journal entries in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stating that Mew was discovered deep in the jungles of Guyana , South America , on July 5 ( the year is not specified ) , and named on July 10 , and that it " gave birth " to Mewtwo on February 6 . The name Mew is based on the onomatopoeia of a cat 's cry , meow . 
 In the video games , it is possible for Mew to learn any move that can be taught . Other than Ditto and Smeargle ( through the Sketch technique ) , it is the only Pokémon that can transform into other Pokémon using the " Transform " technique . In the anime , it is capable of flight , teleportation , shapeshifting , summoning giant pink bubbles of psychic energy ( which serve various purposes such as closing itself in for protection , acting as a cushion , or simply for Mew 's amusement of bouncing on ) , and rendering itself invisible .

 For a time , Mew could only be legitimately obtained in the Pokémon video games via Nintendo promotional event distributions . Mew was first revealed and made available to the public in the April 1996 issue of CoroCoro Comics . This issue offered a promotion called the " Legendary Pokémon Offer " , where 20 randomly selected entrants could send their cartridges in for Nintendo to add Mew to their games . At Nintendo promotional events soon after the release of Pokémon Red and Blue , players could have it downloaded to their games . This period ended with the release of My Pokémon Ranch , where Mew was accessible legitimately without an event distribution . Mew also appears as one of the Pokémon that can be released from the Poké Ball item in the Super Smash Bros. series . When sent out , it flies away from the stage , usually dropping rare items as it does so . 
 The creature has also long been accessible by the use of glitches or cheating devices . One of the glitches discovered in Pokémon Red , Blue , and Yellow involves exploiting programmed events . Walking into the view of a Trainer , then using a Pokémon 's " Fly " or " Teleport " move ( or " Dig " or the item " Escape Rope " in caves ) to escape the area right before the Trainer notices the player , then battling a Pokémon with the correct Special stat in a different area and immediately returning to the original location starts a battle with a wild Mew .

 The revealing and distribution of Mew through organized events has been noted as a major reason for the series ' success in Japan , with the Japanese " Legendary Pokémon Offer " receiving over 78 @,@ 000 entries , exceeding their initial expectation of 3000 . Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata attributed the success of the games to the " Legendary Pokémon Offer " ; since then , the weekly sales of Red and Green began to match its previous monthly sales , and then becoming three to four times larger . However , Computer and Video Games magazine criticized the exclusivity of Mew to Nintendo events as one of the worst aspects of Pokémon , noting that through the use of cheat devices such as the Pro Action Replay to access Mew , they were rendered obsolete . Many fans of the game bought cheat devices only to obtain it . UGO.com listed Mew sixth on their list of " The 25 Awesomest Hidden Characters " . Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Mew the best Legendary Pokémon and the fifth best Pokémon overall . 
 Due to its balanced statistics and ability to learn any move that comes from a Technical or Hidden Machine , Mew is regarded as one of the best Pokémon in Red , Blue , and Yellow . Studies on the impact of fictional characters on children , such as those in Pikachu 's Global Adventure : The Rise and Fall of Pokémon , have noted Mew as popular with younger female children who tend to be drawn to " cute " characters ; Mewtwo in comparison was described as a polar opposite , popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to " tough or scary " characters . The book Media and the Make @-@ believe Worlds of Children noted a similar comparison , describing Mew as " child @-@ like and gentle , combining characteristics of power and cuteness " and emphasizing the importance of the contrast for children between it and Mewtwo , and its role as a source of appeal for the character . IGN listed Mew as one of the best Psychic types , alongside Mewtwo , Alakazam , and Starmie . They called it a good contender to Mewtwo , as well as an unpredictable Pokémon due to its ability to use any TM or <unk> , items that teach Pokémon attacks . 
 = Þorgerðr <unk> and Irpa = 
 In Norse mythology , Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr and Irpa are divine figures . Þorgerðr and Irpa appear together in Jómsvíkinga saga , Njáls saga and Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds . Irpa does not appear outside of these four attestations , but Þorgerðr also appears in the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , Færeyinga saga , and Harðar saga ok Hólmverja and is mentioned in Ketils saga hœngs . Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr is particularly associated with Haakon Sigurdsson ( d . 995 ) , and , in Jómsvíkinga saga and Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds , she and Irpa are described as sisters . The roles of the Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr and Irpa in these sources , and the implications of their names , has resulted in an amount of scholarly discourse and theory . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr is Old Norse and literally means " Þorgerðr , Hǫlgi 's bride . " According to Skáldskaparmál chapter 42 , Hǫlgi ( a traditional eponym of the northernmost Norwegian province Hålogaland ) is also Þorgerðr 's father . The first name Þorgerðr is a compound of two names , the god name <unk> ( Thor ) , and <unk> — the latter name meaning " fenced in . " 
 The figure 's second name sometimes appears in sources featuring <unk> replaced with <unk> , and , in place of <unk> , the prefixes <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> also appear . It has been suggested that name Þorgerðr derives from the name of the <unk> Gerðr , as Þorgerðr is also described at times as a troll or giantess . Alternatively , Gerðr may simply be an abbreviated version of the name Þorgerðr . Þorgerðr is referred to as Gerðr in <unk> <unk> ’ s 10th @-@ century <unk> on Haakon , quoted in chapter 43 of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar , found in the Heimskringla . 
 John McKinnell states that the name of Þorgerðr 's father is probably a later addition used to explain the origins of the name of Hålogaland , and that " Hǫlgabrúðr " probably means " bride of the ( rulers of ) Hålogaland " and that <unk> , similarly , may mean " bride of the ( rulers of ) <unk> . " <unk> as " bride of the heathen shrines , " and <unk> as either " bride of the people of Holde " or " bride of noblemen . " McKinnell says that the variety of stories and names suggest that the tradition of Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr was wide spread , and that she was venerated in more than one area . 
 The name Irpa may derive from the Old Norse term <unk> " dark brown " , which has led to a number of theories about the goddess . <unk> is thought to derive from the earlier Proto @-@ Germanic word * <unk> . 
 = = Attestations = = 
 Þorgerðr and / or Irpa are attested in the following works : 
 = = = Jómsvíkinga saga = = = 
 Irpa appears in chapter 21 of the Jómsvíkinga saga , which focuses on the late 10th century Battle of <unk> between the fleet of the Jomsvikings under Sigvaldi Strut @-@ Haraldsson and the fleet of Haakon Sigurdsson and Sweyn Haakonsson . Haakon calls a meeting during a lull in the fighting , and says that he feels that the tide of the battle is going against his allies and him . Haakon then goes to an island called <unk> , north of <unk> Bay . On the island , Haakon falls to his knees , and , while looking northward , prays to what is described as his patron goddess , Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr . According to the saga , Þorgerðr repeatedly refuses his offers , but finally accepts the blót of his 7 @-@ year @-@ old son . Haakon 's slave , <unk> , slaughters the boy . Haakon returns to his fleet and presses his men to engage in an attack , and commends his men to ( " Þorgerðr " is here anglicized as " Thorgerd " ) : 
 Press the attack all the more vigorously , because I have invoked for victory both the sisters , Thorgerd and Irpa . 
 Haakon enters his ship , the fleet rows forward for the attack , and battle ensues . The weather becomes thick in the north , the clouds cover the sky , daylight becomes sparse , thunder and lightning ring out , and it begins to rain . The <unk> fleet fights facing the storm and cold , and they have trouble standing due to the heavy wind . The Jomsvikings throw weapons , missiles , and stones at Haakon 's fleet but the winds turn their projectiles back at them . 
 <unk> the <unk> , in the fleet of Haakon , first spots Þorgerðr there and then many others see her . The wind wanes and the men witness arrows flying from the fingertips of Þorgerðr , each arrow killing a man of the <unk> fleet . The Jomsvikings tell Sigvaldi that although they are no longer fighting men alone , they will still do their best . The storm lessens again and once again Haakon invokes Þorgerðr . The saga describes this attack : 
 And then it grew dark again with a squall , this time even stronger and worse than before . And right at the beginning of the squall <unk> the <unk> saw that two women were standing on the earl 's ship , and both were doing the same thing that Thorgerd had done before . 
 Sigvaldi tells his men to retreat , and reasons that this is not what he vowed to fight , especially since there are now two women , whom he refers to as " <unk> " and " trolls . " After the <unk> fleet has been defeated , Haakon 's men weigh the hailstones that had fallen during the storm , to detect " what power " Þorgerðr and Irpa had , and they find that the hailstones weigh an ounce each . 
 = = = Njáls saga = = = 
 Þorgerðr and Irpa are again mentioned together in chapter 88 of Njáls saga , set in the 10th and 11th centuries . Here , Hrapp breaks into the temple owned by Haakon and Gudbrand while Haakon is at a feast at Gudbrand 's home . Hrapp plunders a seated depiction of Þorgerðr ; he takes a large gold ring from her plus the linen hood she is wearing . Next , Hrapp spots a depiction of Thor and Thor 's <unk> . He takes a gold ring from the depiction of Thor too , and , thirdly , he takes a ring from a depiction of Irpa there . Hrapp takes all of the images from the temple , strips them of their items , and then burns the temple until leaving at dawn . 
 = = = Skáldskaparmál = = = 
 Þorgerðr is mentioned in the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál . Here , Hålogaland is described as named after king Hǫlgi , and that he was Þorgerðr 's father . According to Skáldskaparmál , blót were made to them both that included money , and a tumulus was made for Hǫlgi that was built with layers of gold and silver , then covered by a layer of earth and stone . Later in Skáldskaparmál , a list of " troll @-@ wives " is given that includes Hǫlgabrúðr . 
 = = = Færeyinga Saga = = = 
 In chapter 23 of Færeyinga Saga , Haakon asks Sigmund where he puts his trust . Sigmund responds that he puts his trust nowhere but with himself . Haakon responds : 
 " That must not be , " the Earl [ Haakon ] answered , " but thou shalt put thy trust where I have put all my trust , namely , in Thorgerd <unk> , " said he . " And we will go and see her now and seek luck for thee at her hands . " 
 The two then follow a small path through the woods until they come to a house with a stake fence around it . The house is described as beautiful , featuring carvings filled with gold and silver . They enter the house with a few men , and find that it is lit from glass windows in the ceiling , so that the daylight illuminates the room and there are no shadows to be seen due to this . There were depictions of many gods there and a woman who is described as well dressed near the door . 
 The saga relates that Haakon throws himself to the ground before the woman for some time . When he gets up , he tells Sigmund that they should give her an offering , that they ought to lay silver on the stool before her . Haakon says : 
 And we shall have it as a mark of what she thinks of this , if she will do as I wish and let the ring loose which holds in her hand . For thou , Sigmund , shalt get luck by that ring . 
 Haakon takes hold of the ring , and , seemingly to Sigmund , she clasps her hand around it . Haakon does not receive the ring . Haakon casts himself down before her a second time , and Sigmund notices that Haakon is weeping . He stands up again , takes hold of the ring , and finds that it has become loose . Haakon gives the ring to Sigmund , and tells him that he must never part with it . Sigmund gives him his word on it and the men part , each returning to their ships . A storm appears and the two ships are swept apart , and many days are described as passing afterwards . 
 = = = Harðar saga ok Hólmverja = = = 
 In chapter 19 of the saga Harðar saga ok Hólmverja , Grímkell <unk> , a goði closely related to Haakon , goes to the temple ( Old Norse hof ) of Þorgerðr <unk> to ask for a successful marriage for his daughter . When he arrives , the gods are preparing to leave . After an angry exchange with Þorgerðr , who tells him he does not have long to live , Grímkell burns down the hof with all the gods in it . Later that evening , Grímkell suddenly falls dead at dinner .

 In chapter 5 of Ketils saga hœngs , Ketill encounters a troll @-@ woman in the forest . The troll @-@ woman tells him she is traveling to a <unk> @-@ <unk> — an assembly of trolls . Among the major figures who will be present , she continues , are <unk> , the king of the trolls , and Þorgerðr <unk> . 
 = = = Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds = = = 
 In Þorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds , Þorleifr <unk> , known as <unk> ( " the Jarl ’ s skald " ) , recites an abusive and magically aggressive poem in Earl Haakon 's hall . In chapter 7 ( chapter 173 of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar ) , Haakon recovers from his injuries and offers gifts to Þorgerðr <unk> and her sister Irpa , seeking their counsel on how best to take vengeance on Þorleifr . Following their advice , Haakon has a wooden man ( Old Norse <unk> ) built out of driftwood and endows it with a human heart . Haakon and the two sisters then bring the <unk> to life , arm him with a halberd , and send him to Iceland to kill Þorleifr , which he does . 
 = = Theories = = 
 A number of theories surround the figures of Þorgerðr and Irpa : 
 = = = Guardian goddesses = = = 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as examples of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism , and compares their roles to that of the dísir and valkyries . Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland , it would explain Þorgerðr 's last name ( " bride of Helgi " ) and that , subsequently , she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn . <unk> the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell . Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age , that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept , and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life , using the poem Hákonarmál as an example . 
 = = = Þorgerðr and Freyja = = = 
 Davidson further theorizes that Þorgerðr 's name may have originally been Gerðr , reasons that this form is what is found in early skaldic verse , and , further , that this is one of the names given for the goddess Freyja . Davidson points out that Haakon may have later turned to the same goddess soon before he met his death , when he hid in the earth beneath a swine in Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar ( collected in Heimskringla ) chapter 48 , and that this could symbolize a mound of Freyja , one of whose names means " sow " ( Old Norse <unk> ) . Davidson theorizes that the account of Olaf I of Norway dragging Þorgerðr 's image out of its temple after Haakon 's death , and burning it next to a depiction of Freyr ( Freyja 's male twin ) , further supports this view . 
 = = = Irpa = = = 
 Irpa has been proposed as an earth goddess due to the derivation of her name to a word for " dark brown " , but F.R. Schröder has expressed criticism at the notion of concluding that Irpa is an earth goddess based on this evidence . John McKinnell proposes that the Irpa may represent a " dark " aspect of Þorgerðr , in that her name may mean " swarthy , " and that the two were probably of contrasting appearance ; Irpa being unlucky to name and seen as a troll . McKinnell further proposes a connection between Irpa and Hel , stating that the two may have been seen as synonymous . 
 = = = Miscellaneous theories = = = 
 Nora Chadwick ( 1950 ) suggested that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon ’ s wife <unk> and her sister , Guðrún ; and that the figure of the shieldmaiden <unk> in the Gesta may also be an aspect of Þorgerðr . Lotte Motz ( 1993 ) proposed that Þorgerðr was a rare instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship in her own right in heathen Scandinavia . 
 = Arnolfini = 
 The Arnolfini is an international arts centre and gallery in Bristol , England . It has a programme of contemporary art exhibitions , artist 's performance , music and dance events , poetry and book readings , talks , lectures and cinema . There is also a specialist art bookshop and a café bar . Educational activities are undertaken and experimental digital media work supported by online resources . A number of festivals are regularly hosted by the gallery . Arnolfini is funded by Bristol City Council and Arts Council England , with some corporate and individual supporters . 
 The gallery was founded in 1961 by Jeremy Rees , and was originally located in Clifton . In the 1970s it moved to Queen Square , before moving to its present location , Bush House on Bristol 's waterfront , in 1975 . The name of the gallery is taken from Jan van Eyck 's 15th @-@ century painting , The Arnolfini Portrait . Arnolfini has since been refurbished and redeveloped in 1989 and 2005 . Artists whose work has been exhibited include Bridget Riley , Rachel Whiteread , Richard Long and Jack Yeats . Performers have included Goat Island Performance Group , the Philip Glass Ensemble , and Shobana <unk> Dance Company . The gallery reached a new audience in April 2010 , when it was chosen to host one of the three 2010 general election debates . 
 = = History = = 
 Jeremy Rees started Arnolfini with the assistance of his wife Annabel , and the painter John <unk> in 1961 . The original location was above a bookshop in the Triangle in Clifton , Bristol . In 1968 , Rees was able to give up his teaching job and with the aid of private funding and Arts Council funding relocated the gallery to Queen Square , then to E Shed , the current home of the Watershed Media Centre . In 1975 , Arnolfini moved to its present home in Bush House , occupying two floors of a 19th @-@ century Grade II * listed tea warehouse situated on the side of the Floating Harbour in Bristol city centre . The remainder of the building was office space leased out by developers JT Group . 
 The architect of Bush House was Richard Shackleton Pope , who constructed first the south part of the warehouse ( 1831 ) then extended it to the north in 1835 – 1836 . Its original use was as a warehouse for local iron foundry D. , E. & A. <unk> . The building has a Pennant Sandstone exterior with arched ground level entrances and arched windows above . This style of architecture is the first example of the Bristol Byzantine style which became popular in the 1850s . Later conversion to a tea warehouse added <unk> floors . 
 Originally dedicated to exhibiting the work of artists from the West of England , under the directorship of Barry Barker ( 1986 – 1991 ) the gallery moved towards a more general spread of contemporary art . Barker supervised a successful refurbishment of the gallery spaces and café bar by David Chipperfield . Before development work began , the Arnolfini was attracting over 285 @,@ 000 visitors per year . Subsequent Directors have been Tessa Jackson ( 1991 – 1999 ) , Caroline Collier ( 1999 – 2005 ) and Tom Trevor ( 2005 @-@ 2013 ) . 
 As part of a two @-@ year development project that finished in September 2005 , the old warehouse has been fully redeveloped , adding another attic storey . Arnolfini now occupies the lower three floors and basement , and the upper floors are leased to help pay for the running costs . One tenant is the School of Creative Arts , part of the University of the West of England . Funding for this development was received from the National Lottery and the Barker @-@ Mill Trust , set up by long term Arnolfini patron Peter Barker @-@ Mill . The original committee to support Arnolfini included Peter Barker @-@ Mill , Ann Hewer , and Lawrence Ogilvie . 
 = = Name = = 
 The Arnolfini is named after Jan van Eyck 's masterpiece The Arnolfini Portrait ( 1434 ) depicting the merchant and arts patron Giovanni Arnolfini . The Arnolfini Portrait is one of the earliest paintings to assert the presence of the artist within its depiction ( an inscription in the middle of the work and a reflection in a mirror on the back wall ) and one of Arnolfini 's consistent concerns : to explore the role of artist as a witness and recorder of what is around them – contemporary society . The painting is in the National Gallery , London and it was one of the founder 's favourite paintings . 
 = = Today = = 
 Arnolfini has three floors of galleries , a specialist arts bookshop , a cinema which can also be used as a performance space for theatre , live art , dance and music , a specialist arts bookshop , a reading room that provides reference material for all past exhibitions and wide range of books and catalogues , and a café bar . Entrance to the galleries is free of charge . Notable exhibitions have included works by Bridget Riley , Richard Long , Rachel Whiteread , Paul McCartney , Angus <unk> and Louise Bourgeois . Regular events include poetry and film festivals , live art and dance performances , lectures and jazz and experimental music concerts , including Bodies in Flight , Goat Island Performance Group , Akram Khan , the London Sinfonietta , the Philip Glass Ensemble , Random Dance , and Shobana <unk> Dance Company . 
 There is an active access and education programme , hosting visits from students , workshops with artists , presenting interpretative information and offering some work experience placements within the <unk> <unk> is an online experimental web site with dumps of digital media related to Arnolfini exhibitions and events , past and present , which may be reorganised by any online user , utilising resources on the web site to create new works and projects under a copyleft license . Arnolfini also hosts events from outside organisations , including the Encounters Short Film Festival ( along with the Watershed Media Centre ) , Mayfest , the first Festival of British Independent Cinema , the biennial Inbetween Time Festival of Live Art and Intrigue and the Bristol Artists Book Events . In April 2010 , British Sky Broadcasting chose Arnolfini to host the second of the three 2010 general election debates . 
 Arnolfini receives funding from Arts Council England , and Bristol City Council . According to returns lodged with the Charity Commission for the year ending in March 2009 , Arnolfini had 398 @,@ 000 visitors in 2008 / 2009 .

 = History of botany = 
 The history of botany examines the human effort to understand life on Earth by tracing the historical development of the discipline of botany — that part of natural science dealing with organisms traditionally treated as plants . 
 Rudimentary botanical science began with empirically @-@ based plant lore passed from generation to generation in the oral traditions of paleolithic hunter @-@ gatherers . The first written records of plants were made in the Neolithic Revolution about 10 @,@ 000 years ago as writing was developed in the settled agricultural communities where plants and animals were first domesticated . The first writings that show human curiosity about plants themselves , rather than the uses that could be made of them , appears in the teachings of Aristotle 's student Theophrastus at the Lyceum in ancient Athens in about 350 BC ; this is considered the starting point for modern botany . In Europe , this early botanical science was soon overshadowed by a medieval preoccupation with the medicinal properties of plants that lasted more than 1000 years . During this time , the medicinal works of classical antiquity were reproduced in manuscripts and books called herbals . In China and the Arab world , the Greco @-@ Roman work on medicinal plants was preserved and extended . 
 In Europe the Renaissance of the 14th – 17th centuries heralded a scientific revival during which botany gradually emerged from natural history as an independent science , distinct from medicine and agriculture . Herbals were replaced by floras : books that described the native plants of local regions . The invention of the microscope stimulated the study of plant anatomy , and the first carefully designed experiments in plant physiology were performed . With the expansion of trade and exploration beyond Europe , the many new plants being discovered were subjected to an increasingly rigorous process of naming , description , and classification . 
 Progressively more sophisticated scientific technology has aided the development of contemporary botanical offshoots in the plant sciences , ranging from the applied fields of economic botany ( notably agriculture , horticulture and forestry ) , to the detailed examination of the structure and function of plants and their interaction with the environment over many scales from the large @-@ scale global significance of vegetation and plant communities ( biogeography and ecology ) through to the small scale of subjects like cell theory , molecular biology and plant biochemistry . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 Botany ( Greek <unk> - grass , fodder ; Medieval Latin <unk> – herb , plant ) and zoology are , historically , the core disciplines of biology whose history is closely associated with the natural sciences chemistry , physics and geology . A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense , as the study of plants themselves , and botany as applied science , which studies the human use of plants . Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology @-@ classification , anatomy and physiology – that is , external form , internal structure , and functional operation . The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture , forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science , plant pathology , floristry , <unk> , economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany . Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study . Modern molecular systematics , for example , entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy , molecular biology , computer science and more . 
 Within botany there are a number of sub @-@ disciplines that focus on particular plant groups , each with their own range of related studies ( anatomy , morphology etc . ) . Included here are : <unk> ( algae ) , <unk> ( ferns ) , <unk> ( mosses and liverworts ) and <unk> ( fossil plants ) and their histories are treated elsewhere ( see side bar ) . To this list can be added mycology , the study of fungi , which were once treated as plants , but are now ranked as a unique kingdom . 
 = = Ancient knowledge = = 
 Nomadic hunter @-@ gatherer societies passed on , by oral tradition , what they knew ( their empirical observations ) about the different kinds of plants that they used for food , shelter , poisons , medicines , for ceremonies and rituals etc . The uses of plants by these pre @-@ literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classified — their uses were embedded in folk @-@ taxonomies , the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication . The nomadic life @-@ style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10 @,@ 000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region . With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture from one generation to the next . 
 = = = Plant lore and plant selection = = = 
 During the Neolithic Revolution plant knowledge increased most obviously through the use of plants for food and medicine . All of today 's staple foods were domesticated in prehistoric times as a gradual process of selection of higher @-@ yielding varieties took place , possibly unknowingly , over hundreds to thousands of years . <unk> were cultivated on all continents but cereals made up most of the regular diet : rice in East Asia , wheat and barley in the Middle east , and maize in Central and South America . By Greco @-@ Roman times popular food plants of today , including grapes , apples , figs , and olives , were being listed as named varieties in early manuscripts . Botanical authority William Stearn has observed that " cultivated plants are mankind 's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity " . 
 It is also from the Neolithic , in about 3000 BC , that we glimpse the first known illustrations of plants and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt . However <unk> , the first pre @-@ scientific written record of plants , did not begin with food ; it was born out of the medicinal literature of Egypt , China , Mesopotamia and India . Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated , while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans , priests , apothecaries , magicians and physicians , who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity . 
 = = = Early botany = = = 
 Ancient India 
 An early example of ancient Indian plant classification is found in the Rigveda , a collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns from about 3700 – 3100 BP . Plants are divided into <unk> ( trees ) , <unk> ( herbs useful to humans ) and <unk> ( creepers ) , with further subdivisions . The sacred Hindu text Atharvaveda divides plants into eight classes : <unk> ( spreading branches ) , <unk> ( leaves with long clusters ) , <unk> ( bushy plants ) , <unk> ( which expands ) ; <unk> ( those with <unk> growth ) , <unk> ( creeping plants ) , <unk> ( with many stalks ) , and <unk> ( plants with knotty joints ) . The Taittiriya Samhita classifies the plant kingdom into <unk> , vana and <unk> ( trees ) , <unk> ( shrubs with spreading branches ) , <unk> ( herbs ) , <unk> ( spreading plant ) , <unk> ( climber ) , <unk> ( bushy plant ) , <unk> ( creeper ) , and <unk> ( spreading on the ground ) . Other examples of early Indian taxonomy include Manusmriti , the Law book of Hindus , which classifies plants into eight major categories . Elaborate taxonomies also occur in the Charaka <unk> , Sushruta Samhita and <unk> . 
 Ancient China 
 In ancient China lists of different plants and herb concoctions for pharmaceutical purposes date back to at least the time of the Warring States ( 481 BC @-@ 221 BC ) . Many Chinese writers over the centuries contributed to the written knowledge of herbal <unk> . The Han Dynasty ( 202 BC @-@ 220 AD ) includes the notable work of the Huangdi <unk> and the famous pharmacologist Zhang Zhongjing . There were also the 11th century scientists and statesmen Su Song and Shen Kuo who compiled learned treatises on natural history , emphasising herbal medicine . 
 = = = Theophrastus and the origin of botanical science = = = 
 Ancient Athens , of the 6th century BC , was the busy trade centre at the confluence of Egyptian , Mesopotamian and Minoan cultures at the height of Greek colonisation of the Mediterranean . The philosophical thought of this period ranged freely through many subjects . Empedocles ( 490 – 430 BC ) foreshadowed Darwinian evolutionary theory in a crude formulation of the mutability of species and natural selection . The physician Hippocrates ( 460 – 370 BC ) avoided the prevailing superstition of his day and approached healing by close observation and the test of experience . At this time a genuine non @-@ anthropocentric curiosity about plants emerged . The major works written about plants extended beyond the description of their medicinal uses to the topics of plant geography , morphology , physiology , nutrition , growth and reproduction . 
 Foremost among the scholars studying botany was Theophrastus of <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ; c . 371 – 287 BC ) who has been frequently referred to as the " Father of Botany " . He was a student and close friend of Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BC ) and succeeded him as head of the Lyceum ( an educational establishment like a modern university ) in Athens with its tradition of peripatetic philosophy . Aristotle 's special treatise on plants — <unk> <unk> φυτῶν — is now lost , although there are many botanical observations scattered throughout his other writings ( these have been assembled by Christian Wimmer in <unk> <unk> Fragmenta , 1836 ) but they give little insight into his botanical thinking . The Lyceum prided itself in a tradition of systematic observation of causal connections , critical experiment and rational theorizing . Theophrastus challenged the superstitious medicine employed by the physicians of his day , called <unk> , and also the control over medicine exerted by priestly authority and tradition . Together with Aristotle he had tutored Alexander the Great whose military conquests were carried out with all the scientific resources of the day , the Lyceum garden probably containing many botanical trophies collected during his campaigns as well as other explorations in distant lands . It was in this garden where he gained much of his plant knowledge . 
 Theophrastus 's major botanical works were the Enquiry into Plants ( Historia Plantarum ) and Causes of Plants ( Causae Plantarum ) which were his lecture notes for the Lyceum . The opening sentence of the Enquiry reads like a botanical manifesto : " We must consider the distinctive characters and the general nature of plants from the point of view of their morphology , their behaviour under external conditions , their mode of generation and the whole course of their life " . The Enquiry is 9 books of " applied " botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany , examining the techniques of agriculture ( relationship of crops to soil , climate , water and habitat ) and horticulture . He described some 500 plants in detail , often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution , and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern @-@ day plant families . Some names he used , like Crataegus , <unk> and Asparagus have persisted until today . His second book Causes of Plants covers plant growth and reproduction ( akin to modern physiology ) . Like Aristotle he grouped plants into " trees " , " undershrubs " , " shrubs " and " herbs " but he also made several other important botanical distinctions and observations . He noted that plants could be annuals , perennials and biennials , they were also either monocotyledons or dicotyledons and he also noticed the difference between determinate and indeterminate growth and details of floral structure including the degree of fusion of the petals , position of the ovary and more . These lecture notes of Theophrastus comprise the first clear exposition of the rudiments of plant anatomy , physiology , morphology and ecology — presented in a way that would not be matched for another eighteen centuries . 
 Meanwhile , the study of medicinal plants was not being neglected and a full synthesis of ancient Greek pharmacology was compiled in Materia Medica c . 60 AD by Pedanius Dioscorides ( c . 40 @-@ 90 AD ) who was a Greek physician with the Roman army . This work proved to be the definitive text on medicinal herbs , both oriental and occidental , for fifteen hundred years until the dawn of the European Renaissance being slavishly copied again and again throughout this period . Though rich in medicinal information with descriptions of about 600 medicinal herbs , the botanical content of the work was extremely limited . 
 = = = Ancient Rome = = = 
 The Romans contributed little to the foundations of botanical science laid by the ancient Greeks , but made a sound contribution to our knowledge of applied botany as agriculture . In works titled De Re <unk> four Roman writers contributed to a compendium Scriptores Rei <unk> , published from the Renaissance on , which set out the principles and practice of agriculture . These authors were Cato ( 234 – 149 BC ) , Varro ( 116 – 27 BC ) and , in particular , Columella ( 4 – 70 AD ) and Palladius ( 4th century AD ) . Roman encyclopaedist Pliny the Elder ( 23 – 79 AD ) deals with plants in Books 12 to 26 of his 37 @-@ volume highly influential work Naturalis Historia in which he frequently quotes Theophrastus but with a lack of botanical insight although he does , nevertheless , draw a distinction between true botany on the one hand , and farming and medicine on the other . 
 It is estimated that at the time of the Roman Empire between 1300 and 1400 plants had been recorded in the West .

 In Western Europe , after Theophrastus , botany passed through a bleak period of 1800 years when little progress was made and , indeed , many of the early insights were lost . As Europe entered the Middle Ages ( 5th to 15th centuries ) , a period of disorganised feudalism and indifference to learning , China , India and the Arab world enjoyed a golden age . Chinese philosophy had followed a similar path to that of the ancient Greeks . The Chinese dictionary @-@ encyclopaedia <unk> Ya probably dates from about 300 BC and describes about 334 plants classed as trees or shrubs , each with a common name and illustration . Between 100 and 1700 AD many new works on pharmaceutical botany were produced including encyclopaedic accounts and treatises compiled for the Chinese imperial court . These were free of superstition and myth with carefully researched descriptions and nomenclature ; they included cultivation information and notes on economic and medicinal uses — and even elaborate monographs on ornamental plants . But there was no experimental method and no analysis of the plant sexual system , nutrition , or anatomy . 
 The 400 @-@ year period from the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance , a time when Islamic culture and science thrived . Greco @-@ Roman texts were preserved , copied and extended although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants . Kurdish biologist <unk> <unk> <unk> ibn <unk> Dīnawarī ( 828 – 896 AD ) is known as the founder of Arabic botany ; his <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( ‘ Book of Plants ’ ) describes 637 species , discussing plant development from germination to senescence and including details of flowers and fruits . The <unk> philosopher and physician Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) ( c . 980 – 1037 AD ) was another influential figure , his The Canon of Medicine being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the Enlightenment . 
 In India simple artificial plant classification systems of the Rigveda , Atharvaveda and Taittiriya Samhita became more botanical with the work of Parashara ( c . 400 – c . 500 AD ) , the author of <unk> ( the science of life of trees ) . He made close observations of cells and leaves and divided plants into <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . The dicotyledons were further classified into groupings ( ganas ) akin to modern floral families : <unk> ( Fabaceae ) , <unk> ( Rutaceae ) , <unk> ( Cruciferae ) , <unk> ( Cucurbitaceae ) , <unk> ( Apocynaceae ) , and <unk> ( Asteraceae ) . Important medieval Indian works of plant physiology include the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> . 
 = = = The Silk Road = = = 
 Following the fall of Constantinople ( 1453 ) , the newly expanded Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital , which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire . In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous two thousand years , mainly as bulbs . Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value . Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge , especially Venice , which traded extensively with the East . From there these new plants rapidly spread to the rest of Western Europe . 
 = = = The Age of Herbals = = = 
 In the European Middle Ages of the 15th and 16th centuries the lives of European citizens were based around agriculture but when printing arrived , with movable type and woodcut illustrations , it was not treatises on agriculture that were published , but lists of medicinal plants with descriptions of their properties or " virtues " . These first plant books , known as herbals showed that botany was still a part of medicine , as it had been for most of ancient history . Authors of herbals were often curators of university gardens , and most herbals were derivative compilations of classic texts , especially De Materia Medica . However , the need for accurate and detailed plant descriptions meant that some herbals were more botanical than medicinal . German Otto Brunfels 's ( 1464 – 1534 ) Herbarum <unk> Icones ( 1530 ) contained descriptions of about 47 species new to science combined with accurate illustrations . His fellow countryman Hieronymus Bock 's ( 1498 – 1554 ) <unk> of 1539 described plants he found in nearby woods and fields and these were illustrated in the 1546 edition . However , it was Valerius Cordus ( 1515 – 1544 ) who pioneered the formal botanical description that detailed both flowers and fruits , some anatomy including the number of chambers in the ovary , and the type of ovule placentation . He also made observations on pollen and distinguished between inflorescence types . His five @-@ volume Historia Plantarum was published about 18 years after his early death aged 29 in 1561 @-@ 1563 . In Holland Rembert Dodoens ( 1517 – 1585 ) , in Stirpium Historiae ( 1583 ) , included descriptions of many new species from the Netherlands in a scientific arrangement and in England William Turner ( 1515 – 1568 ) in his Libellus De Re <unk> Novus ( 1538 ) published names , descriptions and localities of many native British plants . 
 Herbals contributed to botany by setting in train the science of plant description , classification , and botanical illustration . Up to the 17th century botany and medicine were one and the same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias ; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras . These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras . The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine . 
 = = The Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment ( 1550 – 1800 ) = = 
 The revival of learning during the European Renaissance renewed interest in plants . The church , feudal aristocracy and an increasingly influential merchant class that supported science and the arts , now jostled in a world of increasing trade . Sea voyages of exploration returned botanical treasures to the large public , private , and newly established botanic gardens , and introduced an eager population to novel crops , drugs and spices from Asia , the East Indies and the New World . 
 The number of scientific publications increased . In England , for example , scientific communication and causes were facilitated by learned societies like Royal Society ( founded in 1660 ) and the Linnaean Society ( founded in 1788 ) : there was also the support and activities of botanical institutions like the Jardin du Roi in Paris , Chelsea Physic Garden , Royal Botanic Gardens Kew , and the Oxford and Cambridge Botanic Gardens , as well as the influence of renowned private gardens and wealthy entrepreneurial nurserymen . By the early 17th century the number of plants described in Europe had risen to about 6000 . The 18th century Enlightenment values of reason and science coupled with new voyages to distant lands instigating another phase of encyclopaedic plant identification , nomenclature , description and illustration , " flower painting " possibly at its best in this period of history . Plant trophies from distant lands decorated the gardens of Europe 's powerful and wealthy in a period of enthusiasm for natural history , especially botany ( a preoccupation sometimes referred to as " <unk> " ) that is never likely to recur . 
 During the 18th century botany was one of the few sciences considered appropriate for genteel educated women . Around 1760 , with the popularization of the Linnaean system , botany became much more widespread among educated women who painted plants , attended classes on plant classification , and collected herbarium specimens although emphasis was on the healing properties of plants rather than plant reproduction which had overtones of sexuality . Women began publishing on botanical topics and children 's books on botany appeared by authors like Charlotte Turner Smith . Cultural authorities argued that education through botany created culturally and scientifically aware citizens , part of the thrust for ' improvement ' that characterised the Enlightenment . However , in the early 19th century with the recognition of botany as an official science women were again excluded from the discipline . 
 = = = Botanical gardens and herbaria = = = 
 Public and private gardens have always been strongly associated with the historical unfolding of botanical science . Early botanical gardens were physic gardens , repositories for the medicinal plants described in the herbals . As they were generally associated with universities or other academic institutions the plants were also used for study . The directors of these gardens were eminent physicians with an educational role as " scientific gardeners " and it was staff of these institutions that produced many of the published herbals . 
 The botanical gardens of the modern tradition were established in northern Italy , the first being at Pisa ( 1544 ) , founded by Luca Ghini ( 1490 – 1556 ) . Although part of a medical faculty , the first chair of materia medica , essentially a chair in botany , was established in Padua in 1533 . Then in 1534 , Ghini became Reader in materia medica at Bologna University , where Aldrovandi established a similar garden in 1568 ( see below ) . Collections of pressed and dried specimens were called a hortus siccus ( garden of dry plants ) and the first accumulation of plants in this way ( including the use of a plant press ) is attributed to Ghini . Buildings called herbaria housed these specimens mounted on card with descriptive labels . Stored in cupboards in systematic order they could be preserved in perpetuity and easily transferred or exchanged with other institutions , a taxonomic procedure that is still used today . 
 By the 18th century the physic gardens had been transformed into " order beds " that demonstrated the classification systems that were being devised by botanists of the day — but they also had to accommodate the influx of curious , beautiful and new plants pouring in from voyages of exploration that were associated with European colonial expansion . 
 = = = From Herbal to Flora = = = 
 Plant classification systems of the 17th and 18th centuries now related plants to one another and not to man , marking a return to the non @-@ anthropocentric botanical science promoted by Theophrastus over 1500 years before . In England , various herbals in either Latin or English were mainly compilations and translations of continental European works , of limited relevance to the British Isles . This included the rather unreliable work of Gerard ( 1597 ) . The first systematic attempt to collect information on British plants was that of Thomas Johnson ( 1629 ) , who was later to issue his own revision of Gerard 's work ( 1633 – 1636 ) .
