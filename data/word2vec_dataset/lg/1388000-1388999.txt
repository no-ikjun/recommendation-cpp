 On 8 July 2012 , the Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Television ( SVT ) announced that Malmö Arena in Malmö would be the host venue for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest . This was the fifth time after 1975 , 1985 , 1992 and 2000 that the competition was held in Sweden and the second time , after 1992 , that it was held in Malmö . SVT had expressed the desire to host the contest at a slightly smaller venue than previous years , as well as smaller environment which is easier to dedicate and decorate for other celebrations and festivities of the event within the host city . This were factors in the choice of Malmö Arena as the host venue , and Malmö as Sweden 's third @-@ largest city by population after Stockholm and Gothenburg , the two other initial location @-@ bidders . 
 SVT made the advance decision to allocate Denmark at one semi @-@ final and Norway at the other , in consideration for the number of Danish and Norwegian fans likely to come , with the arena being relatively small and so not suitable for accommodating both countries ' fans at one semi @-@ final event . Øresund bridge was eventually also used as the main artistic medium for the theme of the contest , as an expression of binding cultures .

 On the night of the final for the 2012 Contest , the chief executive of SVT , Eva Hamilton , stated to the Swedish media that various venues in Stockholm , Gothenburg and Malmö were being considered for hosting the 2013 Contest . One alternative put forward in the Expressen , was to hold the competition at three different venues – the semi @-@ finals in Gothenburg and Malmö , and the final in Stockholm . This proposal was dismissed as unfeasible by SVT , which declared that the contest would be hosted in only one city . 
 On 20 June 2012 , it was announced that Gothenburg had withdrawn from the bidding process due to the city being the host of the Göteborg Horse Show in late April 2013 . There were also concerns about the availability of hotel rooms due to a variety of other events taking place in the same time frame as the Eurovision Song Contest . The executive producer for the 2013 Contest , Martin <unk> , told Swedish press that he did not like the decisions made by previous hosts to hold the contest in larger arenas , stating that he and SVT wanted the 2013 Contest to be " more close and personal " . SVT also claimed that the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) wanted the 2013 Contest to be " smaller " due to the escalating costs of previous contests . 
 The following candidate cities had provisionally reserved venues and hotel rooms , as part of their bids to host the 2013 Contest . On 8 July 2012 , Malmö Arena was confirmed as the host venue for the contest . Malmö Arena is Sweden 's fourth @-@ largest indoor arena , after Friends Arena , <unk> Arena and Ericsson Globe , all located in Stockholm .

 The combination of televoting and jury voting results underwent changes that were detailed in the official rules for the 2013 contest . Each member of a respective nation 's jury was required to rank every song , except that of their own country . The voting results from each member of a particular nation 's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place . Likewise , the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking , taking into account the full televoting result rather than just the top ten . The combination of the jury 's full ranking and the televote 's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries . The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points , while the tenth @-@ best ranked song received 1 @-@ point . It was announced in the official Media Handbook that an official app would also be available for voters to vote via during the contest . 
 Official sponsors of the broadcast were the main Swedish @-@ Finnish telecommunication company <unk> , and the German cosmetics company Schwarzkopf . The competition sponsors were the makeup company <unk> cosmetics , the supermarket ICA and Tetra Pak . 
 The singer and actress Sarah Dawn Finer also appeared in both semifinals and the final in sketches as the comic character Lynda Woodruff . " Lynda " presented the votes for Sweden at the previous contest in Baku . Finer also appeared in the final as herself performing the ABBA song " The Winner Takes It All " before the results were announced . The footballer Zlatan Ibrahimović was revealed on 28 April to be part of the opening segment of the Eurovision final , in a pre @-@ recorded message welcoming viewers to his home city of Malmö . The 2011 Swedish entrant Eric Saade was the host of the green room during the final . 
 = = = Semi @-@ final allocation draw = = = 
 The draw that determined the semi @-@ final allocation was held on 17 January 2013 at the Malmö City Hall . A draw at the EBU headquarters determined that , due to their geographical proximity with Malmö , Denmark would perform in the first semi @-@ final , while Norway would perform in the second semi @-@ final . This provided a maximum availability of tickets for visitors from both countries . The EBU also allocated Israel to the second semi @-@ final after a request from the delegation in order to avoid complications with a national holiday coinciding with the date of the first semifinal . The remaining participating countries , excluding the automatic finalists ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom ) , were split into five pots , based on voting patterns from the previous nine years . From these pots , 15 ( in addition to Denmark ) were allocated to compete in the first semi @-@ final on 14 May 2013 and 15 ( in addition to Norway and Israel ) were allocated to compete in the second semi @-@ final on 16 May 2013 . 
 The pots were calculated by the televoting partner <unk> and were as follows :

 Unlike previous years , the running order was not decided by the drawing of lots , but instead by the producers , with the aim of making the shows more exciting and ensuring that all contestants had a chance to stand out , preventing entries that are too similar cancelling each other out . The decision elicited mixed reactions from both fans of the contest and participating broadcasters . 
 The running order for the semi @-@ finals was released on 28 March 2013 . The running order for the final was determined on 17 May 2013 . An additional allocation draw occurred for the final with each finalist nation drawing to perform either in the first or second half of the final . The allocation draw for qualifying countries from the semi @-@ finals occurred during the semi @-@ final winners ' press conferences following each semi @-@ final , while the allocation draw for the Big Five countries ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) occurred during their first individual press conferences on 15 May 2013 . As the host country , the running order position for Sweden in the final was exclusively determined by a draw during the heads of delegation meeting on 18 March 2013 . Sweden was drawn to perform 16th in the final . 
 = = = Graphic design = = = 
 As aforesaid , SVT wanted to make a good use of Malmo Arena 's space to highlight the performances and increase the audience 's visibility compared to previous years . SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher @-@ lower shifted floors , connected by a trail closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage . The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova 's performance towards its finish , as a movable part beneath the singer 's dress making her look gradually taller . The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom 's performance towards its finish , lifted above the close @-@ standing audience . 
 On 17 January 2013 , at the semi @-@ final allocation draw , the EBU revealed the graphic design , created by the Gothenburg @-@ based branding agency Happy F & B for the 2013 contest , featuring a butterfly and slogan " We Are One " . The butterfly featured an array of colours and textures , it also represented something small which can start powerful and big movements , a phenomenon known as the butterfly effect , indicating that a flap from one butterfly can start a hurricane . 
 SVT confirmed on 19 February 2013 that the postcard films , used to introduce each song in the contest , would feature each artist in their respective country , to give the viewer a personal insight of each competing participant . This broke with recent tradition of the postcards often containing short segments of life within either the host city or country of the contest . They were produced by a company called Camp David . The on @-@ air graphics were produced by Broken Doll , a production company . The animation of the many butterflies was done by the visual effects studio Swiss International . For example , Sweden 's postcard features Robin and his friends at a funfair , having fun and meeting fans , while Ireland 's postcard shows Ryan together with his family . In addition to the graphic design , there was a theme music for the contest entitled " Wolverine " composed by Adam <unk> , which was used in the intros and in @-@ between commercial breaks .

 On 11 July 2012 , the show producer Christer Björkman advised the public not to buy tickets for the 2013 Contest that are currently in circulation and instead to wait for tickets to be released through official channels . Björkman said that official tickets had not yet been released , as necessary decisions over the stage and seating plans had not yet been made . Björkman also gave reassurance that accommodation would be available , as while the organizers had booked a large quantity of hotel rooms , some may be made available to the general public . On 21 November 2012 , SVT officially announced the launch of ticket sales . 
 On 17 October 2012 , the executive producer Martin <unk> told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter that SVT plans for the 2013 Contest to have only one presenter for the entire contest , unlike previous years where there were up to three presenters per show . The last time there was just one presenter was in the 1995 Contest , in Dublin , Ireland , when the solo host was Mary Kennedy . Petra Mede was announced as the host for the 2013 contest on 28 January 2013 .

 Prior to the finals , the Lithuanian media outlet 15 min released an undercover video suggesting that representatives from Azerbaijan were trying to bribe Lithuanians for votes in the tele / <unk> . The video detailed the plan , which involved recruiting groups of 10 people each , and supplying them with SIM cards so they could vote multiple times during the voting window in the tele / <unk> . It was also suggested that similar activity was taking place in a total of 15 countries including Latvia , Estonia , Belarus , Ukraine , Croatia and Switzerland . In response to the allegations , Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand reaffirmed the contest 's commitment to a " fair and transparent result . " He stated that while Eurovision organisers were looking into the case , they " [ emphasised ] that the intention of these individuals have not yet been clarified , and nor has a link been established between the individuals in the video and the Azeri delegation , the Azeri act or the Azeri EBU member <unk> TV . " He added that , since 1998 , when he was first involved with the contest , " every year there are rumors about irregularities in the voting " . 
 The EBU later confirmed an attempt of cheating in the contest , which was unsuccessful according to EBU as the EBU 's system prevent fraud . According to the EBU , there is no evidence that any broadcaster has been involved in cheating . The rules were changed the next year to ensure that all broadcasters would be responsible for preventing fraud to their advantage or face a three @-@ year suspension if fraud is revealed . However , in May 2015 a member of The Eurovision Song Contest Reference Group confirmed that Azerbaijan had cheated and that it was organized and very expensive . 
 When Azerbaijan officially awarded no points to Dina <unk> of Russia , despite <unk> having reportedly come second in the country 's phone poll , the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev ordered an inquiry . The Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed that the result had been falsified , and stated that " this outrageous action will not remain without a response " . He promised a co @-@ ordinated response with his Azerbaijani counterpart Elmar <unk> . Simultaneously , the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko claimed that his own country having received no points from Russia showed that the result must have been falsified . In June 2013 , UK entrant Bonnie Tyler also claimed she overheard Russians complaining that Azerbaijan did not " give us the ten points we paid for .

Local residents interviewed in a 2007 newspaper article in the Richmond Times @-@ Dispatch noted that " not much changed " nearly a decade after Vick left . One resident said that there was drug dealing , drive @-@ by shootings and other killings in the neighborhood , and suggested that sports were a way out and a dream for many .

As a senior , he passed for 1 @,@ 668 yards , accounting for ten passing and ten rushing touchdowns . During one game , he ran for six touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns . 
 Reamon , who had helped guide Brooks from Newport News to the University of Virginia , helped Michael with his SATs and helped him and his family choose between Syracuse University and Virginia Tech . Reamon favored Virginia Tech , where he felt better guidance was available under Frank Beamer , who promised to redshirt him and provide the freshman needed time to develop . Reamon sold Michael on the school 's proximity to family and friends , and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech . As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998 with a college football scholarship in hand , Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a success story .

 In his first collegiate game as a redshirt freshman against James Madison in 1999 , Vick scored three rushing touchdowns in just over one quarter of play .

During the season , Vick led a last @-@ minute game @-@ winning drive against West Virginia in the annual Black Diamond Trophy game . He led the Hokies to an undefeated season ( 11 – 0 win @-@ loss record ) and to the Bowl Championship Series national title game in the Nokia Sugar Bowl against Florida State .

 The following game against Pittsburgh , Vick was injured and had to miss the rest of the game . He also missed games against Central Florida , and was unable to start against the Miami Hurricanes , who handed Virginia Tech their only loss of the season . Vick 's final game while playing for Virginia Tech was against the Clemson Tigers in the Toyota Gator Bowl ; Virginia Tech won and Vick was named the game 's MVP . Vick left Virginia Tech after his redshirt sophomore season . Aware that the rest of his family was still living in their 3 bedroom apartment in the Ridley Circle Homes , Vick stated that he was going to buy his mother " a home and a car . " ESPN later reported that Vick used some of his NFL and endorsement earnings to buy his mother a brand @-@ new house in an upscale section of Suffolk , Virginia .

 At his Pro Day workout , Vick ran the 40 @-@ yard dash in 4 @.@ 33 seconds ; his time has been clocked as low as 4 @.@ 25 , the fastest @-@ ever for an NFL quarterback . Vick was selected first in the 2001 NFL Draft by the Atlanta Falcons , becoming the first African @-@ American quarterback to be taken with the top pick .

He tied for third in team history for the lowest interception @-@ to @-@ interception ratio in a season . He had a streak of 177 passes without an interception as the Falcons finished with a 9 – 6 – 1 win @-@ loss @-@ tie record and reached the playoffs . On January 4 , 2003 , Vick led the Falcons to an upset victory over the heavily favored Green Bay Packers 27 – 7 in the first playoff round . The Falcons lost 20 – 6 to the Donovan McNabb @-@ led Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football Conference divisional playoff game the following week .

On October 31 , 2004 in a game against the Denver Broncos , he became the first quarterback to throw for more than 250 yards and rush for over 100 yards in the same game . Vick set an NFL postseason record for a quarterback with 119 rushing yards in the first round of the 2004 NFL playoffs ; Atlanta beat the St. Louis Rams in that game , but lost the following week to the Philadelphia Eagles in the conference championship game .

Despite Vick 's record @-@ setting season , the Falcons finished with a 7 – 9 record and again missed the playoffs . 
 = = = Suspension = = = 
 In August 2007 , hours after Vick pleaded guilty to federal charges in the Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation , the NFL suspended him indefinitely without pay for violating its player conduct policy . In a letter to Vick , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the quarterback had admitted to conduct that was " not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible . " While Vick was technically a first @-@ time offender under the league 's personal conduct policy , Goodell handed down a harsher suspension because Vick admitted he provided most of the money for the gambling side of the dog fighting operation . Goodell left open the possibility of reinstating Vick depending on how he cooperated with federal and state authorities . Goodell had barred Vick from reporting to training camp while the league conducted its own investigation into the matter . At his July 26 arraignment , the terms of his bail barred him from leaving Virginia before the trial . 
 On August 27 , Falcons owner Arthur Blank said at a press conference that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick 's signing bonus . He said the team had no immediate plans to cut ties with Vick , citing salary @-@ cap issues . It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick , since he ruled that Vick 's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract . On August 29 , the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $ 20 million of his $ 37 million bonus . The case was sent to arbitration , and on October 10 an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $ 19 @.@ 97 million . The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons ' contention that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004 , and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation . 
 In February 2009 , the Falcons revealed that they were exploring trading Vick to another NFL team . Atlanta general manager Thomas <unk> said NFL rules allowed teams to trade the contractual rights to suspended players . The Falcons released Vick in early June , however , making him an unrestricted free agent . 
 = = = Philadelphia Eagles = = = 
 After his release from prison , Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy . The prospect of his return to professional football was the subject of much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued . In 2007 , ESPN 's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking a chance on Vick , and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash . There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League , he said . Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension , the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL . In any case , Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa . He did think , however , that Vick would be " unstoppable " if he decided to play in the Arena Football League . 
 Vick signed a one @-@ year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on August 13 , 2009 . The contract was worth $ 1 @.@ 6 million , with no money guaranteed . It contained a team option for the 2010 season worth $ 5 million . Vick was allowed to participate in all team practices and meetings as well as the Eagles ' last two preseason games . He was eligible to play in the third week of the regular season . Starting quarterback Donovan McNabb told reporters he gave coach Andy Reid the idea to sign Vick . 
 Vick was activated to the 53 @-@ man roster in mid @-@ September and played sparingly for the rest of the season as McNabb 's backup . In week 13 against the Falcons , Vick both threw and ran for a touchdown , his first scores since December 2006 . Vick was voted by teammates as the winner of the Ed Block Courage Award in December . The award honors players who " exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage " . " It means a great deal to me , " Vick said at the time . " I was voted unanimously by my teammates . They know what I 've been through . I 've been through a lot . It 's been great to come back and have an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys . I 'm just ecstatic about that and I enjoy every day . " The Eagles finished the season with an 11 – 5 record , making the playoffs . In the team 's NFC wildcard game against the Dallas Cowboys on January 9 , 2010 , Vick threw the longest touchdown pass of his career to rookie Jeremy Maclin for a 76 @-@ yard touchdown . The Eagles lost the game 34 – 14 . 
 Reid named Donovan McNabb the Eagles ' starter for the 2010 season , but McNabb was traded to the Washington Redskins and Kevin Kolb was named the starter . While relegated to a second @-@ string role , Vick said he knew he could still play at a high level . Asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract , he said , " I hope so ... I feel like I 'm probably better than I ever was in my career , as far as the mental aspect of the game . " The Eagles exercised his option for 2010 in March and Vick received a $ 1 @.@ 5 million roster bonus . 
 Reid named Vick the Eagles ' starting quarterback on September 21 after Kolb suffered a concussion and Vick performed well in his stead . In his second game as an Eagles starter versus the Jacksonville Jaguars , Vick led the Eagles to a 28 – 3 win , throwing for 291 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for another touchdown . He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for September . Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in a week 4 game against the Redskins , and was replaced by Kolb . Vick had passed for 49 yards with three carries for 17 yards in the game prior to the injury . 
 In a Week 10 Monday Night Football matchup against the Washington Redskins on November 14 , Vick passed for 333 yards and four touchdowns , while rushing for 80 yards and another two touchdowns . Vick threw an 88 @-@ yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson on the first play from scrimmage in the game , and went on to lead the Eagles to a 59 – 28 victory . Vick was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance , and the Pro Football Hall of Fame asked for his game jersey to display after he became the first player to pass for three touchdowns and rush for two touchdowns in the first half of a game . In a game later in the season against the New York Giants , Vick led a fourth @-@ quarter rally to erase a 21 @-@ point deficit . He scored three touchdowns to tie the game with under two minutes left . DeSean Jackson returned the Giants ' last punt of the game for a touchdown to win the game for the Eagles as time expired . Vick finished the season with 3 @,@ 018 yards passing , 21 touchdowns and six interceptions with a passer rating of 100 @.@ 2 . He had 100 carries for 676 yards and nine touchdowns . Philadelphia ended with a 10 – 6 record in 2010 and made the playoffs . The team lost to the Packers 21 – 16 in the wildcard round , however . 
 Vick made his fourth Pro Bowl after the season and was named the Eagles ' starting quarterback . The Associated Press and Sporting News named him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year . He also won the Bert Bell Award on March 4 , 2011 . In early 2011 , the Eagles placed their franchise tag on Vick . He signed the one @-@ year tender on March 2 . On August 29 , however , Vick and the Eagles announced they had agreed on a 6 @-@ year , $ 100 million contract with almost $ 40 million in guaranteed money . 
 Led by Vick , Philadelphia finished the 2011 season with an 8 – 8 record . The team began with a 4 – 8 record before winning four games in a row to finish the season . The final game of the season was a 34 – 10 victory on January 1 , 2012 at home against the Washington Redskins . Vick completed 24 of his 39 passes for 335 yards and three touchdowns . 
 Vick came into week one of the 2012 season as the starter , despite a solid showing from rookie Nick Foles in the preseason . Vick led the Eagles to a 17 – 16 victory in week one against the Cleveland Browns despite throwing four interceptions . The Eagles won their following game against the Baltimore Ravens , but lost 27 – 6 in the third week of the season to the Arizona Cardinals . Facing former teammate Kevin Kolb , Vick completed only 17 of 37 passes with no touchdowns and two lost fumbles . The Eagles went on to beat the New York Giants , but then lost three straight games . After the third loss against the Falcons on October 28 , calls for coach Andy Reid to replace Vick with Foles intensified . Reid refused to make the move . 
 The Eagles lost another game against the New Orleans Saints , and Vick remained the starting quarterback for a week 10 game against the Dallas Cowboys . Vick was injured in that game , which the Eagles lost , and was replaced by Foles . On December 3 , after Vick had already been sidelined for three weeks , Reid officially named Foles the starter for the remainder of the season . After a Foles injury in week 16 , Vick was named the starter for the season finale against the Giants in New York . Vick went 19 of 35 for 197 yards with a touchdown and interception , and also ran five times for 25 yards . The Eagles , however , lost the game 42 – 7 , to end the season with a 1 – 5 division record and 4 – 12 overall record . 
 On February 11 , 2013 , the Eagles and Vick agreed on a one @-@ year restructured contract worth up to $ 10 million . New head coach Chip Kelly announced that Vick , Foles , and rookie Matt Barkley would compete for the starting job . After a stellar preseason , Vick was able to reclaim his starting job from Foles , who was named Vick 's backup . 
 Vick started out well , winning his first game against the Redskins and throwing had his first career 400 yard game in a close loss to the Chargers , with 4 passing TDs , 2 rushing TDs , and no interceptions in the two game stretch . After that , Vick suffered losses against Kansas City and Denver , where he threw for 1 touchdown and 3 <unk> in that stretch ( all 3 were thrown against Kansas City ) . In a game against the Giants , Vick was 6 – 14 for 105 yards , when he suffered a hamstring injury . Nick Foles played stellar in his place , going 8 – 2 as starter , while throwing 27 touchdowns to only 2 interceptions with a 119 @.@ 0 passer rating . Vick saw his only playing time in a 15 – 7 loss to the Giants , where he was 6 – 9 for 30 yards and an interception , but he again suffered an injury , this time to his quadriceps , and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley , who played even worse . Foles returned the following week , and Vick spent the rest of the season as the backup , making only one more appearance in a blowout win over the Chicago Bears . 
 = = = New York Jets = = = 
 Vick signed a one @-@ year $ 5 million contract with the New York Jets on March 21 , 2014 , the same day the Jets released Mark Sanchez . The Eagles signed Sanchez a week later . 
 Vick chose to wear # 8 as a tribute to Steve Young , although several days later he decided to change it to number 1 , as number 7 was already taken by Geno Smith . Vick became the first quarterback in franchise history to wear the number . During Week 5 against the San Diego Chargers , Vick came in relief of a struggling Geno Smith following halftime and finished the game with 47 passing yards as the Jets were shutout by the Chargers , 31 – 0 . After seven consecutive losses , Rex Ryan named Vick the starter over Smith for the Week 9 game against the Kansas City Chiefs . Vick became the first quarterback to reach 6 @,@ 000 rushing yards during Week 10 , 20 – 13 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers , which was one of only 3 games that Vick started for the season . 
 = = = Pittsburgh Steelers = = = 
 On August 25 , 2015 , Vick signed a one @-@ year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers . With Ben Roethlisberger wearing number 7 and number 1 being unofficially retired for Gary Anderson , Vick wore number 2 . 
 His signing by the Steelers caused a social media backlash by many Steeler fans , with some saying that they would never support the team again . Fans who supported or were indifferent about the signing called such fans fair weather fans , and also cited that the Steelers have several players with questionable pasts , most notably Roethlisberger and James Harrison . The Animal Rescue League of Western Pennsylvania made a subtle jab at the team on Twitter by saying that they were now more proud to support the Pittsburgh Penguins and subsequently moved an upcoming fundraiser event from Heinz Field to Consol Energy Center . Steelers president Art Rooney II defended the Vick signing on KDKA @-@ TV , saying that they felt that Vick had proven himself since being released from prison . The Steelers had considered signing Vick in 2009 — both Vick and Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin are from the same part of Virginia and know each other well personally — but decided against it due to potential backlash since Vick at the time hadn 't proven himself following his release from prison . 
 In week 3 , Vick was brought into action against the Rams when Ben Roethlisberger sustained a knee injury that sidelined him for 4 – 6 weeks . Vick played decently in that stretch , going 40 – 66 with 2 TDs and 1 INT , while also rushing for 102 yards on 17 carries ( his other 3 carries were kneels in a game where he threw no passes ) . Vick suffered a hamstring injury in a win against the Arizona Cardinals , being replaced by Landry Jones , which led to him missing 6 games , and by then Roethlisberger was healthy enough to play . Despite continual injuries to Roethlisberger and the team not signing another quarterback throughout the season , Vick would be inactive the remainder of the season , leading some sports commentators to speculate that Vick 's playing career may be over . 
 In 2016 , Vick announced he would play one more season , which would be his last season

 Between his selection by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL Draft and early 2007 , Vick was allegedly involved in several incidents : 
 In early 2004 , two men were arrested in Virginia for distributing marijuana . The truck they were driving was registered to Vick . Falcons coach Dan Reeves said he lectured Vick at that time on the importance of reputation , on choosing the right friends , and on staying out of trouble for the good of his team . 
 On October 10 , 2004 , Vick and other members of his entourage , including employee <unk> Phillips , were at Atlanta 's Hartsfield International Airport on their way to board an AirTran flight . While they were passing through a security checkpoint , a security camera caught Phillips and Todd Harris picking up an expensive @-@ appearing watch which belonged to Alvin Spencer , a security screener . After watching the theft on a videotape , Spencer filed a police report . He claimed that Billy " White Shoes " Johnson , known as the Falcons ' " fixer " , interfered with the investigation . Although Vick 's representatives declined to make him available for an Atlanta police inquiry , Spencer got the watch back six days later . 
 In March 2005 , Sonya Elliott filed a civil lawsuit against Vick alleging she contracted genital herpes from him in the autumn of 2002 and that he failed to inform her that he had the disease . Elliot further alleged that Vick had visited clinics under the alias " Ron Mexico " to get treatments and thus knew of his condition . On April 24 , 2006 , Vick 's attorney , Lawrence Woodward , revealed that the lawsuit had been settled out of court under undisclosed terms . Many fans bought custom jerseys from NFL.com with Vick 's number 7 and the name " <unk> " on the back . The NFL later banned customizing jerseys with the name Mexico . 
 After a loss to the New Orleans Saints on November 26 , 2006 in the Georgia Dome , Vick made an obscene gesture at fans in an apparent reaction to booing , holding up both hands with the middle finger extended . He was fined $ 10 @,@ 000 by the NFL and agreed to donate another $ 10 @,@ 000 to charity . 
 Vick surrendered a water bottle that had a hidden compartment to security personnel at Miami International Airport on January 17 , 2007 . " The compartment was hidden by the bottle 's label so that it appeared to be a full bottle of water when held upright , " police said . Test results indicated there were no illegal substances in the water bottle and Vick was cleared of any wrongdoing . Vick announced that the water bottle was a jewelry stash box , and that the substance in question had been jewelry . 
 On April 24 , 2007 , Vick was scheduled to lobby on Capitol Hill , hoping to persuade lawmakers to increase funding for after @-@ school programs . Vick missed a connecting flight in Atlanta on Monday to Reagan National Airport in Arlington , Virginia . He failed to show up for another seat booked for him later that evening . On Tuesday morning , he did not attend his scheduled appearance at a congressional breakfast where he was to be honored for his foundation 's work with after @-@ school projects in Georgia and Virginia . Vick 's mother Brenda accepted the award from the Afterschool Alliance . 
 In 2007 , Vicks father , Michael Boddie , made statements about possible dogfighting activities in 2001 . Boddie told the Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution that around 2001 , Vick was staging dogfights in the garage of the family 's home in Newport News and kept fighting dogs in the family 's backyard , including injured ones that the father nursed back to health . Boddie said his son had been urged to not engage in the activity , but continued . " This is Mike 's thing , " he said . " And he knows it . " Within days , Vick 's mother , Brenda Vick Boddie , told the Newport News Daily Press that " There was no dogfighting . There were no cages . " 
 = = Dog fighting investigations = = 
 A search warrant executed on April 25 , 2007 , as part of a drug investigation of Vick 's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia , with extensive facilities for the activity . Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated , soon joined by federal authorities . As separate state and federal investigations progressed , more details emerged about an interstate dog @-@ fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling . Gruesome details of abuse , torture and execution of under @-@ performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage . Vick and several others were indicted on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation . 
 = = = Federal prosecution and conviction = = = 
 In July 2007 , Vick and three other men were indicted on federal felony charges of operating an unlawful interstate dog fighting venture known as " Bad Newz Kennels " . Vick was accused of financing the operation , directly participating in dog fights and executions , and personally handling thousands of dollars in related gambling activities . Federal prosecutors indicated they intended to proceed under the provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) , a United States federal law that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil cause of action for acts performed as part of an ongoing criminal organization . 
 By August 20 , Vick and the other three co @-@ defendants agreed to separate plea bargains for the federal charges . They were expected to each receive federal prison sentences of between one and five years . Four days later , Vick filed plea documents with the federal court . He pleaded guilty to " Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture " . Vick admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation , and to participating directly in several dog fights in Virginia , Maryland , North Carolina and South Carolina . He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights . He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well . He admitted to being involved in the destruction of 6 – 8 dogs , by hanging or drowning . The " victimization and killing of pit bulls " was considered an aggravating circumstance , allowing prosecutors to exceed the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge . Vick denied placing any side bets on the dogfights . On August 27 , U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson accepted Vick 's guilty plea , but reminded Vick that he ( Hudson ) was under no obligation to accept the prosecution 's recommendation of a reduced sentence . 
 While free on bail , Vick tested positive for marijuana in a random drug test . This was a violation of the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing in federal court . Vick 's positive urine sample was submitted on September 13 , 2007 , according to a document filed by a federal probation officer on September 26 . As a result , Hudson ordered Vick confined to his Hampton , Virginia home between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring until his court hearing date in December . He was ordered to submit to random drug testing . 
 In November , Vick turned himself in early to begin accruing time @-@ served credit against his likely federal prison sentence . He was held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw , Virginia awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions . On December 10 , Vick appeared in U.S. District Court in Richmond for sentencing . Judge Hudson said he was " convinced that it was not a momentary lack of judgment " on Vick 's part , and that Vick was a " full partner " in the dog fighting ring , and he was sentenced to serve 23 months in federal prison . Hudson noted that despite Vick 's claim to have accepted responsibility for his actions , his failure to cooperate fully with federal officials , coupled with a failed drug test and a failed polygraph , showed that he had not taken full responsibility for " promoting , funding and facilitating this cruel and inhumane sporting activity " . Vick was assigned to United States Penitentiary , Leavenworth , a federal prison facility in Leavenworth , Kansas , to serve his sentence . 
 At the request of federal authorities before sentencing , Vick agreed to deposit nearly $ 1 million in an escrow account with attorneys to reimburse others for the costs of caring for the confiscated dogs , most of which were being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court @-@ appointed specialist . Experts said some of the animals would require special care for the rest of their lives . During the administration of his bankruptcy case , the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7 , a celebrity marketing company he owned . 
 = = = State prosecution and sentencing = = = 
 Separate Virginia charges against all four defendants in the dog @-@ fighting case were brought following indictments by the Surry County grand jury when it met on September 25 , 2007 . The principal evidence considered was sworn statements of the defendants during their plea agreement process before the federal court . Vick was charged with two class @-@ 6 felonies , which each carried a maximum penalty of five years ' imprisonment . 
 Citing the high costs and transportation logistics of proceeding while Vick was still in federal prison , state prosecutor Gerald Poindexter decided to postpone Vick 's trial in Surry County Circuit Court until after Vick 's release from federal custody . Vick 's attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner . On October 14 , 2008 , Vick attorney Lawrence Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two @-@ way electronic video with the Surry County Courts . Vick planned to plead guilty to state charges in an effort to get early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house . The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied , but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses . 
 Vick was transported to Virginia in November 2008 to face the state charges . He appeared before the Surry County Circuit Court on November 25 at a session held in neighboring Sussex County because the Surry court building was undergoing renovation . He submitted a guilty plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dog fighting , receiving a 3 @-@ year prison sentence suspended on condition of good behavior , and a $ 2 @,@ 500 fine .

 At the end of 2006 , Sports Illustrated magazine estimated Vick 's annual income between his NFL salary and endorsements at $ 25 @.@ 4 million , ranking him just below NASCAR 's Dale Earnhardt , Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes . Vick 's finances suffered , however , from poor management , bad investments and lawsuits . A $ 45 million lawsuit was pending in a dispute with his original sports agents . Several lucrative endorsement deals soured . 
 After the dog fighting indictments were announced in July 2007 , financial claims against Vick escalated . His financial affairs strained , Vick was unable to meet scheduled payments and other obligations . Within several months , he had been named in numerous lawsuits by banks and creditors for defaulting on loans , some of them related to business investments . The dog fighting property near Smithfield , Virginia had been liquidated earlier , and in November 2007 , Vick attempted to sell another of his homes . 
 As he served his sentence in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth , Kansas , friends and family continued to occupy some of Vick 's other homes in the South Beach section of Miami Beach , Florida . In June 2008 , when Vick 's brother Marcus was arrested and jailed in Norfolk after a police chase , he listed his residence as a $ 1 @.@ 39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in Suffolk , Virginia . Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk . His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $ 30 @,@ 000 a month to support seven friends and relatives , including his mother and brother , three children , and their mothers . 
 = = = Bankruptcy = = = 
 On July 7 , 2008 , Vick sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newport News after failing to " work out consensual resolutions with each of his creditors , " according to court papers . The initial filing , which was incomplete , listed assets of less than $ 50 million and debts of between $ 10 million and $ 50 million . The seven largest creditors without collateral backing their claims were owed a total of $ 12 @.@ 8 million . The three biggest unsecured creditors were Joel Enterprises Inc . , owed $ 4 @.@ 5 million for breach of contract ; Atlanta Falcons , owed $ 3 @.@ 75 million for a pro @-@ rated signing bonus ; and Royal Bank of Canada , owed $ 2 @.@ 5 million in loans .

 Joel Enterprises of Richmond was listed as one of Vick 's larger creditors . Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a contract with their firm in 2001 , nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft . With his mother as a witness , Vick signed a five @-@ year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick 's name , likeness , voice and reputation . Joel 's cut was 25 % of all deals , excluding Vick 's NFL contract , according to the agreement . Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later , and entered into another relationship with other agents . In 2005 , Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $ 45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract . After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006 , the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial . The outcome of the case was an award of $ 4 @.@ 5 million to Joel . 
 The Atlanta Falcons sought to recover a portion of Vick 's $ 37 million 2004 signing bonus . A reduced amount of $ 20 million was awarded to the Falcons in binding legal arbitration , which Vick disputed . The sides agreed to reduce the amount to between $ 6 @.@ 5 and $ 7 @.@ 5 million . The bankruptcy court was advised of this Vick @-@ Falcons settlement agreement on April 3 , 2009 . 
 On September 20 , 2007 , the Royal Bank of Canada filed a civil lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Newport News against Vick for more than $ 2 @.@ 3 million over a loan tied to real estate . The suit claimed Vick failed to meet a September 10 deadline to repay . On May 7 , 2008 , the court granted a motion for summary judgment against Vick for default and breach of a promissory note and ordered him to pay the bank more than $ 2 @.@ 5 million . 
 On September 26 , 2007 , 1st Source Bank , based in South Bend , Indiana , claimed damages of at least $ 2 million in a federal lawsuit , alleging Vick and Divine Seven LLC of Atlanta refused to pay for at least 130 vehicles acquired to be used as rental cars . The bank 's Specialty Financing Group provided financing for rental car fleets . 
 Wachovia Bank also filed a federal suit in October 2007 in Atlanta seeking about $ 940 @,@ 000 from Vick and Gerald Frank Jenkins , a business partner . The bank claimed the two men and their business , Atlantic Wine & Package LLC , defaulted on a May 2006 loan of $ 1 @.@ 3 million to set up a wine shop and restaurant . Jenkins , a retired surgeon who owned Atlantic Wine since 2004 , brought Vick in as an investor . In May 2008 , the U.S. District Court in Atlanta granted a summary judgment in favor of Wachovia . The judgment of $ 1 @.@ 11 million included the initial principal balance , interest accrued , fees , overdrawn accounts , and legal fees . The order provided that further interest could be accrued . 
 The United States Department of Labor filed another lawsuit in federal district court in Newport News on March 25 , 2009 , alleging Vick and others violated federal employee benefits laws by withdrawing $ 1 @.@ 35 million from a retirement plan sponsored by MV7 , one of Vick 's companies . The money was held in trust under pension laws to fund retirement plans for nine MV7 employees . The Labor Department simultaneously filed a complaint in federal bankruptcy court to prevent Vick from discharging his alleged debt to the MV7 pension plan . The complaint alleged that some of the funds were used to pay restitution ordered in his dogfighting case .

 In August 2008 , trustee W. Clarkson McDow , Jr. was appointed to manage Vick 's bankruptcy . The trustee noted in court documents that Vick " has limited ability to arrange his finances and limited ability to participate in the bankruptcy case on an in @-@ person basis . " McDow wrote in court documents that it appeared Vick had " routinely relied upon others to make financial decisions for him , giving them discretionary control over large sums of money " . McDow named Mary Wong and David A. Talbot as people who had obtained broad written authority to act as his attorney @-@ in @-@ fact over all of his financial affairs . 
 Vick had hired Wong , a business manager in Omaha , Nebraska , in the fall of 2007 on the recommendation of Falcons teammate <unk> Williams . Wong helped cash in some of Vick 's investments to provide restitution funds required by the federal court in his criminal case . According to a document filed by one of Vick 's attorneys , she used a power of attorney from Vick to " wrongfully remove " at least another $ 900 @,@ 000 from his various accounts . Court papers also alleged Wong " caused certain business entities owned by [ Vick ] to be transferred to her . " Vick learned later that Wong had been permanently barred from working with any firm that traded on the New York Stock Exchange as the result of taking more than $ 150 @,@ 000 from two elderly widows she met while working at Wells Fargo . 
 Vick next turned to Talbot , a medical school graduate from Hackensack , New Jersey who claimed to have expertise in financial management . Vick later told the court he met Talbot in April 2008 through his brother , Marcus . Talbot was to be paid $ 15 @,@ 000 per month and took possession of one of Vick 's cars , an $ 85 @,@ 000 Mercedes @-@ Benz . Vick later discovered that Talbot 's résumé contained numerous false statements . Talbot had been accused of defrauding church members in New Jersey . The New Jersey Attorney General started legal action against Talbot for securities fraud over an alleged scheme to defraud investors of more than $ 500 @,@ 000 by offering them " asset enhancement contracts " to be used to build a new church . U.S. bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro ordered that the Mercedes @-@ Benz Vick gave Talbot be repossessed and sold , and that Talbot appear at a hearing on September 5 . 
 Paul K. <unk> , one of Vick 's lawyers , told the court that Vick " has supported his mother , brother , fiancée and his two children " over the years . He said Vick 's financial problems included average monthly expenses of $ 12 @,@ 225 for several large homes his family and friends were living in and a monthly income of just $ 277 @.@ 69 . 
 = = = = Reorganization Plan = = = = 
 Vick 's attorneys filed a first plan of reorganization through bankruptcy on November 12 , 2008 . Under the plan , Vick was to sell three of his six homes . Vick 's expenses , meanwhile , included support payments of approximately $ 30 @,@ 000 a month . They included $ 14 @,@ 531 a month to his mother , $ 12 @,@ 363 a month to his fiancée and two daughters , and $ 3 @,@ 500 a month to Taylor . Creditors challenged Vick 's spending plan given his loss of salary and suspension from the NFL . Vick 's attorneys told the judge on November 13 that Vick " has every reason to believe that upon his release , he will be reinstated into the NFL , resume his career and be able to earn a substantial living . " 
 After creditors objected to the initial reorganization plan , Vick appeared in person before Santoro at a hearing in Newport News on April 2 , 2009 . Santoro had decided not to allow testimony by video in March , saying he needed Vick in the courtroom to assess his demeanor and credibility . Vick testified that he intended to live a better life after prison . He said his crime was " heinous " and he felt " true remorse . " Near the end of the hearing , Santoro rejected the plan as unsound , saying that it was too strongly predicated on Vick 's return to the NFL and the substantial projected income it would bring , neither of which was assured . 
 The judge commended Vick for trying to work out his financial mess after years of poor choices , but told Vick the numbers did not add up . Santoro adjourned the case and told Vick to work with his advisers to create a new plan , suggesting Vick begin by liquidating one or both of his Virginia homes , as well as three of the cars he intended to keep , and " buy a house more within his means . " Vick had testified that he felt obligated to provide for friends and family because of " where he had come from . " Santoro told Vick that while that was commendable , " You cannot be everything to everybody . If you do , you 're going to be nothing to anybody . " 
 On April 28 , attorneys met with Santoro and said they made substantial progress on a revised plan . They reported having settled all disputes with Vick 's creditors , including Joel . On August 27 , Santoro approved the revised reorganization plan . It was supported by all of Vick 's creditors but one who was owed $ 13 @,@ 000 . Every creditor was to be paid back in six years on the condition that an estimated $ 9 million in assets be liquidated . Vick was allowed annual living expenses of $ 300 @,@ 000 under the plan . He could spend up to $ 3 @,@ 500 a month for rent in Philadelphia and $ 750 for " utilities and miscellaneous . " He was to pay $ 3 @,@ 712 a month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton , Virginia , where his fiancée and two children lived , and could pay up to $ 1 @,@ 355 per month in private school tuition for his children . Vick was also given up to $ 472 a month in car @-@ related expenses . His mother was allowed $ 2 @,@ 500 per month , and his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor was allotted $ 3 @,@ 000 per month to support their son , <unk> . Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles . Vick paid his agent , Joel Segal , $ 32 @,@ 500 in 2010 , $ 104 @,@ 000 in 2011 , and will pay him $ 160 @,@ 000 each year from 2012 – 2015 for a total of $ 776 @,@ 500 . He paid bankruptcy lawyers $ 748 @,@ 750 in 2010 , $ 1 million in 2011 , and a total of $ 2 @.@ 6 million . 
 = = Endorsements = = 
 During his career with the Falcons , Vick became a spokesperson for many companies . He had endorsement contracts with companies including Nike , EA Sports , Coca @-@ Cola , Powerade , Kraft , Rawlings , Hasbro and AirTran . 
 Even before the animal cruelty case surfaced in 2007 , however , Vick 's corporate status had deteriorated . Among the negative incidents was his middle finger gesture to Atlanta football fans in 2006 . Vick 's first endorsement after being released from prison was a two @-@ year deal on January 27 , 2011 with Unequal Technologies , a company that produces football pads . Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1 , 2011 . The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009 ; his re @-@ signing marked the first time a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him . 
 In 2012 , Vick launched a sports clothing line called V7 to be sold exclusively at Modell 's . Part of the proceeds was to go to the Boys and Girls Club of Philadelphia . 
 = = Charitable foundations = = 
 Michael Vick has been a principal in two charitable foundations , the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation . In June 2006 , Vick , along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda , established The Vick Foundation , a nonprofit organization to support at @-@ risk youth with after @-@ school programs in the Metro Atlanta and Hampton Roads areas . The announcement of the new organization came just before the start of the foundation 's first fundraiser , the Michael Vick Golf Classic . The inaugural event was held at the prestigious Kingsmill Golf Course in James City County near Williamsburg , Virginia in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter , and raised more than $ 80 @,@ 000 for charity . According to its 2006 federal tax return , the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after @-@ school program . The foundation spent 12 % of its 2006 budget – $ 20 @,@ 590 of $ 171 @,@ 823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser , Susan Bass Roberts , a former spokeswoman for Vick , $ 97 @,@ 000 . The foundation ceased operations that year . One of Vick 's financial advisors withdrew $ 50 @,@ 000 – most of the remaining funds – from its checking account in 2008 . 
 After the Virginia Tech massacre on April 16 , 2007 , Vick and the United Way donated $ 10 @,@ 000 to assist families affected . The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia to be placed in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and a special fund at the United Way of Montgomery , Radford and Floyd counties , which serves the Virginia Tech area . The Vick Foundation said the money would be used to provide help with funeral expenses , transportation for family members and other support services . 
 In June 2007 , the " Michael Vick Football Camp , " to be held at Christopher Newport University in Newport News , was canceled for the summer . Vick canceled participation in another football camp to be held at the College of William and Mary and was replaced by Washington Redskins quarterback Jason Campbell . On June 22 , 2007 , a charity golf tournament featuring Vick that was intended in part to raise scholarships in memory of Virginia Tech 's shooting victims was rescheduled for September . 
 = James A. Garfield = 
 James Abram Garfield ( November 19 , 1831 – September 19 , 1881 ) was the 20th President of the United States , serving from March 4 , 1881 , until his assassination later that year . Garfield had served nine terms in the House of Representatives , and had been elected to the Senate before his candidacy for the White House , though he declined the senatorship once he was president @-@ elect . He is the only sitting House member to be elected president . 
 Garfield was raised in humble circumstances on an Ohio farm by his widowed mother . He worked at various jobs , including on a canal boat , in his youth . Beginning at age 17 , he attended several Ohio schools , then studied at Williams College in Williamstown , Massachusetts , from which he graduated in 1856 . A year later , Garfield entered politics as a Republican . He married Lucretia Rudolph in 1858 , and served as a member of the Ohio State Senate ( 1859 – 1861 ) . Garfield opposed Confederate secession , served as a major general in the Union Army during the American Civil War , and fought in the battles of Middle Creek , Shiloh , and Chickamauga . He was first elected to Congress in 1862 to represent Ohio 's 19th District . Throughout Garfield 's extended congressional service after the Civil War , he firmly supported the gold standard and gained a reputation as a skilled orator . Garfield initially agreed with Radical Republican views regarding Reconstruction , but later favored a moderate approach for civil rights enforcement for freedmen . 
 At the 1880 Republican National Convention , Senator @-@ elect Garfield attended as campaign manager for Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman , and gave the presidential nomination speech for him . When neither Sherman nor his rivals – Ulysses S. Grant and James G. Blaine – could get enough votes to secure the nomination , delegates chose Garfield as a compromise on the 36th ballot . In the 1880 presidential election , Garfield conducted a low @-@ key front porch campaign , and narrowly defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock . 
 Garfield 's accomplishments as president included a resurgence of presidential authority against senatorial courtesy in executive appointments , energizing American naval power , and purging corruption in the Post Office , all during his extremely short time in office . Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments , including a U.S. Supreme Court justice . He enhanced the powers of the presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York , starting a fracas that ended with Robertson 's confirmation and Conkling 's resignation from the Senate . Garfield advocated agricultural technology , an educated electorate , and civil rights for African Americans . He also proposed substantial civil service reform , eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor , Chester A. Arthur , as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act . With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days , and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack , Garfield is little @-@ remembered in the American cultural memory other than for his assassination ; historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency . 
 = = Childhood = = 
 James Garfield was born the youngest of five children on November 19 , 1831 , in a log cabin in Orange Township , now Moreland Hills , Ohio . Orange Township was located in the Western Reserve , and like many who settled there , Garfield 's ancestors were from New England . James ' father Abram had been born in Worcester , New York , and came to Ohio to woo his childhood sweetheart , Mehitabel Ballou , only to find her married . He instead wed her sister Eliza , who had been born in New Hampshire . James was named for an older brother , dead in infancy . 
 In early 1833 , Abram and Eliza Garfield joined the Disciples of Christ , a decision that would help shape their youngest son 's life . Abram Garfield died later that year ; his son was raised in poverty in a household led by the strong @-@ willed Eliza . James was her favorite child , and the two remained close for the rest of her life . Eliza Garfield remarried in 1842 , but soon left her second husband , Warren Belden ( possibly Alfred Belden ) , and a then @-@ scandalous divorce was awarded against her in 1850 . James took his mother 's side and when Belden died in 1880 , noted the fact in his diary with satisfaction . Garfield enjoyed his mother 's stories about his ancestry , especially his Welsh great @-@ great @-@ grandfathers and his ancestor who served as a knight of Caerffili Castle . 
 Poor and fatherless , Garfield was mocked by his fellow boys , and throughout his life was very sensitive to slights . He escaped through reading , devouring all the books he could find . He left home at age 16 in 1847 . Rejected by the only ship in port in Cleveland , Garfield instead found work on a canal boat , responsible for managing the mules that pulled it . This labor would be used to good effect by Horatio Alger , who penned Garfield 's campaign biography in 1880 . 
 After six weeks , illness forced Garfield to return home and , during his recuperation , his mother and a local education official got him to promise to postpone his return to the canals for a year and go to school . Accordingly , in 1848 , he began at Geauga Seminary , in nearby Chester Township . Garfield later said of his childhood , " I lament that I was born to poverty , and in this chaos of childhood , seventeen years passed before I caught any inspiration ... a precious 17 years when a boy with a father and some wealth might have become fixed in manly ways . " 
 = = Education , marriage and early career = = 
 At Geauga Academy , which he attended from 1848 to 1850 , Garfield learned academic subjects he had not previously had time for . He shone as a student , and was especially interested in languages and elocution . He began to appreciate the power a speaker had over an audience , writing that the speaker 's platform " creates some excitement . I love agitation and investigation and glory in defending unpopular truth against popular error . " Geauga was co @-@ educational , and Garfield was attracted to one of his fellow students , Lucretia Rudolph , whom he later married . To support himself at Geauga , he worked as a carpenter 's assistant and as a teacher . The need to go from town to town to find a place as a teacher disgusted Garfield , and he thereafter developed a dislike of what he called " place @-@ seeking " , which became , he said , " the law of my life " . In later years , he would astound his friends by letting positions pass that could have been his with a little politicking . Garfield had attended church more to please his mother than to worship God , but in his late teens underwent a religious awakening , and attended many camp meetings , at one of which he was born again . The next day , March 4 , 1850 , he was baptized into the Disciples by being submerged in the icy waters of the Chagrin River . 
 After leaving Geauga , Garfield worked for a year at various jobs , including teaching . Finding that some New Englanders worked their way through college , Garfield determined to do the same , and first sought a school that could prepare him for the entrance examinations . From 1851 to 1854 , he attended the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute ( later named Hiram College ) in Hiram , Ohio , a school run by the Disciples . While there , he was most interested in the study of Greek and Latin , but was inclined to learn about and discuss any new thing he encountered . Securing a position on entry as janitor , he was hired to teach while still a student . Lucretia Rudolph had also enrolled at the Institute , and Garfield wooed her while teaching her Greek . He developed a regular preaching circuit at neighboring churches , in some cases earning a gold dollar per service . By 1854 , Garfield had learned all the Institute could teach him and was a full @-@ time teacher . Garfield then enrolled at Williams College in Williamstown , Massachusetts , as a third @-@ year student , given credit for two year 's study at the Institute after passing a cursory examination . Garfield was impressed with the college president , Mark Hopkins , who had responded warmly to Garfield 's letter inquiring about admission . He said of Hopkins , " The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log with a student on the other . " Hopkins later stated about Garfield in his student days , " There was a large general capacity applicable to any subject . There was no pretense of genius , or alternation of spasmodic effort , but a satisfactory accomplishment in all directions . " After his first term , Garfield was hired to teach penmanship to the students of nearby Pownal , Vermont , a post whose previous incumbent was Chester A. Arthur . 
 Garfield graduated from Williams in August 1856 as salutatorian , giving an address at the commencement . Garfield biographer Ira Rutkow pointed out that the future president 's years at Williams gave Garfield the opportunity to know and respect those of different social backgrounds , and despite his origin as an unsophisticated Westerner , he was liked and respected by socially conscious New Englanders . " In short , " as Rutkow later wrote , " Garfield had an extensive and positive first experience with the world outside the Western Reserve of Ohio . " 
 On his return to Ohio , the degree from a prestigious Eastern school made Garfield a man of distinction . He returned to Hiram to teach at the Institute , and in 1857 was made its president . He did not see education as a field in which he could realize his full potential . At Williams , he had become more politically aware in the intensely anti @-@ slavery atmosphere of the Massachusetts school , and began to consider politics as a career . In 1858 , he married Lucretia ; they would have seven children , five of whom survived infancy . Soon after the wedding , he formally entered his name to read law at a Cleveland firm , although he did his studying in Hiram . He was admitted to the bar in 1861 . 
 Local Republican Party leaders invited Garfield to enter politics upon the death of Cyrus Prentiss , the presumptive nominee for the local state senate seat . He was nominated by the party convention on the sixth ballot , and was elected , serving until 1861 . Garfield 's major effort in the state senate was a bill providing for Ohio 's first geological survey to measure its mineral resources , though it failed . 
 = = Civil War = = 
 After Abraham Lincoln 's election as president , several Southern states announced their secession from the Union to form a new government , the Confederate States of America . Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort , which he regarded as a holy crusade against the Slave Power . In April 1861 , the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter , one of the last federal outposts in the South , beginning the Civil War . Although he had no military training , Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army . 
 At Governor William Dennison 's request , Garfield deferred his military ambitions to remain in the legislature , where he helped appropriate the funds to raise and equip Ohio 's volunteer regiments . Afterward , the legislature adjourned and Garfield spent the spring and early summer on a speaking tour of northeastern Ohio , encouraging enlistment in the new regiments . Following a trip to Illinois to purchase muskets , Garfield returned to Ohio and , in August 1861 , received a commission as a colonel in the 42nd Ohio Infantry regiment . The 42nd Ohio existed only on paper , so Garfield 's first task was to fill its ranks . He did so quickly , recruiting many of his neighbors and former students . The regiment traveled to Camp Chase , outside Columbus , Ohio , to complete training . In December , Garfield was ordered to bring the 42nd to Kentucky , where they joined the Army of the Ohio under Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell . 
 = = = Buell 's command = = = 
 Buell quickly assigned Garfield the task of driving Confederate forces out of eastern Kentucky , giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign which , besides his own 42nd , included the 40th Ohio Infantry , two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units . They departed Catlettsburg , Kentucky , in mid @-@ December , advancing through the valley of the Big Sandy River . The march was uneventful until Union forces reached <unk> , Kentucky , on January 6 , 1862 , where Garfield 's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny 's Creek . Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield 's own , but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered . Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek , on the road to Virginia ; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates . They attacked the rebel positions on January 9 , 1862 , in the Battle of Middle Creek , the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded . At the end of the fighting , the Confederates withdrew from the field , and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision . 
 In recognition of his success , Garfield was promoted to brigadier general . After Marshall 's retreat , Garfield 's command was the sole remaining Union force in eastern Kentucky , and he announced that any men who had fought for the Confederacy would be granted amnesty if they returned to their homes and lived peaceably and remained loyal to the Union . The proclamation was surprisingly lenient , as Garfield now believed the war was a crusade for eradication of slavery . Following a brief skirmish at Pound Gap , the last rebel units in the area were outflanked , and they retreated to Virginia . 
 Garfield 's promotion gave him command of the 20th Brigade of the Army of the Ohio , which was ordered in early 1862 to join Major General Ulysses S. Grant 's forces as they advanced on Corinth , Mississippi . Before the 20th Brigade arrived , however , Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston surprised Grant 's men in their camps , driving them back . Garfield 's troops got word of the battle and advanced quickly , joining the rest of the army on the second day to drive the Confederates back across the field and into retreat . The action , later known as the Battle of Shiloh , was the bloodiest of the war to date ; Garfield was exposed to fire for much of the day , but emerged uninjured . Major General Henry W. Halleck , Grant 's superior , took charge of the combined armies and advanced ponderously toward Corinth ; when they arrived , the Confederates had fled . 
 That summer Garfield suffered from jaundice and significant weight loss . He was forced to return home , where his wife nursed him back to health . While he was home , Garfield 's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress , although he refused to <unk> with the delegates . He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment . During this period of idleness , a rumor of an extra @-@ marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it . Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn , to his frustration . In the meantime , he served on the court @-@ martial of Fitz John Porter , a sensational trial in which Porter was tried for his tardiness at the Second Battle of Bull Run . He was convinced of Porter 's guilt , and voted with his fellow generals to convict . The trial lasted almost two months , from November 1862 to January 1863 , and by the end of it , Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans . 
 = = = Chief of staff for Rosecrans = = = 
 The position of Chief of Staff for a general was usually held by a more junior officer , but Garfield 's influence with Rosecrans was greater than usual , with duties extending beyond mere communication of orders to duties that involved actual management of his Army of the Cumberland . Rosecrans had a voracious appetite for conversation , especially when he was unable to sleep ; in Garfield , he found " the first well read person in the Army " and the ideal candidate for discussions that ran deep into the night . The two became close in spite of Garfield 's being twelve years junior to Rosecrans , and their talks covered all topics , especially religion ; Rosecrans , who had converted from Methodism to Roman Catholicism , succeeded in softening Garfield 's view of his faith . Garfield recommended that Rosecrans replace wing commanders Alexander McCook and Thomas Crittenden , whom he believed ineffective , but Rosecrans ignored the suggestions . With Rosecrans , Garfield devised the Tullahoma Campaign to pursue and trap Confederate General Braxton Bragg in Tullahoma . After initial Union success , Bragg retreated toward Chattanooga , where Rosecrans stalled and requested more troops and supplies . Garfield argued for an immediate advance , in line with demands from Halleck and Lincoln . After a council of war and lengthy deliberations , Rosecrans agreed to attack . 
 At the ensuing Battle of Chickamauga on September 19 and 20 , 1863 , confusion among the wing commanders over Rosecrans 's orders created a gap in the lines , resulting in a rout of the right flank . Rosecrans concluded that the battle was lost and fell back on Chattanooga to establish a defensive line . Garfield , however , thought that part of the army had held and , with Rosecrans 's approval , headed across Missionary Ridge to survey the scene . Garfield 's hunch was correct . His ride became legendary , while Rosecrans ' error reignited criticism about his leadership . While Rosecrans 's army had avoided disaster , they were stranded in Chattanooga , surrounded by Bragg 's army . Garfield sent a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton alerting Washington to the need for reinforcements to avoid annihilation , and Lincoln and Halleck delivered 20 @,@ 000 troops by rail within nine days . In the meantime , Grant was promoted to command of the western armies , and quickly replaced Rosecrans with George H. Thomas . Garfield was ordered to report to Washington , where he was promoted to major general , a commission he would resign before taking a seat in the House of Representatives . According to historian Jean Edward Smith , Grant and Garfield had a " guarded relationship " , since Grant promoted Thomas to command of the Army of the Cumberland , rather than Garfield , after Rosecrans was dismissed .

 = = = Election in 1862 ; Civil War years = = = 
 While serving in the army in early 1862 , Garfield was approached by friends about running for Congress from Ohio 's newly redrawn , heavily Republican 19th district . He was worried that he and other state @-@ appointed generals would get obscure assignments , and running for Congress would allow him to resume his political career . The fact that the new Congress would not hold its first regular session until December 1863 would allow him to continue his war service for a time . Home on medical leave , he refused to campaign for the nomination , leaving that to political managers who secured it at the local convention in September 1862 , on the eighth ballot . In October , he defeated D.B. Woods by a two @-@ to @-@ one margin in the general election for a seat in the 38th Congress . 
 Soon after the nomination , Garfield was ordered to report to War Secretary Edwin Stanton in Washington to discuss his military future . There , Garfield met Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase , who befriended him , seeing him as a younger version of himself . The two men agreed politically , and both were part of the Radical wing of the Republican Party . Once he took his seat in December 1863 , Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard . Many radicals , led in the House by Pennsylvania 's Thaddeus Stevens , wanted lands owned by rebels to be confiscated , but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill that would do that on a widespread basis . Garfield , in debate on the House floor , supported such legislation and , discussing England 's Glorious Revolution , hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills . Although Garfield had supported Lincoln 's Emancipation Proclamation , the congressman marveled that it was a " strange phenomenon in the world 's history , when a second @-@ rate Illinois lawyer is the instrument to utter words which shall form an epoch memorable in all future ages " . 
 Garfield not only favored abolition of slavery , but believed that the leaders of the rebellion had forfeited their constitutional rights . He supported the confiscation of southern plantations and even exile or execution of rebellion leaders as a means to ensure the permanent destruction of slavery . Garfield felt Congress was obliged " to determine what legislation is necessary to secure equal justice to all loyal persons , without regard to color . " Garfield was more supportive of Lincoln when Lincoln took action against slavery . Early in his tenure , he differed from his party on several issues ; his was the solitary Republican vote to terminate the use of bounties in recruiting . Some financially able recruits had used the bounty system to buy their way out of service ( called commutation ) , which Garfield considered reprehensible . Garfield gave a speech pointing out the flaws in the existing conscription law : that of 300 @,@ 000 called upon to enlist , barely 10 @,@ 000 had , the remainder claiming exemption or providing money or a substitute . Lincoln appeared before the Military Affairs committee on which Garfield served , demanding a more effective bill ; even if it cost him re @-@ election , Lincoln was confident he could win the war before his term expired . After many false starts , Garfield , with the support of Lincoln , procured the passage of a conscription bill which excluded commutation . 
 Under Chase 's influence , Garfield became a staunch proponent of a dollar backed by a gold standard , and was therefore a strong opponent of the " greenback " ; he regretted very much , but understood , the necessity for suspension of payment in gold or silver during the emergency presented by the Civil War . Garfield voted with the Radical Republicans in passing the Wade – Davis Bill , designed to give Congress more authority over Reconstruction , but it was defeated by Lincoln 's pocket veto . 
 Garfield did not consider Lincoln particularly worthy of re @-@ election , but no viable alternative seemed available . " He will probably be the man , though I think we could do better . " The Ohioan attended the party convention and promoted Rosecrans as Lincoln 's running mate , but delegates chose Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson . Both Lincoln and Garfield were re @-@ elected . By then , Chase had left the Cabinet and had been appointed Chief Justice , and his relations with Garfield became more distant . 
 Garfield took up the practice of law in 1865 as a means to improve his personal finances . His efforts took him to Wall Street where , the day after Lincoln 's assassination , a riotous crowd led him into an impromptu speech to calm it : " Fellow citizens ! Clouds and darkness are round about Him ! His pavilion is dark waters and thick clouds of the skies ! Justice and judgment are the establishment of His throne ! Mercy and truth shall go before His face ! Fellow citizens ! God reigns , and the Government at Washington still lives ! " The speech , with no mention or praise of Lincoln , was according to Garfield biographer Robert G. Caldwell " quite as significant for what it did not contain as for what it did " . In the following years , Garfield had more praise for Lincoln ; a year after the Illinoisan 's death Garfield stated that " greatest among all these developments were the character and fame of Abraham Lincoln " , and in 1878 called Lincoln " one of the few great rulers whose wisdom increased with his power " . 
 = = = Reconstruction = = = 
 After the war , Garfield became a proponent of black suffrage , though he admitted that the idea of African Americans as political equals with whites gave him " a strong feeling of repugnance " . The new president , Johnson , sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865 ; Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment . Johnson , an old friend , sought Garfield 's backing , and their conversations led Garfield to assume that differences between president and Congress were not large . When Congress assembled in December ( to Johnson 's chagrin without the elected representatives of the Southern states , who were excluded ) , Garfield urged conciliation on his colleagues , although he feared that Johnson , a former Democrat , might combine with other Democrats to gain political control if he rejoined the party . Garfield foresaw conflict even before February 1866 when Johnson vetoed a bill to extend the life of the Freedmen 's Bureau , charged with aiding the former slaves . By April , Garfield had concluded that Johnson was either " crazy or drunk with opium " . 
 The conflict between the branches of government was the major issue of the 1866 campaign , with Johnson taking to the campaign trail in a Swing Around the Circle and Garfield facing opposition within his party in his home district . With the South still disenfranchised and Northern public opinion behind them , the Republicans gained a two @-@ thirds majority in both houses of Congress . Garfield , having overcome his challengers at his district nominating convention , was easily re @-@ elected . 
 Garfield opposed the initial talk of impeaching President Johnson when Congress convened in December 1866 . However , he supported legislation to limit Johnson 's powers , such as the Tenure of Office Act , which restricted Johnson in removing presidential appointees . Distracted by committee duties , he rarely spoke in connection with these bills , but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson . Due to a court case , he was absent on the day in April 1868 when the House impeached Johnson , but soon gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson 's removal . When the president was acquitted in trial before the Senate , Garfield was shocked , and blamed the outcome of the trial on its presiding officer , Chief Justice Chase , his onetime mentor . 
 By the time Ulysses S. Grant succeeded Johnson in 1869 , Garfield had moved away from the remaining radicals ( Stevens , their leader , had died in 1868 ) . He hailed the ratification of the 15th Amendment in 1870 as a triumph , and he favored the re @-@ admission of Georgia to the Union as a matter of right , not politics . In 1871 , Garfield opposed passage of the Ku Klux Klan Act , saying " I have never been more perplexed by a piece of legislation " . He was torn between his indignation at " these terrorists " and his concern for the freedoms endangered by the power the bill gave to the president to enforce the act through suspension of habeas corpus . 
 = = = Tariffs and finance = = = 
 Throughout his political career , Garfield favored the gold standard and decried attempts to increase the money supply through the issuance of paper money not backed by gold , and later , through the free and unlimited coinage of silver . In 1865 , Garfield was placed on the House Ways and Means Committee , a long @-@ awaited opportunity to focus on financial and economic issues . He reprised his opposition to the greenback , saying , " any party which commits itself to paper money will go down amid the general disaster , covered with the curses of a ruined people . " In 1868 Garfield gave a two @-@ hour speech on currency in the House , which was widely applauded as his best oratory to that point ; in it he advocated a gradual resumption of specie payments , that is , the government paying out silver and gold , rather than paper money that could not be redeemed . 
 Tariffs had been raised to high levels during the Civil War . Afterwards , Garfield , who made a close study of financial affairs , advocated moving towards free trade , though the standard Republican position was a protective tariff that would allow American industries to grow . This break with his party likely cost him his place on the Ways and Means Committee in 1867 , and though Republicans held the majority in the House until 1875 , Garfield remained off that committee during that time . Garfield came to chair the powerful House Appropriations Committee , but it was Ways and Means , with its influence over fiscal policy , that he really wanted to lead . Part of the reason Garfield was denied a place on Ways and Means was the opposition of the influential Republican editor , Horace Greeley . 
 In September 1870 , Garfield , who was then chairman of the House Banking Committee , led an investigation into the Black Friday Gold Panic scandal . The committee investigation into corruption was thorough , but found no indictable offenses . Garfield blamed the easy availability of fiat money greenbacks for financing the speculation that led to the scandal . 
 Garfield was not at all enthused about the re @-@ election of President Grant in 1872 — until Horace Greeley , who emerged as the candidate of the Democrats and Liberal Republicans , became the only serious alternative . Garfield opined , " I would say Grant was not fit to be nominated and Greeley is not fit to be elected . " Both Grant and Garfield won overwhelming re @-@ election victories . 
 = = = Crédit Mobilier scandal ; Salary Grab = = = 
 The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal involved corruption in the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad , part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869 . Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company , then contracted with the firm to have it undertake the construction of the railroad . The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad , using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project , and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value , well below the market rate . Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains , and distributed substantial dividends . The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds . One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman , Oakes Ames of Massachusetts . He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier stock at par value , well below what it sold for on the market , and the railroad got its additional appropriations . 
 The story broke in July 1872 , in the middle of the presidential campaign . Among those named were Vice President ( and former House Speaker ) Schuyler Colfax , Grant 's second @-@ term running mate ( Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson ) , Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine , and Garfield . Greeley had little luck taking advantage of the scandal . When Congress reconvened after the election , Blaine , seeking to clear his name , demanded a House investigation . Evidence before the special committee exonerated Blaine . Garfield had stated , in September 1872 , that Ames had offered him stock , but he had repeatedly refused it . Testifying before the committee in January , Ames alleged that he had offered Garfield ten shares of stock at par value , but that Garfield had never taken the shares , or paid for them . A year had passed , from 1867 to 1868 , before Garfield had finally refused it . Garfield , appearing before the committee on January 14 , 1873 , confirmed much of this . Ames testified several weeks later that Garfield agreed to take the stock on credit , and that it was paid for by the company 's huge dividends . The two men differed over a sum of some $ 300 that Garfield received and later paid back , with Garfield deeming it a loan and Ames a dividend . 
 Garfield 's biographers were unwilling to exonerate him in Crédit Mobilier , with Allan Peskin writing " Did Garfield lie ? Not exactly . Did he tell the truth ? Not completely . Was he corrupted ? Not really . Even Garfield 's enemies never claimed that his involvement ... influenced his behavior " . Rutkow wrote that " Garfield 's real offense was that he knowingly denied to the House investigating committee that he had agreed to accept the stock and that he had also received a dividend of $ 329 . " Caldwell suggested that Garfield " while he told the truth [ before the committee ] , certainly failed to tell the whole truth , clearly evading an answer to certain vital questions and thus giving the impression of worse faults than those of which he was guilty " . That Crédit Mobilier was a corrupt organization had been a secret badly kept , even mentioned on the floor of Congress , and editor Sam Bowles wrote at the time that Garfield , in his positions on committees dealing with finance , " had no more right to be ignorant in a matter of such grave importance as this , than the sentinel has to snore on his post " . 
 Another issue that caused Garfield trouble in his 1874 re @-@ election bid was the so @-@ called " Salary Grab " of 1873 , which increased the compensation for members of Congress by 50 percent , retroactive to 1871 . Garfield was responsible , as Appropriations Committee chairman , for shepherding the legislative appropriations bill through the House ; during the debate in February 1873 , Massachusetts Representative Benjamin Butler offered the increase as an amendment , and despite Garfield 's opposition , it passed the House and eventually became law . The law was very popular in the House , as almost half the members were lame ducks , but the public was outraged , and many of Garfield 's constituents blamed him , though he refused to accept the increase . In what was a bad year for Republicans , who lost control of the House for the first time since the Civil War , Garfield had his closest congressional election , winning with only 57 percent of the vote . 
 = = = Minority leader ; Hayes administration = = = 
 With the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 1875 , Garfield lost his chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee . The Democratic leadership in the House appointed Garfield as a Republican member of Ways and Means . With many of his leadership rivals defeated in the 1874 Democratic landslide , and Blaine elected to the Senate , Garfield was seen as the Republican floor leader and the likely Speaker should the party regain control of the chamber . 
 As the 1876 presidential election approached , Garfield was loyal to the candidacy of Senator Blaine , and fought for the former Speaker 's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati . When it became clear , after six ballots , that Blaine could not prevail , the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes . Although Garfield had supported Blaine , he had kept good relations with Hayes , and wholeheartedly supported the governor . Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full @-@ time to the practice of law , but to help his party , he sought re @-@ election , and won it easily that October . Any celebration was short lived , as Garfield 's youngest son , Neddie , fell ill with whooping cough shortly after the congressional election , and soon died . 
 When Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat Samuel Tilden , the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship : South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida . If Hayes won all three states , he would take the election by a single electoral vote . Grant asked Garfield to serve as a " neutral observer " in the recount in Louisiana . The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner — Garfield recommended that the entire vote of West Feliciana Parish , which had given Tilden a sizable majority , be thrown out . The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states , to the outrage of Democrats , who had the state legislatures submit rival returns , and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote — under the Constitution , Congress is the final arbiter of the election . Congress then passed a bill establishing the Electoral Commission , to determine the winner . Although he opposed the Commission , feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious , Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of Democrats that he was too partisan . Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7 , with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court . As part of the deal whereby they recognized Hayes as president , Southern Democrats secured the removal of federal troops from the South , ending Reconstruction . 
 Although a Senate seat would be disposed of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary , Hayes needed Garfield 's expertise to protect him from the agenda of a hostile Congress , and asked him not to seek it . Garfield , as the president 's key legislator , gained considerable prestige and respect from his role . When Congress debated what became the Bland @-@ Allison Act , to have the government purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins , Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard , but it was enacted over Hayes 's veto in February 1878 . 
 Garfield during this time purchased the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed <unk> , and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency . Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879 , seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House . Garfield preferred to seek election as senator , and devoted his efforts to seeing that Republicans won the 1879 election for the General Assembly , with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent , Allen G. Thurman . The Republicans swept the legislative elections . Rivals were spoken of for the seat , such as Secretary Sherman , but he had presidential ambitions ( for which he sought Garfield 's support ) , and other candidates fell by the wayside . Garfield was elected to the Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880 , though his term was not to begin until March 4 , 1881 . 
 = = = Legal career and other activities = = = 
 Garfield was one of three attorneys who argued for the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court case Ex parte Milligan in 1866 . The petitioners were pro @-@ Confederate northern men who had been found guilty and sentenced to death by a military court for treasonous activities . The case turned on whether the defendants should instead have been tried by a civilian court , and resulted in a ruling that civilians could not be tried before military tribunals while the civil courts were operating . The oral argument was Garfield 's first court appearance . Jeremiah Black had taken him in as a junior partner a year before , and assigned the case to him in light of his highly regarded oratory skills . With the result , Garfield instantly achieved a reputation as a preeminent appellate lawyer . 
 During Grant 's first term , discontented with public service , Garfield pursued opportunities in the law , but declined a partnership offer when told his prospective partner was of " intemperate and licentious " reputation . In 1873 , after the death of Chase , Garfield appealed to Grant to appoint Justice Noah H. Swayne as Chief Justice . Grant , however , appointed Morrison R. Waite . 
 Garfield thought the land grants given to expanding railroads to be an unjust practice ; as well , he opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations , as well as the power sought by the workers ' unions . Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of the annoyance of aggressive office seekers . He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers , in exchange for their positions , were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions . 
 In 1876 , Garfield displayed his mathematical talent when he developed a trapezoid proof of the Pythagorean theorem . His finding was placed in the New England Journal of Education . Mathematics historian William Dunham stated that Garfield 's trapezoid work was " really a very clever proof " . 
 = = Presidential election of 1880 = = 
 = = = Republican nomination = = = 
 Having just been elected to the Senate with Sherman 's support , Garfield entered the 1880 campaign season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee . Even before the convention began , however , a few Republicans , including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia , thought Garfield the best choice for the nomination . Garfield denied any interest in the position , but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant 's ambitions . Besides Sherman , the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant , but several other candidates attracted delegates as well . 
 As the convention began , Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York , the floor leader for the Grant forces ( known as the Stalwart faction ) , proposed that the delegates pledge to support the eventual nominee in the general election . When three West Virginia delegates declined to be so bound , Conkling sought to expel them from the convention . Garfield rose to defend the men , giving a passionate speech in defense of their right to reserve judgement . The crowd turned against Conkling , and he withdrew the motion . The performance delighted Garfield 's boosters , who now believed more than ever that he was the only man who could attract a majority of the delegates ' votes . 
 After speeches in favor of the other front @-@ runners , Garfield rose to place Sherman 's name in nomination ; his nominating speech was well @-@ received , but the delegates mustered little excitement for the idea of Sherman as the next president . The first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284 ; Sherman 's 93 placed him in a distant third . Subsequent ballots quickly demonstrated a deadlock between the Grant and Blaine forces , with neither having the 379 votes needed for nomination . Jeremiah McLain Rusk , a member of the Wisconsin delegation , and Benjamin Harrison , an Indiana delegate , sought to break the deadlock by shifting a few of the anti @-@ Grant votes to a dark horse candidate — Garfield . Garfield gained 50 votes on the 35th ballot , and the stampede began . Garfield protested to the other members of his Ohio delegation that he had not sought the nomination and had never intended to betray Sherman , but they overruled his objections and cast their ballots for him . In the next round of voting , nearly all of the Sherman and Blaine delegates shifted their support to Garfield , giving him 399 votes and the Republican nomination . Most of the Grant forces backed the former president to the end , creating a disgruntled Stalwart minority in the party . To obtain that faction 's support for the ticket , former New York customs collector Chester A. Arthur , a member of Conkling 's political machine , was chosen as the vice @-@ presidential nominee . 
 = = = Campaign against Hancock = = = 
 Despite including a Stalwart on the ticket , animosity between the Republican factions carried over from the convention , and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there . After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign , Garfield returned to Ohio , leaving the active campaigning to others , as was traditional at the time . Meanwhile , the Democrats settled on their nominee , Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania , a career military officer . Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South , while much of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans ; most of the campaign would involve a few close states , including New York and Indiana . 
 Practical differences between the candidates were few , and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt : reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war , and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war , dishonor Union veterans , and pay Confederate veterans pensions out of the federal treasury . With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war , and Union generals at the head of both tickets , the bloody shirt was of diminishing value in exciting the voters . With a few months to go before the election , the Republicans switched tactics to emphasize the tariff . Seizing on the Democratic platform 's call for a " tariff for revenue only " , Republicans told Northern workers that a Hancock presidency would weaken the tariff protection that kept them in good jobs . Hancock made the situation worse when , attempting to strike a moderate stance , he said " the tariff question is a local question " . The ploy proved effective in uniting the North behind Garfield . In the end , fewer than two thousand votes , of the more than 9 @.@ 2 million popular votes cast , separated the two candidates , but in the Electoral College Garfield had an easy victory over Hancock , 214 to 155 . 
 = = Presidency , 1881 = = 
 = = = Cabinet and inauguration = = = 
 Between his election and his inauguration , Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling 's and Blaine 's warring factions . Blaine 's delegates had provided much of the support for Garfield 's nomination , and the Maine senator received the place of honor : Secretary of State . Blaine was not only the president 's closest advisor , he was obsessed with knowing all that took place in the White House , and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence . Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury , William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy , Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War , and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior . New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General . Garfield appointed Pennsylvania 's Wayne MacVeagh , an adversary of Blaine 's , as Attorney General . Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh , William E. Chandler , as Solicitor General under MacVeagh . Only Chandler 's rejection by the Senate forestalled MacVeagh 's resignation over the matter . 
 Distracted by cabinet maneuvering , Garfield 's inaugural address was not up to his typical oratorical standards . In one high point , Garfield emphasized the civil rights of African @-@ Americans , saying " Freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen . " After discussing the gold standard , the need for education , and an unexpected denunciation of Mormon polygamy , the speech ended . The crowd applauded , but the speech , according to Peskin , " however sincerely intended , betrayed its hasty composition by the flatness of its tone and the conventionality of its subject matter . " 
 Garfield 's appointment of James infuriated Conkling , a factional opponent of the Postmaster General , who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction , such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury . The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield 's brief presidency . The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president , at Blaine 's instigation , nominated Conkling 's enemy , Judge William H. Robertson , to be Collector of the Port of New York . This was one of the prize patronage positions below cabinet level , and was then held by Edwin A. Merritt . Conkling raised the time @-@ honored principle of senatorial courtesy in an attempt to defeat the nomination , to no avail . Garfield , who believed the practice to be corrupt , would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed , intending to " settle the question whether the President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States . " Ultimately , Conkling and his New York colleague , Senator Thomas C. Platt , resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication , but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places . Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield 's victory was clear . To Blaine 's chagrin , the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions , and nominated a number of Conkling 's Stalwart friends to offices . 
 = = = Reforms = = = 
 Grant and Hayes had both advocated civil service reform , and by 1881 , civil service reform associations had organized with renewed energy across the nation . Garfield sympathized with them , believing that the spoils system damaged the presidency and distracted from more important concerns . Some reformers were disappointed that Garfield had advocated limited tenure only to minor office seekers and had given appointments to his old friends , but many remained loyal and supported Garfield . 
 Corruption in the post office also cried out for reform . In April 1880 , there had been a congressional investigation into corruption in the Post Office Department , in which profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars , securing bogus mail contracts on star routes . After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid , costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among ring members . That year , Hayes stopped the implementation of any new star route contracts . Shortly after taking office , Garfield received information from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader , Second Assistant Postmaster @-@ General Thomas J. Brady . Garfield demanded Brady 's resignation and ordered prosecutions that would end in trials for conspiracy . When told that his party , including his own campaign manager , Stephen W. Dorsey , was involved , Garfield directed MacVeagh and James to root out the corruption in the Post Office Department " to the bone " , regardless of where it might lead . Brady resigned and was eventually indicted for conspiracy . After two " star route " ring trials in 1882 and 1883 , the jury found Brady not guilty . 
 = = = Civil rights and education = = = 
 Garfield believed that the key to improving the state of African American civil rights would be found in education aided by the federal government . During Reconstruction , freedmen had gained citizenship and suffrage that enabled them to participate in government , but Garfield believed their rights were being eroded by Southern white resistance and illiteracy , and was concerned that blacks would become America 's permanent " peasantry " . His answer was to propose a " universal " education system funded by the federal government . Congress and the northern white public , however , had lost interest in African @-@ American rights , and federal funding for universal education did not find support in Congress during Garfield 's term . Garfield also worked to appoint several African Americans to prominent positions : Frederick Douglass , recorder of deeds in Washington ; Robert Elliot , special agent to the Treasury ; John M. Langston , Haitian minister ; and Blanche K. Bruce , register to the Treasury . Garfield believed that Southern support for the Republican party could be gained by " commercial and industrial " interests rather than race issues and began to reverse Hayes 's policy of conciliating Southern Democrats . He appointed William H. Hunt , a carpetbagger Republican from Louisiana , as Secretary of the Navy . To break the hold of the resurgent Democratic Party in the Solid South , Garfield took patronage advice from Virginia Senator William Mahone of the biracial independent Readjuster Party , hoping to add the independents ' strength to the Republicans ' there . 
 = = = Foreign policy and naval reform = = = 
 Entering the presidency , Garfield had little foreign policy experience , so he leaned heavily on Blaine . Blaine , a former protectionist , now agreed with Garfield on the need to promote freer trade , especially within the Western Hemisphere . Their reasons were twofold : firstly , Garfield and Blaine believed that increasing trade with Latin America would be the best way to keep Great Britain from dominating the region . Secondly , by encouraging exports , they believed they could increase American prosperity , and by doing so position the Republican party as the author of that prosperity , ensuring continued electoral success . Garfield authorized Blaine to call for a Pan @-@ American conference in 1882 to mediate disputes among the Latin American nations and to serve as a forum for talks on increasing trade . At the same time , they hoped to negotiate a peace in the War of the Pacific then being fought by Bolivia , Chile , and Peru . Blaine favored a resolution that would not result in Peru yielding any territory , but Chile , which had by 1881 occupied the Peruvian capital , Lima , rejected any settlement that restored the previous status quo . Garfield sought to expand American influence in other areas , calling for renegotiation of the Clayton @-@ Bulwer Treaty to allow the United States to construct a canal through Panama without British involvement , as well as attempting to reduce British influence in the strategically located Kingdom of Hawaii . Garfield 's and Blaine 's plans for the United States ' involvement in the world stretched even beyond the Western Hemisphere , as he sought commercial treaties with Korea and Madagascar . Garfield also considered enhancing the United States ' military strength abroad , asking Navy Secretary Hunt to investigate the condition of the navy with an eye toward expansion and modernization . In the end , these ambitious plans came to nothing after Garfield was assassinated . Nine countries had accepted invitations to the Pan @-@ American conference , but the invitations were withdrawn in April 1882 after Blaine resigned from the cabinet and Arthur , Garfield 's successor , cancelled the conference . Naval reform continued under Arthur , if on a more modest scale than Garfield and Hunt had envisioned , ultimately ending in the construction of the Squadron of Evolution . 
 = = = Administration and cabinet = = = 
 = = Assassination = = 
 = = = Guiteau and shooting = = = 
 Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau , a disgruntled office seeker , at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington , D.C. on July 2 , 1881 . After eleven weeks of intensive and other care Garfield died in Elberon , New Jersey , the second of four Presidents to be assassinated , following Abraham Lincoln . Guiteau had followed various professions in his life , but in 1880 had determined to gain federal office by supporting what he expected to be the winning Republican ticket . He composed a speech , " Garfield vs. Hancock " , and got it printed by the Republican National Committee . One means of persuading the voter in that era was through orators expounding on the candidate 's merits , but with the Republicans seeking more famous men , Guiteau received few opportunities to speak . On one occasion , according to Kenneth D. Ackerman in his book about Garfield 's candidacy and assassination , Guiteau was unable to finish his speech due to nerves . Guiteau , who considered himself a Stalwart , deemed his contribution to Garfield 's victory sufficient to justify the position of consul in Paris , despite the fact he spoke no French , nor any foreign language . 
 One of President Garfield 's more wearying duties was seeing office seekers , and he saw Guiteau at least once . White House officials suggested to Guiteau that he approach Blaine , as the consulship was within the Department of State . Blaine also saw the public regularly , and Guiteau became a regular at these sessions ; Blaine , who had no intention of giving Guiteau a position for which he was not qualified nor one he had not earned , simply stated that the deadlock in the Senate over Robertson 's nomination made it impossible to consider the Paris consulship , which required Senate confirmation . Once the New York senators had resigned , and Robertson had been confirmed as Collector , Guiteau pressed his claim , and Blaine told him he would not receive the position . 
 Guiteau came to believe he had lost the position because he was a Stalwart . The office @-@ seeker decided that the only way to end the internecine warfare in the Republican Party was for Garfield to die — though he had nothing personal against the president . Arthur 's succession would restore peace , he felt , and lead to rewards for fellow Stalwarts , including Guiteau . 
 The assassination of Abraham Lincoln was deemed a fluke due to the Civil War , and Garfield , like most people , saw no reason why the president should be guarded ; Garfield 's movements and plans were often printed in the newspapers . Guiteau knew the president would leave Washington for cooler climes on July 2 , and made plans to kill him before then . He purchased a gun he thought would look good in a museum , and followed Garfield several times , but each time his plans were frustrated , or he lost his nerve . His opportunities dwindled to one — Garfield 's departure by train for New Jersey on the morning of July 2 , 1881 . 
 Guiteau concealed himself by the ladies ' waiting room at the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad , from where Garfield was scheduled to depart . Most of Garfield 's cabinet planned to accompany him at least part of the way ; Blaine , who was to remain in Washington , came to the station to see him off . The two men were deep in conversation and did not notice Guiteau before he took out his revolver and shot Garfield twice , once in the back and once in the arm . The time was 9 : 30 a.m. The assassin attempted to leave the station , but was quickly captured . As Blaine recognized him and Guiteau made no secret of why he had shot Garfield , the assassin 's motivation to benefit the Stalwarts reached many with the early news of the shooting , causing rage against that faction . 
 = = = Treatment and death = = = 
 Garfield was hit by two shots ; one glanced off his arm while the other pierced his back , shattering a rib and embedding itself in his abdomen . " My God , what is this ? " he exclaimed . Guiteau , as he was led away , stated , " I did it . I will go to jail for it . I am a Stalwart and Arthur will be President . " 
 Among those at the station was Robert Todd Lincoln , who sixteen years before had watched his father die from an assassin 's bullet . Garfield was taken on a mattress upstairs to a private office , where several doctors examined him , probing the wound with unwashed fingers . At his request , Garfield was taken back to the White House , and his wife , then in New Jersey , was sent for . Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City , who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau 's statements . 
 Although Joseph Lister 's pioneering work in antisepsis was known to American doctors , with Lister himself having visited America in 1876 , few of them had confidence in it , and none of his advocates were among Garfield 's treating physicians . The physician who took charge at the depot and then at the White House was Doctor Willard Bliss . A noted physician and surgeon , Bliss was an old friend of Garfield , and about a dozen doctors , led by Bliss , were soon probing the wound with unsterilized fingers and instruments . Garfield was given morphine for the pain , and asked Bliss to frankly tell him his chances , which Bliss put at one in a hundred . " Well , Doctor , we 'll take that chance . " 
 Over the next few days , Garfield made some improvement , as the nation viewed the news from the capital and prayed . Although he never stood again , he was able to sit up and write several times , and his recovery was viewed so positively that a steamer was fitted out as a seagoing hospital to aid with his convalescence . He was nourished on oatmeal ( which he detested ) and milk from a cow on the White House lawn . When told that Indian chief Sitting Bull , a prisoner of the army , was starving , Garfield said , " Let him starve " , then , " Oh , no , send him my oatmeal . " Alexander Graham Bell tried to locate the bullet with a primitive metal detector ; he was not successful . One means of keeping the president comfortable in Washington 's summer heat was one of the first successful air conditioning units : air that was propelled by fans over ice and then dried had reduced the temperature in the sickroom by 20 degrees Fahrenheit ( 11 degrees Celsius ) . 
 Beginning on July 23 , Garfield took a turn for the worse . His temperature increased to 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) ; doctors , concerned by a pus sac that had developed by the wound , operated and inserted a drainage tube . This initially seemed to help , and Garfield , in his bed , was able to hold a brief cabinet meeting on July 29 , though members were under orders from Bliss to discuss nothing that might excite Garfield . Doctors probed the sac , which went into Garfield 's body , hoping to find the bullet ; they most likely only made the infections worse . Garfield performed only one state act in August , signing an extradition paper . By the end of the month , the president was much more feeble than he had been , and his weight had decreased to 130 pounds ( 59 kg ) . 
 Garfield had long been anxious to escape hot , unhealthy Washington , and in early September the doctors agreed to move him to Elberon , where his wife had recovered earlier in the summer . He left the White House for the last time on September 5 , traveling in a specially cushioned railway car ; a spur line to the Franklyn Cottage , a seaside mansion given over to his use , was built in a night by volunteers . There , Garfield could see the ocean as officials and reporters maintained what became ( after an initial rally ) a death watch . Garfield 's personal secretary , Joe Stanley Brown , wrote 40 years later , " to this day I cannot hear the sound of the low slow roll of the Atlantic on the shore , the sound which filled my ears as I walked from my cottage to his bedside , without recalling again that ghastly tragedy . " 
 On September 18 , Garfield asked A. F. Rockwell , a friend , if he would have a place in history . Rockwell assured him he would , and told Garfield he had much work still before him . But his response was , " No , my work is done . " The following day , Garfield , by then also suffering from pneumonia and heart pains , marveled that he could not pick up a glass despite feeling well , and went to sleep without discomfort . He awoke that evening around 10 : 15 pm with great pain in his chest . The attendant watching him sent for Bliss , who found him unconscious . Despite efforts to revive him , Garfield never awoke , and died at 10 : 35 pm that evening . 
 According to some historians and medical experts , Garfield might have survived his wounds had the doctors attending him had at their disposal today 's medical research , techniques , and equipment . Standard medical practice at the time dictated that priority be given to locating the path of the bullet . Several of his doctors inserted their unsterilized fingers into the wound to probe for the bullet , a common practice in the 1880s . Historians agree that massive infection was a significant factor in President Garfield 's demise . Biographer Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield 's death ; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation . Rutkow , a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey , has argued that starvation also played a role . Rutkow suggests that " Garfield had such a nonlethal wound . In today 's world , he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days . " 
 Guiteau was indicted on October 14 , 1881 , for the murder of the President . In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often interrupted and argued , and in which his counsel used the insanity defense , the jury found him guilty on January 5 , 1882 , and he was sentenced to death by hanging . Guiteau might have had syphilis , a disease that causes physiological mental impairment . He was executed on June 30 , 1882 . 
 = = Funeral , memorials and commemorations = = 
 Garfield 's funeral train left Long Branch on the same special track that brought him there , traveling over tracks blanketed with flowers and past houses adorned with flags . His body was transported to the Capitol and then continued on to Cleveland for burial . More than 70 @,@ 000 citizens , some waiting over three hours , passed by Garfield 's coffin as his body lay in state in Washington ; later , on September 25 , 1881 , in Cleveland , more than 150 @,@ 000 — a number equal to the entire population of that city — likewise paid their respects . His body was temporarily interred in a vault in Cleveland 's Lake View Cemetery until his permanent memorial was built . 
 Memorials to Garfield were erected across the country . On April 10 , 1882 , seven months after Garfield 's death , the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp in his honor , the second stamp issued by the U.S. to honor an assassinated president . In 1884 , sculptor Frank <unk> completed a monument on the grounds of the San Francisco Conservatory of Flowers . In 1887 , the James A. Garfield Monument was dedicated in Washington . Another monument , in Philadelphia 's Fairmount Park , was erected in 1896 . In Victoria , Australia , Cannibal Creek was renamed Garfield in his honor . 
 On May 19 , 1890 , Garfield 's body was permanently interred , with great solemnity and fanfare , in a mausoleum in Lake View Cemetery in Cleveland . Attending the dedication ceremonies were former president Hayes , President Benjamin Harrison , and future president William McKinley . Garfield 's Treasury Secretary , William Windom , also attended . Harrison said that Garfield was always a " student and instructor " and that his life works and death would " continue to be instructive and inspiring incidents in American history " . Three panels on the monument display Garfield as a teacher , Union major general , and orator ; another shows him taking the Presidential oath , and a fifth shows his body lying in state at the Capitol rotunda in Washington D.C. 
 Garfield 's murder by a deranged office @-@ seeker awakened public awareness of the need for civil service reform legislation . Senator George H. Pendleton , a Democrat from Ohio , launched a reform effort that resulted in the Pendleton Act in January 1883 . This act reversed the " spoils system " where office seekers paid up or gave political service in order to obtain or keep federally appointed positions . Under the act , appointments were awarded on merit and competitive examination . To ensure the reform was implemented , Congress and Arthur established and funded the Civil Service Commission . The Pendleton Act , however , covered only 10 % of federal government workers . For Arthur , previously known for having been a " veteran spoilsman " , civil service reform became his most noteworthy achievement . 
 = = Legacy and historical view = = 
 For a few years after his assassination , Garfield 's life story was seen as an exemplar of the American success story : that even the poorest boy might someday become President of the United States . Peskin noted that " in mourning Garfield , Americans were not only honoring a president ; they were paying tribute to a man whose life story embodied their own most cherished aspirations " . As the rivalry between Stalwarts and Half @-@ Breeds faded from the scene in the late 1880s and after , so too did memories of Garfield . Beginning in 1882 , the year after Garfield 's death , the U.S. Post Office began issuing postage stamps honoring the late President . Despite his short term as President , nine different issues were printed over the years . In the 1890s , Americans became disillusioned with politicians , and looked elsewhere for inspiration , focusing on industrialists , labor leaders , scientists , and others as their heroes . Increasingly , Garfield 's short time as president was forgotten . 
 The 20th century saw no revival for Garfield . Thomas Wolfe deemed the presidents of the Gilded Age , including Garfield , " lost Americans " whose " gravely vacant and bewhiskered faces mixed , melted , swam together " . The politicians of the Gilded Age faded from the public eye , their luster eclipsed by those who had influenced America outside of political office during that time : the robber barons , the inventors , those who had sought social reform , and others who had lived as America rapidly changed . Current events and more recent figures occupied America 's attention : according to Ackerman , " the busy Twentieth Century has made Garfield 's era seem remote and irrelevant , its leaders ridiculed for their very obscurity . " 
 Garfield 's biographers , and those who have studied his presidency , tend to think well of him , and that his presidency saw a promising start before its untimely end . Historian Justus D. Doenecke , while deeming Garfield a bit of an enigma , chronicles his achievements , " by winning a victory over the Stalwarts , he enhanced both the power and prestige of his office . As a man , he was intelligent , sensitive , and alert , and his knowledge of how government worked was unmatched . " Yet Doenecke criticizes Garfield 's dismissal of Merritt in Robertson 's favor , and wonders if the president was truly in command of the situation even after the latter 's confirmation . According to Caldwell , writing in 1931 , " If Garfield lives in history , it will be partly on account of the charm of his personality — but also because in life and in death , he struck the first shrewd blows against a dangerous system of boss rule which seemed for a time about to engulf the politics of the nation . Perhaps if he had lived he could have done no more . " Rutkow writes , " James Abram Garfield 's presidency is reduced to a tantalizing ' what if . ' " 
 Peskin believes Garfield deserves more credit for his political career than he has received : 
 True , his accomplishments were neither bold nor heroic , but his was not an age that called for heroism . His stormy presidency was brief and , and in some respects , unfortunate , but he did leave the office stronger than he found it . As a public man he had a hand in almost every issue of national importance for almost two decades , while as a party leader he , along with Blaine , forged the Republican Party into the instrument that would lead the United States into the twentieth century . 
 = 12th Light Horse Regiment ( Australia ) = 
 The 12th Light Horse Regiment was a mounted unit of the Australian Army . It was raised in New South Wales in 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) for service during the First World War . After fighting at Gallipoli as reinforcements , the regiment served in the Sinai and Palestine campaign against the Ottoman Empire , seeing action in several notable battles including Beersheba , the capture of Jerusalem , Megiddo and the capture of Damascus . In the aftermath of the war , the regiment was used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising , before being disbanded in late 1919 . 
 In 1921 , as part of a re @-@ organisation of Australia 's military following the disbandment of the AIF , the regiment was re @-@ raised as a part @-@ time unit of the Citizens Force based in New South Wales . It remained in existence throughout the inter @-@ war years until it was amalgamated with the 24th Light Horse Regiment in 1936 as a result of manpower shortages . The 12th Light Horse Regiment was re @-@ formed in 1938 and undertook garrison duties in Australia during the Second World War , having been converted first to a motor regiment and then to an armoured car regiment . It was disbanded in 1943 without having seen action and was never re @-@ raised . Its honours and traditions are perpetuated in the 12th / 16th Hunter River Lancers .

 The 12th Light Horse Regiment was established on 1 March 1915 at Liverpool , New South Wales , and two days later began forming at Holsworthy as part of the all @-@ volunteer Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , which was raised for service overseas during the First World War . Drawing the majority of its personnel from outback New South Wales , the regiment was assigned to the 4th Light Horse Brigade along with the 11th and 13th Light Horse Regiments and was placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Percy Abbott . Upon establishment , the regiment had an authorised strength of 25 officers and 497 other ranks , who were organised into a regimental headquarters and three squadrons , each of which consisted of six troops . Armed usually with standard infantry weapons instead of swords or lances , and mounted on Australian Waler horses , the Australian light horse regiments performed several roles and were similar to both cavalry and mounted infantry . They mainly fought dismounted , using their horses to obtain mobility that foot soldiers did not possess , but they could also conduct certain cavalry roles , such as scouting and screening , while mounted . 
 Following this , the regiment undertook basic training including weapons handling , ceremonial drill , mounted and dismounted tactics and regimental manoeuvres . In late April , they marched through the centre of Sydney as part of a farewell before deploying overseas . On 11 June , after the brigade had concentrated , the regiment embarked upon the troopship SS Suevic . After four days steaming , the ship put into Adelaide , South Australia , where the regiment disembarked their horses due to concerns about death rates among horses travelling at that time of year . The men continued on their journey three days later , undertaking rifle and signals training on deck during the day . They crossed the equator in the early afternoon on 5 July ; a short time later an epidemic of measles broke out . 
 On 11 July , the 4th Light Horse Brigade received orders to interrupt its journey to Egypt and instead disembark at Aden , where an Ottoman attack was expected . They were briefly put ashore during this time and conducted a reconnaissance to the frontier , before undertaking a 6 mi ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) route march . The expected attack did not come and on 18 June the regiment re @-@ embarked , arriving at Suez on 23 June . Moving into a camp at Heliopolis , near Cairo , after receiving a draft of 54 reinforcements and about 350 replacement horses , the regiment began a period of intense training and guard duties as they acclimatised to the local conditions . 
 = = = Gallipoli = = = 
 Elsewhere , the Gallipoli campaign had developed into a stalemate . The regiments of the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Brigades had already been sent to the peninsula as reinforcements ; however , the failed August Offensive had resulted in heavy casualties for the Australians and further reinforcements were required . As a result , the regiments of the 4th Light Horse Brigade were broken up to make up the losses in the other brigades . The troops were not initially informed of this , and following a train trip to Alexandria on 25 August they embarked upon the transport SS Marquette and sailed to Lemnos Island where they were transferred to Prince Abbas . Early on the morning of 29 August , the regiment went ashore at Anzac Cove upon lighters , and later that afternoon received the news that they were to be broken up and distributed among the other New South Wales light horse regiments that were already ashore . The Machine @-@ Gun Section and ' A ' Squadron were sent to the 1st Light Horse Regiment around " Walker 's Ridge " , becoming that regiment 's ' B ' Squadron ; ' B ' Squadron went to the 7th Light Horse Regiment at " Ryrie 's Post " , adopting the designation of ' D ' Squadron ; and ' C ' Squadron went to the 6th Light Horse Regiment around " Holly Spur " and " Lone Pine " , becoming their ' D ' Squadron . The Regimental Headquarters was absorbed by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade 's headquarters , while Abbott took command of the 10th Light Horse Regiment . 
 For the remainder of the campaign , about 600 men from the regiment – including a batch of reinforcements that arrived in early October – carried out mainly defensive duties before leaving with the last Australian troops to be evacuated from the peninsula on 20 December . They did not take part in any large @-@ scale battles , but were involved in fighting off a number of sharp attacks . The exact number of casualties suffered is not known , but 18 men from the regiment are known to have been killed in this time . 
 = = = Sinai = = = 
 Following their evacuation from Gallipoli , the regiment was reconstituted on 22 February 1916 when all three squadrons assembled at Heliopolis . Under a new commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel John Royston – a veteran of the Boer War who had replaced Abbott after the latter had been sent to England – the regiment began to re @-@ form . At the time of re @-@ forming , it had been intended that the 12th would be assigned to the 5th Division as its divisional light horse regiment ; however , it was decided to reduce the size of divisional light horse components to a squadron , and the 12th were removed from the 5th Division 's order of battle . Although other units , such as part of the 4th and all of the 13th Light Horse Regiment , were sent to Europe to fight on the Western Front , the 12th , along with the bulk of the Australian light horse units , were to remain in the Middle East , where they would take part in the Sinai and Palestine campaign . Initially , the regiment was not brigaded and served as a detached unit . 
 After conducting infantry training around Tel @-@ el @-@ Kebir in early April , the regiment crossed the Suez Canal along a new railway that was being constructed through the Sinai towards Palestine . Here it was established around Kantara and a position known as " Hill 70 " . The following month , Ottoman forces clashed with positions around the railhead and on 14 May , a British garrison was attacked at Dueidar , about 9 mi ( 15 km ) away from the regiment 's positions at Hill 70 . Tasked with relieving the Royal Scots Fusiliers , two squadrons were dispatched . Delayed by a navigational error , and suffering from heat , the regiment arrived in some disorder . After this , they began work on constructing defences , while one squadron was detached to garrison Kasr @-@ el @-@ Nil ; in early July they were sent on to Moascar . 
 Later that month , the 12th were relieved at Dueidar and moved back to Heliopolis . While there , Lieutenant Colonel Harold McIntosh took command of the regiment following Royston 's elevation to temporary commander of the 2nd Light Horse Brigade . On 27 July the regiment , without its machine @-@ gun section which had been detached to the 2nd Light Horse Brigade , was sent to Gebel <unk> to relieve the 9th Light Horse Regiment . After undertaking the first part of the journey to <unk> by train , they marched the rest of the way . In early August , Ottoman forces launched an attack in the Battle of Romani . During this fighting , the 12th Light Horse Regiment provided flank protection , carrying out patrols , and was not directly engaged except for its machine @-@ gun section . 
 In early September , the regiment moved to <unk> where they were attached to a British column along with the 11th Light Horse Regiment , a regiment from the City of London Yeomanry , and an artillery battery . Under the command of Major General A.G. Dallas , they carried out a raid in the Maghara Hills on an Ottoman position 37 mi ( 60 km ) away . Upon arrival , after discovering that the Ottoman force was greater than expected , Dallas decided to limit the operation to a demonstration rather than a full attack . Within this plan , the 12th was allocated the task of advancing on the right flank during the attack . They proceeded to advance across the open ground on their horses , before dismounting to ascend towards the high ground . As the Ottoman fire increased , the 12th provided covering fire with machine @-@ guns and rifles while the 11th came forward using their bayonets to clear the defenders from the forward position . The light horsemen were then ordered to withdraw , instead of assaulting the main position . 
 In early October , while at Mageibra , the regiment received orders that they were to be remounted on camels and be re @-@ designated as the " 2nd Australian Camel Regiment " , but largely the regiment continued to refer to itself by its old designation . This was due to a plan to convert both the 11th and 12th Light Horse Regiments to <unk> ; however , it did not occur . In late October , the 12th were sent to the rear to rest , arriving at the railhead at El Ferdan on the Suez . ' A ' Squadron established itself there , while ' B ' and ' C ' Squadrons and the Machine @-@ Gun Section were sent to Ferry Post . During this time they undertook frequent patrols , with ' A ' Squadron permanently detaching a troop to <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Palestine = = = 
 In early 1917 , the 4th Light Horse Brigade was reconstituted at Ferry Post on 13 February under the command of Brigadier General John Meredith . Assigned to the brigade along with the 4th and 11th Light Horse Regiments , the regiment 's time of operating as a detached unit came to an end ; they officially readopted the designation of 12th Light Horse Regiment at this time . For the next month they undertook training exercises before joining the advance into Palestine , while some men from the regiment were also detached to join Dunsterforce in Persia . In April , the regiment took part in the Second Battle of Gaza . Assigned the task of attacking the Atawineh Redoubt early in the morning of 19 April , the regiment dismounted about 2 mi ( 3 @.@ 5 km ) from it and advanced on foot . Initially , they made good progress and captured a ridge about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) from their objective without even firing a shot . As the defensive fire grew more intense , the men were forced to the ground and began fire and movement drills . Spread thinly across a 1 @,@ 000 yd ( 900 m ) front with just 500 men , the 12th was dangerously exposed as machine @-@ gun fire began to inflict casualties , checking the Australians ' advance . Nevertheless , the regiment held its position throughout the day until being withdrawn to a nearby hill that night , by which time it had suffered more than 30 percent casualties . These included the commanding officer , McIntosh , who was gravely wounded and subsequently died of his wounds . He was replaced by the second @-@ in @-@ command , Major Donald Cameron , who was later promoted to lieutenant colonel . 
 The day after the attack , the 12th Light Horse Regiment dug @-@ in and sent out patrols in preparation for a possible Ottoman counterattack . Although they were harassed throughout the day with sniper fire , the attack never came . After three days they were withdrawn back to <unk> , where they worked to improve defences and conducted patrols for the next fortnight before dispatching two squadrons in early May to attack an Ottoman foraging party at Esani . The attack proved unsuccessful , as the Australians ' approach was spotted , allowing the Ottomans and their Bedouin workers to withdraw before they could be engaged . 
 A period of stalemate followed , during which time the regiment , along with the rest of the brigade , rotated between the forward position at Fara and other positions in support and reserve at <unk> and Marakeb as preparations were made for a future offensive . The regiment 's next major action came in October 1917 . Conceived as part of an attack towards the Jerusalem to Jaffa line , the regiment took part in the Battle of Beersheba . During this battle , along with the 4th Light Horse Regiment , the 12th Light Horse carried out a successful mounted charge , advancing over open ground late in the afternoon to get under the Ottoman guns and capture the town and its vital water supplies . Late in the afternoon , the 12th Light Horse Regiment advanced , according to historian Henry Gullett , on a " squadron frontage in three lines " 300 – 500 yd ( 270 – 460 m ) apart , with the 4th Light Horse Regiment to launch a " pure cavalry " charge , the troopers advancing with bayonets in their hands . Advancing over 6 @,@ 600 yd ( 6 @,@ 000 m ) , the light horsemen were subjected to rifle and machine @-@ gun fire and artillery bombardment from the flanks and trenches to their front . Supporting artillery helped suppress the machine @-@ gun fire from the flanks , and the speed of the charge made it difficult for the Ottoman gunners to adjust their range . The Ottoman trenches were not protected with wire and after jumping over the trenches , the light horsemen dismounted and hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting followed . While most of the 4th Light Horse and some of the 12th Light Horse dismounted , the remainder stayed mounted , continuing their charge into the town . The British official historian claims " more than half the dismounted troops in the town were captured or killed , " while 15 of the 28 guns in the town were captured by the Desert Mounted Corps and XX Corps . Over 700 Ottoman soldiers were captured and , more significantly for the Australians , over 400 @,@ 000 litres of water secured . In achieving this , the 12th lost 24 men killed and 15 wounded ; 44 horses were also killed , while another 60 were wounded or became sick . 
 The success at Beersheba significantly reduced Ottoman resistance , but heavy fighting continued around Gaza and elsewhere , including the Battle of Tel el Khuweilfe , and the regiment remained at Beersheba for four days to receive remounts . Gaza fell in early November and , as Ottoman forces fell back , the British Empire troops followed them in pursuit . The 12th advanced further into Palestine as part of the plan to capture Jerusalem . On 7 November , during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria , the regiment joined the 11th Light Horse Regiment in an attack in support of the 60th Division around Khurbet <unk> , but was forced to halt their charge and dismount amidst artillery and machine @-@ gun fire as their horses needed water . The following day , the 12th was sent to Beit Hanun to contact the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade , before searching for water around Sin Sin and <unk> , where they captured a number of Ottoman troops before rejoining the Australian Mounted Division at Huj . On 10 November , the 12th provided support to the 11th Light Horse Regiment when they came under attack at Hill 248 by a strong Ottoman counterattack , which was turned back . After moving on to Summeil the next day , one of the regiment 's squadrons received heavy fire while providing flank protection to the 54th Division as it attacked to the south of Et Tine . 
 Early on 14 November , in the aftermath of the Battle of Mughar Ridge , a reconnaissance patrol to Et Tine found it had been evacuated and the 12th occupied the town . In doing so , they secured a water source and a quantity of supplies , although a large amount of equipment was lost to a fire that had been set by the withdrawing garrison . The 12th then took up an observation position at El <unk> to support the British flank before moving to Wadi <unk> on 18 November to water their horses . They were then ordered to launch an attack around Latron during the Battle of Nebi <unk> , but after moving to Abu <unk> where they dismounted , the regiment was recalled to Junction Station . From there , the following day amidst heavy rain they moved to Deiran . Three days later , the 12th encamped at Mejdel for a week of rest along with the majority of the Australian Mounted Division . After a brief respite , as the 4th Light Horse Brigade was sent to El Burj to relieve British forces there , the 12th went in to reserve ; the horses were sent back to Deiran , and dismounted patrols and reconnaissance parties were sent out . 
 In early December , the 12th relieved the Scots Fusiliers in the Judean Hills to the north of Jerusalem . Supported by artillery , the regiment advanced and on 6 December established itself along the <unk> – <unk> – <unk> line . Upon arrival , they moved into a defensive position about 900 yd ( 800 m ) from Ottoman positions . Initially , it had only been planned for the unit to stay there for one night and as a result most of the cold weather equipment had been left behind . Nevertheless , the stay was extended and as winter came to Judea , heavy rain set in and the temperature dropped . Redoubts were established along the front for shelter , while the men also took to caves in the hills briefly to escape the elements , although these were soon abandoned when they were found to contain lice . On 11 December , the 4th Light Horse Brigade , having been relieved by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , was withdrawn back to <unk> <unk> , where they became the Australian Mounted Division 's reserve formation . On 28 December , the brigade advanced to the <unk> – <unk> – <unk> line to hold ground that had been captured as part of the advance on Jerusalem , and the 12th established itself at <unk> . 
 In early in January 1918 , the regiment received orders to move to Belah , on the coast near Gaza . For the next three months they undertook training there . In March , the 4th Light Horse Brigade , commanded by Brigadier General William Grant , was inspected by the Duke of Connaught who , according to author Kenneth Hollis , likened the " snap and automatic precision " of their ceremonial drill to " a battalion of Grenadiers " . The following month they moved to <unk> , near Jaffa , to support the attack on the Ottoman position that had been established around <unk> and <unk> on the railway line that stretched north in the direction of Haifa . Although the 74th Division made some progress on the flank , the regiment 's involvement in the attack was called off due to heavy resistance and the 12th , along with the rest of the 4th Light Horse Brigade , was sent to the Jordan Valley , which had been occupied by British Empire forces . Taking up positions near Jericho , they then sent out patrols to the Jordan and the river el Auja .

 In late April 1918 , the regiment joined an attack on Es Salt , which was undertaken as part of a plan to capture the village so it could be used as a staging point for a further advance towards the railway junction at Deraa . The regiment 's role in the raid was to advance up the eastern side of the Jordan River to capture a crossing 19 mi ( 31 km ) to the north of Es Salt at Jisr ed Damieh to stop Ottoman reinforcements being sent to Es Salt from Nablus . Initially , the operation met with success , and although two of the 12th 's squadrons met strong resistance and were stopped at the bridge on the Es Salt track , the village was secured by dusk on 30 April by troops of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade . Throughout the night , the 4th Light Horse Brigade assumed defensive positions : the 12th in the centre with the 4th on their left and the 11th on their right . The following day , they were confronted by a force of around 4 @,@ 000 Ottoman infantry along the Es Salt track , while another force of 1 @,@ 000 infantry and 500 cavalry were further south , ready to force a second crossing . After coming under attack , and finding themselves hard pressed , the 4th Light Horse Brigade was forced back to the south , exposing the rear of the troops holding Es Salt . Over the course of next few days little progress was made by the British Empire troops and , despite the arrival of reinforcements , the commander of the operation , Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel , decided that it was necessary to withdraw from the position on 3 May . The regiment crossed the Jordan and two days later had returned to its previous positions around Jericho . 
 Throughout May the regiment constructed defences around Musallabeh in temperatures as high as 50 ° C ( 122 ° F ) , and flies , scorpions , spiders and snakes also infested the regiment 's camp . Many men from the 12th became sick with malaria and other conditions , before they were moved to Solomon 's Pools , where the climate was more bearable . In late June , the regiment manned defences in the Jordan Valley before being sent to a camp amongst the olive groves at Ludd in early August . While there , the regiment received cavalry training and was issued swords , along with the rest of the Australian Mounted Division . 
 The regiment departed Ludd on 18 September , taking up camp near Jaffa . Before dawn the next morning , the regiment led the Australian Mounted Division 's advance towards <unk> and Tiberias , moving by day to a position near Nahr <unk> where they rested until midnight . The 12th then trotted on to Liktera , 37 mi ( 60 km ) behind the original Ottoman front line . There the regiment rested again until midday before making for <unk> <unk> ; encountering a number of surrendering Ottoman troops along the way , it arrived there in the afternoon but halted only briefly before continuing on to the mouth of the Plain of Esdraelon , where they bivouacked for the night . The next morning , the regiment moved to support the 3rd Light Horse Brigade , which had taken between 8 @,@ 000 and 9 @,@ 000 prisoners during the capture of Jenin . They also sent out patrols to the outlying villages and hills and established signal stations . 
 On 22 September , following the 4th Light Horse Brigade 's relief by the 5th Light Horse Brigade , the regiment was tasked with escorting 5 @,@ 000 prisoners to El Lejjun before moving to Jisr ed Mejamie , along the Jordan River near its confluence with the Sea of Galilee at Lake Tiberias . From there , in the early hours of 25 September , the 12th Light Horse Regiment , along with the rest of the brigade and one regiment from the 5th Light Horse Brigade , departed to conduct a dawn attack during the Battle of Samakh before rejoining the division 's advance to Tiberias . It was still dark when the advancing Australians came under heavy rifle and machine @-@ gun fire from German and Ottoman positions near the railway station about 0 @.@ 9 mi ( 1 @.@ 5 km ) away . In response , the 11th Light Horse Regiment conducted a mounted charge that was checked just short of the objective , and one squadron from the 12th advanced along the left flank on horseback , while the other squadrons attempted to draw fire . Once close enough , the squadron from the 12th dismounted and attacked with their bayonets , which forced most of the defenders out of the village , except the Germans defending the fortified railway station house . At this point , the defenders raised a white flag of truce , and as several Australians from the 11th and 12th Light Horse advanced to take their surrender , the Germans manning the station killed them . The Australians then attacked , clearing the building , and later refused to bury the German dead , which amounted to 98 , leaving their bodies to be looted by villagers . In the battle , the regiment lost one man killed and 10 wounded ; losses suffered by the horses amounted to 61 killed and 27 injured . 
 The regiment then moved towards the high ground on the western side of the Jordan River . Mid @-@ morning on 25 September they reached El <unk> . In the afternoon , after the garrison was seen to withdraw , they advanced in concert with a number of armoured cars and at 3 : 00 pm the regiment entered Tiberias , capturing 200 German and Ottoman troops and a large amount of stores . From there , on 27 September , they began the final advance to Damascus , crossing the Jordan River and , early the following day , established a divisional bridgehead around Et Min during the Battle of Jisr <unk> Yakub . On 30 September , about 9 mi ( 15 km ) from their objective , the 12th , along with the 4th , mounted a charge at <unk> . Forming up with the 4th on their left , the regiment attacked across a maize field towards a spur near the Jebel es Aswad , advancing on a position that they believed was strongly held . In the end , the defenders did not fire a shot before withdrawing and the Australians took the position without suffering a casualty , capturing 12 machine @-@ guns and taking 22 prisoners . The 12th then spent the night south @-@ west of the city and the following day , 1 October 1918 , it was one of the first Australian units to enter Damascus , sending patrols in ahead of the main advance . A period of guard duty followed before the regiment was withdrawn to the city 's outskirts , suffering heavily from illness . Shortly after this , on 30 October , while the regiment was moving towards Homs , the Armistice of Mudros came into effect , ending the fighting .

 Following the end of the war , the 12th Light Horse Regiment remained in the Middle East for a number of months , during which time , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers , they were used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising . During the uprising , the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area . As the situation was resolved , the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian Remount Depot at Moascar . Due to concerns about costs , availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions , the decision was made that the horses would not be returned to Australia , but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service , or to local Egyptians . According to Hollis , though , many were also put down by the troopers due to concerns they might be mistreated . 
 Mid @-@ morning on 22 July the 12th Light Horse Regiment 's personnel embarked upon the transport <unk> at Kantara . Cruising via Colombo , in Ceylon , the regiment made landfall at Fremantle on 17 August 1919 . There the men were granted a brief period of leave before the ship continued on to Sydney . After stops at Adelaide and Melbourne , they arrived on 28 August , and the regiment was disbanded . 
 During the war , the regiment lost 67 men killed and 401 men wounded . Members of the regiment received the following decorations : three Distinguished Service Orders ( DSOs ) and one Bar ; five Military Crosses with one Bar ; nine Distinguished Conduct Medals with one Bar ; 14 Military Medals and 17 Mentions in Despatches . One member of the regiment , Major Eric Hyman , was nominated for the Victoria Cross for his involvement in the fighting around Beersheba . The award was never approved and instead Hyman received a DSO .

 In 1921 , the Citizens Force was reorganised to replicate the numerical designations of the AIF units and perpetuate their honours and traditions . As a result , the 12th Light Horse Regiment was re @-@ raised in the New England region of New South Wales and headquartered at Armidale . In re @-@ forming , the regiment drew lineage from the Citizens Forces ' 12th ( New England ) Light Horse , which had existed parallel to the AIF light horse regiment and had remained in Australia during the war . This regiment , through a complex series of reorganisations , traced its lineage to the 6th Australian Light Horse Regiment , which had been raised in 1903 and perpetuated units that had contributed personnel to fight in South Africa during the Boer War . 
 During this time , the regiment was assigned to the 2nd Cavalry Brigade , along with the 15th and 16th Light Horse Regiments . In 1927 , when territorial designations were adopted , the 12th Light Horse Regiment became known as the " New England Light Horse " . At the same time , the regiment adopted the motto of <unk> Fortuna Comes ( " Fortune Comes " ) . Initially , the strength of part @-@ time units was maintained through both voluntary and compulsory service , but after the election of the Scullin Labor government in 1929 – 30 , compulsory service ended and the Citizens Force was replaced with the all @-@ volunteer " Militia " . The economic hardships of the Great Depression and reduced training opportunities resulted in a decline in the number of volunteers and consequently a number units were disbanded or amalgamated . 
 Amidst the austerity of the inter @-@ war years , the regiment remained in existence until 1 October 1936 when it was merged with the 24th ( Gwydir ) Light Horse to form the 12th / 24th Light Horse . These two units were later delinked in 1938 as the Militia was expanded following increased political tensions in Europe . In March 1942 , during the Second World War , the 12th Light Horse was converted to a motor regiment , known as the 12th Motor Regiment . In September 1942 , it was redesignated the 12th Armoured Car Regiment , and assigned to the 3rd Armoured Division . During this period a process of mechanisation resulted in the last of the light horse units giving up their horses . Throughout 1943 , the Australian Army was faced with a manpower shortage and as the Japanese threat to mainland Australia decreased many Militia armoured units were broken up and their personnel sent to other units as reinforcements . As a result , the regiment was disbanded on 19 October 1943 , having only undertaken garrison duty within Australia . 
 When Australia 's part @-@ time military force was reformed in 1948 as the Citizens Military Force , the regiment was not re @-@ raised in its own right , although an amalgamated unit known as the 12th / 16th Hunter River Lancers was established . Through this unit the 12th Light Horse Regiment 's honours and traditions are perpetuated .

 = Ellen Wilkinson = 
 Ellen Cicely Wilkinson PC ( 8 October 1891 – 6 February 1947 ) was a British Labour Party politician who served as Minister of Education from July 1945 until her death . Earlier in her career , as the Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Jarrow , she became a national figure when she figured prominently in the 1936 Jarrow March of the town 's unemployed to London , to petition for the right to work . Although unsuccessful at that time , the march provided an iconic image for the 1930s , and helped to form post @-@ Second World War attitudes to unemployment and social justice . 
 Wilkinson was born into a poor though ambitious Manchester family , and embraced socialism at an early age . After graduating from the University of Manchester she worked for a women 's suffrage organisation and later as a trade union officer . Inspired by the Russian Revolution of 1917 , Wilkinson joined the British Communist Party , and preached revolutionary socialism while seeking constitutional routes to political power through the Labour Party . She was elected Labour MP for Middlesbrough East in 1924 , and supported the 1926 General Strike . In the 1929 – 31 Labour government she served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to the junior Health Minister . Following her defeat at Middlesbrough in 1931 , Wilkinson became a prolific journalist and writer before returning to parliament as Jarrow 's MP in 1935 . She was a strong advocate for the Republican faction in the Spanish Civil War , and made several visits to the battle zones . 
 During the Second World War Wilkinson served in Churchill 's wartime coalition as a junior minister , mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison . She supported Morrison 's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party 's leader ; nevertheless , when he formed his postwar government Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education . By this time her health was poor , the legacy of years of overwork . She saw her main task in office as the implementation of the wartime coalition 's 1944 Education Act , rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party . Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school leaving age from 14 to 15 . In the exceptionally cold English winter of 1946 – 47 , she succumbed to a bronchial disease , and died after an overdose of medication which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental .

 = = = = Early years = = = = 
 Ellen Wilkinson was born on 8 October 1891 , at 41 Coral Street in the Manchester district of Chorlton @-@ on @-@ Medlock . She was the third child and second daughter of Richard Wilkinson , a cotton worker who became an insurance agent , and his wife , Ellen , née Wood . Richard Wilkinson was a pillar of his local Wesleyan Methodist church , and combined a strong sense of social justice with forthright views on self @-@ help ; rather than espousing working @-@ class solidarity his view , according to Ellen , was : " I have pulled myself out of the gutter , why can 't they ? " Entirely self @-@ educated , he ensured that his children received the best schooling available , encouraged them to read widely , and inculcated strong Christian principles . 
 At the age of six Ellen began attending what she described as " a filthy elementary school with the five classes in one room " . A series of childhood illnesses kept her at home for two years , but she used the time learning to read . On her return to school she made rapid progress , and at the age of 11 won a scholarship to Ardwick Higher Elementary Grade School . Outspoken and often rebellious , after two years she transferred to Stretford Road Secondary School for Girls , an experience she later remembered as " horrid and unmanageable " . She made up for the school 's shortcomings by reading , with her father 's encouragement , the works of Haeckel , Thomas Huxley and Darwin . 
 Teaching was one of the few careers then open to educated working @-@ class girls , and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £ 25 that enabled her to begin her training . For half the week she attended the Manchester Day Training College , and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School . Her classroom approach — she sought to interest her pupils , rather than impose learning by rote — led to frequent clashes with her superiors , and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching . At the college , where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day , she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford . By this time she was impatient with religion ; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute . At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party ( ILP ) , and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier , whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact . Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had " brought me into the Socialist movement ... It always makes me humble to think of her indomitable courage " . After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell , Wilkinson took up the cause of women 's suffrage , the major women 's rights issue of the day . Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters , she made a considerable impression on Mitchell , who later remembered her as " brilliant and gifted " . 
 = = = = University = = = = 
 Determined to carve a career for herself outside teaching , in 1910 Wilkinson sat for and won the Jones Open History Scholarship , which gave her a place at Manchester University . There , she found many opportunities to extend her political activities . She joined the university 's branch of the Fabian Society , and eventually became its joint secretary . She continued her suffragist work by joining the Manchester Society for Women 's Suffrage , where she impressed Margaret Ashton , the first woman member of Manchester City Council , by her efforts in the North Manchester and Gorton constituencies . Through these and other campaigning activities Wilkinson met many of the contemporary leaders of the radical left — the veteran campaigner Charlotte Despard , the ILP leader William Crawford Anderson , and Beatrice and Sidney Webb among others . She also came under the influence of Walton Newbold , an older student who later became the United Kingdom 's first Communist MP . The two were briefly engaged , and although this was soon broken off , they remained close political associates for many years . 
 In her final year at university Wilkinson was co @-@ opted to the executive committee of the University Socialist Federation ( USF ) , an inter @-@ institutional organisation formed to bring together socialist @-@ minded students from all over the country . This brought her new contacts , who would typically meet at Fabian summer schools to hear lectures by ILP leaders such as Ramsay MacDonald and Arthur Henderson , and trade union activists such as Ben Tillett and Margaret Bondfield . Amid these distractions she continued to study hard , and won several prizes . In the summer of 1913 she sat her finals and was awarded her BA degree — not the First Class honours that her tutors had predicted , but an Upper Second . Wilkinson rationalised thus : " I deliberately sacrificed my First ... to devote my spare time to a strike raging in Manchester " .

 = = = = Trade union organiser = = = = 
 On leaving university in June 1913 , Wilkinson became a paid worker for the National Union of Women 's Suffrage Societies ( NUWSS ) . She helped to organise the Suffrage Pilgrimage of July 1913 , when more than 50 @,@ 000 women marched from all over the country to a mass rally in Hyde Park , London . She began to develop a fuller understanding of the mechanics of politics and campaigning , and became an accomplished speaker , able to hold her own even in the most hostile public meetings . 
 When the First World War began in August 1914 , Wilkinson , like many in the Labour movement , condemned it as an imperialist exercise that would result in the deaths of millions of workers . Nevertheless , she took the role of honorary secretary of the Manchester branch of the Women 's Emergency Corps ( WEC ) , a body which found suitable war work for women volunteers . With the advent of war the NUWSS became divided between pro @-@ war and pro @-@ peace factions . They ultimately separated , the <unk> ( including Wilkinson 's Manchester branch ) eventually aligning themselves with the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom ( WIL ) . With little suffrage activity to organise , Wilkinson looked for another job , and in July 1915 was appointed as a national organiser for the Amalgamated Union of Co @-@ operative Employees ( <unk> ) , with particular responsibility for the recruitment of women into the union . In this post she fought for equal pay for equal work , and for the rights of unskilled and lower @-@ paid workers when these interests conflicted with those of the higher @-@ paid craft unions . She organized a series of strikes to attain these goals with notable successes in Carlisle , Coatbridge , Glasgow and Grangemouth . She was less successful in managing a lengthy dispute at the Longsight print works in Manchester , in the summer of 1918 , where opponents described her tactics as " unreasonable guerrilla warfare " . As a result of her actions Wilkinson briefly lost her job at the union , only to be swiftly reinstated after protests by members and after apologising for her role in the strike . From 1918 she served as her union 's nominee on several Trade Boards — national consultative bodies which attempted to set minimum wage rates for low @-@ paid workers . In 1921 <unk> amalgamated with the National Union of Warehouse and General Workers to form the National Union of <unk> and Allied Workers ( NUDAW ) . 
 Wilkinson 's work for the union brought new alliances , and useful new friendships — including one with John Jagger , the union 's future president . She remained an active Fabian , and after the Fabian Research Department became the Labour Research Department in 1917 , served on the new body 's executive committee . Through these connections she became a member of the National Guilds League ( <unk> ) , an organisation that promoted industrial democracy , workers ' control and producer associations in a national system of guilds . She maintained her connection with the WIL , whose 1919 conference adopted a non @-@ pacifist stance that justified armed struggle as a means of defeating capitalism . After visiting Ireland for the WIL in 1920 she became an outspoken critic of the British government 's actions there , in particular its use of the " Black and Tans " as a paramilitary force . She gave evidence about the conduct of British forces in Ireland at the Congressional Committee of Investigation in Washington in December of that year . She called for an immediate truce and the release of republican prisoners . 
 = = = = Communism = = = = 
 Along with many others in the Labour movement , Wilkinson 's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917 . She saw communism as the shape of the future , and when the Communist Party of Great Britain ( CPGB ) was formed in the summer of 1920 , Wilkinson was one of a group of ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members . For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity , although she kept her membership in the Labour Party , which at the time accepted dual CPGB / Labour memberships . 
 In 1921 Wilkinson attended the Red International of Labour Unions Congress and the Second Congress of Communist Women in Moscow , where she met several Russian communist leaders , including the Defence Minister Leon Trotsky , and Nadezhda Krupskaya , the educationist who was Lenin 's wife ; Wilkinson considered Krupskaya 's speech the best at the Congress . The main outcome of the gathering was the foundation of the Red International of Labour Unions , often known as the " Profintern " . The aim of this organisation was to seek revolutionary change through industrial action , leading to the overthrow of world capitalism . At home , although she failed to persuade her union , NUDAW , to affiliate to the Profintern , Wilkinson continued to promote Russian achievements , especially its emancipation of women workers . In November 1922 , at a meeting celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Russian Revolution , Wilkinson said that the Russian people could look forward with hope , and asked whether the same could be said of the people condemned to live their lives in the slums of Manchester . However , Wilkinson found herself increasingly at odds with communists in Manchester , over the party 's industrial and wider international strategies . 
 = = = = Seeking elective office = = = = 
 Wilkinson was an early and lifetime supporter of the National Council of Labour Colleges , established in 1921 with NUDAW backing with the aim of educating working @-@ class students in working @-@ class principles . She became a NUDAW @-@ sponsored parliamentary candidate , and in 1923 , while still a CPGB member , sought nomination as the Labour Party 's parliamentary candidate for the Gorton constituency . She was unsuccessful , but in November 1923 the Gorton ward elected her to Manchester City Council ; Hannah Mitchell , her co @-@ worker in prewar suffrage campaigns , was a fellow councillor . In her short council career — she served only until 1926 — Wilkinson 's main areas of concern were unemployment , housing , child welfare and education . 
 When the prime minister , Stanley Baldwin , called a general election for December 1923 , Wilkinson was adopted as Labour 's parliamentary candidate for Ashton @-@ under @-@ Lyne . She made no secret of her Communist affiliations , stating that " we shall have only one class in this country , the working class " . In a three @-@ way contest she came third , behind the Conservative and the Liberal candidate . The general election resulted in a hung parliament , and a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald took office . During its short term in power , the Labour Party proscribed the Communist Party and outlawed dual membership . Faced with a choice , Wilkinson left the CPGB , citing the party 's " exclusive and dictatorial methods which make impossible the formation of a real left wing among the progressives of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party " . After this , she was selected as Labour 's candidate for the constituency of Middlesbrough East . 
 = = = Middlesbrough MP = = = 
 = = = = In opposition , 1924 – 29 = = = = 
 On 8 October 1924 MacDonald 's Labour government resigned , after losing a confidence vote in the House of Commons . The latter stages of the ensuing general election were dominated by the controversy surrounding the Zinoviev letter , which generated a " Red Scare " shortly before polling day and contributed to a massive Conservative victory . Labour 's representation in the House of Commons fell to 152 , against the Conservatives ' 415 ; Wilkinson was the only woman elected in the Labour ranks , winning Middlesbrough East with a majority of 927 over her Conservative opponent . 
 Wilkinson 's arrival in the House of Commons attracted considerable press comment , much of it related to her bright red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing . She informed MPs : " I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world — I know I do not look like it , but I do " . The Woman 's Leader described her as a " vigorous , uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious , forcible and hard @-@ headed politician " . As an unofficial spokesperson for women 's rights , Wilkinson achieved one of her first parliamentary victories in 1925 , when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill . She combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches , in March 1926 , to attack the government 's proposed decrease in expenditure on women 's training centres . Wilkinson 's ODNB biographer , Brian Harrison , acknowledges that while " women 's issues " were often to the fore in her speeches , she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist , and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former . 
 During the nine days ' duration of the May 1926 General Strike , Wilkinson toured the country to press the strikers ' case at meetings and rallies . She was devastated when the Trades Union Congress called off the strike . Early in June she joined George Lansbury and other leading Labour and union figures on the platform at an Albert Hall rally which raised around £ 1 @,@ 200 for the benefit of the miners , who continued on strike despite the TUC decision . Wilkinson 's reflections on the strike were recorded in A Workers ' History of the Great Strike ( 1927 ) , which she co @-@ authored with Raymond Postgate and Frank Horrabin , and in a semi @-@ autobiographical novel , Clash , which she published in 1929 . She also visited the United States in August 1926 to raise financial support for the miners , provoking criticism from the Conservative prime minister Baldwin who denied that the lockout was causing hardship . 
 Throughout her career Wilkinson was an opponent of imperialism . In February 1927 she attended the Founding Congress of the League Against Imperialism in Brussels , where she met and befriended the Indian nationalist leader Jawaharlal Nehru . In 1927 she was elected to the Labour Party 's National Executive , which gave her a voice in the formulation of party policy . Her advance was noted with approval by Beatrice Webb , who saw in her a future candidate for high office — ahead of more senior Labour women such as Margaret Bondfield and Susan Lawrence . A tireless campaigner for women 's equality , she challenged the caricature of voteless younger women as ' flappers ' . On 29 March 1928 Wilkinson voted in the House of Commons for the bill that became the Representation of the People ( Equal Franchise ) Act 1928 , granting the vote to all women aged 21 or over . During the debate she said : " [ W ] e are doing at last a great act of justice to the women of the country ... just as we have [ previously ] opened the door to the older women , tonight we are opening it to those who are just entering on the threshold of life and in whose hands is the new life of the future country that we are going to build " .

 In May 1929 Baldwin called a general election . As a member of Labour 's National Executive , Wilkinson helped to draft her party 's manifesto , although her preference for a list of specific policy proposals was overruled in favour of a lengthy statement of ideals and objectives . In Middlesbrough she was re @-@ elected with an increased majority over her Conservative and Liberal opponents . Overall , Labour emerged from the election as the largest party , with 288 members ( nine of whom were women ) , while the Conservatives and Liberals won 260 and 59 respectively . MacDonald formed his second minority administration , and included two women in ministerial posts : Margaret Bondfield as Minister of Labour and Susan Lawrence as Parliamentary Secretary ( junior minister ) at the Ministry of Health . Wilkinson was not given office , but was made Lawrence 's Parliamentary Private Secretary ( PPS ) , an indication that she was marked down for future promotion . 
 Almost from its inception the second MacDonald administration was overwhelmed by the twin crises of rising unemployment and the world trade recession that followed the financial crash in the latter part of 1929 . The Labour Party was divided ; the Chancellor , Philip Snowden , favoured a strict curb on public expenditure , while others , including Wilkinson , believed that the problem was not over @-@ production , but under @-@ consumption . The solution , she argued , lay in increasing , not squeezing , the spending power of the poorest in society . On the issue of unemployment , Wilkinson supported Oswald Mosley 's " Memorandum " , a plan for economic reconstruction and public works that was rejected by the government on the grounds of cost ; Mosley resigned from the government in protest . 
 With Wilkinson 's assistance , the Mental Treatment Act 1930 received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1930 . In the same year she co @-@ sponsored a bill to limit shopworkers ' hours to 48 a week , and poured scorn on Conservatives opposing the measure who seemed , she said , to think that all shop work was carried out in the " soothing atmosphere " and " exquisite scents " of Jermyn Street and Bond Street . The bill was referred to a parliamentary committee , but got no further . As the parliament progressed , it became increasingly difficult to promote social legislation in the face of the mounting financial crisis and the use by the Conservative @-@ dominated House of Lords of its statutory delaying powers . 
 The divisions in the Labour Party became more acute during 1931 , as the government struggled to meet the May Report 's recommended expenditure cuts of £ 97 million , the majority ( £ 67 million ) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs . On 23 August 1931 the government collapsed . To implement the required cuts , MacDonald and a small number of Labour MPs formed a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals , while the bulk of the Labour Party , including Wilkinson , went into opposition . In the general election that followed in October the Labour Party was utterly routed , retaining only 52 of its parliamentary seats . In Middlesbrough East Wilkinson 's vote was nearly the same as her 1929 total , but against a single candidate representing the National Government she was defeated by over 6 @,@ 000 votes . 
 = = = Out of parliament , 1931 – 35 = = = 
 Wilkinson rationalised Labour 's defeat in a Daily Express article , arguing that the party had lost because it was " not socialist enough " , a theme she built on in numerous radical newspaper and journal articles . In a less serious vein she published Peep at Politicians , a collection of humorous pen @-@ portraits of parliamentary colleagues and opponents . She wrote that Winston Churchill was " cheerfully indifferent as to whether any new [ ideas ] he acquires match the collection he already possesses " , and described Clement Attlee as " too fastidious for intrigue , and too modest for over @-@ ambition " . Her second novel , The Division Bell Mystery , set in the House of Commons , was published in 1932 ; Paula Bartley , Wilkinson 's biographer , acknowledges that Wilkinson was not a first @-@ class novelist , but " the autobiographical topicality of [ her ] books made them very appealing " . 
 In 1932 Wilkinson was invited by the India League to join a small delegation , to report on conditions in India . During the three @-@ month visit she met Gandhi , then in prison , and became convinced that his co @-@ operation was essential to any prospect of peace in the subcontinent . On her return home she delivered her conclusions in an uncompromising report , The Condition of India , published in 1934 . She visited Germany shortly after Hitler came to power in 1933 , and published a pamphlet , The Terror in Germany , that documented early incidents of Nazi outrage . She collaborated with a refugee from Hitler 's Germany , Edward Conze , to produce a major book , Why Fascism ? , which condemned the Labour Party 's gradualism and focus upon parliament as well as the failure of communist strategy , arguing for the need for grassroots workers ' unity and revolution to check the threat of fascism across Europe . Meanwhile , her parliamentary prospects had been revived by her selection as Labour candidate for Jarrow , a Tyneside shipbuilding town . Jarrow had been devastated early in the 1930s by the run @-@ down and closure of Palmers shipyard , the town 's main source of employment . Early in 1934 Wilkinson led a deputation of Jarrow 's unemployed to meet the prime minister , MacDonald , in his nearby Seaham constituency , and received sympathy but no positive action . She was unimpressed by the government 's Special Areas Act , passed late in 1934 and designed to assist distressed areas such as Jarrow ; she thought the legislation provided inadequate funding , and benefited employers more than workers . 
 = = = Jarrow MP = = = 
 = = = = Jarrow March = = = = 
 In the November 1935 general election the National Government , led by Baldwin since MacDonald 's retirement earlier that year , won convincingly , although Labour increased its House of Commons representation to 158 . Wilkinson was returned at Jarrow with a majority of 2 @,@ 350 . Although the poverty in the town was acute , there were hopes that its chronic unemployment would shortly be alleviated by the erection of a large steelworks on the derelict shipyard site . However , the scheme was opposed by the <unk> represented by the British Iron and Steel Federation ( BISF ) , who thought that any increase in steel production should be handled by expanding their existing facilities . On 30 June 1936 Wilkinson asked Walter Runciman , the responsible minister , " to induce the Iron and Steel Federation to pursue a less selfish policy than it is pursuing at present " . Her request was ignored , and the matter delayed indefinitely by the appointment of a committee to consider the general development of the iron and steel industry — a committee , a Times letter @-@ writer noted , dominated by BISF members . A deputation from Jarrow 's town council met Runciman to protest against the decision , but were told that " Jarrow must find its own salvation . " 
 According to Wilkinson , Runciman 's dismissive phrase " kindled the town " . Under the general leadership of its chairman , David Riley , the town council began preparations for a demonstration in the form of a march to London to present a petition to the government . Marches of the unemployed , generally termed " hunger marches " , had been taking place since the early 1920s , often under the auspices of the communist @-@ led National Unemployed Workers ' Movement . This political dimension had associated such marches in the public mind with far @-@ left propaganda . The Jarrow council determined to organise its march free of political connotations , and with the backing of every section of the town . This did not prevent Hensley Henson , the Bishop of Durham , from denouncing it as " revolutionary mob pressure " and condemning the action of James Gordon , the Bishop of Jarrow , who gave the march his blessing . Even within the Labour Party , Wilkinson found the leadership 's attitude lukewarm , fearful of possible association with revolutionary socialism . 
 On 5 October 1936 a selected group of 200 set out from Jarrow Town Hall on the 282 @-@ mile march , aiming to reach London by 30 October for the start of the new session of parliament . Wilkinson did not march all the way , but joined whenever her various commitments allowed . At that year 's Labour Party conference , held in Edinburgh , she hoped to rouse enthusiasm but instead heard herself condemned for " sending hungry and ill @-@ clad men across the country " . This negative attitude was mirrored by some of the local parties on the route of the march ; in such areas , Wilkinson recorded with irony , the Conservatives and Liberals saw to the marchers ' needs . On 31 October the marchers reached London , but Baldwin refused to see them . On 4 November , Wilkinson presented the town 's petition to the House of Commons . Signed by 11 @,@ 000 citizens of Jarrow , it concluded : " The town cannot be left derelict , and therefore your Petitioners humbly pray that His Majesty 's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay . " In the brief discussion that followed , Runciman opined that " the unemployment position at Jarrow , while still far from satisfactory , has improved during recent months " . In reply a Labour backbencher commented that " the Government 's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience " . 
 The marchers returned to Jarrow by train , to find their unemployment benefit reduced because they had been " unavailable for work " had any vacancies arisen . The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart suggest that the success of the Jarrow march lay in the future ; it " helped to shape [ post @-@ Second World War ] perceptions of the 1930s " , and thus paved the way to social reform . According to Vernon , it planted the idea of social justice into the minds of the middle classes . " Ironically and tragically , " Vernon says , " it was not peaceful crusading , but the impetus of rearmament which brought industrial activity back to Jarrow " . In 1939 Wilkinson published an account of Jarrow 's travails in her final book , The Town that was Murdered . " Jarrow 's plight " , she wrote , " is not a local problem . It is the symptom of a national evil " .

 In November 1934 , as a representative of the Relief Committee for the Victims of Fascism , Wilkinson visited the northern Spanish province of Asturias to report on the crushing of the Oviedo miners ' uprising . She was forcibly ejected from the country . Despite being banned from Germany as an undesirable , Wilkinson continued to visit the country covertly , and as a correspondent for the Sunday Referee was the first to report Hitler 's intention to march into the Rhineland , in March 1936 . Spain , however , came to occupy a special place in her opposition to the spread of fascism . When a section of the Spanish army under General Franco attacked the elected Popular Front coalition government to precipitate the Spanish Civil War , Wilkinson set up the Spanish Medical Aid Committee and the National Joint Committee for Spanish Relief . She later argued in parliament against the British government 's non @-@ intervention policies which , she insisted , " worked on the side of General Franco " . She returned to Spain in April 1937 as a member of an all @-@ women delegation led by the Duchess of Atholl , and afterwards wrote of feeling " a helpless , choking rage " , as she witnessed the effects of aerial bombing on undefended villages . On a further visit , in December 1937 , she was accompanied by Attlee , now leader of the Labour Party , and Philip Noel @-@ Baker , a fellow Labour MP . Having observed the near @-@ starvation of schoolchildren in Madrid , on her return to Britain she set up a " Milk for Spain " fund , together with other humanitarian initiatives . 
 Although she had long broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party , Wilkinson retained strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad . Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her . However , she was not prepared to risk losing her parliamentary seat , and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds . In 1937 Wilkinson was one of a group of Labour figures — Aneurin Bevan , Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others — who founded the left @-@ wing magazine Tribune ; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment , poverty , malnutrition and inadequate housing . Mindful of the dependence of many low @-@ income families on credit , she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements , at the time a subject of frequent abuse , and with all @-@ party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938 . 
 Wilkinson was a strong opponent of the National Government 's appeasement policies towards the European dictators . In the House of Commons on 6 October 1938 she condemned the actions of the prime minister , Neville Chamberlain , in signing the Munich Agreement : " Only by throwing away practically everything for which this country cared and stood could he rescue us from the results of his own policy " . On 24 August 1939 , as parliament considered the recently signed Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact , Wilkinson attacked Chamberlain 's failure to ally with Russia in a common front against Hitler . " Time after time " , she told the Commons , " we have had the prime minister ... putting the narrow interests of his class and of the rich , before the national interest " . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 Wilkinson supported Britain 's declaration of war on Germany , on 3 September 1939 , although she was critical of Chamberlain 's conduct of the war . In May 1940 , when Churchill 's all @-@ party coalition replaced Chamberlain 's National Government , Wilkinson was appointed Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Pensions . In October 1940 she transferred to the Ministry of Home Security , as one of Herbert Morrison 's three Parliamentary Secretaries , with responsibilities for air raid shelters and civil defence . When aerial bombardment of British cities began in the summer of 1940 , many Londoners used Underground stations as improvised shelters , often living there for days in conditions of increasing squalor . By the end of 1941 Wilkinson had supervised the distribution of more than half a million indoor " Morrison shelters " — reinforced steel tables with wire mesh sides , under which a family could sleep at home . Dubbed the " shelter queen " by the press , Wilkinson toured the bombed cities frequently , to share hardships and raise morale . More controversially , she approved the conscription of women into the Auxiliary Fire Service for fire @-@ watching duty , a policy that provoked considerable opposition from women , who felt that their domestic duties were a sufficient burden . Even Wilkinson 's own union , NUDAW , disapproved of the measure , but Wilkinson stood firm . 
 The discipline of working in a ministerial post , together with the influence of Morrison and her alienation from communism , turned Wilkinson away from many of her former left @-@ wing stances . She supported Morrison 's decision in January 1941 to suppress the communist newspaper The Daily Worker on the grounds of its anti @-@ British propaganda , and voted for the wartime legislation that banned strikes in key industries . Now accepted within the mainstream of the Labour Party , she served on several key policy committees , and in June 1943 became vice @-@ chairman of the party 's National Executive . She succeeded to the chair when the incumbent , George Ridley , died in January 1944 . In the 1945 New Year Honours she was appointed a Privy Counsellor , only the third woman ( after Margaret Bondfield and Lady Astor ) to receive this honour . In April 1945 she was part of a parliamentary delegation that travelled to San Francisco to begin work on the establishment of the United Nations . 
 = = = Postwar career = = = 
 = = = = Leadership manoeuvres = = = = 
 Wilkinson had formed a close relationship with Morrison , personally and politically , before and during their wartime ministerial association . She thought that he , rather than the sedate Attlee , should be leading the Labour Party , and had promoted his leadership credentials in 1935 and 1939 . In 1945 , Morrison informed Attlee that he intended to seek the leadership " in the interests of party unity " . In the general election held in July 1945 Labour won a landslide victory , with 393 seats against the Conservatives ' 213 . This did not prevent Wilkinson and others from continuing to press for a change of leader , but Attlee forestalled further action by quickly accepting the king 's invitation to form a government . He showed no resentment towards either Morrison or Wilkinson ; the former was appointed Lord President of the Council and deputy prime minister , while Wilkinson was made Minister of Education , with a seat in the cabinet . Emmanuel Shinwell , who became Minister of Fuel and Power , later commented that " it is not bad tactics to make one 's enemies one 's servants " . 
 = = = = Minister of education = = = = 
 Wilkinson was the second woman , after Margaret Bondfield , to achieve a place in the British cabinet . As Minister of Education she saw as her main task the implementation of the 1944 Education Act passed by the wartime coalition . This Act provided universal free secondary education , and raised the minimum school leaving age from 14 to 15 with effect from 1947 . All children would take an examination — the " 11 @-@ plus " — which would determine whether their secondary education would be in a grammar ( academic ) , technical or " modern " school . Many in the Labour Party saw this tripartite arrangement as perpetuating elitism , and wanted a more radical scheme based on what later became known as the " comprehensive " system . This envisaged large schools under a single roof , each with a range of appropriate courses of study for different levels of ability , and flexible movement between courses as children 's aptitudes changed . Wilkinson believed , however , that such a major reconstruction was unachievable at that time , and limited herself to more attainable reforms . Her cautious attitude disappointed and angered some of the Labour left wing and teacher ' representatives , who considered that a great opportunity to incorporate socialist principles into education had been missed . Wilkinson , however , was persuaded to the view that selection at 11 would allow all those with higher IQs , irrespective of class background , to obtain a grammar school education . 
 Wilkinson made her first priority the raising of the school leaving age . This required the recruitment and training of thousands of extra teachers , and creating classroom space for almost 400 @,@ 000 extra children . Under the Emergency Training Scheme ( ETS ) , ex @-@ servicemen and women were given grants to train as teachers on an accelerated one @-@ year programme ; more than 37 @,@ 000 had been or were being trained by the end of 1946 . The rapid expansion of school premises was achieved by the erection of temporary huts — some of which became long @-@ term features of schools . Wilkinson was determined that the higher leaving age be implemented by 1 April 1947 — the date set by the 1944 Act — and in the face of parliamentary scepticism insisted that her plans were on track . Final cabinet approval to honour the April date was given on 16 January 1947 . 
 Other reforms during Wilkinson 's tenure as minister included free school milk , improvements in the school meals service , an increase in university scholarships , and an expansion in the provision of part @-@ time adult education through county colleges . In October 1945 she went to Germany to report on how the destroyed German education system could best be reactivated . She was astonished by the speed with which , five months after its defeat , the country 's schools and universities were reopening . Other trips included visits to Gibraltar , Malta and Czechoslovakia . In November 1945 she chaired an international conference in London that led to the establishment , a year later , of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organisation ( UNESCO ) . In one of her final speeches in parliament , on 22 November 1946 , she emphasised that UNESCO stood for " standards of value ... putting aside the idea that only practical things matter " . She prophesied that the organisation " will do great things " , and urged the government to give it its full backing . 
 = = = = Illness and death = = = = 
 Wilkinson suffered for most of her life from bronchial asthma , which she aggravated over the years by heavy smoking and overwork . She had often been ill during the war , and had collapsed during a visit to Prague in 1946 . On 25 January 1947 she attended the opening of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School . The winter of 1946 – 47 was exceptionally cold , and the ceremony was held out of doors . Shortly afterwards , Wilkinson developed pneumonia ; on 3 February she was found in her London flat in a coma , and on 6 February 1947 she died in St Mary 's Hospital , Paddington . At the inquest the coroner gave the cause of death as " heart failure following emphysema , with acute bronchitis and bronchial pneumonia , accelerated by barbiturate poisoning " . Wilkinson had been taking a combination of drugs for several months , to combat both her asthma and insomnia ; the coroner believed she had inadvertently taken an overdose of barbiturates . With no evidence to indicate that the overdose was deliberate , he recorded a verdict of accidental death . Despite this , speculation that Wilkinson had committed suicide has persisted , the reasons cited being the failure of her personal relationship with Morrison and her likely fate in a rumoured cabinet reshuffle . In their 1973 biography of Morrison , Bernard <unk> and G. W. Jones suggest that , given Wilkinson 's poor health , the burdens of her ministerial office became too much for her . However , the lack of conclusive evidence divides historians about Wilkinson 's intention to take her own life . 
 = = Appraisal and legacy = = 
 Wilkinson 's short stature and distinctive red hair , combined with her uncompromising politics , gave rise to popular nicknames such as the " Fiery Particle " and " Red Ellen " . With her bright , fashionable clothes and her forceful manner , she was easily noticeable — an obituarist wrote that " wherever there was a row going on in support of some good or even fairly good cause , that rebellious redhead was sure to be seen bobbing about in the heart of the tumult " . In her later career , ambition and pragmatism led her to temper her earlier Marxism and militancy and work within mainstream Labour Party policy ; she came to believe that parliamentary democracy offered a better route to social progress than any alternative . Yet , Vernon says , " she never lost her resolute independence of thought , and sought power not for self glory but to succour the weak of the world " . In a tribute published when Wilkinson 's death was announced , the former Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet @-@ Keir summed up her personality : " Ellen Wilkinson was as far removed from being a bore as it is possible for any human being to be . Whatever she did , wherever she went , she created an atmosphere of excitement and interest ... and not just because of her red hair and green dress " . 
 In the course of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in numerous policy areas : women 's equal suffrage , women civil servants ' equal pay , provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers , and protection of hire purchase borrowers ' rights . The historian David Kynaston cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age ; her successor as education minister , George Tomlinson , recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform , and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date . Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely ; a local newspaper , the North Mail , complained in May 1937 that " Miss Wilkinson is working for too many causes to do justice to Jarrow " . Nevertheless , her book The Town that was Murdered brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working @-@ class communities ; the book , Harrison observes , " educated the nation " . 
 Wilkinson never married , although she enjoyed numerous close friendships with men . Apart from her early engagement to Walton Newbold , she was close to John Jagger for many years , and in the early 1930s enjoyed a brief romantic attachment with Frank Horrabin . Her long association with Morrison began in her early Fabian days ; Morrison was very reticent about this friendship , choosing not to mention Wilkinson in his 1960 autobiography despite their close political association . Vernon says that the relationship almost certainly became " more than platonic " , but as Wilkinson 's private papers were destroyed after her death , and Morrison maintained silence over the matter , the full nature and extent of their friendship remains unknown . 
 On 25 January 1941 Wilkinson received the freedom of the town of Jarrow , and in May 1946 was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Manchester . Her name has been commemorated in The Ellen Wilkinson School for Girls in Ealing , West London , in the Ellen Wilkinson Primary School and Children 's Centre in Newham , East London , and in the Ellen Wilkinson Estate , a 1950s Felling Urban District Council housing project at Wardley , once part of her Jarrow constituency now in Gateshead Metropolitan Borough . In addition , the Ellen Wilkinson High School in Ardwick , which incorporated Wilkinson 's old school , bore her name for some years before its closure in 2000 . The Ellen Wilkinson Building in the University of Manchester 's campus houses parts of the School of Psychological Sciences and other departments . A blue plaque records the site of Wilkinson 's birthplace , and another , in the main quadrangle of the old university buildings , records Wilkinson 's attendance there in 1910 to 1913 . In October 2015 Wilkinson was shortlisted by a Manchester town hall panel as one of six candidates to be the subject of the city 's first female statue in over a century .

 " Eve " is the eleventh episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on December 10 , 1993 . It was written by Kenneth Biller and Chris Brancato , directed by Fred Gerber , and featured guest appearances by Harriet Sansom Harris and Jerry Hardin in his role as Deep Throat . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Eve " earned a Nielsen household rating of 6 @.@ 8 , being watched by 6 @.@ 4 million households in its initial broadcast ; and received positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . When Mulder and Scully investigate two seemingly identical murders that occurred simultaneously thousands of miles apart , they find that both victims ' daughters may be the product of a secret human cloning project created by the government . 
 The episode was pitched to series creator Chris Carter by freelance writers Biller and Brancato under the title of " The Girls from Greenwich " , with the focus being on genetic experiments conducted on sets of twins . The producers initially looked for twins to play the roles of Teena and Cindy in Los Angeles , but child labor laws made using children from there so difficult that they instead searched locally in Vancouver , finding Erika and Sabrina Krievins . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Greenwich , Connecticut , a jogging couple find a girl , Teena Simmons , standing alone . Nearby , they find her father sitting dead on a swing set with two incisions in his neck . 
 Fox Mulder takes the case and reviews it with Dana Scully , believing the death is an example of extraterrestrial cattle mutilation on a human being . When Mulder and Scully travel to Connecticut and interview Teena , she claims to have seen " red lightning " when her father died and that " men from the clouds " had wanted to <unk> him . Afterwards , the agents travel to Marin County , California and visit the Reardon residence , the scene of a similar murder . They realize that despite the distance between the killings , they were committed on the same day and at the same moment . Meanwhile , back in Connecticut , Teena is kidnapped by a dark @-@ clothed figure . 
 When Mulder and Scully meet the <unk> , they discover that their daughter , Cindy , is identical to Teena . Cindy 's mother tells the agents that she was conceived via in vitro fertilization at a fertility clinic in San Francisco . There , Scully learns that both the Simmons and the <unk> were treated by a woman named Dr. Sally Kendrick , who was fired for conducting eugenics experiments with ova from the clinic 's lab . Meanwhile , Mulder is contacted by Deep Throat , who details a Cold War @-@ era supersoldier program that produced genetically modified children — identified as " Adam " or " Eve " based on their genders . Deep Throat tells Mulder of a woman connected with the project who is currently kept in a mental hospital . 
 The agents travel to the hospital and meet " Eve 6 " , who tells them that the clones created in the project had extra chromosomes which led them to display superhuman intelligence and strength , as well as homicidal psychoses . The last three clones , Eves 6 , 7 and 8 , were institutionalized after the project was cancelled . However , Eve 7 escaped , joined the fertility clinic as " Sally Kendrick " , and modified the ova of the clinic 's patients to create new Eve clones . Eve 8 , who also escaped , is still at large . 
 Mulder and Scully are unable to prevent one of the escaped Eves from abducting Cindy . The Eve takes Cindy to a motel where Teena is already being held captive , and introduces the two girls to each other . The woman reveals herself to be Eve 7 , who explains how she had created them to improve upon the project 's flaws , only to learn about the girl 's " accelerated development " when they murdered their fathers . The girls , in turn , poison Eve 7 's drink with a fatal dose of foxglove . When Mulder and Scully arrive at the motel , the girls falsely claim that both Eve 7 and Eve 8 were trying to goad them into a mass suicide . The agents decide to take the girls with them as they leave the scene . 
 That night , when the group arrives at a roadside truck stop , one of the girls sneaks out and poisons the sodas the agents ordered . Mulder realizes the girls ' plan and manages to keep Scully from drinking her soda . The agents then pursue the girls through the truck stop , with Mulder eventually capturing them . Teena and Cindy , now known as " Eve 9 " and " Eve 10 , " end up sharing the psychiatric ward with Eve 6 in the mental hospital . Eventually , a woman wearing a lab coat — identified as Eve 8 — comes to the ward . When Eve 8 asks the girls how they knew she would come for them , the girls each respond , " We just knew . "

 Freelance writers Kenneth Biller and Chris Brancato pitched the idea for this episode to series creator Chris Carter under the title of " The Girls from Greenwich " , with the focus being on genetic experiments conducted on sets of twins . Brancato said the duo decided to do " an X @-@ File with a genetics experiment gone awry " inspired by The Boys from Brazil , where Nazi scientists create clones of Adolf Hitler , while finding " our own themes and characterizations to explore " , such as commenting on human condition similarly to The Twilight Zone . The characters of Teena and Cindy were named after the wives of Glen Morgan and James Wong , who rewrote the original script prior to filming . " Eve " was the only episode of The X @-@ Files to be directed by Fred Gerber , who Carter felt " brought some interesting stuff to it " . 
 The producers initially looked for twins to play the roles of Teena and Cindy in Los Angeles , but child labor laws made using children from there so difficult that they instead searched locally in Vancouver , finding Erika and Sabrina Krievins . The difficulty in finding suitable actors for the roles had led producer R. W. Goodwin to consider casting one actor in both roles and using special effects and body doubles to create the impression of twins ; however , this idea was rejected as it would have proved too impractical and expensive . The scenes in the episode set in the roadside diner were filmed in a café in White Rock , British Columbia , whose large gravel car park helped it appear " very rural in its setting " . A large awning was used to complement the exterior shots of the building .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . In a retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly , " Eve " was rated a B + , with the episode being called " tidy , satisfying , and suspenseful " . The episode 's premise and the casting of Harris were both cited as highlights . Keith Phipps , writing for The A.V. Club , also rated the episode a B + , calling it " a nicely realized episode " that " does a nice job building slowly and offering some shocks along the way " . The acting and tone were also praised , especially the " dead @-@ eyed performances " of the Krievins twins . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , felt that the episode had " a good , original story " that proved " you can 't go wrong when it comes to twins and horror " ; with the girls ' acting being called " suitably menacing " . Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A grade . Series creator Chris Carter stated he liked the casting of the episode , calling Harriet Harris ' performance excellent . He also praised the performance of Erika and Sabrina Krievins , stating " those two little girls were so wonderfully understated and creepy " . The band Eve 6 took its name from this episode , as the band 's member Tony <unk> was a fan . The plot for " Eve " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Ellen Steiber . 
 = Warfare in Medieval Scotland = 
 Warfare in Medieval Scotland includes all military activity in the modern borders of Scotland , or by forces originating in the region , between the departure of the Romans in the fifth century and the adoption of the innovations of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century . In this period conflict developed from minor raids to major conflicts , incorporating many of the innovations of continental warfare . 
 In the Early Middle Ages war on land was characterised by the use of small war @-@ bands of household troops often engaging in raids and low level warfare . The arrival of the Vikings brought a new scale of naval warfare , with rapid movement based around the Viking longship . The Birlinn , which developed from the longship , became a major factor in warfare in the Highlands and Islands . By the High Middle Ages , the kings of Scotland could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of the " common army " , mainly of poorly armoured spearmen and bowmen . After the " Davidian Revolution " of the twelfth century , which introduced elements of feudalism to Scotland , these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights . Feudalism also introduced castles into the country , originally simple wooden motte @-@ and @-@ bailey constructions , but these were replaced in the thirteenth century with more formidable stone " enceinte " castles , with high encircling walls . In the thirteenth century the threat of Scandinavian naval power subsided and the kings of Scotland were able to use naval forces to help subdue the Highlands and Islands . 
 Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England , but they were used to good effect by Robert I of Scotland at Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence . He adopted a policy of slighting castles and made use of naval power to support his forces , beginning to develop a royal Scottish naval force . In the Late Middle Ages under the Stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops , particularly men @-@ at @-@ arms and archers , hired by bonds of manrent , similar to English indentures of the same period . New " livery and maintenance " castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons . The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare , such as longer pikes , the extensive use of artillery , and they built up a formidable navy . However , one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 , which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops , a large section of the nobility and the king James IV .

 In the politically divided world of early medieval Scotland the nucleus of most armed forces was a leader 's bodyguard or war @-@ band . In the British language , this was called the teulu , as in teulu <unk> ( the " War @-@ band of Deira " ) . In Latin the most common word in this period is tutores , and derives from the Latin verb <unk> , meaning " defend , preserve from danger " . In peace @-@ time , the war @-@ band 's activity was centred around the " Great Hall " . Here , in both Germanic and Celtic cultures , the feasting , drinking and other forms of male bonding that kept up the war @-@ band 's integrity would take place . In the contemporaneous Old English epic poem Beowulf , the war @-@ band was said to sleep in the Great Hall after the lord had retired to his adjacent bedchamber . It is not likely that any war @-@ band in the period exceeded 120 – 150 men , as no hall structure having a capacity larger than this has been found by archaeologists in northern Britain . The war @-@ band was the core of the larger armies that were mobilised from time to time for campaigns of significant size . These wider forces depended on the obligations to defend a province or kingdom by land and sea . Early sources from Dál Riata indicate an attempt to define this as an obligation based on landholding , with obligations to provide a specified number of men or ships based on the amount of land held by an individual . Pictish stones , like that at Aberlemno in Angus , show warriors with swords , spears , bows , helmets and shields . These images may show infantry in formation , or gathered together for protection , and they show mounted troops , sometimes heavily armoured , suggesting a mounted warrior elite . 
 = = = Hill forts = = = 
 Early fortifications in Scotland , particularly in the north and west , included modest stone built towers known as brochs and duns and , particularly in the south and east larger hill forts , There is evidence for about 1 @,@ 000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland , most located below the Clyde @-@ Forth line . They appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period , but some seem to have been reoccupied after their departure . Most are circular , with a single palisade around an enclosure . Forts of the Early Medieval era were often smaller , more compact , " nucleated " constructions , sometimes utilising major geographical features , as at Dunadd and Dunbarton . The large number of hill forts in Scotland may have made open battle less important than it was in contemporaneous Anglo @-@ Saxon England , and the relatively high proportion of kings who are recorded as dying in fires , suggest that sieges were a more important part of warfare in Northern Britain . 
 = = = Ships = = = 
 Sea power may also have been important . Irish annals record an attack by the Picts on Orkney in 682 , which must have necessitated a large naval force , and also they lost 150 ships in a disaster in 729 . Ships were also vital in the amphibious warfare in the Highlands and Islands and from the seventh century the Senchus fer n @-@ Alban indicates that Dál Riata had a ship @-@ muster system that obliged groups of households to produce a total of 177 ships and 2 @,@ 478 men . The same source mentions the first recorded naval battle around the British Isles in 719 and eight naval expeditions between 568 and 733 . The only vessels to survive form this period are dugout canoes , but images from the period suggest that there may have been skin boats ( similar to the Irish <unk> ) and larger oared vessels . The Viking raids and invasions of the British Isles were based on superior sea @-@ power , which enabled the creation of the thalassocracies ( sea @-@ based lordships ) of the north and west . The long @-@ ship , the key to their success , was a graceful , long , narrow , light , wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed . This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only 3 feet ( 1 m ) deep and permitted beach landings , while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages . Longships were also double @-@ ended , the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around .

 By the twelfth century the ability to call on wider bodies of men for major campaigns had become formalised as the " common " ( communis exercitus ) or " Scottish army " ( exercitus <unk> ) , based on a universal obligation linked to the holding of variously named units of land . This could be used to produce a regional army , as the future Robert I did when from 1298 – 1302 when , as Earl of Carrick , he raised " my army of Carrick " , but also a national Scottish army , as he did later in the Wars of Independence . Later decrees indicated that the common army was a levy of all able @-@ bodied freemen aged between 16 and 60 , with 8 @-@ days warning . It produced relatively large numbers of men serving for a limited period , usually as unarmoured or poorly armoured bowmen and spearmen . In this period it continued to be mustered by the earls and they often led their men in battle , as was the case in the Battle of the Standard in 1138 . It would continue to provide the vast majority of Scottish national armies , potentially producing tens of thousands of men for short periods of conflict , into the early modern era . 
 There also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of feudal troops . The introduction of feudalism to Scotland is usually attributed to the Davidian Revolution of the twelfth century . When David I acceded to the Scottish throne in 1124 after spending much of his life living as a baron in England , he brought with him a number of Anglo @-@ Norman vassals , to whom he distributed lands and titles , first in the lowlands and borders and then later in buffer zones in the North and West . Geoffrey Barrow wrote that among other changes this brought " fundamental innovations in military organization " . These included the knight 's fee , homage and fealty , as well as castle @-@ building and the regular use of professional cavalry , as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service , providing troops on a 40 @-@ day basis . David 's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights , but the vast majority of his forces were the " common army " of poorly armed infantry , capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare , but only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field , as they managed to do critically in the wars of independence at Stirling Bridge in 1297 and Bannockburn in 1314 . 
 = = = Castles = = = 
 Castles , in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble , arrived in Scotland as part of David I 's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures , particularly in the south and east , and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands . These were primarily wooden motte @-@ and @-@ bailey constructions , of a raised mount or motte , surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey , both usually surrounded by a fosse ( a ditch ) and palisade , and connected by a wooden bridge . They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie , to more modest designs like Balmaclellan . 
 In England many of these constructions were converted into stone " keep @-@ and @-@ bailey " castles in the twelfth century , but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of " enceinte " , with a high embattled curtain wall . In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles , often larger and providing defence , lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre . By 1200 these included fortifications at Ayr and Berwick . In the wars of Scottish Independence Robert I adopted a policy of castle destruction , rather than allow fortresses to be easily taken or retaken by the English and held against him , beginning with his own castles at Ayr and Dumfries , and including Roxburgh and Edinburgh . 
 = = = Marine forces = = = 
 In the Highlands and Islands , the longship was gradually succeeded by ( in ascending order of size ) the birlinn , highland galley and <unk> , which , were clinker @-@ built ships , usually with a centrally @-@ stepped mast , but also with oars that allowed them to be rowed . Like the longship , they had a high stem and stern , and were still small and light enough to be dragged across portages , but they replaced the steering @-@ board with a stern @-@ rudder from the late twelfth century . They could fight at sea , but rarely were able to match armed ships of the Scottish or English navies . However , they could usually outrun larger vessels and were extremely useful in quick raids and in aiding escape . Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship @-@ levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands , which have been argued to date back to the muster system of Dál Riata , but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers . Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to feudal obligations , with Celtic @-@ Scandinavian lords , who had previously contributed as a result of a general levy on landholding , coming to hold their lands in exchange for specified numbers and sizes of ships supplied to the king . This process probably began in the thirteenth century , but would be intensified under Robert I. The importance of these ships was underlined by their becoming common in depictions on grave markers and in heraldry throughout the Highlands and Islands . 
 There are mentions in Medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including William the Lion and Alexander II . The latter took personal command of a large naval force which sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera in 1249 , intended to transport his army in a campaign against the Kingdom of the Isles , but he died before the campaign could begin . Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms , but entered a period of resurgence in the thirteenth century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters . These included king Hakon <unk> 's <unk> , built at Bergen from 1262 – 3 , which was 260 feet ( 79 m ) long , of 37 rooms . In 1263 Hakon responded to Alexander III 's designs on the Hebrides by personally leading a major fleet of forty vessels , including the <unk> , to the islands , where they were swelled by local allies to as many as 200 ships . Records indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr , but he avoided a sea battle . Defeat on land at the Battle of Largs and winter storms forced the Norwegian fleet to return home , leaving the Scottish crown as the major power in the region and leading to the ceding of the Western Isles to Alexander in 1266 . 
 = = Late Middle Ages = = 
 = = = Armies = = = 
 Scottish victories in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries have been seen as part of a wider " infantry revolution " , that saw a decline in the primacy of the mounted knight on the battlefield . However , it has been pointed out that Scottish medieval armies had probably always been dependent on infantry forces . In the late medieval period Scottish men @-@ at @-@ arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry , with perhaps a small mounted reserve , and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English , leading to their successes in the Hundred Years ' War . Like the English , the Scots deployed mounted archers , and even spearmen , who were particularly useful in the mobile raids that characterised border warfare , but like the English they fought on foot . 
 By the second half of the fourteenth century , in addition to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations , money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent , similar to English indentures of the same period , were being used to retain more professional troops , particular men @-@ at @-@ arms and archers . In practice , forms of service tended to blur and overlap , and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred . These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry , usually armed with 12 – 14 foot spears . They often formed the large close order defensive formations of <unk> , able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn , or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388 , but vulnerable to arrows ( and later artillery fire ) and relatively immobile , as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and <unk> Hill in 1402 . 
 There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of 15 @.@ 5 feet ( 5 m ) to 18 @.@ 5 feet ( 6 m ) in the later fifteenth century , in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland , but this does not appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early sixteenth century . There were smaller numbers of archers and men @-@ at @-@ arms , which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield . Scottish archers were mainly drawn from the border regions , with those from Selkirk Forest gaining a particularly reputation . They became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the fifteenth century , in order to help counter the English superiority in this arm , becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the Garde Écossaise . 
 = = = Fortification = = = 
 After the Wars of Independence , new castles began to be built , often on a grander scale as " livery and maintenance " castles , to house retained troops , like Tantallon , Lothian and Doune near Stirling , rebuilt for Robert Stewart , Duke of Albany in the fourteenth century . The largest number of Late Medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles , about 800 , were of the tower house design . Smaller versions of tower houses in southern Scotland were known as peel towers , or pele houses . The defences of tower houses were primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties and were not intended to put up significant opposition to an organised military assault , leading historian Stuart Reid to characterise them as " defensible rather than defensive " . They were typically be a tall , square , stone @-@ built , crenelated building ; often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn , a walled courtyard designed to hold valuable animals securely , but not necessarily intended for serious defence . They were built extensively on both sides of the border with England , and James IV 's forfeiture of the Lordship of the Isles in 1494 led to an immediate burst of castle building across the region . 
 Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture , with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of " keyhole " gun ports , platforms to mount guns and walls being adapted to resist bombardment . Ravenscraig , Kirkcaldy , begun about 1460 , is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort , incorporating " D @-@ shape " bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted . Towards the end of the period royal builders in Scotland adopted European Renaissance styles in castle design . The grandest buildings of this type were the royal palaces in this style at Linlithgow , Holyrood , Falkland and the remodelled Stirling Castle , begun by James IV . A strong influence from France and the Low Countries can be seen in the fashionable design of a quadrangular court with stair @-@ turrets on each corner . However , these were adapted to Scottish idioms and materials ( particularly stone and harl ) . 
 = = = Siege engines and artillery = = = 
 The Wars of Independence brought the first recorded instances of major mechanical artillery in Scotland . Edward I used a range of siege engines , which were carefully constructed , transported , deployed , dismantled and stored for reuse . This began with the siege of Caerlaverock Castle in 1300 . Here , after the failure of an initial assault , a small rock @-@ throwing engine was employed , while three large engines ( probably trebuchet , using a counter @-@ weight mechanism ) , were constructed . Their destruction of walls demoralised the garrison and forced a surrender . Edward 's armies deployed several such engines , often named , with " <unk> " , one of 17 used in the capture of Stirling Castle in 1304 , being the best known . They also deployed lighter bolt @-@ shooting <unk> , belfry siege towers and on one occasion a covered sow . Some of these were supplied by Robert Earl of Carrick , the future Robert I , who was present on the English side . Scottish armies , with more limited resources and expertise tended to rely on assault , blockade and subterfuge as siege tactics . Robert I is known to have employed siege engines against the English , but often with little success , as at Carlisle in 1315 where his siege tower floundered in mud . The disparity in siege technology has been seen as resulting in a policy of castle destruction by Robert I. 
 Edward I had the major ingredients for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304 , probably to produce a form of Greek fire , to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines . The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade . The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333 , where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines . The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341 . Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century . The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train . The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery . James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent , including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good , Duke of Burgundy , one of which , Mons Meg , still survives . Although these were probably already outdated on the continent , they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland . James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some of the dangers of early artillery , when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460 . James III also experienced ill @-@ fortune , when artillery sent from Sigismund , Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481 . James IV brought in experts from France , Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511 . Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train , allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign . However , his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army , proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden . 
 = = = Navy = = = 
 English naval power was vital to Edward I 's successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296 , using largely merchant ships from England , Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies . Part of the reason for Robert I 's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands . As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303 , he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea . The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling , the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314 . Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315 . They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick , which led to its fall in 1318 . 
 After the establishment of Scottish independence , Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity . This was largely focused on the west coast , with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews . Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man @-@ of @-@ war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde . In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots , Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers . James I took a greater interest in naval power . After his return to Scotland in 1424 , he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith , a house for marine stores , and a workshop . King 's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war , one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429 . The office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period . In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the Flower and the King 's Carvel also known as the Yellow Carvel . 
 James IV put the enterprise on a new footing , founding a harbour at Newhaven in May 1504 , and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of Airth . The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie . The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the Royal Scottish Navy , including the Margaret , and the carrack Michael or Great Michael . The latter , built at great expense at Newhaven and launched in 1511 , was 240 feet ( 73 m ) in length , weighed 1 @,@ 000 tons , had 24 cannon , and was , at that time , the largest ship in Europe . Scottish ships had some success against privateers , accompanied the king in his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts Scandinavia and the Baltic . In the Flodden campaign the fleet consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft . After a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland , it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war . After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael , and perhaps other ships , were sold to the French and the king 's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516 . 
 = Y Gododdin = 
 Y Gododdin ( pronounced [ ə <unk> ] ) is a medieval Welsh poem consisting of a series of elegies to the men of the Brittonic kingdom of Gododdin and its allies who , according to the conventional interpretation , died fighting the Angles of Deira and Bernicia at a place named Catraeth in c . AD 600 . It is traditionally ascribed to the bard Aneirin and survives only in one manuscript , the Book of Aneirin . 
 The Book of Aneirin manuscript is from the later 13th century , but Y Gododdin has been dated to anywhere between the 7th and the early 11th centuries . The text is partly written in Middle Welsh orthography and partly in Old Welsh . The early date would place its oral composition soon after the battle , presumably in the Hen Ogledd ( " Old North " ) ; as such it would have been written in the Cumbric dialect of Common Brittonic . Others consider it the work of a poet from Wales in the 9th , 10th or 11th century . Even a 9th @-@ century date would make it one of the oldest surviving Welsh works of poetry . 
 The Gododdin , known in Roman times as the Votadini , held territories in what is now southeast Scotland and Northumberland , part of the Hen Ogledd ( Old North ) . The poem tells how a force of 300 ( or 363 ) picked warriors were assembled , some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd . After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn , now Edinburgh , they attacked Catraeth , which is usually identified with Catterick , North Yorkshire . After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds , nearly all the warriors are killed . The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry , with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory , but is not a narrative . The manuscript contains several stanzas which have no connection with the Gododdin and are considered to be interpolations . One stanza in particular has received attention because it mentions King Arthur in passing , which , if not an interpolation , would be the earliest known reference to that character .

 There is only one early manuscript of Y Gododdin , the Book of Aneirin , thought to date from the second half of the 13th century . The currently accepted view is that this manuscript contains the work of two scribes , usually known as A and B. Scribe A wrote down 88 stanzas of the poem , then left a blank page before writing down four related poems known as <unk> . This scribe wrote the material down in Middle Welsh orthography . Scribe B added material later , and apparently had access to an earlier manuscript since the material added by this scribe is in Old Welsh orthography . Scribe B wrote 35 stanzas , some of which are variants of stanzas also given by Scribe A while others are not given by A. The last stanza is incomplete and three folios are missing from the end of the manuscript , so some material may have been lost . 
 There are differences within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material shows signs of partial modernisation of the orthography , while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features . Jarman explains this by suggesting that Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas , but after a while tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas as they were in the older manuscript . Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources , called B1 and B2 . If this is correct , the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources . 
 = = = Poem = = = 
 The stanzas that make up the poem are a series of elegies for warriors who fell in battle against vastly superior numbers . Some of the verses refer to the entire host , others eulogize individual heroes . They tell how the ruler of the Gododdin , Mynyddog Mwynfawr , gathered warriors from several Brythonic kingdoms and provided them with a year 's feasting and drinking mead in his halls at Din Eidyn , before launching a campaign in which almost all of them were killed fighting against overwhelming odds . The poetry is based on a fixed number of syllables , though there is some irregularity which may be due to modernisation of the language during oral transmission . It uses rhyme , both end @-@ rhyme and internal , and some parts use alliteration . A number of stanzas may open with the same words , for example " <unk> a <unk> <unk> gan <unk> " ( " Men went to Catraeth at dawn " ) . 
 The collection appears to have been compiled from two different versions : according to some verses there were 300 men of the Gododdin , and only one , Cynon ap Clydno , survived ; in others there were 363 warriors and three survivors , in addition to the poet , who as a bard would have almost certainly not have been counted as one of the warriors . The names of about eighty warriors are given in the poem . 
 The Book of Aneirin begins with the introduction <unk> yw e <unk> <unk> ae cant ( " This is the Gododdin ; Aneirin sang it " ) . The first stanza appears to be a reciter 's prologue , composed after the death of Aneirin : 
 Gododdin , <unk> oth <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> cant en <unk> en <unk> : … 
 Er pan want maws mur <unk> , 
 er pan <unk> <unk> ar Aneirin , 
 nu <unk> <unk> nat a <unk> . 
 Gododdin , I make claim on thy behalf 
 In the presence of the throng boldly in the court : … 
 Since the gentle one , the wall of battle , was slain , 
 Since the earth covered Aneirin , 
 Poetry is now parted from the Gododdin . 
 The second stanza praises an individual hero : 
 In might a man , a youth in years , 
 Of boisterous valour , 
 Swift long @-@ maned steeds 
 Under the thigh of a handsome youth … 
 Quicker to a field of blood 
 Than to a wedding 
 Quicker to the ravens ' feast 
 Than to a burial , 
 A beloved friend was <unk> , 
 It is wrong that he is beneath a cairn . 
 It is a sad wonder to me in what land 
 <unk> 's only son was slain . 
 Other stanzas praise the entire host , for example number 13 : 
 Men went to Catraeth at morn 
 Their high spirits lessened their life @-@ span 
 They drank mead , gold and sweet , ensnaring ; 
 For a year the minstrels were merry . 
 Red their swords , let the blades remain 
 <unk> , white shields and four @-@ sided spearheads , 
 Before Mynyddog Mwynfawr 's men . 
 Mead is mentioned in many stanzas , sometimes with the suggestion that it is linked to their deaths . This led some 19th @-@ century editors to assume that the warriors went into battle drunk , however Williams explained that " mead " here stood for everything the warriors received from their lord . In return , they were expected to " pay their mead " by being loyal to their lord unto death . A similar concept is found in Anglo @-@ Saxon poetry . The heroes commemorated in the poem are mounted warriors ; there are many references to horses in the poem . There are references to spears , swords and shields , and to the use of armour ( <unk> , from the Latin <unk> ) . There are several references which indicate that they were Christians , for example " penance " and " altar " , while the enemy are described as " heathens " . Several of these features can be seen in stanza 33 : 
 Men went to Catraeth with a war @-@ cry , 
 Speedy steeds and dark armour and shields , 
 Spear @-@ shafts held high and spear @-@ points sharp @-@ edged , 
 And glittering coats @-@ of @-@ mail and swords , 
 He led the way , he thrust through armies , 
 Five companies fell before his blades . 
 <unk> His gave gold to the altar , 
 And a rich reward to the minstrel . " 
 However , D. Simon Evans has suggested that most , if not all , of the references which point to Christianity may be later additions . 
 Many personal names are given , but only two are recorded in other sources . One of the warriors was Cynon ap Clydno , whom Williams identifies with the Cynon ap Clydno <unk> who is mentioned in old pedigrees . The other personal name recorded in other sources is Arthur . If the mention of Arthur formed part of the original poem this could be the earliest reference to Arthur , as a paragon of bravery . In stanza 99 , the poet praises one of the warriors , <unk> : 
 He fed black ravens on the rampart of a fortress 
 Though he was no Arthur 
 Among the powerful ones in battle 
 In the front rank , <unk> was a palisade 
 Many of the warriors were not from the lands of the Gododdin . Among the places mentioned are Aeron , thought to be the area around the River Ayr and <unk> , the area around Leeds still called Elmet . Others came from further afield , for example one came from " beyond <unk> " , a reference to the mountains between Stirling ( thought to have been <unk> Gododdin territory ) and Dumbarton ( chief fort of the Brythonic Kingdom of Strathclyde ) – this warrior must have come from Pictland . Others came from Gwynedd in north Wales .

 Three of the stanzas included in the manuscript have no connection with the subject matter of the remainder except that they are also associated with southern Scotland or northern England rather than Wales . One of these is a stanza which celebrates the victory of the Britons of the Kingdom of Strathclyde under Eugein I , here described as " the grandson of <unk> " , over Domnall Brecc ( " Dyfnwal <unk> " in Welsh ) , king of Dál Riata , at the Battle of Strathcarron in 642 : 
 I saw an array that came from Kintyre 
 who brought themselves as a sacrifice to a holocaust . 
 I saw a second [ array ] who had come down from their settlement , 
 who had been roused by the grandson of <unk> . 
 I saw mighty men who came with dawn . 
 And it was Domnall Brecc 's head that the ravens gnawed . " 
 Another stanza appears to be part of the separate cycle of poems associated with <unk> Hen . The third interpolation is a poem entitled " <unk> 's <unk> " , a cradle @-@ song addressed to a baby named <unk> , describing how his father goes hunting and fishing . The interpolations are thought to have been added to the poem after it had been written down , these stanzas first being written down where there was a space in the manuscript , then being incorporated in the poem by a later copier who failed to realise that they did not belong . The Strathcarron stanza , for example , is the first stanza in the B text of the Book of Aneirin , and Jackson suggested that it had probably been inserted on a blank space at the top of the first page of the original manuscript . According to Koch 's reconstruction , this stanza was deliberately added to the text in Strathclyde .

 = = = Date = = = 
 The date of Y Gododdin has been the subject of debate among scholars since the early 19th century . If the poem was composed soon after the battle , it must predate 638 , when the fall of Din Eidyn was recorded in the reign of Oswy king of Bernicia , an event which is thought to have meant the collapse of the kingdom of the Gododdin . If it is a later composition , the latest date which could be ascribed to it is determined by the orthography of the second part of Scribe B 's text . This is usually considered to be that of the 9th or 10th centuries , although some scholars consider that it could be from the 11th century . 
 Most of the debate about the date of the poem has employed linguistic arguments . It is believed that around the time of the battle , the British language was transitioning into its daughter languages : the primitive form of Welsh in Wales , of Cornish and Breton in southwestern Britain and Brittany , and Cumbric in northern Britain . Kenneth Jackson concludes that the majority of the changes that transformed British into Primitive Welsh belong to the period from the middle of the 5th to the end of the 6th century . This involved syncope and the loss of final syllables . If the poem dates to this time , it would have been written in an early form of Cumbric , the usual name for the Brythonic speech of the Hen Ogledd . Jackson suggested the name " Primitive Cumbric " for the dialect spoken at the time . 
 Sweetser gives the example of the name <unk> found in the Gododdin ; in British this would have been <unk> . The middle unstressed o and the final unstressed os have been lost . Ifor Williams , whose 1938 text laid the foundations for modern scholarly study of the poetry , considered that part of it could be regarded as being of likely late 6th @-@ century origin . This would have been orally transmitted for a period before being written down . Dillon cast doubt on the date of composition , arguing that it is unlikely that by the end of the 6th century Primitive Welsh would have developed into a language " not notably earlier than that of the ninth century " . He suggests that the poetry may have been composed in the 9th century on traditional themes and attributed to Aneirin . Jackson however considers that there is " no real substance " in these arguments , and points out that the poetry would have been transmitted orally for a long period before being written down , and would have been modernised by reciters , and that there is in any case nothing in the language used which would rule out a date around 600 . Koch suggests a rather earlier date , about 570 , and also suggests that the poem may have existed in written form by the 7th century , much earlier than usually thought . Koch , reviewing the arguments about the date of the poetry in 1997 , states : 
 Today , the possibility of an outright forgery - which would amount to the anachronistic imposition of a modern literary concept onto early Welsh tradition - is no longer in serious contention . Rather , the narrowing spectrum of alternatives ranges from a Gododdin corpus which is mostly a literary creation of mediaeval Wales based on a fairly slender thread of traditions from the old Brittonic North to a corpus which is in large part recoverable as a text actually composed in that earlier time and place . " 
 Koch himself believes that a considerable part of the poem can be dated to the 6th century . Greene in 1971 considered that the language of the poem was 9th century rather than 6th century , and Isaac , writing in 1999 , stated that the linguistic evidence did not necessitate dating the poem as a whole before the 9th or 10th century . 
 The other approach to dating the poetry has been to look at it from a historical point of view . Charles @-@ Edwards writing in 1978 concluded that : 
 The historical arguments , therefore , suggest that the poem is the authentic work of Aneirin ; that we can establish the essential nature of the poem from the two surviving versions ; but that we cannot , except in favourable circumstances , establish the wording of the original . 
 Dumville , commenting on these attempts to establish the historicity of the poem in 1988 , said , " The case for authenticity , whatever exactly we mean by that , is not proven ; but that does not mean that it cannot be . " The fact that the great majority of the warriors mentioned in the poem are not known from other sources has been put forward by several authors as an argument against the idea that the poem could be a later composition . The poems which are known to be later " forgeries " have clearly been written for a purpose , for example to strengthen the claims of a particular dynasty . The men commemorated in Y Gododdin do not appear in the pedigrees of any Welsh dynasty . Breeze comments , " it is difficult to see why a later poet should take the trouble to commemorate men who , but for the poem , would be forgotten " . 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The poem is set in the area which is now southern Scotland and north @-@ east England . Around the year 600 this area included a number of Brythonic kingdoms . Apart from the Gododdin , the kingdom of Alt Clut occupied the Strathclyde area and Rheged covered parts of Galloway , Lancashire and Cumbria . Further south lay the kingdom of Elmet in the Leeds area . These areas made up what was later known in Welsh as Yr Hen Ogledd ( The Old North ) . The Gododdin , known as the Votadini in the Romano @-@ British period , occupied a territory from the area around the head of the Firth of Forth as far south as the River Wear . In modern terms their lands included much of Clackmannanshire and the Lothian and Borders regions . Their capital at this period may have been called Din Eidyn , now known as Edinburgh . By this time the area that later became Northumbria had been invaded and increasingly occupied by the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia . 
 In the Historia Brittonum , attributed to Nennius , there is a reference to several poets in this area during the 6th century . Having mentioned Ida of Bernicia , the founder of the Northumbrian royal line who ruled between 547 and 559 , the Historia goes on to say : 
 At that time <unk> the Father of the Muse was famous in poetry , and <unk> , Taliesin , <unk> and Cian who is called <unk> , at one and the same time were renowned in British poetry . " 
 Nothing has been preserved of the work of <unk> , <unk> and Cian , but poems attributed to Taliesin were published by Ifor Williams in Canu Taliesin and were considered by him to be comparable in antiquity to the Gododdin . This poetry praises Urien of Rheged and his son Owain , and refers to Urien as lord of Catraeth . 
 = = = Interpretation = = = 
 Y Gododdin is not a narrative poem but a series of elegies for heroes who died in a battle whose history would have been familiar to the original listeners . The context of the poem has to be worked out from the text itself . There have been various interpretations of the events recorded in the poem . The 19th @-@ century Welsh scholar Thomas Stephens identified the Gododdin with the Votadini and Catraeth as Catterick in North Yorkshire . He linked the poem to the Battle of Degsastan in c . 603 between King Æthelfrith of Bernicia and the Gaels under Áedán mac Gabráin , king of Dál Riada . <unk> Evans in his 1922 edition and translation of the Book of Aneirin claimed that the poem referred to a battle around the Menai Strait in 1098 , <unk> the text to fit the theory . The generally accepted interpretation for the Battle of Catraeth is that put forward by Ifor Williams in his Canu Aneirin first published in 1938 . Williams interpreted <unk> <unk> in the text to refer to a person , Mynyddog Mwynfawr in modern Welsh . Mynyddog , in his version , was the king of the Gododdin , with his chief seat at Din Eidyn ( modern Edinburgh ) . Around the year 600 Mynyddog gathered about 300 selected warriors , some from as far afield as Gwynedd . He feasted them at Din Eidyn for a year , then launched an attack on Catraeth , which Williams agrees with Stephens in identifying as Catterick , which was in Anglo @-@ Saxon hands . They were opposed by a larger army from the Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia . 
 The battle at Catraeth has been seen as an attempt to resist the advance of the Angles , who had probably by then occupied the former Votadini lands of Bryneich in modern north @-@ eastern England and made it their kingdom of Bernicia . At some time after the battle , the Angles absorbed the Gododdin kingdom , possibly after the fall of their capital Din Eidyn in 638 , and incorporated it into the kingdom of Northumbria . 
 This interpretation has been accepted by most modern scholars . Jackson accepts the interpretation but suggests that a force of 300 men would be much too small to undertake the task demanded of them . He considers that the 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by a larger number of foot soldiers , not considered worthy of mention in the poem . Jarman also follows Williams ' interpretation . Jackson suggested that after the fall of the kingdom of Gododdin , in or about 638 , the poem was preserved in Strathclyde , which maintained its independence for several centuries . He considers that it was first written down in Strathclyde after a period of oral transmission , and may have reached Wales in manuscript form between the end of the 8th and the end of the 9th century . There would be particular interest in matters relating to the Gododdin in Gwynedd , since the founding myth of the kingdom involved the coming of Cunedda <unk> from <unk> Gododdin . 
 = = = Alternative interpretation = = = 
 In 1997 , John Koch published a new study of Y Gododdin which involved an attempt to reconstruct the original poetry written in what Koch terms " Archaic Neo @-@ Brittonic " . This work also included a new and very different interpretation of the background of the poetry . He draws attention to a poem in Canu Taliesin entitled <unk> Gwen Ystrat ( The Battle of Gwen Ystrat ) : 
 The men of Catraeth arise with the day 
 around a battle @-@ victorious , cattle @-@ rich sovereign 
 this is <unk> by name , the most senior leader . " 
 There is also a reference to Catraeth in the slightly later poem Moliant Cadwallon , a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd , thought to have been composed in about 633 . Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as " fierce <unk> wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth " . He identifies <unk> as the " <unk> " who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien . Koch draws attention to the mention of <unk> <unk> ( the sons of <unk> ) as an enemy in stanza 15 of the Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of " <unk> Hen <unk> " . He considers that , in view of the references in the three poems , there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat . This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c . 600 favoured by Williams and others . He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Brythons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet , with Anglian allies on both sides , Rheged being in an alliance with Deira . He points out that according to the Historia <unk> it was Rhun , son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanflæd of Deira , her father Edwin and 12 @,@ 000 of his subjects in 626 / 7 . Urien Rheged was thus the real victor of the battle . Mynyddog Mwynfawr was not a person 's name but a personal description meaning ' mountain feast ' or ' mountain chief ' . Some aspects of Koch 's view of the historical context have been criticised by both Oliver <unk> and Tim Clarkson . Clarkson , for example , makes the point that the reference in <unk> Gwen Ystrat is to " the men of Catraeth " ; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth , and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus , not Rhun , who baptized the Deirans . 
 = = Editions and translations = = 
 The first known translation of Y Gododdin was by Evan Evans ( " Ieuan <unk> " ) who printed ten stanzas with a Latin translation in his book Some Specimens of the Poetry of the Antient Welsh Bards published in 1764 . The full text was printed for the first time by Owen Jones in the <unk> <unk> in 1801 . English translations of the poem were published by William Probert in 1820 and by John Williams ( Ab <unk> ) in 1852 , followed by translations by William Forbes Skene in his Four Ancient Books of Wales ( 1866 ) and by Thomas Stephens for the <unk> Society in 1888 . <unk> Evans produced a facsimile copy of the Book of Aneirin in 1908 and an edition with a translation in 1922 . 
 The first reliable edition was Canu Aneirin by Ifor Williams with notes in Welsh , published in 1938 . New translations based on this work were published by Kenneth H. Jackson in 1969 and , with modernized Welsh text and glossary , by <unk> Jarman in 1988 . A colour facsimile edition of the manuscript with an introduction by Daniel <unk> was published by South Glamorgan County Council and the National Library of Wales in 1989 . John Koch 's new edition , which aimed to recreate the original text , appeared in 1997 . There have also been a number of translations which aim to present the Gododdin as literature rather than as a subject of scholarly study . Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry ( 1970 ) and Steve Short 's 1994 translation . 
 = = Cultural influence = = 
 There are a number of references to Y Gododdin in later Medieval Welsh poetry . The well @-@ known 12th @-@ century poem <unk> Owain by Owain Cyfeiliog , in which Owain praises his own war @-@ band , likens them to the heroes of the Gododdin and uses Y Gododdin as a model . A slightly later poet , Dafydd <unk> , in a eulogy addressed to Llywelyn the Great , wishes to be inspired " to sing as Aneirin sang / The day he sang the Gododdin " . After this period this poetry seems to have been forgotten in Wales for centuries until Evan Evans ( Ieuan <unk> ) discovered the manuscript in the late 18th century . From the early 19th century onwards there are many allusions in Welsh poetry . 
 In English , Y Gododdin was a major influence on the long poem In Parenthesis ( 1937 ) by David Jones , in which he reflects on the carnage he witnessed in the First World War . Jones put a quotation from the Gododdin at the beginning of each of the seven sections of In Parenthesis . Another poet writing in English , Richard <unk> , used Y Gododdin as the basis of his difficult but much @-@ admired poem For the Fallen ( 1997 ) , written in memory of his son Tom . Tony Conran 's poem Elegy for the Welsh Dead , in the Falklands Islands , 1982 opens with the line ' Men went to Catraeth ' , using the original poem to comment on a contemporary conflict . 
 The poem has also inspired a number of historical novels , including Men Went to <unk> ( 1969 ) by John James , The Shining Company ( 1990 ) by Rosemary Sutcliff and The Amber Treasure ( 2009 ) by Richard J Denning . In 1989 the British industrial band Test Dept brought out an album entitled Gododdin , in which the words of the poem were set to music , part in the original and part in English translation . This was a collaboration with the Welsh avant @-@ garde theatre company Brith Gof and was performed in Wales , Germany , Italy , the Netherlands and Scotland . 
 = Cyclone Rusty = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Rusty was a strong , slow @-@ moving tropical cyclone that produced record duration gale @-@ force winds in Port Hedland , Western Australia in late February 2013 . Originating as an area of low pressure on 22 February well to the northwest of the Kimberley region of Western Australia , the precursor to Rusty steadily developed within a favourable environment . Gradually decreasing surface pressures in the region signaled intensification and the low was classified as Tropical Cyclone Rusty on 23 February . Although a large , sprawling system , near @-@ record high sea surface temperatures enabled Rusty to quickly deepen . Becoming essentially stationary on 25 February , the system acquired hurricane @-@ force winds as its core improved in structure . The cyclone achieved its peak intensity two days later with maximum ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 945 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 91 inHg ) . Thereafter , interaction with land caused its core to collapse before the system made landfall near Pardoo Station . Rusty weakened below cyclone strength on 28 February . Its remnants persisted over Western Australia for several more days before being absorbed into an extratropical cyclone on 5 March . 
 Owing to the slow @-@ moving nature of Rusty , a large swath of coastal Western Australia saw heavy rains from the storm with a storm peak of 374 mm ( 14 @.@ 7 in ) at De Grey Station . Substantial flooding took place accordingly ; the De Grey River crested just shy of its all @-@ time record at 17 @.@ 23 m ( 56 @.@ 5 ft ) . Some structural damage took place , but the predominant effects of the storm were sustained by agriculture and infrastructure . Economic losses related to the storm were estimated to be as high as A $ 500 million ( US $ 480 million ) . The name Rusty was later retired and replaced with <unk> . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In late February 2013 , a monsoon trough combined with the Madden – Julian oscillation to produce an area of low pressure on 22 February well to the northeast of the Kimberley region . Upon its formation , the Bureau of Meteorology ( BoM ) began monitoring the system as Tropical Low <unk> . Low to moderate upper @-@ level wind shear and favorable diffluence supported tropical cyclogenesis as the system moved slowly south along the edge of a subtropical ridge . By 23 February , deep convective banding features were wrapping into a well @-@ defined circulation . This prompted the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 0300 UTC and subsequently initiate advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17S at 0000 UTC on 24 February . Surface pressures around the cyclone had significantly decreased by this time , with an automated weather station on Rowley Shoals , roughly 130 km ( 80 mi ) southeast of the storm 's centre , recording a 7 mbar ( hPa ; 0 @.@ 21 inHg ) drop to 993 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 33 inHg ) in 24 hours . The BoM similarly classified the system as a tropical cyclone hours later as gale @-@ force winds were observed on Bedout Island . They consequently assigned it the name Rusty , at which time the cyclone was situated roughly 360 km ( 220 mi ) north of Port Hedland , Western Australia . 
 A large monsoonal cyclone , Rusty featured an expansive cloud mass with a relatively cloud @-@ free centre spanning 160 km ( 100 mi ) . Under normal circumstances , cyclones of this nature tend to develop slowly due to their sprawling nature ; however , near @-@ record high sea surface temperatures of 31 to 32 ° C ( 88 to 90 ° F ) fueled an unusually quick organization . The high temperatures were linked to a record warm January across the entirety of Australia . Additionally the warmth extended to a great depth , resulting in a high tropical cyclone heat potential of 90 kJ / cm2 . Throughout 24 February , convective bands steadily consolidated around the circulation as it intensified . The strongest winds continued to be displaced well to the south of the centre , however , within the most persistent convective band . This large , intense band extended westward from Broome to Port Hedland and into the western portion of Rusty 's circulation . Areas within this band experienced gale @-@ force winds despite being more than 200 km ( 120 mi ) away from the cyclone . Increasingly rapid strengthening took place later in the day with a 35 km ( 25 mi ) wide eye developing . Rusty became virtually stationary late on 25 February as a trough to its south weakened the ridge previously steering the cyclone south .
