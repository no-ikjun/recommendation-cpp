 In the 2000s , several car audio manufacturers have produced subwoofers using non @-@ circular shapes from manufacturers including Boston Acoustic , Kicker , Sony , Bazooka , and X @-@ Tant . These shapes typically carry some sort of distortion penalties . In situations of limited mounting space they provide a greater cone area and assuming all other variables are constant , greater maximum output . An important factor in the " square sub vs round sub " argument is the effects of the enclosure used . In a sealed enclosure , the maximum displacement is determined by 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <unk> stands for volume of displacement ( in m3 ) 
 <unk> to the amount of linear excursion the speaker is mechanically capable of ( in m ) 
 Sd to the cone area of the sub woofer ( in m2 ) . 
 These are some of the Thiele / Small parameters which can either be measured or found with the driver specifications . 
 = = = Cinema sound = = = 
 After the introduction of Sensurround , movie theater owners began installing permanent subwoofer systems . Dolby Stereo 70 mm Six Track was a six channel film sound format introduced in 1976 that used two subwoofer channels for stereo reproduction of low frequencies . In 1981 , Altec introduced a dedicated cinema subwoofer model tuned to around 20 Hz : the <unk> . Starting in 1983 , THX certification of the cinema sound experience quantified the parameters of good audio for watching films , including requirements for subwoofer performance levels and enough isolation from outside sounds so that noise did not interfere with the listening experience . This helped provide guidelines for multiplex cinema owners who wanted to isolate each individual cinema from its neighbors , even as louder subwoofers were making isolation more difficult . Specific cinema subwoofer models appeared from JBL , Electro @-@ Voice , Eastern Acoustic Works , <unk> , Meyer Sound Laboratories and <unk> Systems in the early 1990s . In 1992 , Dolby Digital 's six @-@ channel film sound format incorporated a single <unk> channel , the " point one " in 5 @.@ 1 surround sound . 
 Tom <unk> , a Boston @-@ based <unk> , blames complaints about modern movies being too loud on subwoofers . He says that before subwoofers made it possible to have loud , relatively undistorted bass , movie sound levels were limited by the distortion in less capable systems at low frequency and high levels . 
 = = = Sound reinforcement = = = 
 Professional audio subwoofers used in rock concerts in stadiums , DJ performances at EDM festivals and similar events must be capable of very high output levels with low distortion . This is reflected in the design attention given in recent years to the subwoofer applications for sound reinforcement , public address systems , dance club systems and concert systems . Consumer applications ( as in home use ) are considerably less demanding due to much smaller listening space and lower playback levels . Subwoofers are now almost universal in professional sound applications such as live concert sound , churches , nightclubs , and theme parks . Movie theatres certified to the THX standard for playback always include high capability subwoofers . Some professional applications require subwoofers designed for very high sound levels , using multiple 12 " , 15 " , 18 " or 21 " drivers ( 30 cm , 40 cm , 45 cm , 53 cm respectively ) . Drivers as small as 10 " ( 25 cm ) are occasionally used , generally in horn loaded enclosures . 
 The number of subwoofer enclosures used in a concert depends on a number of factors , including the size of the venue , whether it is indoors or outdoors , the amount of low @-@ frequency content in the band 's sound , the desired volume of the concert , and the design and construction of the enclosures ( e.g. , direct @-@ radiating versus horn @-@ loaded . A small bar may use a single direct @-@ radiating 15 @-@ inch ( 40 cm ) sub cabinet . A large dance club may have a row of four or five twin 18 @-@ inch ( 45 cm ) subwoofer cabinets , or more ) . In the largest stadium venues , there may be a very large number of subwoofer enclosures . For example , the 2009 – 2010 U2 360 ° Tour uses 24 Clair Brothers BT @-@ 218 subwoofers ( a double 18 " ( 45 cm ) box ) around the perimeter of the central circular stage , and 72 proprietary Clair Brothers cardioid S4 subwoofers placed underneath the ring @-@ shaped " B " stage which encircles the central main stage . 
 The main speakers may be ' flown ' from the ceiling of a venue on chain hoists , and ' flying points ' ( i.e. , attachment points ) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures . Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage . There can be more than 50 double @-@ 18 @-@ inch ( 45 cm ) cabinets in a typical concert system . Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium @-@ density fibreboard ( MDF ) , Oriented strand board ( OSB ) , plywood , plastic or other dense material , professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials . MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern . Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood : the Altec <unk> ( 1981 ) used 7 @-@ ply 28 mm birch @-@ faced oak plywood . Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18 – 20 mm thick void @-@ free Baltic birch ( Betula pendula or Betula pubescens ) plywood from Finland , Estonia or Russia ; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures . Not naturally weatherproof , Baltic birch is coated with carpet , thick paint or spray @-@ on truck <unk> to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability . 
 Touring subwoofer cabinets are typically designed with features that facilitate moving the enclosure ( e.g. , wheels , a " towel bar " handle and recessed handles ) , a protective grill for the speaker ( in direct radiating @-@ style cabinets ) , metal or plastic protection for the cabinets to protect the finish as the cabinets are being slid one on top of another , and hardware to facilitate stacking the cabinets ( e.g. , interlocking corners ) and for " flying " the cabinets from stage rigging . 
 In the 2000s , many small @-@ to mid @-@ size subwoofers designed for bands ' live sound use and DJ applications are " powered subs " ; that is , they have an integrated power amplifier . These models typically have a built @-@ in crossover . Some models have a metal @-@ reinforced hole in which a speaker stand can be mounted for full @-@ range cabinets . 
 = = = = Full @-@ range system = = = = 
 In professional concert sound system design , subwoofers can be incorporated seamlessly with the main speakers into a stereo or mono full @-@ range system by using an active crossover . Such a system receives its signal from the main mono or stereo mixing console mix bus and amplifies all frequencies together in the desired balance . If the main sound system is stereo , the subwoofers can also be in stereo . Otherwise , a mono subwoofer channel can be derived within the crossover from a stereo mix , depending on the crossover make and model . 
 = = = = Aux @-@ fed subwoofers = = = = 
 Instead of being incorporated into a full @-@ range system , concert subwoofers can be supplied with their own signal from a separate mix bus on the mixing console ; often one of the auxiliary sends ( " aux " or " <unk> " ) is used . This configuration is called " aux @-@ fed subwoofers " , and has been observed to significantly reduce low frequency " muddiness " that can build up in a concert sound system which has on stage a number of microphones each picking up low frequencies and each having different phase relationships of those low frequencies . The aux @-@ fed subs method greatly reduces the number of sources feeding the subwoofers to include only those instruments that have desired low frequency information ; sources such as kick drum , bass guitar , samplers and keys . This simplifies the signal sent to the subwoofers and makes for greater clarity and low punch . Aux @-@ fed subs can even be stereo , if desired , using two auxiliary mix buses . 
 = = = = Directional bass = = = = 
 | thumb | <unk> dispersion pattern of two end @-@ fire subwoofers placed one in front of the other . The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds . In order to keep low frequency energy focused on the audience area and not on the stage , and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space , a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern . These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array ; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion ; and setting up a delay @-@ shaded system . 
 = = = = = Vertical array = = = = = 
 <unk> or rigging the subwoofers in a vertical array focuses the low frequencies forward to a greater or lesser extent depending on the physical length of the array . Longer arrays have a more directional effect at lower frequencies . The directionality is more pronounced in the vertical dimension , yielding a radiation pattern that is wide but not tall . This helps reduce the amount of low frequency sound bouncing off the ceiling indoors and assists in mitigating external noise complaints outdoors . 
 = = = = = Rear delay array = = = = = 
 Another cardioid subwoofer array pattern can be used horizontally , one which takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space . This method is often called " cardioid subwoofer array " or " CSA " even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is cardioid . The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one out of every three subwoofers across the front of the stage , and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage . Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically , by reversing the wiring polarity , or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward . This method reduces forward output relative to a tight @-@ packed , flat @-@ fronted array of subwoofers , but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage . Compared to the end @-@ fire array , this method has less on @-@ axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience , and more predictable cancellation rearward . The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave . 
 A second method of rear delay array combines end @-@ fire topology with polarity reversal , using two subwoofers positioned front to back , the drivers spaced one @-@ quarter wavelength apart , the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed by a few milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency . This method has the least output power directed toward the audience , compared to other directional methods . 
 = = = = = End @-@ fire array = = = = = 
 The end @-@ fire subwoofer method , also called " forward steered arrays " , places subwoofer drivers co @-@ axially in one or more rows , using destructive interference to reduce emissions to the sides and rear . This can be done with separate subwoofer enclosures positioned front to back with a spacing between them of one @-@ quarter wavelength of the target frequency , the frequency that is least wanted on stage or most desired in the audience . Each row is delayed beyond the first row by an amount related to the speed of sound in air ; typically a few milliseconds . The arrival time of sound energy from all the subwoofers is near @-@ simultaneous from the audience 's perspective , but is canceled out to a large degree behind the subwoofers because of offset sound wave arrival times . <unk> of the target frequency can achieve as much as 25 dB rear attenuation , and the forward sound is coherently summed in line with the subwoofers . The positional technique of end @-@ fire subwoofers came into widespread use in European live concert sound in 2006 . 
 The end @-@ fire array trades a few decibels of output power for directionality , so it requires more enclosures for the same output power as a tight @-@ packed , flat @-@ fronted array of enclosures . Sixteen enclosures in four rows were used in 2007 at one of the stages of the Ultra Music Festival , to reduce low frequency interference to neighboring stages . Because of the physical size of the end @-@ fire array , few concert venues are able to implement it . The output pattern suffers from comb @-@ filtering off @-@ axis , but can be further shaped by adjusting the frequency response of each row of subwoofers . 
 = = = = = Delay @-@ shaded array = = = = = 
 A long line of subwoofers placed horizontally along the front edge of the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them , which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors , continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row ( <unk> ) . This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of horizontal dispersion pattern seen with a horizontal subwoofer array . Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array . 
 = = = = = Directional enclosure = = = = = 
 Some subwoofer enclosure designs rely on drivers facing to the sides or to the rear in order to achieve a degree of directionality . End @-@ fire drivers can be positioned within a single enclosure that houses more than one driver . 
 = = = Bass instrument amplification = = = 
 In rare cases , sound reinforcement subwoofer enclosures are also used for bass instrument amplification by electric bass players and synth bass players . For most bands and most small- to mid @-@ size venues ( e.g. , nightclubs and bars ) , standard bass guitar speaker enclosures or keyboard amplifiers will provide sufficient sound pressure levels for onstage monitoring . Since a regular electric bass has a low " E " ( 41 Hz ) as its lowest note , most standard bass guitar cabinets are only designed with a range that goes down to about 40 Hz . However , in some cases , performers wish to have extended sub @-@ bass response that is not available from standard instrument speaker enclosures , so they use subwoofer cabinets . Just as some electric guitarists add huge stacks of guitar cabinets mainly for show , some bassists will add immense subwoofer cabinets with 18 " woofers mainly for show , and the extension sub cabinets will be operated at a lower volume than the main bass cabinets . 
 Bass guitar players who may use subwoofer cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses that include a low " B " string ( about 31 Hz ) ; bassists who play in styles where a very powerful sub @-@ bass response is an important part of the sound ( e.g. , funk , Latin , gospel , R & B , etc . ) ; and / or bass players who perform in stadium @-@ size venues or large outdoor venues . Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on @-@ stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards ( which go down to a low " C " which is about 33 Hz ) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub @-@ bass parts that go as low as 18 Hz . Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage , synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches , because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ , which have as their lowest notes a low " A " and a low " C " , respectively , a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave . A synth player can add lower octaves to a patch by pressing an " octave down " button , which can produce pitches that are at the limits of human hearing . 
 Several concert sound subwoofer manufacturers suggest that their subs can be used for bass instrument amplification . Meyer Sound suggests that its 650 @-@ R2 Concert Series Subwoofer , a 14 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 3 m2 ) enclosure with two 18 @-@ inch drivers ( 45 cm ) , can be used for bass instrument amplification . While performers who use concert sound subwoofers for onstage monitoring may like the powerful sub @-@ bass sound that they get onstage , sound engineers may find the use of large subwoofers ( e.g. , two 18 " drivers ( 45 cm ) ) for onstage instrument monitoring to be problematic , because it may interfere with the " Front of House " sub @-@ bass sound . 
 = = Bass shakers = = 
 Since subsonic bass is felt , sub @-@ bass can be augmented using tactile transducers . Unlike a typical subwoofer driver , which produces audible vibrations , tactile transducers produce low @-@ frequency vibrations that are designed to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor . Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class , called variously " bass shakers " , " butt shakers " and " throne shakers " . They are attached to a seat , for instance a drummer 's stool ( " throne " ) or gamer 's chair , car seat or home theater seating , and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear in a manner similar to bone conduction . They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer . They can be attached to a large flat surface ( for instance a floor or platform ) to create a large low frequency conduction area , although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat . 
 The advantage of tactile transducers used for low frequencies is that they allow a listening environment that is not filled with loud low frequency waves . This helps the concert drummer to monitor his or her kick drum performance without " polluting " the stage with powerful low frequency waves from a 15 " ( 40 cm ) subwoofer monitor . By not having a subwoofer monitor , a bass shaker also enables a drummer to lower the sound pressure levels that he is exposed to during a performance . For home cinema or videogame use , bass shakers help the user avoid disturbing others in nearby apartments or rooms , because even powerful sound effects such as explosion sounds in a war videogame or the simulated rumbling of an earthquake in an adventure film will not be heard by others . However , some critics argue that the felt vibrations are disconnected from the auditory experience , and they claim that that music is less satisfying with the " butt shaker " than sound effects . As well , critics have claimed that the bass shaker itself can rattle during loud sound effects , which can distract the listener .

 With varying measures upon which to base claims , several subwoofers have been said to be the world 's largest , loudest or lowest . 
 = = = Matterhorn = = = 
 The Matterhorn is a subwoofer model completed in March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville , Georgia after a U.S. military request for a loudspeaker that could project infrasonic waves over a distance . The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20 Hz , and generate 94 dB at a distance of 250 meters ( 820 ft ) , and more than 140 dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth . It can generate a constant 15 Hz sine wave tone at 140 dB for 24 hours a day , seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion . The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80 Hz , and is down 3 dB at 12 Hz . It was built within an intermodal container 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long and 8 by 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m × 2 @.@ 4 m ) square . The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long @-@ throw 15 @-@ inch ( 40 cm ) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000 @-@ watt amplifier . The manufacturer claims that 53 13 @-@ ply 18 mm 4 @-@ by @-@ 8 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m × 2 @.@ 4 m ) sheets of plywood were used in its construction , though one of the fabricators wrote that double @-@ thickness 26 @-@ ply sheets were used for convenience . 
 A diesel generator is housed within the enclosure to supply electricity when external power is unavailable . Of the constant tone output capability , designer Tom Danley wrote that the " target 94 dB at 250 meters is not the essentially fictional ' burst ' or ' peak SPL ' nonsense in pro sound , or like the ' death burp ' signal used in car sound contests . " At the annual National Systems Contractors Association ( <unk> ) convention in March 2007 , the Matterhorn was barred from making any loud demonstrations of its power because of concerns about damaging the building of the Orange County Convention Center . Instead , using only a single 20 amp electrical circuit for safety , visitors were allowed to step inside the horn of the subwoofer for an " acoustic massage " as the fractionally powered Matterhorn reproduced low level 10 – 15 Hz waves .

 Another subwoofer claimed to be the world 's biggest is a custom installation in Italy made by Royal Device primarily of bricks , concrete and sound @-@ deadening material consisting of two subwoofers embedded in the foundation of a listening room .

Each subwoofer is driven by eight 18 @-@ inch subwoofer drivers with 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) voice coils . The designers assert that the floor mouths of the horns are additionally loaded acoustically by a vertical wooden horn expansion and the room 's ceiling to create a 10 Hz " full power " wave at the listening position . 
 = = = Concept Design 60 @-@ inch = = = 
 A single 60 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 500 mm ) diameter subwoofer driver was designed by Richard Clark and David <unk> with the help of Dr. Eugene <unk> of the Georgia Institute of Technology . The driver was intended to break sound pressure level records when mounted in a road vehicle , calculated to be able to achieve more than 180 <unk> . It was built in 1997 , driven by DC motors connected to a rotary crankshaft somewhat like in a piston engine . The cone diameter was 54 inches ( 1 @,@ 400 mm ) and was held in place with a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) surround . With a 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) peak @-@ to @-@ peak stroke , it created a one @-@ way air displacement of 6 @,@ 871 cubic inches ( 112 @,@ 600 cm3 ) . It was capable of generating 5 – 20 Hz sine waves at various DC motor speeds — not as a response to audio signal — it could not play music . The driver was mounted in a <unk> owned by Tim <unk> but was too powerful for the amount of applied reinforcement and damaged the vehicle . MTX 's Loyd Ivey helped underwrite the project and the driver was then called the MTX " Thunder 1000000 " ( one million ) . 
 Still unfinished , the vehicle was entered in an SPL competition in 1997 at which a complaint was lodged against the computer control of the DC motor . Instead of using the controller , two leads were touched together in the hope that the motor speed was set correctly . The drive shaft broke after one positive stroke which created an interior pressure wave of 162 dB . The Concept Design 60 @-@ inch was not shown in public after 1998 .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the disrupted 2012 race by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , and led overall with 81 victories to Oxford 's 76 , with one " dead heat " . The race was sponsored for the second consecutive year by BNY Mellon . 
 Following the disruption caused by a protestor in the previous year 's race , Royal Marines provided support to the security arrangements surrounding the race . Race director David Searle urged nobody to repeat the disruption of 2012 , saying " What I would say to anybody thinking of doing that , is that it 's unbelievably dangerous ... We had practised emergency stops and it worked " . The manner of any potential restart was modified to allow the race re @-@ commence as soon as practicable . The Metropolitan Police had made contact with the protestor , Trenton Oldfield , to assist him making a more peaceful protest should he wish to do so , but he declined the offer and did not attend the race in any capacity . 
 Oxford announced that they had named their boat Acer in honour of former cox Acer Nethercott who had died two months earlier from brain cancer . Nethercott , an Olympic silver medallist in Beijing , had coxed Oxford in the 2003 , 2004 and 2005 races . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race .

Oxford 's Sean Bowden who was coaching the university for an eighteenth time , was " very satisfied " with his crew . Milan <unk> was the first Czech rower in the history of the Boat Race . Three medallists from the 2012 Summer Olympics featured : Cambridge 's George Nash won a bronze for Great Britain in the coxless pair , Oxford 's Constantine Louloudis won bronze for Great Britain in the men 's eight and his crew @-@ mate Malcolm Howard won silver for Canada in the same event .

 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . The weather conditions were adverse , with a " brisk wind " and snow flurries prior to the race . The race commenced at 4 @.@ 31 pm , and despite a good start from Cambridge , Oxford quickly moved to hold a half @-@ length lead . With blades nearly overlapping , Umpire Pinsent issued warnings to both coxes to avoid a clash , and approaching Hammersmith Bridge , Oxford 's lead extended to nearly a length . Cambridge kept in touch despite a push from Oxford , but by Barnes Bridge , Oxford were two lengths clear , and according to James Cracknell , they were " the fastest eight in the world right now . " Oxford passed the finishing post one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths clear , in a time of 17 minutes 27 seconds . 
 In the reserve race , Oxford 's Isis defeated Cambridge 's Goldie by one third of a length , the smallest margin of victory ever recorded in the reserves race . Oxford won the 68th Women 's Boat Race by one @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter lengths .

 The BBC apologised for broadcasting Zorilla 's repeated swearing . A microphone in the Oxford boat picked up the " bad language " during the latter half of the race which was subsequently broadcast live on both BBC One and the BBC World News channel . Further swearing from Zorilla was broadcast as he emerged from the Thames after the customary soaking of the victorious cox . 
 = Effects of Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey = 
 The effects of Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate , limited to fallen trees , two deaths , and $ 50 million in damage ( 2003 USD , $ 59 million 2008 USD ) . Hurricane Isabel formed from a tropical wave on September 6 in the tropical Atlantic Ocean . It moved northwestward , and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165 mph ( 265 km / h ) on September 11 . After fluctuating in intensity for four days , Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on September 18 . It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day . Several days before Isabel made landfall , there existed uncertainty in where the hurricane would strike . At least one computer model predicted a landfall on New Jersey , and as a result services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane . 
 Isabel passed 215 miles ( 350 km ) southwest of the state , though its large wind core produced tropical storm force winds across much of the state . The winds downed hundreds of trees and power lines , leaving hundreds of thousands without power . A falling tree killed one person . Hurricane Isabel produced rough waves and a moderate storm surge along the coastline . One person was killed from the rough waves , and at least 50 locations along the Jersey Shore reported beach erosion from the hurricane . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 44 hours before Hurricane Isabel made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina , the National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watch for the coastline from Little Egg Inlet southward into the Mid @-@ Atlantic . A day later , the watch was extended northward to Sandy Hook . When Isabel was 26 hours from making landfall , the watches were changed to tropical storm warnings , and 10 hours before it struck land the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the remainder of the New Jersey coastline . The National Hurricane Center also briefly issued a hurricane watch for the New Jersey coastline . While over the western Atlantic Ocean as a Category 5 hurricane , forecasters predicted Isabel would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 170 miles ( 275 km ) south of Cape May as a 115 @-@ mph ( 185 @-@ km / h ) major hurricane . By four days before the hurricane struck land , at least one computer model predicted Isabel would strike New Jersey . 
 News stations were stationed with crews along the Jersey shore several days in advance of Isabel to provide breaking news and live conditions . Many residents prepared their houses by boarding windows and purchasing emergency supplies . The Sussex County chapter of the American Red Cross advised local high schools to be on stand @-@ by as potential shelters in the event evacuation occurred . Emergency coordinators in several counties were on alert , though none issued evacuations . In preparation for anticipated power outages , the Jersey Central Power and Light company arranged to receive more electrical crews from its parent company , FirstEnergy . Other utility workers from various locations as far as Canada left for the state in the event of power outages . 
 Several flights in and out of the state were delayed or canceled , and the Cape May @-@ Lewes Ferry canceled travel across the Delaware Bay during the duration of Isabel . In Atlantic City , casino workers prepared for coastal flooding by placing sandbags at boardwalk entrances . New Jersey Transit workers secured its buses , railways , and light rail equipment . To ensure service would remain accessible during and after the hurricane , NJ Transit prepared backup generators , pumps , and chainsaws , with workers inspecting trains and the paths of the lines . FEMA mobilized and dispatched an Urban Search and Rescue Task Force of 28 people to the state for possible rescue duty . Days before the storm made landfall , the Salvation Army prepared food and aid for potentially affected citizens . In anticipation for the effects of Isabel , Governor Jim McGreevey declared a state of emergency , which allowed the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deal with the situation . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Isabel produced a storm surge along the New Jersey coastline of up to 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 m ) in Cape May . Higher amounts occurred along the Delaware River , peaking in the state at 10 @.@ 6 feet ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) in Burlington . At its closest approach , Isabel passed within about 215 miles ( 350 km ) of the state , and as a result the outer rainbands produced light rainfall . Wildwood along the southeast coast reported 1 @.@ 3 inches ( 33 mm ) of rain , while Lincoln Park in the northern portion of the state recorded 2 @.@ 07 inches ( 52 mm ) of precipitation . The large wind field of the hurricane produced moderate winds across the state . A shoal in the Delaware Bay experienced sustained winds of 54 mph ( 87 km / h ) with gusts to 71 mph ( 114 km / h ) . Cape May reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) , while Newark in the northern portion of the state experienced gusts to 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) . 
 Hurricane Isabel produced slightly above normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore , killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest . The combination of gusty winds and the heavy surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline , primarily to beaches facing southeastward . In the Delaware Bay and River area , no significant erosion was reported , though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed the deck of a house in <unk> . In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in Ocean City and Avalon , with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and <unk> in Whale Beach being exposed . Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage , minor coastal flooding , and slight beach erosion . The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 to 1 @.@ 2 m ) of sand , while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion . Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) , with Union Beach losing about 5 @,@ 000 sq. feet ( 465 sq. m ) of sand . 
 Moderate wind gusts throughout the state downed hundreds of trees , tree limbs , and power lines . Over 382 @,@ 000 people were without power , one of the worst power outages on record for area utilities . Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County . One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown , and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars . A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck , and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving . Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford , causing injuries to two women when they were struck . Throughout the state , damage totaled to about $ 50 million ( 2003 USD , $ 59 million 2008 USD ) .

 While touring on the Clash of the Titans tour to promote the 1990 studio album Seasons in the Abyss , separate sections of the Decade of Aggression album were recorded on October 14 , 1990 , March 8 , 1991 , and July 13 , 1991 , however , AllMusic said that Rick Rubin 's production " seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig . " Although it had a working title of Decade of Decadence , it would be released as Decade of Aggression after Mötley Crüe copyrighted the name on their 1991 greatest hits album . It was released through Def American Recordings on October 22 , 1991 . 
 The release was intended to give them time to decide what their next album 's style would be . Text in the book The Great Rock Discography said that it was released after the band had gained popularity , saying " Slayer had finally made it into the metal big league and summing up the first blood @-@ soaked chapter of their career , the group duly released the live double set . " It was also released to commemorate their 10th anniversary . 
 The album does not feature an overdub of guitars . In The Rough Guide To Rock , it was said to be " intense " and " put studio favorites through the live shredder in a brutal and definitive manner . " Most of the tracks were a selection from South of Heaven , Reign in Blood , and Seasons in the Abyss . The album 's total duration is one hour , twenty @-@ five minutes , and twenty @-@ eight seconds ( 85 : 28 ) .

Jurek also gave note to how Rick Rubin made the two @-@ discs sound like it were recorded at one gig , writing " Producer Rick Rubin stays out of the way ; his production seems to be in terms of shaping the live sound to make it sound like this is all one gig . " Entertainment Weekly 's David Browne said that it was an " accurate aural snapshots of what it 's like to be part of a crowd <unk> to see the action on a stage that seems two miles away .

" Joel McIver , author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer said that it was regarded as one of the best live albums released by a heavy metal band . 
 The album charted on three different charts . On November 9 , 1991 , it peaked at number 55 on the Billboard 200 . On January 13 , 1992 , the album entered the Media Control Charts , where it peaked at number 77 . It maintained a number on the chart until February 2 , 1992 , giving it a total of three weeks on the chart . On December 2 , 1991 it entered the UK Album Charts , peaking at number 29 .

 = H.M.S. Pinafore = 
 H.M.S. Pinafore ; or , The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a comic opera in two acts , with music by Arthur Sullivan and a libretto by W. S. Gilbert . It opened at the Opera Comique in London , on 25 May 1878 and ran for 571 performances , which was the second @-@ longest run of any musical theatre piece up to that time . H.M.S. Pinafore was Gilbert and Sullivan 's fourth operatic collaboration and their first international sensation . 
 The story takes place aboard the ship HMS Pinafore . The captain 's daughter , Josephine , is in love with a lower @-@ class sailor , Ralph Rackstraw , although her father intends her to marry Sir Joseph Porter , the First Lord of the Admiralty . She abides by her father 's wishes at first , but Sir Joseph 's advocacy of the equality of humankind encourages Ralph and Josephine to overturn conventional social order . They declare their love for each other and eventually plan to elope . The captain discovers this plan , but , as in many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , a surprise disclosure changes things dramatically near the end of the story . 
 Drawing on several of his earlier " Bab Ballad " poems , Gilbert imbued this plot with mirth and silliness . The opera 's humour focuses on love between members of different social classes and lampoons the British class system in general . Pinafore also pokes good @-@ natured fun at patriotism , party politics , the Royal Navy , and the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority . The title of the piece comically applies the name of a garment for girls and women , a pinafore , to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship . 
 Pinafore 's extraordinary popularity in Britain , America and elsewhere was followed by the similar success of a series of Gilbert and Sullivan works , including The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado . Their works , later known as the Savoy operas , dominated the musical stage on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a decade and continue to be performed today . The structure and style of these operas , particularly Pinafore , were much copied and contributed significantly to the development of modern musical theatre . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1875 , Richard D 'Oyly Carte , who was then managing the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro , brought Gilbert and Sullivan together to write their second show , a one @-@ act opera entitled Trial by Jury . This proved a success , and in 1876 D 'Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company , which was devoted to the production and promotion of family @-@ friendly English comic opera . With this theatre company , Carte finally had the financial resources , after many failed attempts , to produce a new full @-@ length Gilbert and Sullivan opera . This next opera was The Sorcerer , which opened in November 1877 . It too was successful , running for 178 performances . Sheet music from the show sold well , and street musicians played the melodies . 
 Instead of writing a piece for production by a theatre proprietor , as was usual in Victorian theatres , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte produced the show with their own financial support . They were therefore able to choose their own cast of performers , rather than being obliged to use the actors already engaged at the theatre . They chose talented actors , most of whom were not well @-@ known stars and did not command high fees , and to whom they could teach a more naturalistic style of performance than was commonly used at the time . They then tailored their work to the particular abilities of these performers . The skill with which Gilbert and Sullivan used their performers had an effect on the audience ; as critic Herman Klein wrote : " we secretly marvelled at the naturalness and ease with which [ the Gilbertian quips and absurdities ] were said and done . For until then no living soul had seen upon the stage such weird , eccentric , yet intensely human beings . ... [ They ] conjured into existence a hitherto unknown comic world of sheer delight . " 
 The success of The Sorcerer paved the way for another collaboration by Gilbert and Sullivan . Carte agreed on terms for a new opera with the Comedy Opera Company , and Gilbert began work on H.M.S. Pinafore before the end of 1877 . Gilbert 's father had been a naval surgeon , and the nautical theme of the opera appealed to him . He drew on several of his earlier " Bab Ballad " poems ( many of which also have nautical themes ) , including " Captain Reece " ( 1868 ) and " General John " ( 1867 ) . Some of the characters also have prototypes in the ballads : Dick Deadeye is based on a character in " Woman 's Gratitude " ( 1869 ) ; an early version of Ralph Rackstraw can be seen in " Joe Go @-@ Lightly " ( 1867 ) , with its sailor madly in love with the daughter of someone who far outranks him ; and Little Buttercup is taken almost wholesale from " The Bumboat Woman 's Story " ( 1870 ) . On 27 December 1877 , while Sullivan was on holiday on the French Riviera , Gilbert sent him a plot sketch accompanied by the following note : 
 I have very little doubt whatever but that you will be pleased with it . ... there is a good deal of fun in it which I haven 't set down on paper . Among other things a song ( a kind of ' Judge 's Song ' ) for the First Lord – tracing his career as office @-@ boy ... clerk , traveller , junior partner and First Lord of Britain 's Navy . ... Of course there will be no personality in this – the fact that the First Lord in the Opera is a Radical of the most pronounced type will do away with any suspicion that W. H. Smith is intended . 
 Despite Gilbert 's disclaimer , audiences , critics and even the Prime Minister identified Sir Joseph Porter with W. H. Smith ( a politician who had recently been appointed First Lord of the Admiralty despite having neither military nor nautical experience ) . Sullivan was delighted with the sketch , and Gilbert read a first draft of the plot to Carte in mid @-@ January . 
 Following the example of his mentor , T. W. Robertson , Gilbert strove to ensure that the costumes and sets were as realistic as possible . When preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore , Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth in April 1878 to inspect ships . Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a model set for the carpenters to work from . This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama , in which naturalism was still a relatively new concept , and in which most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged . This attention to detail was typical of Gilbert 's stage management and would be repeated in all of his Savoy Operas . Gilbert 's focus on visual accuracy provided a " right @-@ side @-@ up for topsy @-@ <unk> " , that is , a realistic point of reference that serves to heighten the whimsicality and absurdity of the situations . Sullivan was " in the full swing " of work on the piece by the middle of April 1878 . The bright and cheerful music of Pinafore was composed during a time when Sullivan suffered from excruciating pain from a kidney stone . The cast began music rehearsals on 24 April , and at the beginning of May 1878 , the two collaborators worked closely together at Sullivan 's flat to finalise the piece . 
 In Pinafore , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte used several of the principal cast members that they had assembled for The Sorcerer . As Gilbert had suggested to Sullivan in December 1877 , " Mrs. Cripps [ Little Buttercup ] will be a capital part for Everard ... Barrington will be a capital captain , and Grossmith a first @-@ rate First Lord . " However , Mrs Howard Paul , who had played Lady <unk> in The Sorcerer , was declining vocally . She was under contract to play the role of Cousin Hebe in Pinafore . Gilbert made an effort to write an amusing part for her despite Sullivan 's reluctance to use her , but by mid @-@ May 1878 , both Gilbert and Sullivan wanted her out of the cast ; unhappy with the role , she left . With only a week to go before opening night , Carte hired concert singer Jessie Bond to play Cousin Hebe . Since Bond had little experience as an actress , Gilbert and Sullivan cut the dialogue out of the role , except for a few lines in the last scene , which they turned into recitative . Other new cast members were Emma Howson and George Power in the romantic roles , who were improvements on the romantic soprano and tenor in The Sorcerer . 
 Gilbert acted as stage director for his own plays and operas . He sought realism in acting , just as he strove for realistic visual elements . He deprecated self @-@ conscious interaction with the audience and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity but were coherent internal wholes . Sullivan conducted the music rehearsals . As was to be his usual practice in his later operas , Sullivan left the overture for the last moment , sketching it out and entrusting it to the company 's music director , in this case Alfred Cellier , to complete . Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique .

 The British warship H.M.S. Pinafore is at anchor off Portsmouth . The sailors are on the quarterdeck , proudly " cleaning brasswork , splicing rope , etc . " 
 Little Buttercup , a Portsmouth " <unk> woman " ( dockside vendor ) – who is the " <unk> , <unk> , and reddest beauty in all Spithead " – comes on board to sell her wares to the crew . She hints that she may be hiding a dark secret under her " gay and frivolous exterior " . Ralph Rackstraw , " the smartest lad in all the fleet " , enters , declaring his love for the Captain 's daughter , Josephine . His fellow sailors ( excepting Dick Deadeye , the grim and ugly realist of the crew ) offer their sympathies , but they can give Ralph little hope that his love will ever be returned . 
 The gentlemanly and popular Captain Corcoran greets his " gallant crew " and compliments them on their politeness , saying that he returns the favour by never ( " well , hardly ever " ) using bad language , such as " a big , big D " . After the sailors leave , the Captain confesses to Little Buttercup that Josephine is reluctant to consider a marriage proposal from Sir Joseph Porter , the First Lord of the Admiralty . Buttercup says that she knows how it feels to love in vain . As she leaves , the Captain remarks that she is " a plump and pleasing person " . Josephine enters and reveals to her father that she loves a humble sailor in his crew , but she assures him that she is a dutiful daughter and will never reveal her love to this sailor . 
 Sir Joseph comes on board , accompanied by his " admiring crowd of sisters , cousins and aunts " . He recounts how he rose from humble beginnings to be " ruler of the Queen 's <unk> " through persistence , although he has no naval qualifications . He then delivers a humiliating lesson in etiquette , telling the Captain that he must always say " if you please " after giving an order ; for " A British sailor is any man 's equal " – excepting Sir Joseph 's . Sir Joseph has composed a song to illustrate that point , and he gives a copy of it to Ralph . Shortly afterwards , elated by Sir Joseph 's views on equality , Ralph decides that he will declare his love to Josephine . This delights his shipmates , except Dick Deadeye , who contends that " when people have to obey other people 's orders , equality 's out of the question " . Shocked by his words , the other sailors force Dick to listen to Sir Joseph 's song before they exit , leaving Ralph alone on deck . Josephine now enters , and Ralph confesses his love in terms surprisingly eloquent for a " common sailor " . Josephine is touched , but although she has found Sir Joseph 's attentions nauseating , she knows that it is her duty to marry Sir Joseph instead of Ralph . Disguising her true feelings , she " haughtily rejects " Ralph 's " proffered love " . 
 Ralph summons his shipmates ( Sir Joseph 's female relatives also arrive ) and tells them that he is bent on suicide . The crew expresses sympathy , except for Dick , who provides a stark counterpoint of dissent . Ralph puts a pistol to his head , but as he is about to pull the trigger , Josephine enters , admitting that she loves him after all . Ralph and Josephine plan to sneak ashore to elope that night . Dick Deadeye warns them to " forbear , nor carry out the scheme " , but the joyous ship 's company ignores him . 
 = = = Act II = = = 
 Later that night , under a full moon , Captain Corcoran reviews his concerns : his " kindly crew rebels " , his " daughter to a tar is partial " , his friends seem to desert him , and Sir Joseph has threatened a court @-@ martial . Little Buttercup offers sympathy . He tells her that , if it were not for the difference in their social standing , he would have returned her affection . She prophesies that things are not all as they seem and that " a change " is in store for him , but he does not understand her cryptic warning . 
 Sir Joseph enters and complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him . The Captain speculates that she is probably dazzled by his " exalted rank " and that if Sir Joseph can persuade her that " love levels all ranks " , she will accept his proposal . They withdraw , and Josephine enters , still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury . When Sir Joseph makes the argument that " love levels all ranks " , a delighted Josephine says that she " will hesitate no longer " . The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice , but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph . 
 Dick Deadeye intercepts the Captain and tells him of the lovers ' plans to elope . The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship . The pair declare their love , justifying their actions because " He is an Englishman ! " The furious Captain is unmoved and blurts out , " Why , <unk> , it 's too bad ! " Sir Joseph and his relatives , who have overheard this oath , are shocked to hear swearing on board a ship , and Sir Joseph orders the Captain confined to his cabin . 
 When Sir Joseph asks what had provoked the usually polite officer 's outburst , Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine . Furious in his turn at this revelation , and ignoring Josephine 's plea to spare Ralph , Sir Joseph has the sailor " loaded with chains " and taken to the ship 's dungeon . Little Buttercup now comes forward to reveal her long @-@ held secret . Many years ago , when she " practised baby @-@ farming " , she had cared for two babies , one " of low condition " , the other " a regular patrician " . She confesses that she " mixed those children up . ... The <unk> babe was Ralph ; your Captain was the other . " 
 Sir Joseph now realises that Ralph should have been the Captain , and the Captain should have been Ralph . He summons both , and they emerge wearing one another 's uniforms : Ralph as Captain , in command of the Pinafore , and Corcoran as a common sailor . Sir Joseph 's marriage with Josephine is now " out of the question " in his eyes : " love levels all ranks ... to a considerable extent , but it does not level them as much as that . " He hands her to Captain Rackstraw . The former Captain 's now @-@ humble social rank leaves him free to marry Buttercup . Sir Joseph settles for his cousin Hebe , and all ends in general rejoicing .

 Pinafore opened on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique , before an enthusiastic audience , with Sullivan conducting . Soon , however , the piece suffered from weak ticket sales , generally ascribed to a heat wave that made the Opera Comique particularly uncomfortable . Historian Michael <unk> questions this explanation , at least in part , stating that the heat waves in the summer of 1878 were short and transient . In any case , by mid @-@ August , Sullivan wrote to his mother that cooler weather had arrived , which was good for the show . In the meantime , the four partners of the Comedy Opera Company lost confidence in the opera 's viability and posted closing notices . Carte publicised the piece by presenting a matinee concert performance on 6 July 1878 at the enormous Crystal Palace . 
 In late August 1878 , Sullivan used some of the Pinafore music , arranged by his assistant Hamilton Clarke , during several successful promenade concerts at Covent Garden that generated interest and stimulated ticket sales . By September , Pinafore was playing to full houses at the Opera Comique . The piano score sold 10 @,@ 000 copies , and Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces . 
 Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan now had the financial resources to produce shows themselves , without outside backers . Carte persuaded the author and composer that a business partnership among the three would be to their advantage , and they hatched a plan to separate themselves from the directors of the Comedy Opera Company . The contract between Gilbert and Sullivan and the Comedy Opera Company gave the latter the right to present Pinafore for the duration of the initial run . The Opera Comique was obliged to close for drain and sewer repairs , and was renovated and redecorated by E. W. Bradwell , from Christmas 1878 to the end of January 1879 . Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte believed that this break ended the initial run , and , therefore , ended the company 's rights . Carte put the matter beyond doubt by taking a six @-@ month personal lease of the theatre beginning on 1 February 1879 , the date of its re @-@ opening , when Pinafore resumed . At the end of the six months , Carte planned to give notice to the Comedy Opera Company that its rights in the show and the theatre had ended . 
 Meanwhile , numerous versions of Pinafore , unauthorised by its creators , began playing in America with great success , beginning with a production in Boston that opened on 25 November 1878 . Pinafore became a source of popular quotations on both sides of the Atlantic , such as the exchange : 
 " What , never ? " 
 " No , never ! " 
 " What , never ? " 
 " Well , hardly ever ! " 
 In February 1879 , Pinafore resumed operations at the Opera Comique . The opera also resumed touring in April , with two companies crisscrossing the British provinces by June , one starring Richard Mansfield as Sir Joseph , the other W. S. Penley in the role . Hoping to join in on the profits to be made in America from Pinafore , Carte left in June for New York to make arrangements for an " authentic " production there to be rehearsed personally by the author and composer . He arranged to rent a theatre and auditioned chorus members for the American production of Pinafore and a new Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be premiered in New York , and for tours . 
 Sullivan , as had been arranged with Carte and Gilbert , gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he , Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce Pinafore with them and that he would be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July . In return , the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play Pinafore at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company . They offered the London and touring casts of Pinafore more money to play in their production , and although some choristers accepted their offer , only one principal player , Mr <unk> , accepted . They engaged the Imperial Theatre but had no scenery . On 31 July , they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique . Gilbert was away , and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones . Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery , although the stage manager , Richard Barker , and others , were injured . The cast went on with the show until someone shouted " Fire ! " George Grossmith , playing Sir Joseph , went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience . The police arrived to restore order , and the show continued . Gilbert sued to stop the Comedy Opera Company from staging their rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore . The court permitted the production to go on at the Imperial , beginning on 1 August 1879 , and it transferred to the Olympic Theatre in September . Pauline Rita was one of a series of <unk> . The production received good notices and initially sold well but was withdrawn in October after 91 performances . The matter was eventually settled in court , where a judge ruled in Carte 's favour about two years later . 
 After his return to London , Carte formed a new partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan to divide profits equally after the expenses of each of their shows . Meanwhile , Pinafore continued to play strongly . On 20 February 1880 , Pinafore completed its initial run of 571 performances . Only one other work of musical theatre in the world had ever run longer , Robert Planquette 's operetta Les cloches de Corneville . 
 = = = Taking Pinafore to the United States = = = 
 Approximately 150 unauthorised productions of Pinafore sprang up in the United States in 1878 and 1879 , and none of these paid royalties to the authors . Gilbert and Sullivan called them " pirated " , although the creators did not have any international copyright protection . The first of these productions , opening at the Boston Museum on 25 November 1878 , made such a splash that the piece was quickly produced in major cities and on tour by dozens of companies throughout the country . Boston alone saw at least a dozen productions , including a juvenile version described by Louisa May Alcott in her 1879 story , " Jimmy 's Cruise in the Pinafore " . In New York , different productions of the piece played simultaneously in eight theatres within five blocks of each other and in six theatres in Philadelphia . 
 These unauthorised performances took many forms , including burlesques , productions with men playing women 's roles and vice versa , spoofs , variety acts , Minstrel show versions , all @-@ black and Catholic productions , German , Yiddish and other foreign @-@ language versions , performances on boats or by church choirs , and productions starring casts of children . Few purported to play the opera as written . Sheet music arrangements were popular , there were Pinafore @-@ themed dolls and household items , and references to the opera were common in advertising , news and other media . Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte brought lawsuits in the U.S. and tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas , or at least to claim some royalties , without success . They made a special effort to claim American rights for their next work after Pinafore , The Pirates of Penzance , by giving the official premiere in New York . 
 Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte met by 24 April 1879 to make plans for a production of Pinafore in America . Carte travelled to New York in the summer of 1879 and made arrangements with theatre manager John T. Ford to present , at the Fifth Avenue Theatre , the first authorised American production of Pinafore . In November , he returned to America with Gilbert , Sullivan and a company of strong singers , including J. H. Ryley as Sir Joseph , Blanche Roosevelt as Josephine , Alice Barnett as Little Buttercup , Furneaux Cook as Dick Deadeye , Hugh Talbot as Ralph Rackstraw and Jessie Bond as Cousin Hebe . To these , he added some American singers , including Signor <unk> as Captain Corcoran . Alfred Cellier came to assist Sullivan , while his brother François remained in London to conduct Pinafore there . 
 Pinafore opened in New York on 1 December 1879 ( with Gilbert onstage in the chorus ) and ran for the rest of December . After a reasonably strong first week , audiences quickly fell off , since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of Pinafore . This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera , The Pirates of Penzance , which premièred with much success on 31 December . Shortly thereafter , Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest , playing Pinafore alongside Pirates .

 The unauthorised juvenile productions of Pinafore were so popular that Carte mounted his own children 's version , played at matinees at the Opera Comique beginning on 16 December 1879 . François Cellier , who had taken over from his brother as Carte 's music director in London , adapted the score for children 's voices . Between its two Christmas seasons in London , the children 's production went on a provincial tour from 2 August 1880 to 11 December 1880 . 
 Carte 's children 's production earned enthusiastic reviews from critic Clement Scott and the other London critics , as well as the audiences , including children . However , Captain Corcoran 's curse " Damme ! " was uncensored , shocking such prominent audience members as Lewis Carroll , who later wrote : " a bevy of sweet innocent @-@ looking girls sing , with bright and happy looks , the chorus ' He said , Damn me ! He said , Damn me ! ' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain I felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning ... How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write , or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music , such vile trash , it passes my skill to understand " .

 After the opera became successful in London , Richard D 'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces . At least one D 'Oyly Carte company , and sometimes as many as three , played Pinafore under Carte 's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888 , including its first London revival in 1887 . The opera was then given a rest , returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again for most of the time between 1903 and 1940 . Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime , and after his death , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962 . It continued to hew closely to Gilbert 's directions throughout that period , as recorded in Gilbert 's prompt books , and it also required its licensees to follow them closely . 
 Until 1908 , revivals of the opera were given in contemporary dress , with ladies ' costumes executed by couture houses such as Redfern . After that , designers such as Percy Anderson , George Sheringham and Peter Goffin created Victorian costume designs . The 1887 set was designed by Hawes Craven . In the winter of 1940 – 41 , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company 's scenery and costumes for Pinafore and three other operas were destroyed by German bombs during World War II . The opera was revived in London in the summer of 1947 . It was then included in the D 'Oyly Carte repertory in every season from then on , until the company 's closure in 1982 . The D 'Oyly Carte company performed Pinafore before Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family at Windsor Castle on 16 June 1977 , during the queen 's Silver Jubilee year , the first royal command performance of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera since 1891 . 
 The D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company did not allow any other professional company to present the Savoy operas in Britain until the copyrights expired at the end of 1961 , although it licensed many amateur and school societies to do so , beginning in the 19th century . After 1961 , other professional companies mounted productions of the opera in Britain . These have included Tyrone Guthrie 's 1960 production from Stratford , Ontario , seen on Broadway in 1960 and in London in 1962 and a New Sadler 's Wells Opera Company production first seen on 4 June 1984 at Sadler 's Wells Theatre , which was seen also in New York . Scottish Opera , Welsh National Opera and many of the other British opera companies have mounted productions , as did the reconstituted D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1990 and its closure in 2003 . In recent years , the Carl Rosa Opera Company has produced Pinafore several times , including in 2009 , and Opera della Luna and other British companies continue to mount the piece . 
 The extraordinary initial success of Pinafore in America was seen first @-@ hand by J. C. Williamson . He soon made arrangements with D 'Oyly Carte to present the opera 's first authorised production in Australia , opening on 15 November 1879 at the Theatre Royal , Sydney . Thereafter , his opera company played frequent seasons of the work ( and the subsequent Savoy operas ) until at least 1963 . In the U.S. , the piece never lost popularity . The Internet Broadway Database links to forty productions on Broadway alone . Among the professional repertory companies continuing to present Pinafore regularly in the U.S. are Opera a la Carte , based in California , Ohio Light Opera and the New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players , which tours the opera annually and often includes it in its New York seasons . Pinafore is still performed around the world by opera companies such as the Royal Theatre , Copenhagen ; Australian Opera ( and Essgee Entertainment and others in Australia ) ; in Kassel , Germany ; and even Samarkand , Uzbekistan . 
 The following table shows the history of the D 'Oyly Carte productions ( excluding tours ) in Gilbert 's lifetime : 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Initial critical reception = = = 
 The early reviews were mostly favourable . The Era wrote : 
 Seldom indeed have we been in the company of a more joyous audience . ... [ Gilbert and Sullivan ] have on previous occasions been productive of such legitimate amusement , such novel forms of drollery , such original wit , and unexpected whimsicality , that nothing was more natural than for the audience to anticipate an evening of thorough enjoyment . The expectation was fulfilled completely . Those who believed in the power of Mr Gilbert to tickle the fancy with quaint suggestions and unexpected forms of humour were more than satisfied , and those who appreciate Mr Arthur Sullivan 's inexhaustible gift of melody were equally gratified ; while that large class of playgoers who are pleased with brilliant dresses and charming stage effects declared themselves delighted . The result , therefore , was " a hit , a palpable hit " ... there were some slight drawbacks [ such ] as the severe cold that affected Mr. Rutland Barrington [ the captain ] , and almost prevented his singing . 
 The Era also lavishly praised Emma Howson as Josephine . The Entr 'acte and Limelight commented that the opera was reminiscent of Trial by Jury and Sorcerer but found it diverting and called the music " very charming . To hear so @-@ called grand opera imitated through the medium of the most trifling lyrics , is funny " . The paper praised Grossmith as Sir Joseph , noting with amusement that he was made up to look like portraits of Horatio Nelson , " and his good introductory song seems levelled at " W. H. Smith . It opined , further , that " He Is an Englishman " is " an excellent satire on the proposition that a man must necessarily be virtuous to be English " . It found the piece , as a whole , well presented and predicted that it would have a long run . 
 Similarly , The Illustrated London News concluded that the production was a success and that the plot , though slight , served as a good vehicle for Gilbert 's " caustic humour and quaint satire " . It found that there was " much to call forth hearty laughter in the occasional satirical hits . ... Dr. Sullivan 's music is as lively as the text to which it is set , with here and there a touch of sentimental expression ... The piece is well performed throughout . " The Daily News , The Globe , The Times ( which particularly praised Grossmith , Barrington and Everard ) and The Standard concurred , the last commenting favourably on the chorus acting , which , it said , " adds to the reality of the illusion " . The Times also noted that the piece was an early attempt at the establishment of a " national musical stage " with a libretto free from risqué French " improprieties " and without the " aid " of Italian and German musical models . 
 The Daily Telegraph and the Athenaeum , however , greeted the opera with only mixed praise . The Musical Times complained that the ongoing collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan was " detrimental to the art @-@ progress of either " because , although it was popular with audiences , " something higher is demanded for what is understood as ' comic opera ' " . The paper commented that Sullivan had " the true elements of an artist , which would be successfully developed were a carefully framed libretto presented to him for composition " . It concluded , however , by saying how much it enjoyed the opera : " Having thus conscientiously discharged our duties as art @-@ critics , let us at once proceed to say that H.M.S. Pinafore is an amusing piece of extravagance , and that the music floats it on merrily to the end " . The Times and several of the other papers agreed that , while the piece was entertaining , Sullivan was capable of higher art . Only The Figaro was actively hostile to the new piece . Upon the publication of the vocal score , a review by The Academy joined the chorus of regret that Sullivan had sunk so low as to compose music for Pinafore and hoped that he would turn to projects " more worthy of his great ability " . This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career . 
 The many unauthorised American productions of 1878 – 79 were of widely varying quality , and many of them were adaptations of the opera . One of the more " authentic " ones was the production by the Boston Ideal Opera Company , which was first formed to produce Pinafore . It engaged well @-@ regarded concert singers and opened on 14 April 1879 at the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ seat Boston Theatre . The critics agreed that the company fulfilled its goals of presenting an " ideal " production . The Boston Journal reported that the audience was " wrought up by the entertainment to a point of absolute approval " . The paper observed that it is a mistake to consider Pinafore a burlesque , " for while irresistibly comical it is not bouffe and requires to be handled with great care lest its delicate proportions be marred and its subtle quality of humor be lost " . The Journal described the opera as " classical " in method and wrote that its " most exquisite satire " lay in its " imitation of the absurdities " of grand opera . The company went on to become one of the most successful touring companies in America . The first children 's version in Boston became a sensation with both children and adult audiences , extending its run through the summer of 1879 . The Boston Herald wrote that " the large audience of children and their elders went fairly wild with delight ... shrieks of laughter were repeatedly heard " . 
 = = = Subsequent reception = = = 
 When Pinafore was first revived in London in 1887 , it was already treated as a classic . The Illustrated London News observed that the opera had not been updated with new dialogue , jokes and songs , but concluded that this was for the best , as the public would have missed the " time @-@ honoured jokes , such as ' Hardly Ever . ' The Savoy has once more got a brilliant success . " The Theatre concurred , stating that since the opera " has been heard in almost every part of this habitable globe and been enjoyed everywhere , there is not much occasion to descant " . It called the revival a " most brilliant " success and predicted another long run . 
 Reviewing the 1899 revival , The Athenaeum managed to praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment 's critique of Sullivan . On the one hand , " The Pinafore ... sounds fresher than ever . The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry , humorous piece , and music , unassuming in character ... it is delicately scored , and in many ways displays ability of a high order " . On the other hand , it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music , like his symphony , " he would have produced still higher results ; in like manner Pinafore set us wondering what the composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind , but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts " . 
 In 1911 , H. L. Mencken wrote : " No other comic opera ever written – no other stage play , indeed , of any sort – was ever so popular . ... Pinafore ... has been given , and with great success , wherever there are theaters – from Moscow to Buenos Aires , from Cape Town to Shanghai ; in Madrid , Ottawa and Melbourne ; even in Paris , Rome , Vienna and Berlin . " After the deaths of Gilbert and Sullivan , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company retained exclusive rights to perform their operas in Great Britain until 1962 , touring throughout Britain for most of the year and , beginning in 1919 , often performing in London for a season of about four months . The Times gave the company 's 1920 London production an enthusiastic review , saying that the audience was " enraptured " , and regretting that Pinafore would be played for only two weeks . It praised the cast , singling out Leo Sheffield as the Captain , Henry Lytton as Sir Joseph , Elsie Griffin as Josephine , James Hay as Ralph , Bertha Lewis as Little Buttercup and the " splendid " choral tone . It concluded that the opera made a " rollicking climax to the season " . Two years later , it gave an even more glowing report of that season 's performances , calling Derek Oldham an " ideal hero " as Ralph , noting that Sydney Granville " fairly brought down the house " with his song , that Darrell Fancourt 's Deadeye was " an admirably sustained piece of caricature " and that it was a " great pleasure " to hear the returning principals . A 1961 review of the company 's Pinafore is much the same . 
 In 1879 , J. C. Williamson acquired the exclusive performing rights to Pinafore in Australia and New Zealand . His first production earned public and critical acclaim . Williamson played Sir Joseph , and his wife , Maggie Moore played Josephine . Praising the production and all the performers , the Sydney Morning Herald noted that the production though " abounding in fun " was dignified and precise , that many numbers were encored and that laughter and applause from the " immense audience ... was liberally bestowed " . Williamson 's company continued to produce Pinafore in Australia , New Zealand and on tour into the 1960s with much success . As Williamson said , " If you need money , then put on G & S " . Meanwhile , Pinafore continued to garner praise outside Britain . The 1950s Danish version in Copenhagen , for example , was revived repeatedly , playing for well over 100 performances to " packed houses " . Translations into German , Yiddish and many other languages , and professional productions in places as remote as Samarkand in Uzbekistan have been successful . 
 In the U.S. , where Gilbert and Sullivan 's performance copyright was never in force , Pinafore continued to be produced continuously by both professional and amateur companies . The New York Times , in a 1914 review , called a large @-@ scale production at the 6 @,@ 000 @-@ seat New York Hippodrome a " royal entertainment " that " comes up smiling " . The opera had been turned into a " mammoth spectacle " at with a chorus of hundreds and the famous Hippodrome tank providing a realistic harbour . Buttercup made her entrance to the three @-@ masted Pinafore rowing into sight , and Dick Deadeye was later thrown overboard with a real splash . The Times praised the hearty singing but noted that some subtlety is lost when the dialogue needs " fairly to be shouted " . The production took some liberties , including interpolating music from other Sullivan works . The paper concluded , " the mild satire of Pinafore is entertaining because it is universal " . The same paper deemed Winthrop Ames ' popular Broadway productions of Pinafore in the 1920s and 1930s " spectacular " . Modern productions in America continue to be generally well received . The New York Times review of The New York Gilbert and Sullivan Players ' 2008 season at New York City Center commented , " Gilbert 's themes of class inequality , overbearing nationalism and incompetent authorities remain relevant , however absurdly treated . But the lasting appeal of Pinafore and its ilk is more a matter of his unmatched linguistic genius and Sullivan 's generous supply of addictive melodies . " 
 With the expiry of the copyrights , companies around the world have been free to produce Gilbert and Sullivan works and to adapt them as they please for almost 50 years . Productions of Pinafore , both amateur and professional , range from the traditional , in the D 'Oyly Carte vein , to the broadly adapted , such as that of the very successful Essgee Entertainment ( formed by Simon Gallaher ) in Australia and Opera della Luna in Britain . Since its original production , H.M.S. Pinafore has remained one of Gilbert and Sullivan 's most popular comic operas . Productions continue in large numbers around the world . In 2003 alone , The D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company rented 224 sets of orchestra parts , mostly for productions of Pinafore , Pirates and Mikado . This does not take into account other rental companies and the theatre companies that borrow scores or have their own , or that use only one or two pianos instead of an orchestra . Hundreds of productions of Pinafore are presented every year worldwide . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Theatre historian John Bush Jones wrote that Pinafore has " everything a musical <unk> could ask for . An engaging and even relatively suspenseful story is populated with varied and well @-@ drawn characters who speak and sing witty , literate , and often outrageously funny dialogue and lyrics [ and ] has a score that ... has plenty of tunes for the audience to go away humming " . Sir George Power , the tenor who created the role of Ralph Rackstraw , opined in later life that the secret of the success of the Savoy operas is the way in which " Sullivan entered into the spirit of Gilbert 's topsy @-@ turvy humour , and was pompous when Gilbert was sprightly , or , when Gilbert 's satire was keenest and most acid , consciously wallowed in sentiment . " Another commentator has suggested that the opera 's enduring success lies in its focus on " mirth and silliness " . Even the title of the piece is silly , applying the name of a little girl 's garment , a pinafore , to the fearsome symbol of a naval warship , which usually bore names like Victory , Goliath , Audacious and Minotaur . 
 = = = <unk> and comic themes = = = 
 Biographer Jane Stedman wrote that Pinafore is " satirically far more complex " than The Sorcerer . She commented that Gilbert uses several ideas and themes from his Bab Ballads , including the idea of gentlemanly behaviour of a captain towards his crew from " Captain Reece " ( 1868 ) and the exchange of ranks due to exchange at birth from " General John " ( 1867 ) . Dick Deadeye , based on a character in " Woman 's Gratitude " ( 1869 ) , represents another of Gilbert 's favorite ( and semi @-@ autobiographical ) satiric themes : the misshapen misanthrope whose forbidding " face and form " makes him unpopular although he represents the voice of reason and common sense . Gilbert also borrows from his 1870 opera , The Gentleman in Black which includes the device of baby @-@ switching . 
 Historian H. M. Walbrook wrote in 1921 that Pinafore " satirizes the type of nautical drama of which Douglas Jerrold 's Black @-@ Eyed Susan is a typical instance , and the ' God 's Englishman ' sort of patriotism which consists in shouting a platitude , striking an attitude , and doing little or nothing to help one 's country " . G. K. Chesterton agreed that the satire is pointed at the selfishness of " being proud of yourself for being a citizen " of one 's country , which requires no virtuous effort of will to resist the " temptations to belong to other nations " but is merely an excuse for pride . In 2005 , Australian opera director Stuart Maunder noted the juxtaposition of satire and nationalism in the opera , saying , " they all sing ' He is an Englishman ' , and you know damn well they 're sending it up , but the music is so military ... that you can 't help but be swept up in that whole jingoism that is the British Empire . " In addition , he argued that the song ties this theme into the main satire of class distinctions in the opera : " H.M.S. Pinafore is basically a satire on ... the British love of the class system . ... [ O ] f course [ Ralph ] can marry [ the Captain 's ] daughter , because he 's British , and therefore he 's great ' " . Jacobs notes that Gilbert is lampooning the tradition of nautical melodrama in which the sailor 's " patriotism guarantees his virtue " . 
 One of Gilbert 's favourite comic themes is the elevation of an unqualified person to a position of high responsibility . In The Happy Land ( 1873 ) , for example , Gilbert describes a world in which government offices are awarded to the person who has the least qualification to hold each position . In particular , the one who has never heard of a ship is appointed to the cabinet post of First Lord of the Admiralty . In Pinafore , Gilbert revisits this theme in the character of Sir Joseph , who rises to the same position by " never go [ ing ] to sea " . In later Gilbert and Sullivan operas , the characters Major @-@ General Stanley in Pirates , and Ko @-@ Ko in The Mikado , are similarly appointed to high office though lacking the necessary qualifications . Gilbert also pokes fun at party politics , implying that when Sir Joseph " always voted at [ his ] party 's call " , he sacrificed his personal integrity . The " commercial middle class " ( which was Gilbert 's main audience ) is treated as satirically as are social climbers and the great unwashed . In addition , the apparent age difference between Ralph and the Captain , even though they were babies nursed together , satirises the variable age of Thaddeus in The Bohemian Girl . The Times wrote , in reviewing the 1929 production , that Pinafore was quintessentially Gilbertian in that the absurdities of a " paternal " Captain and the " ethics ... of all romanticism " are accepted " unflinchingly " and taken to their logical conclusion : " It is the reference to actuality that is essential ; without it , the absurdity will not stand starkly out " . 
 A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks . In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera , The Sorcerer , a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes . In Pinafore , the captain 's daughter , Josephine , loves and is loved by a common sailor , but she dutifully tells him , " your proffered love I haughtily reject " . He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with " I am a British sailor , and I love you " . It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she . This is a parody of the Victorian " equality " drama , such as Lord Lytton 's The Lady of Lyons ( 1838 ) , where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech , ending with " I am a peasant ! " It then turns out that he has become her social superior . Furthermore , in Pinafore , Sir Joseph assures Josephine that " love levels all ranks " . In Tom Taylor 's The Serf , the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank , and she declares happily at the end that " love levels all " . In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama , Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are " any man 's equal " ( excepting his ) , and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor . Conversely , he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him " dance a hornpipe on the cabin table " . Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine " becomes acceptable only through the absurd second @-@ act revelation of Buttercup 's inadvertent switching of the infants " and concludes that Gilbert is a " conservative satirist [ who ] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ... [ and ] set out to show [ that ] love definitely does not level all ranks " . 
 There is a divide among Gilbert and Sullivan scholars as to whether Gilbert is , as Jones argues , a supporter of the status quo whose focus is merely to entertain or , on the other hand , predominantly to satirise and protest " against the follies of his age " . Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther posits that this disagreement arises from Gilbert 's " techniques of inversion – with irony and <unk> " , which lead to " the surface meaning of his writings " being " the opposite of their underlying meaning " . Crowther argues that Gilbert desires to " celebrate " society 's norms while , at the same time , satirising these conventions . In Pinafore , which established many patterns for the later Savoy operas , Gilbert found a way to express his own conflict that " also had tremendous appeal to the general public " . He creates " a highly intelligent parody of nautical melodrama ... [ though ] controlled by the conventions it mocks " . While nautical melodrama exalts the common sailor , in Pinafore Gilbert makes the proponent of equality , Sir Joseph , a pompous and misguided member of the ruling class who , hypocritically , cannot apply the idea of equality to himself . The hero , Ralph , is convinced of his equality by Sir Joseph 's foolish pronouncements and declares his love for his Captain 's daughter , throwing over the accepted " fabric of social order " . At this point , Crowther suggests , the logic of Gilbert 's satiric argument should result in Ralph 's arrest . But to satisfy convention , Gilbert creates an obvious absurdity : the captain and Ralph were switched as babies . By an " accident of birth " , Ralph is suddenly an appropriate husband for Josephine , and both the social order and the desire for a romantic happy ending are satisfied at once . Crowther concludes , " We have an opera which uses all the conventions of melodrama and ridicules them ; but in the end it is difficult to see which has won out , the conventions or the ridicule . " Thus , Pinafore found <unk> success by appealing to the intellectual <unk> seeking satire , the middle @-@ class theatre @-@ goer looking for a comfortable confirmation of the " existing social order " and the working @-@ class audience who saw a satisfying melodramatic victory for the common man . 
 = = = Songs and musical analysis = = = 
 According to musicologist Arthur Jacobs , Gilbert 's plot " admirably sparked off Sullivan 's genius " . Sullivan embraces the nautical setting ; in " We Sail the Ocean Blue " , for example , he " presents his twist on a traditional sea shanty " . In the Captain 's opening song , " I am the Captain of the Pinafore " , he admits that his <unk> " never ... well , hardly ever " gives way to swearing at his men , and although he has experience at sea , he " hardly ever " suffers from seasickness . Sullivan " unerringly found the right musical setting for the key phrase ' What never ? ' ... cunningly sharpened ... through the chromatic touch on the bassoon . " Audrey Williamson argued that the music of Pinafore is quintessentially English and free of European influences throughout most of the score , from the " glee " for Ralph , the Boatswain and the Carpenter , to " For He Is an Englishman " . 
 The best @-@ known songs from the opera include " I 'm called Little Buttercup " , a waltz tune introducing the character , which Sullivan repeats in the entr 'acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody on the mind of the audience ; and " A British tar " ( a glee for three men describing the ideal sailor ) , composed by Sir Joseph " to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service , and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man 's equal , excepting mine " . Sullivan 's voicing advances the satiric lyric , which mocks the " equality " plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph . Another popular number is Sir Joseph 's song " When I was a Lad " , recounting the meteoric rise of his career , which bears similarities to that of W. H. Smith , the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen to the position of First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877 . 
 In Pinafore , Sullivan exploits minor keys for comic effect , for instance in " Kind Captain , I 've important information " . Further , he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in " Sorry her lot " . Biographer Gervase Hughes was impressed with the introduction to the opening chorus which includes " a rousing nautical tune ... in a key of no nonsense , C major ... a modulation to the <unk> minor , where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of " Sorry her lot " in 2 / 4 [ time ] . After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins ( still in 2 / 4 ) introduce us to Little Buttercup ... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz . " He continues , " the bassoon and basses ... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore ... in the improbable key of A flat minor . ... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor , but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed . So in a flash they all go back to C major on a good old 6 / 4 " . 
 According to Jacobs , " Ralph , Captain Corcoran , Sir Joseph and Josephine all live in their interactive music ( particularly ' Never mind the why and wherefore ' ) , and almost as much musical resource is lavished on two characters parodied from opera or melodrama , Little Buttercup with ' gypsy blood in her veins ' and the heavy @-@ treading Dick Deadeye . " Jacobs also opined that the leading tone that begins " Never mind the why and wherefore " " serves to emphasize the phrase like a Johann Strauss @-@ ian grace @-@ note " . Sullivan scholar David Russell Hulme noted Sullivan 's parody of operatic styles , " particularly the Handelian recitatives and the elopement scene ( evocative of so many nocturnal operatic conspiracies ) , but best of all is the travesty of the patriotic tune in ' For he is an Englishman ! ' " Buttercup 's Act II song , in which she reveals the dark secret of the baby @-@ switching is preceded by a quote from Franz Schubert 's " The Erl @-@ King " and also parodies the opera Il Trovatore . Jacobs notes that Sullivan also adds his own humorous touches to the music by setting commonplace expressions in " <unk> recitative " . But on the serious side , he enhances the moments of true emotional climax , as in Josephine 's Act II aria , and added musical interest to concerted numbers by " subtly shifting the rhythms and bar groupings . " 
 = = Revisions and cut material = = 
 = = = Ballad for Captain Corcoran , " Reflect , my child " = = = 
 During rehearsals for the original production , Gilbert added a ballad for Captain Corcoran in which he urged his daughter to forget the common sailor with whom she is in love , because " at every step , he would commit solecisms that society would never pardon . " The ballad was meant to be sung between No. 5 and No. 6 of the current score , but it was cut before opening night . The words survive in the libretto that was deposited with the Lord Chamberlain for licensing . Before 1999 , all that was known to survive of Sullivan 's setting was a copy of the leader violin part . 
 In April 1999 , Sullivan scholars Bruce I. Miller and Helga J. Perry announced that they had discovered a nearly complete orchestration – lacking only the second violin part – in a private collection of early band parts . These materials , with a conjectural reconstruction of the partially lost vocal lines and second violin part , were later published and professionally recorded . This piece has now been performed a number of times by amateur and professional companies , although it has not become a standard addition to the traditional scores or recordings . 
 = = = Dialogue for Cousin Hebe = = = 
 In the licensing copy of the libretto , Sir Joseph 's cousin Hebe had lines of dialogue in several scenes in Act II . In the scene that follows No. 14 ( " Things are seldom what they seem " ) , she accompanied Sir Joseph onstage and echoed the First Lord 's dissatisfaction with Josephine . After several interruptions , Sir Joseph urged her to be quiet , eliciting the response " Crushed again ! " Gilbert would later re @-@ use this passage for Lady Jane in Patience . Hebe was also assigned several lines of dialogue after No. 18 ( " Carefully on tiptoe stealing " ) and again after No. 19 ( " Farewell , my own " ) . 
 Late in rehearsals for the original production , Jessie Bond assumed the role of Hebe , replacing Mrs Howard Paul . Bond , who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer and had little experience as an actress , did not feel capable of performing dialogue , and these passages were revised to cut Hebe 's dialogue . Hebe 's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances . 
 = = = Recitative preceding the Act II finale = = = 
 The dialogue preceding the Act II finale , starting with " Here , take her sir , and mind you treat her kindly " , was originally recitative . The music for this passage was printed in the first edition of the vocal score as No. <unk> . Shortly after opening night , the recitative was dropped , and the lines thereafter were performed as spoken dialogue . In modern productions , the recitative is occasionally restored in place of the dialogue . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 There have been numerous recordings of Pinafore since 1907 . Ian Bradley counted seventeen recordings of the opera available on CD in 2005 . 
 The 1930 recording is notable for preserving the performances of the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company stars of the era . The 1960 D 'Oyly Carte recording , which contains all the dialogue , has been repeatedly praised by reviewers . The 1994 Mackerras recording , featuring grand opera singers in the principal roles , is musically well @-@ regarded . The 2000 D 'Oyly Carte recording also contains complete dialogue and the first recording of the " lost " ballad for Captain Corcoran , " Reflect , my child " , as a bonus track . A 1957 Danish @-@ language recording of the opera is one of the few foreign @-@ language professional recordings of Gilbert and Sullivan . 
 In 1939 , Pinafore was chosen by NBC as one of the earliest operas ever broadcast on American television , but no recording appears to have been saved . The 1973 D 'Oyly Carte video recording , directed by Michael Heyland , demonstrates the company 's staging of the period , but some reviewers find it dull . It is , however , one of only three video or film recordings of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera by the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company . The 1982 video of Pinafore " is widely considered one of the worst " in the Brent Walker Productions series of Gilbert and Sullivan television productions . More recent professional productions have been recorded on video by the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival .

 H.M.S. Pinafore has been adapted many times . W. S. Gilbert wrote a 1909 children 's book called The Pinafore Picture Book , illustrated by Alice Woodward , which retells the story of Pinafore , in some cases giving considerable backstory that is not found in the libretto . Many other children 's books have since been written retelling the story of Pinafore or adapting characters or events from Pinafore . 
 Many musical theatre adaptations have been produced since the original opera . Notable examples include a 1945 Broadway musical adapted by George S. Kaufman , called Hollywood Pinafore , using Sullivan 's music . This was revived several times , including in London in 1998 . Another 1945 Broadway musical adaptation , Memphis Bound ! , was written by Don Walker and starred Bill Robinson and an all @-@ black cast . In 1940 , the American Negro Light Opera Association produced the first of several productions set in the Caribbean Sea , Tropical Pinafore . An early Yiddish adaptation of Pinafore , called Der <unk> ( Yiddish for " apron " ) was written by Miriam <unk> in 1952 for a Brooklyn , New York Hadassah group , and they recorded 12 of the songs . In the 1970s , Al Grand was inspired by this recording and urged the Gilbert and Sullivan Long Island Light Opera Company to perform these songs . He later translated the missing songs and dialogue , with Bob <unk> , and the show has been toured widely under the name Der Yiddisher Pinafore . The group have continued to produce this adaptation for over two decades , in which " He is an Englishman " becomes " Er Iz a <unk> <unk> " ( " He is a good Jew " ) . 
 Essgee Entertainment produced an adapted version of Pinafore in 1997 in Australia and New Zealand that has been much revived . Another musical adaptation is Pinafore ! ( A Saucy , Sexy , Ship @-@ Shape New Musical ) , adapted by Mark Savage . It was first performed at the Celebration Theater in Los Angeles , California on 7 September 2001 , directed by Savage , where it ran with great success for nine months . It then played in Chicago and New York in 2003 . In this adaptation , only one character is female , and all but one of the male characters are gay . An original cast recording was issued in 2002 by <unk> Records . Pinafore Swing is a musical with music arranged by Sarah Travis . It premiered at the Watermill Theatre in England in 2004 in a production directed by John Doyle . The adaptation , set in 1944 , changes the characters into members of a band entertaining the sailors on a World War II troop ship in the Atlantic . The reduced @-@ size acting cast also serve as the orchestra for the singing roles , and the music is infused with swing rhythms . Numerous productions in recent decades have been set to parody Star Trek or Star Wars .

 Among its other influences on popular culture , Pinafore had perhaps its most profound influence on the development of musical theatre . According to theatre historian John Kenrick , Pinafore " became an international sensation , reshaping the commercial theater in both England and the United States . " Music writer Andrew Lamb notes , " The success of H.M.S. Pinafore in 1879 established British comic opera alongside French opéra bouffe throughout the English @-@ speaking world " . Historian John Bush Jones opines that Pinafore and the other Savoy operas demonstrate that musical theatre " can address contemporary social and political issues without sacrificing entertainment value " and that Pinafore created the model for a new kind of musical theatre , the " integrated " musical , where " book , lyrics , and music combined to form an integral whole " . He adds that its " unprecedented ... popularity fostered an American audience for musical theatre , while the show itself became a model for form , content , and even intention of ... musicals ever since , especially socially relevant musicals . " Its popularity also led to the musical theatre adaptations of Pinafore described above , musicals in which the story line involves a production of Pinafore and other musicals that parody the opera or that use or adapt its music . The first such parody was a short @-@ lived burlesque presented at the Opera Comique in 1882 , called The Wreck of the Pinafore by H. Lingard and Luscombe <unk> ; the opera 's characters are shipwrecked on a desert island . It was described by The Era as " chiefly remarkable for its impudence " . 
 Likewise , the opera 's popularity has led to the widespread parody and pastiche of its songs in politics , literature and films , on television and in a variety of other media . Many comedians have used Pinafore songs for comic and satiric effect . For example , in his comedy album My Son , the Celebrity , Allan Sherman parodies " When I Was a Lad " from the point of view of a young man who goes to an Ivy League school and then rises to prominence in business . At the end of the song , he " thanks old Yale " , " thanks the Lord " and thanks his father , " who is chairman of the board " . Literary references to Pinafore songs include Harris 's attempt to sing " When I Was a Lad " in Jerome K. Jerome 's Three Men in a Boat . Another is found in the story " Runaround " from I , Robot by Isaac Asimov , where a robot sings part of " I 'm Called Little Buttercup " . Pinafore and its songs have been performed by rock musicians such as Todd Rundgren , Taj Mahal and Michele Gray Rundgren , who performed " Never Mind the Why and Wherefore " on Night Music ( Sunday Night ) in 1989 . 
 Political references include a 1996 satiric pastiche of " When I Was a Lad " aimed at Tony Blair by Virginia Bottomley , heritage secretary under John Major . Sporting references include a racehorse named " H.M.S. Pinafore " . Pinafore songs and images have been used extensively in advertising . According to Jones , " Pinafore launched the first media blitz in the United States " beginning in 1879 , and recent ads include a television campaign for Terry 's Chocolate Orange featuring a pastiche of " When I Was a Lad " . Pinafore @-@ themed merchandise includes trading cards that were created in the 1880s . 
 Film references In recent decades , songs from Pinafore have been used frequently to give period flavor to films . Prominent examples include the 1981 historical film Chariots of Fire , in which the protagonist , Harold Abrahams , and others from Cambridge University , sing " He Is an Englishman " . This song also features at the end of the 1983 BBC drama An Englishman Abroad . In the 2003 movie Peter Pan , the Darling family sings " When I Was a Lad " . In Wyatt Earp ( 1994 ) , the famed lawman meets his future wife when he sees her playing in an early production of Pinafore . A 1953 biopic , The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan , uses music from Pinafore . 
 Characters also sing songs from Pinafore in such popular films as Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) and Star Trek : Insurrection ( 1998 ) , where Captain Picard and Lt. Commander Worf sing part of " A British Tar " to distract a malfunctioning Lt. Commander Data . Likewise , in The Good Shepherd ( 2006 ) , which depicts an all @-@ male version of Pinafore at Yale University , the Matt Damon character plays Little Buttercup , singing her song in falsetto . Judy Garland sings " I Am the Monarch of the Sea " in the 1963 film , I Could Go On Singing . The soundtrack of the 1992 thriller The Hand that Rocks the Cradle prominently features songs and music from Pinafore , and the father and daughter characters sing " I Am the Captain of the Pinafore " together . An example of a film based on ideas from Pinafore is the 1976 animated film by Ronald Searle called Dick Deadeye , or Duty Done is based on the character and songs from Pinafore . In the 1988 drama Permanent Record , a high school class performs Pinafore . 
 Television references Television series that include substantial Pinafore references include The West Wing , for example in the 2000 episode " And It 's Surely to Their Credit " , where " He Is an Englishman " is used throughout and quoted ( or paraphrased ) in the episode 's title . Among other notable examples of the use of songs from Pinafore on television are several popular animated shows . In the " Cape Feare " episode of The Simpsons , Bart stalls his would @-@ be killer Sideshow Bob with a " final request " that Bob sing him the entire score of Pinafore . Similarly , the 1993 " HMS Yakko " episode of Animaniacs consists of pastiches of songs from H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance . In a Family Guy episode , " The Thin White Line " ( 2001 ) , Stewie sings a pastiche of " My Gallant Crew " . Stewie also sings " I Am the Monarch of the Sea " ( including the ladies ' part , in falsetto ) in " Stewie Griffin : The Untold Story " . A 1986 Mr. Belvedere episode , " The Play " , concerns a production of H.M.S. Pinafore , and several of the songs are performed . In the 2009 episode " Broken " of House , Dr. House must take a urine test and starts singing " He is an Englishman " to cover the sound . In 1955 , NBC broadcast a variety special including a 20 @-@ minute compressed jazz version , " H.M.S. Pinafore in Jazz " , produced and directed by Max Liebman , starring Perry Como , Buddy Hackett , Kitty <unk> , Bill Hayes , Pat Carroll and Herb Shriner .

 Sharma was recommended for the part of AJ by Nitin Ganatra ( Masood ) after the character was described to him , because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together . The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop , Channel 4 's Meet the <unk> and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers , so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role and he was the first person he thought of . Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be . Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ . When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma 's audition , the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising , but , as Ganatra explained , they " know each other 's style [ and ] have all these shortcuts . It 's like having a real brother . " Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview . Sharma added in March 2013 : " I 've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ , and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea , to which I replied , ' Yes please , I 've waited 20 years for that cup of tea ' , but it 's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I 've already bonded with — it 's like having a pre @-@ built family to bounce off . " He had also previously worked with his co @-@ stars Nina Wadia ( Zainab ) and Marc Elliott ( Syed Masood ) , so felt it was " cool " and " familiar " to work with them . Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood 's brother after watching EastEnders for many years . The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house , and he found it " really surreal " . 
 The character and Sharma 's casting were announced on 1 June 2012 . It was reported that AJ arrives in Albert Square hoping to reconnect with Masood and build bridges with his family , then AJ gets himself and Masood in trouble , so Masood wonders if AJ is running away from something . Sharma said " I think it 's a really fun , colourful and lively part and I can 't wait to see where it goes ! " Speaking of AJ 's arrival , Ganatra said that he felt " very confident , happy and excited about having a new character to play against " , especially a new member of the family , " because the Masoods are always about family . " AJ first appears in the episode originally broadcast in the UK on 9 July 2012 , which is EastEnders ' <unk> episode .

 AJ is a mechanic , who is described as a chancer who " never misses an opportunity for excitement . " He is characterised as a free @-@ spirited , fun @-@ loving and carefree rebel , who does not always realise how his spontaneity affects other people . He is described as cheeky , irresponsible , a bad influence , a joker , a charmer and a talker . It is said that he does not plan or do what people expect of him , is fun to be around and could be running away from life . A writer for the BBC said that he lives " like there 's no tomorrow " , and makes decisions based on the results of a coin flip . The coin , described as " lucky " , is inspired by the Bollywood film Sholay , in which two friends make decisions based on the flip of a coin , though one friend does not know that both sides of the coin are the same . Ganatra stated in an interview on This Morning that he did not think that the two sides of AJ 's coin were the same . Sharma described AJ as " the clown who loves to play " and " a little bit of a hippy " , saying " he 's got a real wheeler @-@ dealer , Del Boy aspect to his character . " He has twice compared AJ to a puppy dog , because he is nice but annoying , and he is fun but a nuisance . Sharma , who was brought up in Newport , said that " the charm , humour and personality " of Welsh people he knew helped him to create the character of AJ . 
 Laura Morgan from All About Soap called AJ " mischievous " , and the magazine also called him " bothersome " and " crazy " . Nathan Bevan from Western Mail has called him " gregarious " , an " aggro @-@ magnet " , a " trouble @-@ magnet " , " wise @-@ cracking " and " wheeler @-@ dealing " . He has also been called " flighty " , a " tearaway " , " naughty " and " good @-@ for @-@ nothing " . 
 = = = Role within the Masood family = = = 
 AJ is a member of the Pakistani Masood family , headed by Masood Ahmed , played by Ganatra . Masood is married to Wadia 's character , Zainab Masood ( though at the time of AJ 's arrival they are divorced and planning to remarry ) , and they live with their children Syed Masood ( Elliott ) , Tamwar Masood ( Himesh Patel ) and Kamil Masood ( Arian <unk> ) . Masood and AJ also have an older brother , Inzamam Ahmed ( Paul Bhattacharjee ) . AJ is younger than Masood . AJ has been called " the black sheep " of the family and " a delinquent uncle " . 
 AJ and Masood had lost touch for three years prior to AJ 's arrival , and had fallen out because of an argument between Zainab and AJ 's wife Aliyah , said to be that Aliyah once made an obscene comment to her . AJ was described as " the polar opposite to his control freak sister @-@ in @-@ law [ Zainab ] " , and it was said that " sparks [ would ] fly in the Masood household as the battle lines are drawn [ between them ] . " Zainab thinks AJ is reckless and she has little time for him . Ganatra said that there is tension between AJ and Zainab , and although Zainab does not necessarily dislike AJ , she does not like that AJ gets Masood into trouble , and Zainab 's hatred for Aliyah does not help . Inside Soap called Zainab AJ 's arch rival and Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail said AJ 's arrival was " Something else not to put a smile on Zainab 's face " though made it an " exciting week " for Masood . 
 AJ brings out a different side to Masood , which Ganatra said could " upset the status quo " . He said that AJ was brought in " to stir up Masood 's life , and that has exciting prospects " , and they would " get up to all sorts of shenanigans . " Presenter Kate Thornton , when interviewing Ganatra , said AJ was a " playmate " for Masood , while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood . Inside Soap 's Kate White called AJ " a world away from family man Masood " , while <unk> said AJ is " not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [ Masood 's ] face and a new spring in his step . " Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ 's influence on Masood is " infectious " . AJ 's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab , as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her . Ganatra stated : " So by opening this door , you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager . Masood did have a naughty streak — he was in a band with his brother , and they got up to mischief . Masood [ ... ] has been put on the straight and narrow [ since ] . But prior to that , he was a teenager like any other — getting into trouble , and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ ! " Ganatra said that , as British Asians , Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls . Now , Masood sees AJ as somebody with " no responsibilities , no children and no stress of having to provide for a family " and as AJ suffers <unk> problems , is feeling lonely and has no children , Ganatra said " they want each other 's lives , which is quite a nice dynamic to play . " He added that " AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood 's , while Masood would love to pack his bags , get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger 's bed . I 'm interested to see him bring out Masood 's naughty streak — and where that could take them ... " AJ is accepting of Syed 's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke ( John Partridge ) . 
 Sharma said that AJ would be an " unlikely saviour " for the Masood family when they find themselves in financial trouble . Although he called AJ the " family rebel " , he said that the character is " doing what he can to help out with the money problems [ because ] when the going gets tough , AJ will step in to help his loved ones — and while he will probably never take the conventional route , he 'll always get something sorted out in the end . " He gets a job , and then helps to lift the family 's spirits by organising a fireworks display , on which Sharma said , " AJ is just trying to help out his family in his own , dysfunctional way . " In November 2012 , Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people 's lives , so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her . Sharma explained : " He is ready to test her promise to the limits ! AJ knows exactly how to push all of Zainab 's buttons , and now he 's going to take full advantage of the fact that she won 't let herself be the control freak she normally likes to be ! " Jane Simon from the Daily Mirror said AJ is " thoroughly enjoying " testing Zainab 's new policy . 
 = = = Relationship with other characters = = = 
 In AJ 's first episode , he makes an enemy of Derek Branning when he and Masood crash a shopping trolley into his car . An insider said that AJ should be worried , explaining : " AJ is a bit of a talker and tries to <unk> his way out of the situation but that just makes things even worse . Derek is quick to rough him up a little to make him realise he 's not to be messed with . The confrontation really shocks AJ but he 's not going to be pushed around by some bullying bloke he 's just met . " The Daily Star said that " Derek is the one person AJ really shouldn 't make into an enemy " , while interviewer Phillip Schofield stated : " If you knock the wing mirror off Derek 's Jag you are in for trouble . " 
 On 11 September 2012 , it was reported that AJ would seduce Roxy Mitchell and they would spend the night together in Masood and Zainab 's house after an evening of drinking . At the time , it was unknown if it would be a one @-@ off or if a longer relationship would start . An insider from EastEnders told Inside Soap that Roxy and AJ are both looking for fun and they " hit it off " because she loves " a man who can make her laugh and AJ definitely ticks that box . " They added that they have " great chemistry " but said that as Roxy is sidetracked by another man , " AJ will have to fight for her affections " if he wants her . An insider also told the Daily Star that the two " can 't keep their hands off each other " and " Roxy is more than up for it . " They added that " Zainab would go mental if she knew what they were up to under her roof and it remains to be seen whether they can get away with it . Roxy is the last person who Zainab would want AJ to hook up with . [ ... ] Even Masood could not defend his brother this time as he had been pretty disrespectful . " Digital Spy also noted chemistry between AJ and Roxy , saying they " clearly enjoy each other 's company " . Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror said the relationship between Roxy and AJ is " played for laughs " , contrasting with Roxy 's relationship with Michael Moon ( Steve John Shepherd ) . 
 Inside Soap expected AJ to be paired up with Denise Fox ( Diane Parish ) , but actor Ricky Norwood , who plays Fatboy , spoke about his character 's rivalry with AJ over her in an interview with the magazine . He said , " There 's a little bit of rivalry building up between [ them ] . Fatboy can tell that AJ likes Denise . But at [ a party ] , AJ puts a [ song ] on for Denise , and it 's just totally wrong . [ ... ] Fatboy takes over and [ ... ] it gets a big response . " Inside Soap said that AJ does not know what makes Denise tick , while Sharma said " Denise isn 't a big fan of AJ at the moment ! " In 2013 , Inside Soap said they expected to see AJ paired with Bianca Jackson ( Patsy Palmer ) , saying , " He 's been trying his luck for some time , and surely there 's only so long Bianca can fend off AJ . If nothing else , he 'd be lots of fun around her kids , as AJ isn 't the most mature fella in Albert Square . " Vicky Prior from the Metro also hoped to see AJ find romance with Bianca .

 On 24 September 2013 , it was announced that AJ , along with three other characters — Kirsty Branning ( Kierston Wareing ) , Poppy Meadow ( Rachel Bright ) and Carl White ( Daniel Coonan ) — had been axed from the series by the new executive producer Dominic Treadwell @-@ Collins . It was reported that Treadwell @-@ Collins was " determined to get EastEnders back to its best " and a spokesperson confirmed the departures . Reports said that it was hoped the move would increase ratings , and a show source added that " [ Treadwell @-@ Collins ] didn 't feel the characters who are leaving fit with the direction he is taking the show so he quickly decided to write them out . He has only been in a month but he is already making big changes . He knows what he wants for EastEnders and is putting plans in place quickly . " Sharma filmed his final scenes before Christmas 2013 and the character 's final appearance was on 10 January 2014 .

 Upon AJ 's arrival , Ally Ross of The Sun said : " New arrivals have included [ ... ] Masood 's supposedly funny and long @-@ lost brother AJ , who made the fatal mistake of arriving with the line : ' Do I look like a comedian ? ' No . You look like David Baddiel . Now kindly piss off " . Kay Ribeiro from Heat said , " We like new boy AJ . Not only is he a laugh [ ... ] but he 's providing light relief during [ Masood ] and [ Zainab ] ' s split , which is making us sad . " Laura Morgan from All About Soap hoped that AJ would become a permanent character after his initial appearances . In October 2012 , Allison Jones from Inside Soap said , " AJ has proved the perfect tonic for a family almost constantly dogged with crisis [ and ] his tenacious ability to wind up Zainab never fails to entertain ! AJ may have only been in Walford for a few months , but it already feels as if we 've known him for ages . " She also called Sharma and Ganatra , " a killer on @-@ screen pairing " . Nathan Bevan from Welsh newspaper Western Mail praised Sharma 's role in EastEnders , naming him as one of " 50 things you should look forward to in Wales " in 2013 , saying , " Anyone who injects a little sunshine into the ' Chekhov with a covered market ' drudgery of EastEnders should be automatically given an Outstanding Contribution to Broadcasting Award in our book . So well done Newport 's very own Phaldut Sharma who , since arriving in Walford as Masood Ahmed 's gregarious but aggro @-@ magnet brother AJ , has helped break up the unrelenting , bicker @-@ filled misery of Albert Square . " Bevan later said that Sharma has " shaken up the residents of Walford as the wise @-@ cracking , wheeler @-@ dealing AJ Ahmed " , adding , " He 's the gregarious , trouble @-@ magnet who 's brought some much needed sunshine to the sombre , squabble @-@ filled <unk> of Albert Square . " Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton.com said AJ was a " find " but thought the writers might not be sure what to do with the character . Vicky Prior from the Metro said AJ " has lit up the square with his gently laddish behaviour . " 
 After AJ and Derek fight in August 2012 , Emma Roberts from MSN Entertainment said it was one of the best fights of 2012 , scoring it 5 out of 5 and saying , " This is how soap fights should always be done ! It was like Walford turned into the wild west . " A writer from MSN TV said that AJ 's drunken kiss with Roxy was one of EastEnders ' 20 worst storylines of 2012 , asked if it was serious and said that it was only made a " little bit believable " because they were both drunk . In the episode broadcast on 2 November 2012 , AJ helps his family stand up to Danny Pennant ( Gary Lucy ) . Claire Crick from All About Soap called AJ the " highlight " of the episode , saying , " we never thought we 'd say this , but he 's really quite funny ! We loved how he rallied the family together to stand up to Danny " . AJ , who undertakes self @-@ defence classes in a storyline , was used as an example by a spokesperson for the show when EastEnders and other British soap operas were criticised in a study of 830 scenes over two weeks , made by Liverpool John Moores University Business School , who said that exercise was only shown or mentioned on four occasions . 
 Sharma has received two award nominations for his role of AJ : a British Soap Award for Sexiest Male , and an Inside Soap Award for Funniest Male , both in 2013 . He was not shortlisted for either award . After his departure was announced , James Lowe from All About Soap opined that he , and the other three characters cut from the show at the same time , were " the right people to go " . Yahoo ! TV UK said they were " a little bit disappointed " about AJ 's departure , because he " has been good value . "

 Back to the Egg is the seventh and final studio album by the British @-@ American band Wings , released in 1979 on Columbia Records in America , and on Parlophone in the UK . Co @-@ produced by Chris Thomas , the album reflects band leader Paul McCartney 's embracing of contemporary musical trends such as new wave and punk , and marked the arrival of new Wings members Laurence Juber and Steve Holley . Back to the Egg adopts a loose conceptual theme around the idea of a working band , and its creation coincided with a period of considerable activity for the group , which included making a return to touring and work on several television and film projects . 
 Recording for the album began in June 1978 and lasted for almost a year . The sessions took place at Spirit of Ranachan Studios in Scotland , Lympne Castle in Kent , London 's Abbey Road Studios , and Replica Studio – the last of which McCartney built as an exact replica of Abbey Road 's Studio Two when the latter became unavailable . Wings returned to Abbey Road in March 1979 to complete the album , before filming a series of promotional videos in Lympne and elsewhere , for what became the Back to the Egg TV special . 
 Back to the Egg received unfavourable reviews from the majority of critics , with Rolling Stone magazine deriding it as " the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory " . Although the album charted in the top ten around the world and was certified platinum in the United States , it was viewed as a commercial failure relative to previous Wings releases , particularly in light of the generous financial terms under which McCartney had signed with CBS @-@ owned Columbia Records . Of its singles – " Old Siam , Sir " , " Getting Closer " and " Arrow Through Me " – only " Getting Closer " made the top twenty in Britain or America . The song " Rockestra Theme " , recorded with a cast of guest musicians from bands such as the Who , Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd , won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1980 . 
 Wings toured the UK in support of the album , but the planned world tour ended in January 1980 , when McCartney was arrested in Japan for possession of drugs . The group disbanded early the following year . Back to the Egg was reissued in 1993 , with bonus tracks , and in 2007 for iTunes , with the addition of Wings ' 1979 non @-@ album single " Goodnight Tonight " , in its extended form .

 Following the release of the album London Town ( 1978 ) , Wings band leader Paul McCartney hired two session musicians , drummer Steve Holly and lead guitarist Laurence Juber , to replace former members Joe English and Jimmy McCulloch . With the new line @-@ up – Wings ' sixth since its formation in 1971 – McCartney intended to record a raw rock and roll album and return to touring , for the band 's first concerts since their acclaimed Wings Over the World tour of 1975 – 76 . In addition , McCartney hoped to realise his longstanding plan of making a film adaptation of the Rupert the Bear cartoon series , for which he owned the commercial rights , and commissioned English playwright Willy Russell to write a feature film starring Wings . 
 Both Holly and Juber were recruited by Wings co @-@ founder and guitarist Denny Laine , who had appeared as a guest on The David Essex Show in 1977 when Juber was working as a guitarist in the house band . Holly , a neighbour of Laine 's , joined Wings in time to appear in the promotional video for London Town 's lead single , " With a Little Luck " , having turned down a position with Elton John 's band . According to Wings biographer Garry McGee , Juber and Holly each received a weekly sum equating to less than one @-@ fifth of that paid to McCartney , his wife Linda ( the band 's keyboard player ) and Laine . 
 For the new album , Back to the Egg , McCartney decided to collaborate in the studio with producer Chris Thomas , with whom he had begun working on the audio for two films documenting Wings ' last world tour : Wings Over the World , a television documentary , and the cinema release Rockshow ( 1980 ) . Thomas 's involvement would mark the first time that Wings had recorded with an outside producer since their 1973 single " Live and Let Die " , which George Martin had produced . Due to his recent work with the Pretenders and the Sex Pistols , Thomas brought a punk rock and new wave influence to Wings ' sound , matching McCartney 's desire to reflect contemporary musical trends . 
 = = Songs = = 
 Although London Town had featured a significant level of contribution from Laine as a songwriter , all bar one of the songs on Back to the Egg are credited to McCartney alone . The album was originally planned around a loose conceptual theme , about which authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write in their book Eight Arms to Hold You : " The idea was to have a theme of a working band , getting back on the road ... or ' back to the egg ' ( or protective shell ) of touring . " In the original LP format , the two album sides were labelled with the egg @-@ related titles " Sunny Side Up " and " Over Easy " . 
 = = = " Sunny Side Up " = = = 
 The album 's opening song is " Reception " , an instrumental , in which McCartney attempted to capture the effect of turning a radio dial and finding " about four stations at once " . The track features a guitar @-@ controlled synthesizer ( played by Juber ) over a funk @-@ inspired bassline , and spoken voices , including a reading of part of " The Poodle and the Pug " , from Vivian Ellis 's opera Big Ben ( 1946 ) . The next three songs – " Getting Closer " , " We 're Open Tonight " and " Spin It On " – adhere to the proposed album @-@ wide concept . Writing in Melody Maker in June 1979 , Mark Williams interpreted " Reception " as representing a radio being tuned in a car , whereby " the occupant is on his way to a gig , hence ' Getting Closer ' [ to the venue ] and , upon arrival , ' We 're Open Tonight ' " . The notion of live performance is then reflected in the sequencing of what Madinger and Easter term " heavier rock tracks such as ' Spin It On ' " . 
 McCartney had recorded a piano demo for " Getting Closer " in 1974 , at which point the song had a slower tempo . Author and Mojo contributor Tom Doyle describes Wings ' version as " power @-@ popping " and reminiscent of the English band Squeeze . The mellow " We 're Open Tonight " was written at the McCartneys ' farm in Campbeltown , Scotland , and was the album 's title track until Linda suggested Back to the Egg . 
 Another song composed in Scotland , the fast @-@ tempo " Spin It On " was an obvious acknowledgment of punk and new wave ; author Vincent Benitez terms it " McCartney @-@ esque whimsy on punk steroids " . Laine 's composition " Again and Again and Again " similarly has " echoes of the Clash " , according to McCartney biographer Howard Sounes . This song was originally two separate pieces , which Laine combined on McCartney 's recommendation . 
 Although credited to McCartney alone , " Old Siam , Sir " marked " the most collective band involvement " as regards songwriting , Madinger and Easter suggest . Similar in style to " Spin It On " , the song features a keyboard riff written by Linda and a Holly @-@ composed middle eight ; in addition , Laine helped McCartney complete the composition , an early version of which the previous incarnation of Wings had demoed in July 1976 . " Arrow Through Me " , a track more in keeping with McCartney 's melodic pop style , is a song written from the perspective of a rejected lover . With a musical arrangement that eschews guitar backing for synthesizer , Fender Rhodes piano and horns , Benitez views it as " reminiscent of the techno @-@ pop style of Stevie Wonder " . 
 = = = " Over Easy " = = = 
 Opening side two , " Rockestra Theme " was a composition that McCartney had first recorded in 1974 , on the same piano demo tape as " Getting Closer " . " Rockestra Theme " is an instrumental – except for the shouted line " Why haven 't I had any dinner ? " , which author Robert Rodriguez describes as a " deliberate evocation " of Glenn Miller 's 1940 single " Pennsylvania 6 @-@ 5000 " . Another rock track , " To You " includes a lyric aimed at a lover who has wronged the singer . The guitar solo on the recording provides an unusual aspect for a Wings song , in that Juber played the part through an Avonside harmonizer while McCartney simultaneously altered the harmonizer 's settings from the studio 's control room . 
 McCartney deemed the two gospel @-@ influenced pieces making up " After the Ball / Million Miles " as being of insufficient quality to merit inclusion as separate tracks ; " After the Ball " ends with a guitar solo , edited from parts played by McCartney , Laine and Juber , after which " Million Miles " consists of a performance by McCartney alone , on concertina . This is followed by another medley , " Winter Rose / Love Awake " , both portions of which McCartney had demoed at Rude Studio , his home studio at Campbeltown , in 1977 . 
 " The Broadcast " is another instrumental , designed to give the impression of several radio signals interlaced . Over a musical backing of piano , mellotron and <unk> , it features readings taken from the plays The Sport of Kings by Ian Hay and The Little Man by John Galsworthy . As a return to the proposed working @-@ band concept , " So Glad to See You Here " , Rodriguez writes , " [ evokes ] the anticipation of a live act guaranteed to ' knock ' em dead ' " and so recalls Wings ' 1975 – 76 show @-@ opening medley " Venus and Mars / Rock Show " . During the outro , the band reprise a line from " We 're Open Tonight " . The album ends with a jazz @-@ inflected ballad , " Baby 's Request " , which McCartney wrote for American vocal group the Mills Brothers , after seeing them perform in the South of France during the summer of 1978 . 
 = = Production = = 
 The band first rehearsed material for Back to the Egg in London , at the offices of McCartney 's company MPL Communications in Soho Square , before carrying out further rehearsals in Scotland , in June 1978 . As on his other Wings recordings over 1978 – 79 , Thomas worked with Phil McDonald as his recording engineer , at McCartney 's insistence , rather than Bill Price , who was the producer 's preferred engineer . 
 = = = Recording and overdubbing = = = 
 = = = = June – July 1978 : Spirit of Ranachan Studios = = = = 
 The recording sessions for Back to the Egg began on 29 June 1978 at Spirit of Ranachan Studios – another , larger recording facility on the McCartneys ' Campbeltown farm – using equipment loaned from Mickie Most 's RAK Studio in London . The basic tracks were recorded with a spontaneity that had been absent in Wings ' past work , employing an approach that Juber has described as a " back @-@ to @-@ basics , garage band kind of feel " . 
 Sessions at Spirit of Ranachan lasted until 27 July , during which the band taped and added overdubs to " Arrow Through Me " , " Again and Again and Again " , " To You " , " Winter Rose " , " Old Siam , Sir " and " Spin It On " . Basic tracks were also completed for " Cage " , a song that remained in the proposed running order for the album until early in 1979 , " Crawl of the Wild " , " Weep for Love " , " Ballroom Dancing " and " Maisie " . These last three compositions would all appear on solo albums by members of Wings between 1980 and 1982 . 
 In addition , the band filmed a promotional video for the London Town single " I 've Had Enough " while in Scotland and , in early July , recorded demos of twelve pieces intended for the Rupert the Bear film soundtrack . In the case of the latter activity , none of these compositions were revisited for what became Rupert and the Frog Song ( 1984 ) . 
 = = = = September 1978 : Lympne Castle = = = = 
 After a break to allow for school summer holidays , recording recommenced on 11 September at Lympne Castle in Kent , using the RAK mobile recording equipment , as before . The choice of location was partly due to the castle 's proximity to the McCartneys ' property " Waterfall " , in Peasmarsh , East Sussex . During sessions lasting through to 29 September , the band recorded " We 're Open Tonight " , " Love Awake " , " After the Ball " , " Million Miles " , " Reception " and " The Broadcast " . 
 Recording took place mainly in the castle 's great hall , with Holly 's drum kit positioned in the fireplace . McCartney and Juber taped their acoustic guitar parts for " We 're Open Tonight " in a stairwell . Excerpted from books found in the library , the readings for " Reception " and " The Broadcast " were overdubbed in the kitchen and performed by the owners of Lympne Castle , Harold and Dierdre Margary . 
 = = = = October – December 1978 : Abbey Road Studios = = = = 
 Sessions moved to Abbey Road Studios in London on 3 October . That day , Wings joined with a supergroup of guest musicians , collectively known as " Rockestra " , to record the tracks " Rockestra Theme " and " So Glad to See You Here " . A camera crew led by Barry <unk> filmed the proceedings , and a 40 @-@ minute documentary , titled Rockestra , was later compiled from the footage . Equipment used for this session included 60 microphones , a pair of mixing consoles and a 16 @-@ track recording desk . James Honeyman @-@ Scott of the Pretenders , Hank Marvin of the Shadows , the Who 's Pete Townshend , Pink Floyd 's David Gilmour , Led Zeppelin 's John Paul Jones and John Bonham , and the Attractions ' Bruce Thomas all took part . Also among the line @-@ up was the horn section from Wings ' 1975 – 76 world tour , consisting of Howie Casey , Tony Dorsey , Thaddeus Richard and Steve Howard . Keith Moon was meant to participate , but he had died shortly before the session ; Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton were also scheduled to appear . 
 On 10 October , Wings taped " Getting Closer " at Abbey Road , along with a demo of " Baby 's Request " . McCartney had intended this recording of " Baby 's Request " for the Mills Brothers to use as a guide , but after they asked to be paid for recording the song , he instead included the demo on Back to the Egg . The band then continued with overdubs on these and other songs intermittently through October and November , finishing at Abbey Road on 1 December . 
 = = = = December 1978 – February 1979 : Replica Studio = = = = 
 Towards the end of the year , Wings also carried out overdubs at the newly built Replica Studio , located at MPL 's Soho Square offices . Frustrated at the impending unavailability of Abbey Road 's Studio Two – which studio owner and record company EMI needed for its other acts , besides Wings – McCartney had constructed an exact replica of Studio Two in the basement at MPL . Among the work done on Back to the Egg at Replica , the band replaced the final twenty seconds of " So Glad to See You Here " with what Madinger and Easter describe as " a reggae @-@ styled coda " , containing the " We 're Open Tonight " reprise . 
 Sessions continued there in January and February 1979 . During that time , the band recorded a non @-@ album single – the disco @-@ styled " Goodnight Tonight " , backed with " Daytime Nighttime Suffering " – as a release to coincide with the airing of the long @-@ delayed Wings Over the World special . While noting that McCartney and Laine 's relationship was beginning to unravel at this point , Sounes compares the freshness of these new recordings with the drawn @-@ out sessions for Back to the Egg and writes that the album " was now so overworked it might more aptly have been titled Over @-@ Egged " . Impatient at the amount of time being spent in the recording studio , Laine publicly admitted that he was " desperate " to go out on tour . 
 = = = Final overdubbing and mixing = = = 
 In March , Wings moved back to Abbey Road Studios to complete the album . Vocal overdubs were then added to " Winter Rose / Love Awake " and an orchestral @-@ sounding mellotron part to the end of " Getting Closer " . Having worked with the Black Dyke Mills Band in the 1960s , when he produced their 1968 single " Thingumybob " for Apple Records , McCartney invited the band down from Yorkshire to overdub brass accompaniment on " Winter Rose / Love Awake " . 
 While mixing the album during March , Wings finally discarded the song " Cage " , which had been sequenced as the second track , following " Reception " . The same alternative running order paired the Rockestra recordings at the end of side two , so that the album closed with the " We 're Open Tonight " coda . Holly later recalled that whereas beforehand the band had been confident that Back to the Egg would be a strong album , during the final mixing process " [ it ] dawned on us there might be problems " . At the last minute , " Baby 's Request " replaced " Cage " and the running order was revised , with the result that the working @-@ band concept became less pronounced . 
 = = Album artwork and promotional videos = = 
 The design for the album 's artwork was by Hipgnosis , the company responsible for previous Wings album covers such as Venus and Mars ( 1975 ) and the recent Wings Greatest compilation ( 1978 ) . The front cover depicts the five members of Wings in a room , looking down through space at Planet Earth through an open hatchway in the floor ; the picture was taken by photographer John Shaw at his London studio . Photos of the individual band members appeared on the back cover , credited to Linda and Paul McCartney . 
 Working with film company Keef & Co . , Wings filmed seven promotional videos for the album , which would later be compiled into the Back to the Egg TV special . Filming took place between 4 and 13 June , at locations including Lympne Castle 's main hall , a private airfield at Lympne , Camber Sands in East Sussex , and Keef & Co . ' s London studios . " Old Siam , Sir " , " Getting Closer " , " Spin It On " and " Arrow Through Me " were among the tracks for which videos were made . 
 = = Release = = 
 " Goodnight Tonight " had been issued on Columbia Records in America , marking McCartney 's break from EMI @-@ affiliated Capitol Records , although he and Wings remained with EMI 's Parlophone label in the UK . McCartney 's contract with Columbia made him the highest @-@ paid recording artist in the world . As an incentive for McCartney , Columbia 's parent company , CBS , had added to his publishing portfolio by giving him the highly profitable Frank Music catalogue – making McCartney the copyright holder to Guys and Dolls and other popular musicals by Frank Loesser . 
 Back to the Egg was released on 24 May 1979 in the US ( as Columbia FC @-@ <unk> ) , and on 8 June in the UK ( as Parlophone <unk> 257 ) . In Britain , " Old Siam , Sir " was the album 's first single , whereas " Getting Closer " was the choice in America ; in both cases , " Spin It On " was the B @-@ side . On 11 June , an album launch party took place inside Abbey Road 's Studio Two , which had been blacked @-@ out like a large frying pan , while tables carrying yellow parasols represented fried eggs sitting in the pan . Part of <unk> 's Rockestra documentary was screened during the event , the only public airing the film received . 
 The follow @-@ up singles , issued in August , were " Arrow Through Me " in the US and " Getting Closer " in the UK , the latter release a double A @-@ side with " Baby 's Request " . In some European countries , " Rockestra Theme " was released as a single . 
 Compared to the major commercial success of previous Wings albums , sales of Back to the Egg were disappointing , and none of its singles became significant hits . In the UK , " Old Siam , Sir " and " Getting Closer " climbed to number 35 and number 60 , respectively . On America 's Billboard Hot 100 chart , " Getting Closer " peaked at number 20 , and " Arrow Through Me " at number 29 . Back to the Egg reached number 6 in the UK and number 8 on the Billboard 200 , although US chart compilers Cashbox and Record World both listed it at number 7 . With heavy promotion from Columbia , the album sold over 1 million copies in America ; in Britain , retail outlets soon slashed its price in an attempt to dispense with their surplus of stock . 
 McCartney later reflected that for an act other than Wings , sales such as those for Back to the Egg would have been considered " very healthy " . Given CBS 's substantial investment in their new signing , Madinger and Easter write , the album 's apparent failure led to a period of " mutual finger @-@ pointing between Paul and Columbia Records " , lasting until his contract expired in 1985 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Back to the Egg received predominantly negative reviews on release ; author Alan Clayson writes of the album receiving " a critical mauling as vicious as that for London Town " . In an especially unfavourable critique for Rolling Stone magazine , Timothy White described it as " the sorriest grab bag of dreck in recent memory " and lamented that none of the songs were " the least bit fleshed out " , with the listener instead given " an irritating display of disjointed images and unfocused musical snapshots " . After opining that , since 1970 , " this ex @-@ Beatle has been lending his truly prodigious talents ... to some of the laziest records in the history of rock & roll " , White wrote : " Who , one felt compelled to ask , is in charge here ? Back to the Egg provides the final , obvious answer : no one . " 
 Music critic Robert Christgau said of McCartney and the new Wings album : " When he 's on , Paulie 's abundant tunefulness passes for generosity . Here he 's just hoping something will stick . " In Melody Maker , Ray Coleman wrote that McCartney " seems to be on a treadmill of banality " . Coleman described " Rockestra Theme " and " So Glad to See You Here " as " creditable , rolling , raunchy and at least efficient , with Paul 's voice at its rocking best on the last named track " , but concluded : " This album gets Wings nowhere ... " Billboard 's reviewer gave Back to the Egg " Spotlight " status ( meaning " the most outstanding new product of the week 's releases and that with the greatest potential for top of the chart placement " ) and commented : " The music features typical McCartney fare of late with nothing here that will distinguish it as one of his classics . The arrangements , though , are interesting , encompassing a variety of styles . " 
 In a more positive assessment , for Creem magazine , Mitchell Cohen highlighted the album 's second side as " a collection of McCartney performances that string together like abbey roadwork " , and praised McCartney 's vocals relative to his past work , writing : " all of the current tracks are terser , sung better , have less of what I suppose would be called the recording artist 's equivalent of camera consciousness . " To NME critic Bob Woffinden , the attempt at an album @-@ wide concept was " a pretty half @-@ baked one " and Hipgnosis ' cover photo was " easily the album 's strongest point " . While identifying the songs as " particularly weak lyrically " , Woffinden concluded : " It was the familiar McCartney problem . He had every essential creative requirement , except the discipline required to <unk> the parts into a perfect whole . " 
 AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine views Back to the Egg as " a set of [ McCartney 's ] most undistinguished songs " that " have no spark whatsoever " , and bemoans " the weak sound of the record and Wings ' faceless performances " . Among McCartney biographers , Vincent Benitez writes that the songs are " uneven in quality " , and Howard Sounes describes the album as " a curate 's egg , good in parts , with token attempts at sounding contemporary " . Tom Doyle views " the new wave @-@ ish rockers " like " Spin It On " as " too smoothed out to be truly edgy " and the two spoken @-@ word tracks as " weird – and not in a good way " . Doyle considers that while Back to the Egg has its " moments of inspiration " , " There was too much material [ recorded during the sessions ] , and yet not enough of it to gel into a cohesive album . " 
 = = Aftermath and reissues = = 
 With the album falling well short of Columbia 's and McCartney 's expectations commercially , McCartney spent the remainder of summer 1979 recording in Peasmarsh and Campbeltown , without Wings , creating his solo album McCartney II ( 1980 ) . During November and December 1979 , US TV stations aired the 31 @-@ minute Back to the Egg special , as Wings undertook a nineteen @-@ show UK tour , the first leg of the proposed world tour . Among the songs in the setlist , they performed several tracks from Back to the Egg : " Getting Closer " , " Again and Again and Again " , " Old Siam , Sir " , " Spin It On " and " Arrow Through Me " . 
 The band were scheduled to tour Japan during January and February 1980 , but the concerts , together with their tour dates elsewhere in the world , were cancelled after McCartney was arrested for possession of drugs when entering the country . Around this time , " Rockestra Theme " won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance . Wings regrouped in October 1980 to finish off songs for the planned Cold Cuts album , a compilation that McCartney had suggested when CBS sought to recover part of its financial losses from Back to the Egg . The reunion with Wings was short @-@ lived and the band broke up in April 1981 . 
 On 20 June 1989 , by which time McCartney had returned to Capitol Records , Back to the Egg was released on CD in America . In August 1993 , Parlophone reissued the album as part of The Paul McCartney Collection with three bonus tracks : " Daytime Nighttime Suffering " , McCartney 's 1979 Christmas single " Wonderful Christmastime " , and the latter 's B @-@ side , " Rudolph the Red @-@ Nosed Reggae " . Samples of " Reception " and " The Broadcast " appeared on the Fireman 's Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest ( 1993 ) album , a collaboration between McCartney and Youth . In 2007 , Back to the Egg was released on iTunes , with a remix of " Goodnight Tonight " as a bonus track .

 Victory Road ( 2008 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion that took place on July 13 , 2008 at the Reliant Arena in Houston , Texas . It was the fourth event under the Victory Road name and the seventh event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule . Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card , three of which were for championships . 
 The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the challenger Booker T. The match ended in a no @-@ contest after interference from Sting and various security personnel , thus causing Joe to retain the championship . A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match was also featured at Victory Road , pitting the team of A.J. Styles , Christian Cage , and Rhino against the team of Kurt Angle and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . Angle and Team 3D were the victors in the contest . The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a " Fan 's Revenge " Lumberjack match at the show , in which the champions The Latin American Xchange ( Hernandez and Homicide ) defeated Beer Money Incorporated . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) to retain the title . The final two rounds of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament took place at Victory Road . The third round featured a Four Team Twelve Man Elimination Tag Team match , which Team TNA won . The final round was a Four Way Ultimate X match , in which Team Mexico 's Volador Jr. defeated Team International 's Daivari , Team TNA 's Kaz , and Team Japan 's Naruki Doi . 
 Victory Road is remembered for the closing of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament . 25 @,@ 000 was the reported figure of purchasers for the event by The Wrestling Observer Newsletter . Victory Road had an attendance of 3 @,@ 000 people . Bob Kapur of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10 , which was lower than the 8 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol .

 The fourth installment under the Victory Road name was announced in January 2008 with a July 13 date attached . In May 2008 , TNA hoped to host a PPV event in Houston , Texas by the end of the year , the earliest timeframe being late summer . TNA issued a press release in late @-@ May 2008 revealing that Victory Road would be held at the Reliant Arena in Houston , Texas . Tickets for the show went on @-@ sale on May 30 . TNA released a poster to promote the event featuring the tagline " Houston , We Have a Problem " as well as Booker T and Samoa Joe . The final two rounds of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament were scheduled to take place at Victory Road . An online vote commenced at the start of the show to select a stipulation for a Six Man Tag Team match promoted for the show . The choices were Falls Count Anywhere match , Tables match , or Full Metal Mayhem . 
 = = = Storylines = = = 
 Victory Road featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at Victory Road was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then @-@ champion Samoa Joe and the challenger Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA 's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title , which Joe won to remain champion . On the June 12 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe 's mentor Kevin Nash . This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one @-@ on @-@ one match . After this segment , Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title . Since Houston is Booker T 's hometown , TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship for the people of Houston . On the July 10 episode of Impact ! , Sting proclaimed that he did not know which of the two would win at Victory Road , but that he would be there to watch . 
 The predominate storyline heading into the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle , both members of The Angle Alliance . On the February 14 episode of Impact ! , TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle 's real @-@ life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on @-@ screen . Afterwards , Karen and Angle separated in the storyline on the March 13 episode of Impact ! . TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May 15 episode of Impact ! . Karen refused Angle 's request on the May 22 episode of Impact ! , leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles . This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen . The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June 12 episode of Impact ! , which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles , Angle , Tomko , Christian Cage , Rhino , Abyss , and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . Afterwards , Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino became involved in the feud with Team 3D joining Angle , while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles . Team 3D then injured both Cage and Rhino in the narrative , with Rhino being knocked out on the June 19 episode of Impact ! , while on the June 26 episode of Impact ! Cage was slammed through a glass table by Brother Ray . Rhino returned from injury on the July 3 episode of Impact ! , challenging Team 3D and Angle to a Six Man Tag Team match at Victory Road , while teasing at adding Full Metal Mayhem rules to the bout . TNA promoted the match for the event afterwards . 
 The conclusion to the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament was held at Victory Road with two matches completing the final two rounds . The World X Cup was a tournament consisting of teams competing against each other for points . There were four teams each made up of four men , with three teams representing a country and one representing TNA . These teams were Team TNA ( Alex Shelley , Chris Sabin , Curry Man , and Kazarian ) , Team Japan ( Masato Yoshino , Milano Collection A.T. , Naruki Doi , and Puma ) , Team Mexico ( Averno , Rey Bucanero , Último Guerrero , and Volador Jr . ) , and Team International ( Alex Koslov , Daivari , Doug Williams , and Tyson Dux ) . The World X Cup began on the June 19 episode of Impact ! , with round one being tag team matches worth one point each . Round one concluded on the June 26 episode of Impact ! . Round two was standard wrestling matches worth two points each on the July 3 and July 10 episodes of Impact ! . The fourth round was announced on the June 19 episode of Impact ! to take place at Victory Road in an Ultimate X match . The The Wrestling Observer Newsletter reported that the third round of the tournament would be a multi @-@ man team elimination match consisting of the wrestlers not competing in the fourth round .

 The fourth and final round of the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament was next involving one member of each respective team in a Four Way Ultimate X match . The encounter was between Daivari of Team International , Kaz of Team TNA , Naruki Doi of Team Japan , and Volador Jr. of Team Mexico . In an Ultimate X match , two steel cables are attached to four steel supports in such a way that they form an " X " above the ring . At the center of this " X " an item is hung , which must be retrieved by a participant to win the match . In this bout , the item hanging above the ring was an enlarged red " X " which symbolized four points in the World X Cup . During the encounter , Kaz ascended one of the steel supports before jumping off towards the center of the ring and slamming his leg onto Daivari , who was holding onto the cables . This action forced both of them to fall and crash onto the ring mat below . Afterwards , Volador Jr ascended the cables and retrieved the " X " to win the match and four points for Team Mexico at 10 minutes and 58 seconds . With this victory , Team Mexico won the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament with seven points , compared to six by Team TNA , and three by Team Japan and Team International , respectively . Team Mexico were awarded a trophy for their victory after the bout by Mike Tenay and TNA Spanish commentator Willie Urbina . 
 A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match followed pitting the team of Kurt Angle and Team 3D against A.J. Styles , Christian Cage , and Rhino . The duration of the contest was 15 minutes and 55 seconds . In this bout , the only way to win was by pinfall or submission , all weapons were legal and encouraged , and there were no disqualifications . Cage ascended the steel supports left behind from the Ultimate X match during the bout to jump off in an aerial splash onto both members of Team 3D and Angle . Each participant of the match was forced through a table during the bout except Angle . Rhino was the first by Team 3D , followed by Cage also by Team 3D . Each member of Team 3D were then forced through a table by Styles . After this , Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter on Team 3D 's behalf by attempting to hit Styles with a kendo stick , only to be kicked in the head by Styles . Later , Styles laid Angle on a table and ascended a ladder . At this time , Frank Trigg interfered by hitting Styles over the head with the kendo stick , allowing Angle to force Styles through the set @-@ up table with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver for the pinfall victory . 
 The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which then @-@ champion Samoa Joe defended the title against the challenger Booker T. Joe 's forehead was cut open during the match after being thrown into a pair of steel ring steps . Booker T also had his forehead cut open during the contest . Several referees were knocked out by Joe in the storyline throughout the encounter , to the point that security was sent down to the ring to restrain Joe . Booker T 's legitimate wife Sharmell then interfered in the bout , attempting to get someone to stop Joe as he applied his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold on Booker T. Sting then entered the arena and went to the ring to calm down Joe , who listened at first , before giving Sting the finger and continuing his assault on Booker T. Sting retaliated by bashing Joe in the gut and over the back with a baseball bat . Booker T then covered Joe , while Sharmell counted the pinfall before the two left the arena with the title belt , leaving the outcome a mystery before being ruled a no @-@ contest at 15 minutes and 14 seconds .

Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment 's ( WWE ) The Great American Bash PPV event on July 20 , Victory Road fared better as The Great American Bash received a 6 out of 10 from Dave Hillhouse . 
 Kapur discussed in his review how the main event of a show can impact the rest of the event . He stated that " a confusing , overbooked <unk> " main event , such as the one at Victory Road , " can leave a bad taste in your mouth after it ’ s over , even if everything else was pretty solid . " He went on to say that based on the crowd reaction the " finish seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of what was otherwise a really good show , " and that it was " unfortunate , because everything leading up to that point was good to great . " Kapur gave the main event a 3 out of 10 , while the Full Metal Mayhem match and the World Tag Team Championship both received a 7 out of 10 .

He felt the main event had a " good start to what might have been a decent match " but stated that it was " far from a satisfying finish " for the price . Keller felt the Full Metal Mayhem bout was a " <unk> of a match , " but at the same time was " entertaining start to finish . " As for the World Tag Team Championship match , he said that it felt " anticlimactic " and that having the fans at ringside was more of a " distraction " than a " payoff . " Regarding the World X Cup , Keller said the third round bout was a dream match for some with " lots of cool spots from start to finish , " but that it had " little context early " and was more just a " bunch of spots . " He also said that the " last ten minutes was better without as many people tagging in and out somewhat indiscriminately . " As for the final round , Keller commented that " it had some spectacular ( and ridiculously dangerous looking ) spots , " but that it ended up " feeling short for a match of that caliber . " 
 James Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter , reviewed the show live from the arena . He said the main event had a " terrible terrible finish " which " killed the crowd . " He also commented that it was one of the " worst finishes " he had " ever seen . " Caldwell stated that the Full Metal Mayhem match had " lots of crazy spots " and that A.J. Styles received a " superstar pop coming out to the ring " from the audience that " carried on throughout the match " . He felt the World Tag Team Championship match was an " OK tag match . " As for the World X Cup , Caldwell stated that the third round bout was " entertaining yet quite long " and that the " crowd was super into Sabin and Shelley . " He also said that after the match settled into " one @-@ on @-@ one action " it " turned into a pretty good match . " The final round was seen by Caldwell as " one of those rinse and repeat spot fest matches until Kaz busted out the big double foot stomp on Daivari that popped the crowd . " Overall , he called it a " one spot match . "

 = Asama @-@ Sansō incident = 
 The Asama @-@ Sansō incident ( <unk> , Asama <unk> jiken ) was a hostage crisis and police siege in a mountain lodge near Karuizawa , Nagano prefecture , Japan that lasted from February 19 , 1972 to February 28 , 1972 . The police rescue operation on the final day of the standoff was the first marathon live television broadcast in Japan , lasting 10 hours and 40 minutes . 
 The incident began when five armed members of the United Red Army ( URA ) , following a bloody purge that left 14 members of the group plus one bystander dead , broke into a holiday lodge below Mount Asama , taking the wife of the lodge @-@ keeper as a hostage . A standoff between police and the URA radicals took place , lasting ten days . The lodge was a natural fortress , solidly constructed of thick concrete on a steep hillside with only one entrance , which , along with their guns , enabled the hostage @-@ takers to keep police at a distance . 
 On February 28 , the police stormed the lodge . Two police officers were killed in the assault , the hostage was rescued and the URA radicals were taken into custody . The incident contributed to a decline in popularity of leftist movements in Japan . 
 = = Background = = 
 Japan 's leftist student movement in the 1960s pervaded Japan 's universities , and , by late in the decade , had become very factionalized , competitive , and violent . After a series of incidents in which leftist student groups attacked and injured or killed law enforcement officials and the general public , Japan 's national police agency cracked down on the student groups , raiding their hideouts and arresting dozens in 1971 and 1972 . Attempting to conceal themselves from the police , a core group of radicals from the URA retreated to a compound in Gunma Prefecture during the winter of 1972 . 
 In the second week of February 1972 at the compound , URA 's chairman Tsuneo Mori and vice @-@ chairman Hiroko Nagata ( sometimes referred to as Yoko Nagata ) initiated a violent purge of the group 's members . In the purge , Nagata and Mori directed the deaths by beating of eight members and one non @-@ member who happened to be present . Six other members were tied to trees outside where they froze to death in the frigid mountain winter air . On February 16 , police arrested Mori , Nagata , and six other URA members at the compound or at a nearby village . Five others , armed with rifles and shotguns , managed to escape , fleeing on foot through the mountains towards Karuizawa in nearby Nagano prefecture . The five fugitives were Kunio Bandō , 25 , a graduate of Kyoto University , <unk> Yoshino , 23 , a senior at Yokohama National University , Hiroshi Sakaguchi , 25 , a dropout of Tokyo <unk> University , Jirō Katō , 19 , and his brother Saburō Katō , 16 . 
 = = Incident = = 
 Sighting the police pursuit near the community of Karuizawa on February 19 , the five radicals took refuge in a vacation lodge called Asama Sansō ( Asama Mountain Villa ) owned by Kawai Musical Instruments Manufacturing . The radicals entered the lodge and discovered Yasuko Muta , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wife of the lodge 's caretaker . She was the only person in the building , as her husband was walking the dog and the lodge 's guests had gone ice skating . The radicals took Muta hostage at gunpoint and barricaded the building . 
 The lodge 's structure made it a stronghold . The lodge , named after nearby Mount Asama , was a three @-@ story wood and concrete edifice built into the side of the hill atop an exposed base of steel @-@ reinforced concrete . The upper floor was slightly larger than the two below , giving the lodge a mushroom appearance . The building towered over the steep , snow @-@ covered slopes below and the lodge 's windows had heavy outer storm shutters . The building 's maze @-@ like floor plan and narrow staircases made it easy for the defenders to block off movement inside the building . The radicals would spend most of their time on the uppermost floor , which contained a kitchen , dining room , tatami @-@ mat sleeping room , and a commanding view of the surrounding valley and hills . The radicals placed large pieces of furniture and <unk> bedding around the doors and windows and secured them in place with wire . When Muta 's husband returned and saw the barricades he realized what had happened and quickly notified police . The police immediately set up roadblocks and surrounded the lodge to cut off any avenues of escape for the radicals inside . 
 The police decided to wait to see if the radicals would surrender on their own . After three days without a surrender offer from the hostage @-@ takers , the police shut off the electricity to the lodge and set up loudspeakers from which the parents of several of the radicals implored them to surrender , to no avail . One of the participating parents ' son had been killed in the purge incident , but both the police and the parent were unaware of this because the full extent of the purge had not yet become known . 
 On February 25 , the police began to prepare to assault the lodge . A wrecking ball crane with an armored driver 's compartment was positioned near the building and police armed themselves with ladders , heavy mallets , and chainsaws . Muta 's husband implored the radicals by loudspeaker to release his wife , but was ignored . On February 27 , the police used a baseball pitching machine to bombard the building with rocks to keep the hostage @-@ takers awake all night . 
 The police moved into position for the assault at 8 a.m. on February 28 and issued a final ultimatum an hour later , which went unheeded by the radicals . At 10 a.m. the wrecking @-@ ball crane began to batter the lodge 's walls . The police cautiously approached the building and began to break through the barricades . By noon , the police had occupied the two lower floors , isolating the radicals and Muta on the top floor . 
 The police experienced difficulty in breaching the radicals ' defenses on the top floor and hours later had not made much headway . The police directed high @-@ pressure water hoses at the top floor , gouging out large holes in the building 's walls and drenching the radicals and Muta with cold water . During this time , the radicals kept up continuous gunfire on the assaulting police and threw homemade bombs at them . Two policemen , Shigemitsu Takami , 42 , and <unk> Uchida , 47 , were shot and killed and 15 other policemen were injured . A civilian observer who intruded into the area without police permission was also shot , reportedly by the radicals , and fatally wounded . 
 As darkness fell , the police breached the top floor 's barricades and captured one of the Katō brothers . The remaining four radicals burrowed into a pile of <unk> bedding and refused to surrender . As the police approached them , Kunio Bandō shot one of the policemen , Masahiro Endō , in the eye . Endō lost his eye but survived . Eventually , at 6 : 15 p.m. , 280 hours after the incident began , the remaining four radicals were taken into custody and Muta was rescued . Muta was cold but uninjured and told police that her captors had not mistreated her , although they had tied her to a bed during most of the standoff . That same evening , despondent over his son 's behavior , Kunio Bandō 's father hanged himself in his home in <unk> , a city near Kyoto . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Throughout the stand @-@ off , the incident was extensively covered by Japanese broadcast media , which gave frequent reports and updates . Muta 's photo was shown repeatedly on television . 
 At 9 : 40 a.m. on February 28 , public broadcaster NHK began live , continuous coverage of the siege that lasted until 8 : 20 p.m. that night . Ratings for NHK 's non @-@ stop coverage averaged 50 @.@ 8 % and peaked at 89 @.@ 7 % at 6 : 26 p.m. Vehicle traffic was noticeably lighter throughout the day in Tokyo . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The five radicals were charged on six counts : two murders , one attempted murder , obstructing police in the execution of their duties , violation of the Swords and Firearms Control Law , and illegal confinement . Four were sentenced to long prison terms and Hiroshi Sakaguchi was sentenced to death . On 24 June 2013 , the Supreme Court of Japan rejected an appeal from Sakaguchi for a retrial , leaving Sakaguchi on death row awaiting execution . 
 On August 8 , 1975 the Japanese government released Kunio Bandō and flew him to asylum in Libya in response to demands from Japanese Red Army members who had stormed the American and Swedish embassies in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia and taken 53 hostages . Bandō later is believed to have assisted in the hijacking of Japan Airlines Flight 472 from Paris to Tokyo in 1977 , forcing the jet to land in Dhaka . Bandō remains at large and reportedly spent time between 1997 and 2007 in Russia , China , the Philippines , and Japan . 
 Yasuko Muta remained in the Karuizawa area , working at another lodge . She refused to speak any further about her ordeal since her initial statements to the police and press after she was rescued . 
 The incident , along with the Lod Airport massacre which occurred several months later , and several hijackings , contributed to an intense social backlash among the population of Japan against radical student leftist groups . After the incident , the leftist movement in Japan greatly decreased in numbers and enjoyed much less popular support . A 2007 film by Kōji Wakamatsu about the incident titled United Red Army won the Japanese Eyes Best Picture award at the October 2007 Tokyo International Film Festival .

 Bowyer appeared in victory lane to celebrate his first win of the season in front of 95 @,@ 000 people who attended the race . Bowyer also earned $ 248 @,@ 250 in race winnings . Stewart took his last @-@ minute loss of the race with good humor , saying , " We went down swinging . I think I ran me out of fuel . " In the subsequent post @-@ race press conference , Hamlin said , " First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap , because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be . I set a goal ( of ) top 15 , and then it was top eight and then top six and , ' Holy cow , we can win this thing . ' We just made a heck of a charge at the end . " Bowyer was delighted with his victory : " [ Crew chief ] Shane [ Wilson ] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck , and everybody had a lot of confidence , a pep in their step . And we showed it from the time we unloaded to qualifying , practice , we were one of the fastest cars here . That ’ s what it takes to run at this level , to be a part of that Chase , if we can go and continue to have as much fun as we did this weekend . I know it ’ s the key , I know it is to my success . " 
 Johnson was candid about his performance : " We had a decent car and ran in the top five and top 10 but just didn 't end up finishing there . " Harvick was somewhat more upbeat , saying , " We didn 't have a great day . We didn 't have a great weekend , honestly , and ( fifth ) says a lot about this team . If we keep doing that on our bad days , we will be in good shape . " The race result left Hamlin leading the Driver 's Championship with 5 @,@ 230 points .

The race took two hours , fifty @-@ eight minutes and twenty @-@ two seconds to complete , and the margin of victory was 0 @.@ 477 seconds . 
 Although Bowyer 's car passed initial inspection , NASCAR announced that they had " discovered issues with the car in a more thorough inspection at its research and development center " . Three days after the race , two teams were given penalties : Richard Childress Racing for Bowyer 's car , and Whitney Motorsports for McDowell 's car . Richard Childress Racing 's penalty , for unauthorized alterations to the rear bodywork of Bowyer 's car , included a $ 150 @,@ 000 fine and a six race suspension for Wilson , and the loss of 150 owner and driver points for Richard Childress and Bowyer respectively . RCR 's car chief , Chad Haney , was placed on probation until December 31 , 2010 , and suspended from NASCAR until November 3 , 2010 . Whitney Motorsports ' penalty was for engine exhaust valves that did not meet NASCAR 's weight requirements . The penalties for that included a $ 50 @,@ 000 fine and six race suspension for Jeremy <unk> , while both McDowell and owner Dusty Whitney lost 50 driver and owner points respectively . 
 Childress and Bowyer were both upset with the penalties and almost immediately announced plans to appeal . Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe , saying , " I don 't think the penalty fits the crime . Sixty @-@ thousandths of an inch , folks . Grab a quarter out of your pocket . Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150 @-@ point fine ? " He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it ran out of gas on its way to victory lane . " Is it possible that a two @-@ ton wrecker could bend the quarter @-@ panel 60 @-@ thousandths of an inch ? You have to ask yourself that . " The team lost the initial appeal , forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook . As a result of the final appeal , Wilson 's fine was reduced to $ 100 @,@ 000 while he and Haney 's suspensions were reduced from six to four races ( they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process ) ; however , the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld . 
 Asked if he thought Bowyer could still win the championship after this setback , Stewart argued , " It 's possible for sure . The biggest thing is going to be going to the race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief , not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend ... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this ... it 's definitely possible , but everyone else is going to have to have trouble . " Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself ; NASCAR vice president of competition , Robin Pemberton , commented , " We don 't consider taking away the win . If you ask some , they would consider a 150 @-@ point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty . "

 = Trapper Nelson = 
 Vince " Trapper " Nelson ( born Vincent <unk> or <unk> around 1909 ) was an American trapper , hunter , and zoo founder . Though he was born in New Jersey , and lived in Mexico and Texas , he is best known for establishing a homestead @-@ turned @-@ zoo on the shore of the Loxahatchee River in Florida . Filled with exotic and wild animals , his zoo was a popular tourist spot in the 1940s and 1950s , visited by local and national celebrities . Because of this , he became known locally as " Tarzan of the Loxahatchee " . 
 The zoo was eventually shut down by State health inspectors in 1960 . After his zoo was closed , Nelson became a hermit and suffered from undiagnosed health problems . In 1968 , he was found dead from a gunshot wound in his cabin by a friend . His death was ruled a suicide . Nelson 's campsite is now known as the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District in Jonathan Dickinson State Park , Hobe Sound , Florida . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Trapper Nelson was born Vincent <unk> ( or <unk> ) to Polish immigrant parents in Trenton , New Jersey , in 1908 or 1909 . As a boy , to earn money he began trapping animals such as muskrats in the marshes of New Jersey . His parents did not speak English , so Nelson would often assist them in translating to make sure they were not taken advantage of . However , when his mother died and his father remarried , Nelson ran away from home , heading west . 
 Hopping freight trains , Nelson first ended up in Colorado , then eventually in Mexico . While there , he was arrested by the Federales under suspicion of gunrunning . He spent time in a Mexican jail and was later released . Nelson later claimed his release was because he " wrecked their food budget . " 
 After his release Nelson headed back east with 10 cents to his name . He made money for food by gambling with other road bums until he made it to southern Florida , where he , his step brother Charles Nelson and friend John Dykas set up camp . 
 = = Settlement on the Loxahatchee = = 
 Nelson and his partners settled on the beach by the Jupiter Inlet in Palm Beach County , Florida , in the late 1920s . Bessie DuBois , wife of John DuBois , recalled seeing him for the first time in 1927 or 1928 . The <unk> owned a restaurant that Nelson would frequent , and Bessie made note of his eccentric eating habits : " He would order a pie — not a piece of pie , mind you , but a pie — and he 'd eat the whole thing right in front of me . " He ate ice cream by the half @-@ gallon , and there were stories that he once ate 18 eggs for breakfast . 
 Things did not stay peaceful for long . On December 17 , 1931 , Charles Nelson shot partner John Dykas in the back , killing him . Trapper Nelson , angered by his step @-@ brother 's actions , testified against him at the trial for Dykas ' murder . Charles was given a 20 @-@ year sentence at Raiford Prison . Disillusioned with civilization , Nelson withdrew from the beach , settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December . Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister , he bought 800 acres . 
 Physically imposing at 6 ' 4 " and 240 pounds , he lived by trapping , hunting , and fishing in what was then wild country . He made money by selling the furs of the animals he trapped , and ate the meat , starting rumors that he ate everything from opossums to stray house cats . He acquired extensive land holdings , bidding on tax auctions during the Great Depression . He would on occasion bid against Judge C. E. Chillingworth , the judge who had handed down his step @-@ brother 's sentence , and the two eventually became friends . When Chillingworth was murdered in the 1950s , Charles Nelson was briefly considered a suspect . 
 Trapping could only bring Nelson income seasonally , and as south Florida became a popular tourist destination , he came up with a new way to earn money . He eventually developed a zoo on his property in the 1930s , calling it " Trapper Nelson 's Zoo and Jungle Gardens " . His camp and zoo became popular tourist attractions . Tours along the river from West Palm Beach would stop there for lunch and stretch breaks , and Nelson shared the profits with the boat captains . Locally prominent people and celebrities alike visited , including boxing champion Gene Tunney and actor Gary Cooper , to see his animals , watch Nelson wrestle alligators , and buy souvenirs . 
 With his new fame came notoriety . He was known locally as the " Tarzan of the Loxahatchee " , and cared for the locals ' exotic pets . He would trap troublesome wild animals , and provided others for parties and events . Rumors were started about his <unk> , his eating habits ( Bessie DuBois denied he ate raw possum ) , and his romantic exploits . It was told that he courted heiresses and countesses from wealthy Palm Beach , and that one conquest was a direct descendant of President James Monroe . 
 Nelson finally married in 1940 in an attempt to avoid the draft for World War II . His plan failed and he was drafted anyway . He joined the Military Police in Texas , but while training , he tore a muscle in his leg and was transferred to Camp Murphy , which was very close to his land . 
 = = Decline = = 
 Upon his return to the Loxahatchee , Nelson discovered that his wife had a new lover . He divorced his wife , and after that Nelson bought cars for the women he wooed , paying for them in installments to ensure they would stay for at least a while . 
 Focusing again on his zoo , he found that property values were skyrocketing . Nelson got a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and added more and more land to his sprawling camp . Shortly after he began his forays into real estate , a health inspector declared his zoo unhygienic and demanded he install lavatories . Nelson did , but the Health Department found them " unsatisfactory " , and in 1960 he was forced to close his zoo . With no income , the taxes on the land became too much for him , and he ended up borrowing $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 800 @,@ 000 in today 's dollars ) to pay them . 
 Nelson already had a deep @-@ seated mistrust of the government , and the closing of his zoo was , to him , enough to confirm his paranoia . He became more and more closed off . He began to dam the river leading to his camp to keep boats away , and installed fences and padlocks to discourage land travelers . He put up signs around his land reading " Danger : Land Mines " . As added discouragement , he kept a 12 @-@ gauge shotgun with him at all times . 
 He began to develop severe stomach pains , refused to see a doctor . He distrusted them because his brother @-@ in @-@ law had died after having a pacemaker installed . It was speculated among friends that the pains were from cancer , but they could have been an acid condition . 
 By the 1960s Nelson had become so reclusive that he would not let even trusted friends visit him without first sending a postcard to ask his permission . He ventured into town once a week to check his mail at the post office , and would sometimes buy steaks , but for the most part he remained holed @-@ up in his cabin . Years later , his nephew recalled his uncle 's change in personality : " During the last 10 years , his eyes seemed to lose their sparkle . He became a lonely man , and a rather sick one . " 
 = = Death = = 
 In July 1968 , Nelson failed to appear for a planned meeting with an old friend . John DuBois , at whose house the meeting was supposed to take place , became worried and drove to Nelson 's camp . When he surveyed the campsite , everything appeared to be in order , until he got to Nelson 's chickee . 
 Nelson was found dead in his cabin from a shotgun blast to his stomach on July 30 , 1968 . The Coroner 's Office ruled it a suicide , and the Martin County Sheriff 's Office deemed it a " pretty clear @-@ cut case " . However , many Florida locals had their doubts . " If it were [ sic ] a suicide , why did [ n 't ] he do a head shot instead of a chest shot ? " asked Bessie DuBois . The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground , leaned over and pulled the trigger , even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson 's part . 
 It was undeniable that Nelson had enemies . Floridian trappers envied his skill and viewed him as an outsider because he was from New Jersey . The State wanted to develop his land into condominiums and golf courses . Shortly before his death , a man who repaired one of Nelson 's jeeps found out he was sick and had not seen a doctor in six months . The man took him to a doctor who prescribed him painkillers . A neighbor , and the last man to see Nelson alive , speculated : " I guess it would be possible for someone to sneak up on him . Ordinarily it would be impossible ... but if he were doped up , well that would be different . " 
 Some friends considered suicide a possibility , however . His stomach pains may have taken a substantial part in a decision to end his life . An executor of Nelson 's will said he had told his sister that he would " rather die than be an invalid . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 A few months after Nelson 's death , the state traded land for Nelson 's estate , which became part of Jonathan Dickinson State Park . The site is now known as the Trapper Nelson Zoo Historic District . After the land was converted to a park , but still <unk> to the public , the camp was often vandalized . One of Nelson 's tool sheds was burned down ; the arsonist attempted to burn other buildings but was unsuccessful . 
 In April 1984 , park rangers discovered Nelson 's " treasure " : a hiding place in his chimney held 5 @,@ 005 coins , totaling $ 1 @,@ 829 @.@ 46 . The coins ranged in date from the 1890s to the 1960s . A thorough search of the camp was conducted before revealing the find to the public , but nothing more was found . 
 The camp still stands today , with his cabin , a guest cabin , a chickee shelter , docks , a boathouse , and assorted cages from his zoo . There are also fruit trees that he planted , including <unk> cherry , Java plum and wild almond . 
 = Ontario Highway 70 = 
 King 's Highway 70 , commonly referred to as Highway 70 , was a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario , which provided a shorter route from Highway 6 and Highway 21 in Springmount to Highway 6 in Hepworth . The route , which now forms part of Highway 6 , was 15 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 4 mi ) long and travelled in a southeast – northwest direction west of Owen Sound . The route followed an early trail blazed by deputy surveyor Charles Rankin in 1842 that was upgraded to a modern road in the 1920s . Highway 70 was designated in 1965 and renumbered as Highway 6 in 1997 . Another Highway 70 existed near Kenora between 1937 and 1959 before being renumbered as Highway 71 . This designation was applied along the newly opened Heenan Highway , shortly after the Department of Highways ( DHO ) began numbering routes in northern Ontario . However , a series of renumberings in 1960 led to the entire length becoming part of Highway 71 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 70 was a short highway that travelled in a northeast – southwest direction between the communities of Springmount , near Owen Sound , and Hepworth . The 15 @.@ 1 km ( 9 @.@ 4 mi ) route , now part of Highway 6 , passes through an equal mixture of farmland and forests , aside from the community of Shallow Lake , located at approximately the midpoint of the route . At its southern terminus is the only wrong @-@ way concurrency in Ontario , between Highway 6 and Highway 21 . The road continues south of the intersection between these highways as Grey County Road 18 , which serves as a bypass of Owen Sound . At its northern terminus , the route curves to the west and enters Hepworth ; Highway 70 ended at the intersection of Queen Street and Bruce Street . From there , Highway 6 continued north through the Bruce Peninsula . 
 = = History = = 
 Rainy River – Kenora 
 The Highway 70 designation was first used along the Heenan Highway , connecting the Rainy River region to Kenora to provide the first Canadian road link to an area previously accessible only from the United States . In 1922 , Kenora MPP Peter Heenan and Dr. McTaggart approached the government to lobby for construction of a road between Nestor Falls and Kenora . Nestor Falls was the northernmost point accessible by road from the Rainy River area . Heenan would become the Minister of Lands and Forests in Mitch Hepburn 's cabinet . This provided the impetus for construction to begin in 1934 . Unlike previously built roads in the area , the Fort Frances – Kenora Highway , as it was known prior to its opening , was constructed through the rugged terrain of the Canadian Shield . Rocks , forests , lakes , muskeg , and insects served as major obstacles during construction of the 100 @-@ kilometre ( 62 mi ) highway , which progressed from both ends . By late 1935 , the only remaining gap in the road was the Sioux Narrows Bridge . Construction on this bridge was underway by March 1936 ; it was rapidly assembled using Douglas fir from British Columbia as the main structural members . The bridge was completed on June 15 , 1936 , completing the link between Fort Frances and Kenora . 
 On July 1 , 1936 , premier Mitch Hepburn attended a ceremony in front of the Rainy Lake Hotel in Fort Frances . On a rainy afternoon , at 5 : 30 p.m. , Peter Heenan handed Hepburn a pair of scissors with which to cut the ribbon crossing the road and declare the highway open . Hepburn , addressing the crowd that was gathered , asked " What would you say if we call it the Heenan Highway , what would you think of that ? " . The crowd cheered and Hepburn cut the ribbon . 
 The Heenan Highway was assumed by the DHO shortly after its merger with the Department of Northern Development . Following the merger , the DHO begin assigning trunk roads throughout northern Ontario as part of the provincial highway network . The portion lying within Kenora District was designated as Highway 70 on September 1 , while the portion within Rainy River District was designated on September 29 . 
 The original route of Highway 70 split in two south of Finland ; Highway 70 turned east to Off Lake Corner , then south to Emo , while Highway 70A turned west to Black Hawk then south to Barwick . The northern end of the highway was also concurrent with Highway 17 for 21 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 13 @.@ 5 mi ) into Kenora , and the southern end concurrent with Highway 71 for 37 @.@ 0 kilometres ( 23 @.@ 0 mi ) between Emo and Fort Frances . During 1952 , the highway was extended south from its split to Highway 71 , midway between Barwick and Emo . By 1953 , the new road was opened and informally designated as the new route of Highway 70 . The old routes were decommissioned on February 8 , and the new route designated on March 10 , 1954 . 
 Throughout the mid to late 1950s , a new highway was constructed west from Thunder Bay towards Fort Frances . Initially this road was designated as Highway 120 . In 1959 , it was instead decided to make this new link a westward extension of Highway 11 ; a major renumbering took place on April 1 , 1960 : Highway 11 was established between Rainy River and Fort Frances , Highway 71 was truncated west of the Highway 70 junction , and the entirety of Highway 70 was renumbered as Highway 71 . 
 Bruce Peninsula 
 On April 22 , 1965 , the DHO recycled the Highway 70 designation , providing a shorter route for traffic between the Bruce Peninsula and Owen Sound . The new highway followed an existing Grey County road through Shallow Lake - the Southwest Diagonal . It was surveyed in 1854 by Ontario 's deputy surveyor , Charles Rankin , to provide a short route between the undeveloped Sydenham ( now Owen Sound ) and Hepworth townsites . This route passed through a large swamp and as a result remained an unimproved one lane trail up until the 1920s . By the time the road was designated as a provincial highway , it was a paved two lane route . On April 1 , 1997 , Highway 6 was decommissioned south of Hepworth to Highway 21 . The entire length of Highway 70 was subsequently renumbered Highway 6 to rectify the discontinuity .

 = Myrmecia nigrocincta = 
 Myrmecia nigrocincta , commonly known as the jumper ant or jumping jack , is an ant of the genus Myrmecia . The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858 . Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia . Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches , and they also have a powerful , venomous sting . Rather than foraging on the ground , M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers . 
 This ant is a large species , some workers can grow to over 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) in length . They have a distinctive pattern of orange @-@ red and black which distinguishes them from other Myrmecia species . M. nigrocincta possess the gamergates gene which allows workers to reproduce , either in the presence of a queen or in a colony where the queen is missing . Life expectancy of a worker ant is over one year . They are known to enslave ants of other species as workers for their colony , and they are aggressive when attacking intruders . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Abundant in eastern Australia , M. nigrocincta ants prefer temperate bushlands , and are usually located in dry to semi @-@ dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands . The species is found in the eastern states of Australia , mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found . They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures . They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1 @,@ 220 metres ( 262 ft - 4 @,@ 000 ft ) . 
 M. nigrocincta colonies have been recorded from Cairns , Atherton , Mackay , Mt . <unk> , Brisbane , Blackall Range and Fletcher in Queensland . In New South Wales , this ant occurs in Lismore , Dorrigo , Armidale and Sydney ( notably in the suburbs of Heathcote and Como ) , while in Victoria it is found in Trafalgar and Millgrove . Several colonies have also been recorded in South Australia . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 M. nigrocincta was first identified by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858 , after syntype workers were collected and described in his work Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI . In a study on phylogenetic relationships among species group of the genus Myrmecia , four species with an occipital carina including M. nigrocincta were found to form a paraphyletic and basal assemblage , while other Myrmecia species lacking an <unk> carina were shown to have a supported monophyletic assemblage . The type specimen is located in the British Museum . 
 = = Description = = 
 Ants of genus Myrmecia are generally referred to as " bulldog ants " and M. nigrocincta , like other species in the genus , has elongated mandibles . M. nigrocincta ants are primarily black and orange @-@ red in colour . They have mandibles which are either black or yellow depending on where the ants are found . The gaster , head , legs and mesonotum are black while the pronotum , propodeum , petiole and post @-@ petiole are red . The ant has linear ridges along the front of its head . It also has apical spurs on the tibia of both its middle leg and hind leg . The legs are thin and become more slender away from the body . M. nigrocincta can be distinguished from other species in the Myrmecia genus by the bi @-@ coloured thorax and post @-@ petiole which are yellowish @-@ red and black and the yellowish @-@ red node . 
 The workers are 13 to 15 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 51 to 0 @.@ 59 in ) long , the males 16 to 17 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 63 to 0 @.@ 67 in ) while the female ( queen ) is 17 to 19 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 67 to 0 @.@ 75 in ) . The development of the queen 's wings is rudimentary and the stubby , reduced wings render the queen flightless . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 M. nigrocincta is an accomplished jumper with leaps ranging from 3 to 4 inches ( 76 to 102 mm ) . It has good vision and can be observed running amongst plants and leaves , occasionally jumping from one branch to another . It is mostly found foraging on plants , trees , and other vegetation , but it sometimes forages on the ground . It propels its jumps by a sudden extension of its middle and hind legs . 
 M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal and do not hibernate . They are omnivores , and feed on other insects including caterpillars and spiders , as well as honey water . M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial hairstreak butterflies , even jumping while carrying them . Predators of the M. nigrocincta ( and the Myrmecia genus as a whole ) includes spiders , birds , lizards , mammals and other predatory invertebrates , including assassin bugs and Redbacks . The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees . Although Senna acclinis is self @-@ compatible , the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity to effect pollination . 
 These ants live in nests in sandy soil which sometimes have a mound , which resembles a <unk> . M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves . Depending on the type of habitat in which the colony is located , they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel . Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves , rocks , vegetation , and twigs . Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or at the base of a tree . 
 The colonies of M. nigrocincta ants are monogyne , i.e. they have only one queen per colony . The queen is semi @-@ claustral , meaning that during the founding of the new colony , the queen has to forage so that she has enough food to raise her brood . Colonies have between 400 and 1200 individuals and are thus considered to be " large " colonies . M. <unk> is known to enslave <unk> and other species of ants . 
 The worker and scout M. nigrocincta ants use pheromones for communication . They are quick to defend their nests and may react aggressively even to a shadow crossing their nest . Wheeler ( 1922 ) describes the reaction of M. nigrocincta to the disturbance of their nest as " they bound out of their small mound nest in a series of short hops like Lilliputian cavalry galloping to battle . " The ants aggressively defend their colony , causing multiple bites and <unk> sacrificing themselves to protect the queen and the colony . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species , which allows female workers to be fertile , and these are then able to reproduce in both queenless and <unk> ( colonies with a queen ) colonies . This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive in the absence of the queen . In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present , worker @-@ laid eggs were reared to mature males , showing that workers are highly fertile . The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 2 years , with a maximum expectancy of 1 @.@ 3 years ( 400 or more days ) . Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are <unk> in length but increase to <unk> when matured . 
 = = Venom = = 
 M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings which are painful and produce intense burning sensations . The sensations last for many days and the sting itches . If left untreated , the sting may develop into an ulcer . The venom of a closely related species , M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and contains active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases , hyaluronidase , as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study , the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis , it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking part of the study reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species . Of these , 176 reacted to the M. pilosula , 15 to M. nigrocincta , three to M. ludlowi , and 56 to other Myrmecia ants . The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis . Besides Myrmecia species , these included the green @-@ head ant ( Rhytidoponera metallica ) . 
 = Action of 31 July 1793 = 
 The Action of 31 July 1793 was an inconclusive engagement between a British Royal Navy frigate and French frigate off the New Jersey coastline in the first year of the French Revolutionary Wars . The British captain , George Courtenay of HMS Boston , had arrived off New York City on 28 May and deliberately disguised his ship as a French vessel , fooling a French officer into coming aboard and making him a prisoner of war . Courtenay then sent a message into New York , where he knew a French frigate lay at anchor , challenging the French captain to battle within the next three days . The challenge was accepted and widely disseminated throughout the city , so that when Captain Jean @-@ Baptiste @-@ François Bompart of Embuscade sailed out to meet Courtenay on the morning of 31 July , the shore was crowded with thousands of sightseers . 
 The engagement between the ships was fiercely contested , but the smaller and more lightly armed Boston seemed to be taking the more serious damage when at 6 : 20 Captain Courtenay was thrown to the deck . What happened next has been subject to debate , with the second @-@ in @-@ command , Lieutenant John Edwards claiming that Courtenay had been killed and he was thrown overboard as was the custom at the time . However rumours subsequently circulated that Courtenay had only been knocked unconscious when Edwards gave the order to jettison him , a story that his family credited and was later taken up by the contemporary historian Edward Pelham Brenton , although historian William James subsequently defended Edwards ' actions . With Courtenay gone , Boston continued to suffer severe damage until just after 07 : 00 , when the remaining officers ordered all surviving sails set and the British ship attempted to escape . Although Bompart pursued , by 08 : 00 the strain had proved too much for his ship and he fell back . After a close encounter with French ships in the Delaware River , Boston eventually escaped to St John 's , Newfoundland while Embuscade refitted in New York . 
 = = Background = = 
 In February 1793 the newly formed French Republic declared war on Great Britain , extending the French Revolutionary Wars that had begun the year before on the continent . The French Navy was in a state of upheaval due to the social consequences of the French Revolution , and as a result found itself at a disadvantage to the Royal Navy , which had been preparing for war since June 1792 . In response , the French sent several frigate squadrons to sea , including their newest ships and best sailors and officers in an attempt to disrupt British commerce in the early stages of the war . One such squadron was sent in April 1793 to the United States , carrying the French ambassador to the United States , Edmond @-@ Charles Genêt . After the ambassador disembarked , the squadron , under the command of Captain Jean @-@ Baptiste @-@ François Bompart , dispersed to raid British shipping along the coast , capturing or destroying more than 60 merchant vessels before retiring to American ports for repairs . 
 The French threat on the American Seaboard was met by Royal Navy frigates operating out of Halifax , Nova Scotia , under orders to watch and blockade French movements in American ports . One such ship was the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Boston , a small and old vessel under the command of Captain George Courtenay . Courtenay was under orders to watch New York City , where one of the frigates was known to be at anchor . On 28 June 1793 , Boston arrived off New York , Courtenay deliberately disguising his ship to resemble a French vessel by having the French @-@ speaking members of his crew talk loudly on the quarterdeck while an American pilot boat was within earshot . The French ship in New York was Bompart 's ship Embuscade , a large and powerful vessel that had been built less than three years before and carried a combined broadside weight of 240 pounds ( 108 @.@ 9 kg ) , 30 pounds ( 13 @.@ 6 kg ) more than that of Boston . Sighting the strange ship off the harbour , Bompart sent a boat with his lieutenant , an American from Boston named <unk> , and twelve men to investigate . Although he was suspicious of the strange vessel , <unk> was finally convinced that the ship was a French vessel after conferring with the pilots , and came aboard only to discover his error when Courtenay seized him and his men as prisoners of war . 
 Courtenay suggested to his prisoner that he would be keen to meet Bompart in battle , and he agreed to send a message into New York via the pilot boat with a challenge for Bompart to bring Embuscade out of the neutral harbour and meet Boston off Sandy Hook . The pilot was initially unable to locate the French captain , and so instead posted the challenge in a coffeehouse in the city , from where the news spread rapidly . Bompart came to learn of it , and spent the next two days preparing his warship ; historian Edward Pelham Brenton has claimed that Bompart was joined by 100 armed American volunteers , which he calls " a flagrant violation of the law of nations " . After a consultation among the French officers Embuscade sailed from New York on the night of 30 July , although Courtenay was almost forced to miss the rendezvous : on the afternoon of 30 July a large French battle squadron of the ships of the line Éole and Patriote , four frigates and six smaller vessels passed northwards along the New Jersey coast , heading for New York . In the face of such a powerful force Boston was temporarily forced to withdraw to open water , but the squadron did not deviate to investigate the frigate and had passed into New York harbour by nightfall , allowing Courtenay to return to his station . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 03 : 00 on 31 May , lookouts on Boston reported a large ship approaching from the northeast . Courtenay readied his ship for battle and at 03 : 30 the ship passed at a distance of 3 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 6 @.@ 5 km ) and was shortly afterwards recognised as a frigate flying the French tricolour . Unsure of the newcomer 's identity , Courtenay raised the same flag and in response the strange ship raised a blue flag bearing a white cross , identifying itself as Embuscade , come to meet his challenge . At 04 : 00 both ships turned eastwards , continuing for 45 minutes until Boston slowed and raised British colours . As the British ship slowed the French vessel overtook at 1 @.@ 5 nautical miles ( 2 @.@ 8 km ) distance and at 05 : 00 Boston tacked towards the French ship , Embuscade slowing so that Courtenay 's frigate passed along the starboard broadside . Boston fired first at 05 : 05 , followed immediately by a volley from Embuscade . Both ships then tacked again , by this time approximately 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ) southeast of Navesink , New Jersey . News of the impending battle had spread rapidly through the countryside , and thousands of spectators had gathered on the New Jersey beaches to watch the engagement . 
 After fifteen minutes of combat , Boston lost its cross @-@ jack yard and by 05 : 45 had suffered significant damage to its rigging and sails , rendering the ship significantly less manoeuvrable than Embuscade . At 06 : 10 the main topmast was knocked over and the mizzen mast badly damaged , and ten minutes later , as he was exhorting his men to greater efforts , a cannonball struck the rail where Captain Courtenay and Royal Marine Lieutenant James Butler were standing . Butler was killed instantly and Courtenay fell to the deck unresponsive , possibly killed . Believing his commander to be dead , Lieutenant John Edwards assumed command and had the bodies thrown overboard in an effort to prevent his sailors losing morale from the death of their captain . Boston continued to suffer under the heavier guns of the French ship and by 06 : 40 the mizzen mast was close to collapse and much of the remaining rigging had been shot away . Casualties mounted , with Lieutenant Edwards and Alexander Kerr both badly wounded , the latter blinded and the former struck on the head and briefly rendered unconscious . 
 With their officers gone and their ship in an increasingly battered state , panic began to spread through the British crew . In response Edwards was assisted to the deck and assumed command . While confusion overtook Boston , Bompart remained in command of his ship despite heavy casualties and manoeuvred around to the British ship 's stern , intending to finish the battle with a raking broadside . With difficulty Edwards wore away from the threat and recognised that continued resistance would be futile , turning Boston towards the open sea away from Embuscade and setting all remaining sail to escape . At 07 : 07 , Bompart began in pursuit , but his ship was also damaged and could not match the speed of the smaller British vessel . At 08 : 00 , with Boston 4 nautical miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) ahead and stretching the distance , the French captain abandoned the chase and turned back towards New York . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 So badly damaged was Bompart 's ship that he was not able to dock in New York until 2 August and repairs to his vessel , including the replacement of all three masts , were not completed until 9 October . Accounts of the battle in the American media claimed that Embuscade 's losses amounted to 50 men killed or wounded during the action from a crew of 340 men . Boston limped southwards in desperate need of repairs and initially attempted to anchor in the Delaware River . On taking on a pilot , Lieutenant Edwards was informed that the French frigates Concorde and <unk> were anchored at Mud Fort . Aware that his ship would be rapidly overwhelmed by such a force , Edwards disembarked the pilot and sailed north , eventually bringing his battered vessel into St John 's , Newfoundland . Losses aboard Boston amounted to ten killed and 24 wounded from a crew of 204 , the dead including Captain Courtenay . In recognition of his service , Courtenay 's widow was presented with a pension of £ 500 ( the equivalent of £ 52 @,@ 900 as of 2016 ) and his two children with £ 50 per annum . Edwards ' subsequent career was shortened by injury , but Bompart was presented with a gold medal on his return to France , and remained a prominent figure in the French Navy , serving at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and leading the French expeditionary force that unsuccessfully attempted to invade Ireland in 1798 and was destroyed at the Battle of Tory Island . 
 Edwards ' report contained his account of Courtenay 's death in battle , and it was widely accepted at the time . However rumours began circulating that Courtenay had not been killed but merely stunned by the blow , and that his death may have come as a result of Edwards order for him to be thrown overboard . This second account was accepted by Courtenay 's family and shortly after Edwards ' death in January 1823 from the effects of the wound he received in the action with Embuscade , the naval officer and historian Edward Pelham Brenton published his work Naval History of Great Britain from the Year 1783 to 1822 , in which he wrote that : 
 " The action soon began , and continued with great bravery on both sides , until the iron hammock @-@ rail of the quarter @-@ deck being struck by a shot , a part of it took Captain Courteney [ sic ] on the back of the neck , and he fell , but no blood followed . The first lieutenant immediately caused the body to be thrown overboard , lest , as he said , it should " dishearten the people ; " and , after this prudent precaution , hauled away from the enemy , who had no inclination to follow him " . 
 This version of events was refuted in 1827 by historian William James , who wrote in response to Brenton that " All we [ James ] can say to this extraordinary statement is , that our [ James ' ] account was taken chiefly from Boston 's log book , and we have not the least reason , from subsequent inquiries , to believe it to be incorrect . " Subsequent histories , including William Laird Clowes ' book of 1900 and Richard Woodman 's of 2001 follow James , but in his 1837 reprint Brenton defended the account and named Alexander Robert Kerr , second lieutenant of Boston during the action , as his source . In the same year a magazine article written by a niece of Captain Courtenay continued to repeat the allegations , stating that " the treacherous or – to say the least of it – the improper and unprofessional conduct of Lieutenant Edwards " had been responsible for his commander 's death . 
 After the battle , the ladies of <unk> launched a subscription to celebrate the crew of HMS Boston . On the other hand , the population of New York had a golden medal made in honour of the crew of Embuscade ; Bompart accepted the medal on the condition he would not have to wear it , as the National Convention had banned medals . 
 = Persistent carbene = 
 A persistent carbene ( also known as stable carbene ) is a type of carbene demonstrating particular stability . The best @-@ known examples and by far largest subgroup are the N @-@ heterocyclic carbenes ( NHC ) ( sometimes called Arduengo carbenes ) , for example diaminocarbenes with the general formula ( R2N ) 2C : , where the ' R 's are typically alkyl and aryl groups . The groups can be linked to give heterocyclic carbenes , such as those derived from imidazole , <unk> , thiazole or triazole . 
 Traditionally carbenes are viewed as so reactive that were only studied indirectly , e.g. by trapping reactions . This situation has changed dramatically with the emergence of persistent carbenes . Although they are fairly reactive substances , i.e. , undergoing dimerization , many can be isolated as pure substances . 
 Persistent carbenes can exist in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable . The relative stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups . Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable in the absence of moisture and ( in most cases ) oxygen , and can be isolated and indefinitely stored . Others are not thermodynamically stable and will dimerise slowly over days . The less stable triplet state carbenes have half @-@ lives measured in seconds , and therefore can be observed but not stored .

 = = = Early evidence = = = 
 In 1957 , Ronald Breslow proposed that a relatively stable nucleophilic carbene , a thiazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene derivative , was involved in the catalytic cycle of vitamin B1 ( thiamine ) that yields <unk> from furfural . In this cycle , the vitamin 's <unk> ring exchanges a hydrogen atom ( attached to carbon 2 of the ring ) for a furfural residue . In <unk> water , the C2 @-@ proton was found to rapidly exchange for a deuteron in a statistical equilibrium . 
 This exchange was proposed to proceed via <unk> of a thiazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene . In 2012 the isolation of the so @-@ called Breslow intermediate was reported . 
 In 1960 , Wanzlick and co @-@ workers conjectured that carbenes derived from dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene were produced by vacuum pyrolysis of the corresponding 2 @-@ <unk> dihydroimidazole compounds with the loss of chloroform . They conjectured that the carbene existed in equilibrium with its dimer , a <unk> derivative , the so @-@ called Wanzlick equilibrium . This conjecture was challenged by <unk> and co @-@ workers in 1964 , who presented evidence that the dimer did not dissociate ; and by <unk> in 1965 . However , subsequent experiments by <unk> , Herrmann and others have confirmed this equilibrium , albeit in specific circumstances . 
 = = = Isolation of persistent carbenes = = = 
 In 1970 , Wanzlick 's group generated imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene carbenes by the deprotonation of an imidazolium salt . Wanzlick as well as Hoffmann , proposed that these imidazole @-@ based carbenes should be more stable than their 4 @,@ 5 @-@ dihydro analogues , due to <unk> @-@ type aromaticity . Wanzlick did not however isolate any imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene , but their coordination compounds with mercury and isothiocyanate : 
 In 1988 , Bertrand and others isolated <unk> . These species can be represented as either a <unk> @-@ <unk> or <unk> @-@ <unk> : 
 These compounds were called " push @-@ pull carbenes " in reference to the contrasting electron affinities of the phosphorus and silicon atoms . They exhibit both carbenic and <unk> reactivity . An X @-@ ray structure of this molecule has not been obtained and at the time of publication some doubt remained as to their exact carbenic nature . 
 In 1991 , a stable , isolated , and crystalline diaminocarbene , which can be represented as a carbene or a nitrogen carbon ylide , was obtained by Arduengo and co @-@ workers , by deprotonation of an imidazolium chloride with a strong base : 
 This carbene , the forerunner of a large family of carbenes with the imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene core , was found to be indefinitely stable at room temperature ( in the absence of oxygen and moisture ) , and melted at 240 – 241 ° C without decomposition . Another interesting chemical property of this ylidic compound was a characteristic resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum at 211 ppm for the carbenic atom . The X @-@ ray structure revealed longer N – C bond lengths in the ring of the carbene than in the parent imidazolium compound , indicating that there was very little double bond character to these bonds . 
 The first air @-@ stable ylidic carbene , a chlorinated member of the imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene family , was obtained in 1997 . 
 In 2000 , Bertrand obtained additional carbenes of the <unk> type , including ( <unk> ) ( trifluoromethyl ) carbene , stable in solution at <unk> ° C and a moderately stable ( amino ) ( aryl ) carbene with only one heteroatom adjacent to the carbenic atom . 
 = = = Factors affecting stability of heteroatom @-@ stabilized carbenes = = = 
 The stability of Arduengo carbenes was initially attributed to the bulky N @-@ <unk> substituents , which prevents the carbene from <unk> due to steric hindrance . However , Arduengo 's group later obtained an imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene in which the N @-@ <unk> groups were replaced with methyl groups , showing that steric hindrance was not the predominant stabilising factor . Instead imidazole @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes are thermodynamically stable . 
 It had been also conjectured that the double bond between carbons 4 and 5 of the imidazolium ring backbone , which gave aromatic character to that system , was important for the carbene 's stability . This conjecture was disproved in 1995 by Arduengo 's group , who obtained a derivative of dihydroimidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene , lacking the double bond . The thermodynamical stability in this compound , and the role of steric protection in preventing dimerisation , has been a topic of some dispute . 
 The first acyclic persistent carbene was reported in 1996 , thus showing that a cyclic backbone was not necessary for their stability . Unlike the cyclic derivatives , the acyclic carbenes are flexible with respect to rotation of the bonds to the carbenic atom . By measuring the barrier to rotation of these bonds , the extent of their double bond character could be measured , and the ylidic nature of this carbene could be determined . Like the cyclic diaminocarbenes , unhindered variants tend to dimerise . 
 Until 1997 , all stable carbenes were stabilized by two nitrogen centers bound to the carbenic atom . This pattern was broken in 1997 – 1998 with the synthesis of a thiazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene derivative by Arduengo 's group and an <unk> and an <unk> . In these stable compounds , the carbenic atom lies between a nitrogen atom and either a sulfur or oxygen atom : 
 However , these carbenes are not thermodynamically stable as decomposition and dimerisation have been observed for unhindered examples . 
 A more radical development was the synthesis in 2006 of bis ( diisopropylamino ) cyclopropenylidene by Bertrand 's group . In this compound , which is stable at room temperature , the carbene atom is connected to two carbon atoms , in a three @-@ member ring that retains the aromaticity and geometry of the cyclopropenylidene ring . This example demonstrated that the presence of heteroatoms next to the carbene is not necessary for stability , either . 
 = = Classes of stable carbenes = = 
 The following are examples of the classes of stable carbenes isolated to date : 
 = = = Imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes = = = 
 The first stable carbenes to be isolated were based on an imidazole ring , with the hydrogen in carbon 2 of the ring ( between the two nitrogen atoms ) removed , and other hydrogens replaced by various groups . These imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes are still the most stable and the most well studied and understood family of persistent carbenes . 
 A considerable range of imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes have been synthesised , including those in which the 1 @,@ 3 @-@ positions have been <unk> with alkyl , aryl , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and even chiral substituents : 
 In particular , substitution of two chlorine atoms for the two hydrogens at ring positions 4 and 5 yielded the first air @-@ stable carbene . Its extra stability probably results from the electron @-@ withdrawing effect of the chlorine substituents , which reduce the electron density on the carbon atom bearing the lone pair , via induction through the sigma @-@ backbone . 
 Molecules containing two and even three imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene groups have also been synthesised . 
 <unk> @-@ based carbenes are thermodynamically stable and generally have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210 – 230 ppm for the carbenic carbon . Typically , X @-@ ray structures of these molecules show N @-@ C @-@ N bond angles of 101 – 102 ° . 
 = = = <unk> @-@ 5 @-@ ylidenes = = = 
 Another family of persistent carbenes are based on the 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 4 @-@ triazole ring , with the unfilled orbitals in carbon 5 of this ring . The triazol @-@ 5 @-@ ylidenes pictured below were first prepared by Enders and co @-@ workers by vacuum pyrolysis through loss of methanol from 2 @-@ <unk> . Only a limited range of these molecules have been reported , with the <unk> substituted molecule being commercially available . 
 <unk> @-@ based carbenes are thermodynamically stable and have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 210 – 220 ppm for the carbenic carbon . The X @-@ ray structure of the <unk> substituted carbene above shows an N @-@ C @-@ N bond angle of ca . 101 ° . The 5 @-@ <unk> precursor to this carbene was made by the treatment of a triazolium salt with sodium <unk> , which attacks as a nucleophile . This may indicate that these carbenes are less aromatic than imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes , as the imidazolium precursors do not react with nucleophiles due to the resultant loss of aromaticity . 
 = = = Other diaminocarbenes = = = 
 Carbenes that formally derive from imidazole @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes by substitution of sulfur , oxygen , or other chalcogens for both α @-@ nitrogens are expected to be unstable , as they have the potential to dissociate into an <unk> ( <unk> ≡ <unk> ) and a carbon <unk> ( X1 = C = X2 ) . The two families above can be seen as special cases of a broader class of compounds which have a carbenic atom bridging two nitrogen atoms . A range of such diaminocarbenes have been prepared principally by Roger Alder 's research group . In some of these compounds , the N @-@ C @-@ N unit is a member of a 5 or 6 membered non @-@ aromatic ring , including a bicyclic example . In other examples , the adjacent nitrogens are connected only through the carbenic atom , and may or may not be part of separate rings . 
 Unlike the aromatic imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes or triazol @-@ 5 @-@ ylidenes , these carbenes appear not to be thermodynamically stable , as shown by the dimerisation of some unhindered cyclic and acyclic examples . Studies suggest that these carbenes dimerise via acid catalysed dimerisation ( as in the Wanzlick equilibrium ) . 
 <unk> have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 230 – 270 ppm for the carbenic atom . The X @-@ ray structure of dihydroimidazole @-@ 2 @-@ ylidene shows a N @-@ C @-@ N bond angle of ca . 106 ° , whilst the angle of the acyclic carbene is 121 ° , both greater than those seen for imidazol @-@ 2 @-@ ylidenes . 
 = = = <unk> carbenes = = = 
 There exist several variants of the stable carbenes above where one of the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene center ( the α nitrogens ) has been replaced by an alternative heteroatom , such as oxygen , sulfur , or phosphorus . : 
 In particular , the formal substitution of sulfur for one of the nitrogens in imidazole would yield the aromatic heterocyclic compound thiazole . A thiazole based carbene ( analogous to the carbene postulated by Breslow ) has been prepared and characterised by X @-@ ray crystallography . Other non @-@ aromatic <unk> with O , S and P atoms adjacent ( i.e. alpha ) to the carbene centre have been prepared , e.g. <unk> and oxy @-@ iminium based carbenes have been characterised by X @-@ ray crystallography . 
 Since oxygen and sulfur are divalent , steric protection of the carbenic centre is limited especially when the N @-@ C @-@ X unit is part of a ring . These acyclic carbenes have diagnostic 13C NMR chemical shift values between 250 – 300 ppm for the carbenic carbon , further downfield than any other types of stable carbene . X @-@ ray structures have shown N @-@ C @-@ X bond angles of ca . 104 ° and 109 ° respectively . 
 = = = Non @-@ amino carbenes = = = 
 The reaction of carbon disulfide ( CS2 ) with electron deficient acetylene derivatives is proposed to give transient 1 @,@ 3 @-@ <unk> carbenes ( i.e. where X1 
 = X2 = 
 S ) , which then dimerise to give derivatives of <unk> . Thus it is possible that the reverse of this process might be occurring in similar carbenes . 
 = = = Bertrand 's carbenes = = = 
 In Bertrand 's persistent carbenes , the unsaturated carbon is bonded to a phosphorus and a silicon . However , these compounds seem to exhibit some <unk> properties , and when published the exact carbenic nature of these red oils was in debate .

 One stable N @-@ heterocyclic carbene has a structure analogous to <unk> with one boron atom replaced by a methylene group . This results in a planar 6 @-@ electron compound .

 Another family of carbenes is based on a cyclopropenylidene core , a three @-@ carbon ring with a double bond between the two atoms adjacent to the carbenic one . This family is exemplified by bis ( diisopropylamino ) cyclopropenylidene . 
 = = = Triplet state carbenes = = = 
 In 2001 , Hideo <unk> and his associates were able to produce a comparatively stable triplet carbene ( bis ( 9 @-@ <unk> ) carbene , with a half @-@ life of 19 minutes ) , by taking advantage of resonance . 
 In 2006 a triplet carbene was reported with a half @-@ life of 40 minutes . This carbene is prepared by a photochemical decomposition of a <unk> with expulsion of nitrogen gas at a wavelength of 300 nanometers in benzene . 
 Exposure to oxygen ( <unk> ) converts this carbene to the corresponding benzophenone and the <unk> compound is formed when it is trapped by 1 @,@ 4 @-@ <unk> . As with the other carbenes this species contains large bulky substituents , namely bromine and the trifluoromethyl groups , that shield the carbene and prevent or slow down the process of dimerisation to a 1 @,@ 1 @,@ 2 @,@ 2 @-@ tetra ( phenyl ) alkene . 
 Based on computer simulations , the distance of the divalent carbon atom to its neighbours is claimed to be 138 picometers with a bond angle of 158 @.@ 8 ° . The planes of the phenyl groups are almost at right angles to each other ( the dihedral angle being 85 @.@ 7 ° ) . 
 = = Mesoionic carbenes = = 
 Mesoionic carbenes ( <unk> ) are similar to N @-@ heterocyclic carbenes ( NHCs ) except that canonical resonance structures with the carbene depicted cannot be drawn without adding additional charges . Mesoionic carbenes are also referred to as abnormal N @-@ heterocyclic carbenes ( <unk> ) or remote N @-@ heterocyclic carbenes ( <unk> ) . A variety of free carbenes can be isolated and are stable at room temperature . Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways .
