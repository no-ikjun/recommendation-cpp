 The white stork was one of the many bird species originally described by Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his Systema Naturae , where it was given the binomial name of Ardea ciconia . It was reclassified to ( and was designated the type species of ) the new genus Ciconia by French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 . Both the genus and specific epithet , <unk> , are the Latin word for " stork " , originally recorded in the works of Horace and Ovid . The Latin word survives in most Romance languages ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the like ) . The word stork is derived from the Old English word <unk> , and appeared in the 10th @-@ century works the Erfurt Glossary , where the word is equated with Ciconia , and Aelfric 's Homilies . The word is related to the Old High German <unk> , " stork " , and similar words in many other European languages , all of which are descended from the Germanic <unk> @-@ z . 
 There are two subspecies : 
 C. c. ciconia , the nominate subspecies described by Linnaeus in 1758 , breeds from Europe to northwest Africa and westernmost Asia , and in southern Africa , and winters mainly in Africa south of the Sahara Desert , though some birds winter in India . 
 C. c. asiatica , described by Russian naturalist Nikolai Severtzov in 1873 , breeds in Turkestan and winters from Iran to India . It is slightly larger than the nominate subspecies . 
 The stork family contains six genera in three broad groups : the open @-@ billed and wood storks ( Mycteria and <unk> ) , the giant storks ( <unk> , Jabiru and Leptoptilos ) , and the " typical " storks , Ciconia . The typical storks include the white stork and six other extant species , which are characterised by straight pointed beaks and mainly black and white plumage . Its closest relatives are the larger , black @-@ billed Oriental white stork ( Ciconia <unk> ) of East Asia , which was formerly classified as a subspecies of the white stork , and the <unk> stork ( C. <unk> ) of South America . Close evolutionary relationships within Ciconia are suggested by behavioural similarities and , biochemically , through analysis of both mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences and DNA @-@ DNA hybridization . 
 A Ciconia fossil representing the distal end of a right humerus has been recovered from Miocene beds of <unk> Island , Lake Victoria , Kenya . The 24 – 6 million year old fossil could have originated from either a white stork or a black stork ( C. nigra ) , which are species of about the same size with very similar bone structures . The Middle Miocene beds of <unk> Island have yielded further remains . 
 = = Description = = 
 The white stork is a large bird . It has a length of 100 – 115 cm ( 39 – 45 in ) , and a standing height of 100 – 125 cm ( 39 – 49 in ) . The wingspan is 155 – 215 cm ( 61 – 85 in ) and its weight is 2 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 5 kg ( 5 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like all storks , it has long legs , a long neck and a long straight pointed beak . The sexes are identical in appearance , except that males are larger than females on average . The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts ; the black is caused by the pigment melanin . The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays . The irises are dull brown or grey , and the peri @-@ orbital skin is black . The adult has a bright red beak and red legs , the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet . In parts of Spain , studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish ( <unk> clarkii ) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings , in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere . 
 As with other storks , the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar . In flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular . It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail . It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck <unk> . In contrast , it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting . Moulting has not been extensively studied , but appears to take place throughout the year , with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season . 
 Upon hatching , the young white stork is partly covered with short , sparse , whitish down feathers . This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down . By three weeks , the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers . On hatching the chick has pinkish legs , which turn to greyish @-@ black as it ages . Its beak is black with a brownish tip . By the time it fledges , the juvenile bird 's plumage is similar to that of the adult , though its black feathers are often tinged with brown , and its beak and legs are a duller brownish @-@ red or orange . The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip . The bills gain the adults ' red colour the following summer , although the black tips persist in some individuals . Young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Within its range the white stork is distinctive when seen on the ground but , when seen at a distance in flight , it can be confused with several other species with similar underwing patterns , such as the yellow @-@ billed stork , great white pelican and Egyptian vulture . The yellow @-@ billed stork is identified by its black tail and a longer , slightly curved , yellow beak . The white stork also tends to be larger than the yellow @-@ billed stork . The great white pelican has short legs which do not extend beyond its tail , and it flies with its neck retracted , keeping its head near to its stocky body , giving it a different flight profile . Pelicans also behave differently , soaring in orderly , synchronised flocks rather than in disorganised groups of individuals as the white stork does . The Egyptian vulture is much smaller , with a long wedge @-@ shaped tail , shorter legs and a small yellow @-@ tinged head on a short neck . The common crane , which can also look black and white in strong light , shows longer legs and a longer neck in flight . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The nominate race of the white stork has a wide although disjunct summer range across Europe , clustered in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa in the west , and much of eastern and central Europe , with 25 % of the world 's population concentrated in Poland , as well as parts of western Asia . The asiatica population of about 1450 birds is restricted to a region in central Asia between the Aral Sea and Xinjiang in western China . The Xinjiang population is believed to have become extinct around 1980 . Migration routes extend the range of this species into many parts of Africa and India . Some populations adhere to the eastern migration route , which passes across Israel into eastern and central Africa . 
 A few records of breeding from South Africa have been known since 1933 at <unk> , and about 10 birds have been known to breed since the 1990s around Bredasdorp . A small population of white storks winters in India and is thought to derive principally from the C. c. asiatica population as flocks of up to 200 birds have been observed on spring migration in the early 1900s through the <unk> Valley . However , birds ringed in Germany have been recovered in western ( Bikaner ) and southern ( Tirunelveli ) India . An atypical specimen with red orbital skin , a feature of the Oriental white stork , has been recorded and further study of the Indian population is required . North of the breeding range , it is a passage migrant or vagrant in Finland , Great Britain , Iceland , Ireland , Norway and Sweden , and west to the Azores and Madeira . In recent years , the range has expanded into western Russia . 
 The white stork 's preferred feeding grounds are grassy meadows , farmland and shallow wetlands . It avoids areas overgrown with tall grass and shrubs . In the Chernobyl area of northern Ukraine , white stork populations declined after the 1986 nuclear accident there as farmland was succeeded by tall grass shrubs . In parts of Poland , poor natural foraging grounds have forced birds to seek food at rubbish dumps since 1999 . White storks have also been reported foraging in rubbish dumps in the Middle East , North Africa and South Africa . 
 The white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands , particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded , and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland . They make use of grasslands , wetlands , and farmland on the wintering grounds in Africa . White storks were probably aided by human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created , and they were found across much of Europe , breeding as far north as Sweden . The population in Sweden is thought to have established in the 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture . About 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in the 18th century which declined subsequently . The first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and the last pair failed to breed around 1955 . The white stork is a rare visitor to the British Isles , as about 20 birds are seen in Britain every year , but there are no records of nesting . A pair nested atop St Giles High Kirk in Edinburgh , Scotland in 1416 . 
 A decline in population began in the 19th century due to industrialisation and changes in agricultural methods . White storks no longer nest in many countries , and the current strongholds of the western population are in Portugal , Spain , Ukraine and Poland . In the Iberian Peninsula , populations are concentrated in the southwest , and have also declined due to agricultural practices . A study published in 2005 found that the Podhale region in the uplands of southern Poland had seen an influx of white storks , which first bred there in 1931 and have nested at progressively higher altitudes since , reaching 890 m ( 3000 ft ) in 1999 . The authors proposed that this was related to climate warming , and the influx of other animals and plants to higher altitudes . White storks arriving in Poznań province ( Greater Poland Voivodeship ) in western Poland in spring to breed did so some 10 days earlier in the last twenty years of the 20th century than at the end of the 19th century . 
 = = = Migration = = = 
 Systematic research into migration of white stork began with German ornithologist Johannes <unk> who commenced ringing studies in 1906 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory , on the <unk> Spit in what was then East Prussia . Although not many storks passed through Rossitten itself , the observatory coordinated the large @-@ scale ringing of the species throughout Germany and elsewhere in Europe . Between 1906 and the Second World War about 100 @,@ 000 , mainly juvenile , white storks were ringed , with over 2 @,@ 000 long @-@ distance recoveries of birds wearing Rossitten rings reported between 1908 and 1954 . 
 = = = = Routes = = = = 
 White storks fly south from their summer breeding grounds in Europe in August and September , heading for Africa . There , they spend the winter in savannah from Kenya and Uganda south to the Cape Province of South Africa . In these areas they congregate in large flocks which may exceed a thousand individuals . Some diverge westwards into western Sudan and Chad , and may reach Nigeria . In spring , the birds return north ; they are recorded from Sudan and Egypt from February to April . They arrive back in Europe around late March and April , after an average journey of 49 days . By comparison , the autumn journey is completed in about 26 days . Tailwinds and scarcity of food and water en route ( birds fly faster over regions lacking resources ) increase average speed . 
 To avoid a long sea crossing over the Mediterranean , birds from central Europe either follow an eastern migration route by crossing the Bosphorus to Turkey , traversing the Levant , then bypassing the Sahara Desert by following the Nile valley southwards , or follow a western route over the Strait of Gibraltar . These migration corridors maximise help from the thermals and thus save energy . The eastern route is by far the more important with 530 @,@ 000 white storks using it annually , making the species the second commonest migrant there ( after the European honey buzzard ) . The flocks of migrating raptors , white storks and great white pelicans can stretch for 200 km ( 125 mi ) . The eastern route is twice as long as the western , but storks take the same time to reach the wintering grounds by either . 
 Juvenile white storks set off on their first southward migration in an inherited direction but , if displaced from that bearing by weather conditions , they are unable to compensate , and may end up in a new wintering location . Adults can compensate for strong winds and adjust their direction to finish at their normal winter sites , because they are familiar with the location . For the same reason , all spring migrants , even those from displaced wintering locations , can find their way back to the traditional breeding sites . An experiment with young birds raised in captivity in Kaliningrad and released in the absence of wild storks to show them the way revealed that they appeared to have an instinct to fly south , although the scatter in direction was large . 
 = = = = Energetics = = = = 
 White storks rely on the uplift of air thermals to soar and glide the long distances of their annual migrations between Europe and Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . For many , the shortest route would take them over the Mediterranean Sea ; however , since air thermals do not form over water , they generally detour over land to avoid the trans @-@ Mediterranean flights that would require prolonged energetic wing flapping . It has been estimated that flapping flight metabolises 23 times more body fat than soaring flight per distance travelled . Thus , flocks spiral upwards on rising warm air until they emerge at the top , up to 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 500 m ( 3 @,@ 900 – 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above the ground ( though one record from Western Sudan observed an altitude of 3 @,@ 300 m ( 10 @,@ 800 ft ) ) . 
 Long flights over water may occasionally be undertaken . A young white stork ringed at the nest in Denmark subsequently appeared in England , where it spent some days before moving on . It was later seen flying over St Mary 's , Isles of Scilly , and arrived in a poor condition in Madeira three days later . That island is 500 km ( 320 mi ) from Africa , and twice as far from the European mainland . Migration through the Middle East may be hampered by the khamsin , winds bringing gusty overcast days unsuitable for flying . In these situations , flocks of white storks sit out the adverse weather on the ground , standing and facing into the wind . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 The white stork is a gregarious bird ; flocks of thousands of individuals have been recorded on migration routes and at wintering areas in Africa . Non @-@ breeding birds gather in groups of 40 or 50 during the breeding season . The smaller dark @-@ plumaged <unk> 's stork is often encountered with white stork flocks in southern Africa . Breeding pairs of white stork may gather in small groups to hunt , and colony nesting has been recorded in some areas . However , groups among white stork colonies vary widely in size and the social structure is loosely defined ; young breeding storks are often restricted to peripheral nests , while older storks attain higher breeding success while occupying the better quality nests toward the centres of breeding colonies . Social structure and group cohesion is maintained by altruistic behaviours such as allopreening . White storks exhibit this behaviour exclusively at the nest site . Standing birds preen the heads of sitting birds , sometimes these are parents grooming juveniles , and sometimes juveniles preen each other . Unlike most storks , it never adopts a spread @-@ winged posture , though it is known to droop its wings ( holding them away from its body with the primary feathers pointing downwards ) when its plumage is wet . 
 A white stork 's droppings , containing faeces and urine , are sometimes directed onto its own legs , making them appear white . The resulting evaporation provides cooling and is termed urohidrosis . Birds that have been ringed can sometimes be affected by the accumulation of droppings around the ring leading to constriction and leg trauma . The white stork has also been noted for tool use by squeezing moss in the beak to drip water into the mouths of its chicks . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 The adult white stork 's main sound is noisy bill @-@ clattering , which has been likened to distant machine gun fire . The bird makes these sounds by rapidly opening and closing its beak so that a knocking sound is made each time its beak closes . The clattering is amplified by its throat pouch , which acts as a resonator . Used in a variety of social interactions , bill @-@ clattering generally grows louder the longer it lasts , and takes on distinctive rhythms depending on the situation — for example , slower during copulation and briefer when given as an alarm call . The only vocal sound adult birds generate is a weak barely audible hiss ; however , young birds can generate a harsh hiss , various <unk> sounds , and a cat @-@ like mew they use to beg for food . Like the adults , young also clatter their beaks . The up @-@ down display is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species . Here a stork quickly throws its head backwards so that its crown rests on its back before slowly bringing its head and neck forwards again , and this is repeated several times . The display is used as a greeting between birds , post coitus , and also as a threat display . Breeding pairs are territorial over the summer , and use this display , as well as crouching forward with the tails cocked and wings extended . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 White storks consume a wide variety of animal prey . They prefer to forage in meadows that are within roughly 5 km ( 3 mi ) of their nest and sites where the vegetation is shorter so that their prey is more accessible . Their diet varies according to season , locality and prey availability . Common food items include insects ( primarily beetles , grasshoppers , locusts and crickets ) , earthworms , reptiles , amphibians , particularly frog species such as the edible frog ( Pelophylax <unk> esculentus ) and common frog ( Rana temporaria ) and small mammals such as voles , moles and shrews . Less commonly , they also eat bird eggs and young birds , fish , molluscs , crustaceans and scorpions . They hunt mainly during the day , swallowing small prey whole , but killing and breaking apart larger prey before swallowing . Rubber bands are mistaken for earthworms and consumed , occasionally resulting in fatal blockage of the digestive tract . 
 Birds returning to Latvia during spring have been shown to locate their prey , moor frogs ( Rana arvalis ) , by homing in on the mating calls produced by aggregations of male frogs . 
 The diet of non @-@ breeding birds is similar to that of breeding birds , but food items are more often taken from dry areas . White storks wintering in western India have been observed to follow blackbuck to capture insects disturbed by them . Wintering white storks in India sometimes forage along with the woolly @-@ necked stork ( Ciconia episcopus ) . Food piracy has been recorded in India with a rodent captured by a western marsh harrier appropriated by a white stork , while Montagu 's harrier is known to harass white storks foraging for voles in some parts of Poland . 
 = = = Breeding and lifespan = = = 
 The white stork breeds in open farmland areas with access to marshy wetlands , building a large stick nest in trees , on buildings , or on purpose @-@ built man @-@ made platforms . Each nest is 1 – 2 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) in depth , 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 5 m ( 2 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 9 ft ) in diameter , and 60 – 250 kg ( 130 – 550 lb ) in weight . Nests are built in loose colonies . Not persecuted as it is viewed as a good omen , it often nests close to human habitation ; in southern Europe , nests can be seen on churches and other buildings . The nest is typically used year after year especially by older males . The males arrive earlier in the season and choose the nests . Larger nests are associated with greater numbers of young successfully fledged , and appear to be sought after . Nest change is often related to a change in the pairing and failure to raise young the previous year , and younger birds are more likely to change nesting sites . Although a pair may be found to occupy a nest , partners may change several times during the early stages and breeding activities begin only after a stable pairing is achieved . 
 Several bird species often nest within the large nests of the white stork . Regular occupants are house sparrows , tree sparrows , and common starlings ; less common residents include Eurasian kestrels , little owls , European rollers , white wagtails , black redstarts , Eurasian jackdaws , and Spanish sparrows . Paired birds greet by engaging in up @-@ down and head @-@ shaking crouch displays , and clattering the beak while throwing back the head . Pairs copulate frequently throughout the month before eggs are laid . High @-@ frequency pair copulation is usually associated with sperm competition and high frequency of extra @-@ pair copulation ; however , extra @-@ pair copulation is infrequent in white storks . 
 A white stork pair raises a single brood a year . The female typically lays four eggs , though clutches of one to seven have been recorded . The eggs are white , but often look dirty or yellowish due to a glutinous covering . They measure 72 @.@ 58 mm × 51 @.@ 86 mm ( 2 @.@ 857 in × 2 @.@ 042 in ) , and weigh 96 – 129 g ( 3 @.@ 4 – 4 @.@ 6 oz ) , of which 10 @.@ 76 g ( 0 @.@ 380 oz ) is shell . Incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid , so the brood hatches asynchronously , beginning 33 to 34 days later . The first hatchling typically has a competitive edge over the others . While stronger chicks are not aggressive towards weaker siblings , as is the case in some species , weak or small chicks are sometimes killed by their parents . This behaviour occurs in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings . White stork nestlings do not attack each other , and their parents ' method of feeding them ( disgorging large amounts of food at once ) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly , hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size . Despite this , this behaviour has not commonly been observed . 
 The temperature and weather around the time of hatching in spring is important ; cool temperatures and wet weather increase chick mortality and reduce breeding success rates . Somewhat unexpectedly , studies have found that later @-@ hatching chicks which successfully reach adulthood produce more chicks than do their earlier @-@ hatching nestmates . The body weight of the chicks increases rapidly in the first few weeks and reaches a plateau of about 3 @.@ 4 kg ( 7 @.@ 5 lb ) in 45 days . The length of the beak increases linearly for about 50 days . Young birds are fed with earthworms and insects , which are regurgitated by the parents onto the floor of the nest . Older chicks reach into the mouths of parents to obtain food . Chicks fledge 58 to 64 days after hatching . 
 White storks generally begin breeding when about four years old , although the age of first breeding has been recorded as early as two years and as late as seven years . The oldest known wild white stork lived for 39 years after being ringed in Switzerland , while captive birds have lived for more than 35 years . 
 = = Parasites and diseases = = 
 White stork nests are habitats for an array of small arthropods , particularly over the warmer months after the birds arrive to breed . Nesting over successive years , the storks bring more material to line their nests and layers of organic material accumulate within them . Not only do their bodies tend to regulate temperatures within the nest , but excrement , food remains and feather and skin fragments provide nourishment for a large and diverse population of free @-@ living <unk> mites . A survey of twelve nests found 13 @,@ 352 individuals of 34 species , the most common being <unk> <unk> , M. <unk> , <unk> pyriformis and <unk> orbicularis , which together represented almost 85 % of all the specimens collected . These feed on the eggs and larvae of insects and on nematodes , which are abundant in the nest litter . These mites are dispersed by coprophilous beetles , often of the family <unk> , or on dung brought by the storks during nest construction . Parasitic mites do not occur , perhaps being controlled by the predatory species . The overall impact of the mite population is unclear , the mites may have a role in suppressing harmful organisms ( and hence be beneficial ) , or they may themselves have an adverse effect on nestlings . 
 The birds themselves host species belonging to more than four genera of feather mites . These mites , including <unk> <unk> and <unk> didactylus live on fungi growing on the feathers . The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil . Chewing lice such as Colpocephalum zebra tend to be found on the wings , and <unk> <unk> elsewhere on the body . 
 The white stork also carries several types of internal parasites , including Toxoplasma gondii and intestinal parasites of the genus Giardia . A study of 120 white stork carcasses from Saxony @-@ Anhalt and Brandenburg in Germany yielded eight species of trematode ( fluke ) , four cestode ( tapeworm ) species , and at least three species of nematode . One species of fluke , <unk> ferox , caused lesions in the wall of the small intestine in a number of birds admitted to two rehabilitation centres in central Spain , and was associated with reduced weight . It is a recognised pathogen and cause of morbidity in the Asian <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) . More recently , the thorough study performed by J. <unk> and P. <unk> in the Czech Republic in 1962 – 2013 suggested that the central European white storks host 11 helminth species . <unk> ferox , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were reported to be the dominant ones . The other species found included <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> cornu , Capillaria sp. and <unk> <unk> . Juvenile white storks were shown to host less species , but the intensity of infection was higher in the juveniles than in the adult storks . 
 West Nile virus ( <unk> ) is mainly a bird infection that is transmitted between birds by mosquitos . Migrating birds appear to be important in spread of the virus , the ecology of which remains poorly known . On 26 August 1998 , a flock of about 1 @,@ 200 migrating white storks that had been blown off course on their southward journey landed in Eilat , in southern Israel . The flock was stressed as it had resorted to flapping flight to return to its migratory route , and a number of birds died . A virulent strain of West Nile virus was isolated from the brains of eleven dead juveniles . Other white storks subsequently tested in Israel have shown anti @-@ <unk> antibodies . In 2008 three juvenile white storks from a Polish wildlife refuge yielded seropositive results indicating exposure to the virus , but the context or existence of the virus in Poland is unclear . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The white stork 's decline due to industrialisation and agricultural changes ( principally the draining of wetlands and conversion of meadows to crops such as maize ) began in the 19th century : the last wild individual in Belgium was seen in 1895 , in Sweden in 1955 , in Switzerland in 1950 and in the Netherlands in 1991 . However , the species has since been reintroduced to many regions . It has been rated as least concern by the IUCN since 1994 , after being evaluated as near threatened in 1988 . The white stork is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) applies . Parties to the agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan . The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation , management of human activities , research , education , and implementation . Threats include the continued loss of wetlands , collisions with overhead power lines , use of persistent pesticides ( such as DDT ) to combat locusts in Africa , and largely illegal hunting on migration routes and wintering grounds . 
 A large population of white storks breeds in central ( Poland , Ukraine and Germany ) and southern Europe ( Spain and Turkey ) . In a 2004 / 05 census , there were 52 @,@ 500 pairs in Poland , 30 @,@ 000 pairs in Ukraine , 20 @,@ 000 pairs in Belarus , 13 @,@ 000 pairs in Lithuania ( the highest known density of this species in the world ) , 10 @,@ 700 pairs in Latvia , and 10 @,@ 200 in Russia . There were around 5 @,@ 500 pairs in Romania , 5 @,@ 300 in Hungary and an estimated 4 @,@ 956 breeding pairs in Bulgaria . In Germany , the majority of the total 4 @,@ 482 pairs were in the eastern region , especially in the states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 1296 and 863 pairs in 2008 respectively ) . Apart from Spain and Portugal ( 33 @,@ 217 and 7 @,@ 684 pairs in 2004 / 05 respectively ) , populations are generally much less stable . The Danish population declined to just three pairs in 2005 . In the eastern Mediterranean region Turkey has a sizeable population of <unk> pairs , and Greece <unk> pairs . In Western Europe the white stork remains a rare bird despite conservation efforts . In 2004 France had only 973 pairs , and the Netherlands 528 pairs . 
 In the early 1980s , the population had fallen to fewer than nine pairs in the entire upper Rhine River valley , an area closely identified with the white stork for centuries . Conservation efforts successfully increased the population of birds there to 270 pairs ( in 2008 ) , largely due to the actions of the Association for the Protection and Reintroduction of Storks in Alsace and Lorraine . The reintroduction of zoo @-@ reared birds has halted further declines in Italy , the Netherlands , and Switzerland . There were 601 pairs breeding in Armenia and around 700 pairs in the Netherlands in 2008 , and few pairs also breed in South Africa , typically recent colonists from within the normal wintering population . In Poland , electric poles have been modified with a platform at the top to prevent the white stork 's large nest from disrupting the electricity supply , and sometimes nests are moved from an electric pole to a man @-@ made platform . Introductions of zoo @-@ reared birds in the Netherlands has been followed up by feeding and nest @-@ building programs by volunteers . Similar reintroduction programs are taking place in Sweden , and Switzerland , where 175 pairs were recorded breeding in 2000 . Long term viability of the population in Switzerland is unclear as breeding success rates are low , and supplementary feeding does not appear to be of benefit .

 Due to its large size , predation on vermin , and nesting behaviour close to human settlements and on rooftops , the white stork has an imposing presence that has had an impact on human culture and folklore . In Ancient Egypt , it was associated with , and was the hieroglyph for , the Ba , or " soul " . The Hebrew word for the white stork is <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " merciful " or " kind " . Greek and Roman mythology portray storks as models of parental devotion , and it was believed that they did not die of old age , but flew to islands and took the appearance of humans . The bird is featured in at least three of Aesop 's Fables : The Fox and the Stork , The Farmer and the Stork , and The Frogs Who Desired a King . Storks were also thought to care for their aged parents , feeding them and even transporting them , and children 's books depicted them as a model of filial values . A Greek law called <unk> , from the Ancient Greek word <unk> for stork , required citizens to take care of their aged parents . The Greeks also held that killing a stork could be punished with death . It was allegedly protected in Ancient Thessaly as it hunted snakes , and widely held to be Virgil 's " white bird " . Roman writers noted the white stork 's arrival in spring , which alerted farmers to plant their vines . 
 Followers of Islam revered storks because they made an annual pilgrimage to Mecca on their migration . Some of the earliest understanding on bird migration were initiated by an interest in white storks ; <unk> ( " arrow storks " ) were found in Europe with African arrows embedded in their bodies . A well @-@ known example of such a stork found in the summer of 1822 in the German town of <unk> in Mecklenburg was made into a mounted taxidermy specimen , complete with the ornate African arrow , that is now in the University of Rostock . 
 Storks have little fear of humans if not disturbed , and often nest on buildings in Europe . In Germany , the presence of a nest on a house was believed to protect against fires . They were also protected because of the belief that their souls were human . German and Dutch households would encourage storks to nest on houses , sometimes by constructing purpose @-@ built high platforms , to bring good luck . Poles , Lithuanians and Ukrainians believe that storks bring harmony to a family on whose property they nest . 
 The white stork is a popular motif on postage stamps , and it is featured on more than 120 stamps issued by more than 60 stamp @-@ issuing entities . It is the national bird of Lithuania and Belarus , and it was a Polish mascot at the Expo 2000 Fair in Hanover . In the 19th century , storks were also thought to only live in countries having a republican form of government . Polish poet Cyprian Kamil Norwid mentioned storks in his poem Moja <unk> ( II ) ( " My Song ( II ) " ) : 
 For the land where it 's a great travesty 
 To harm a stork 's nest in a pear tree , 
 For storks serve us all ... 
 I am homesick , Lord ! ...

 According to European folklore , the stork is responsible for bringing babies to new parents . The legend is very ancient , but was popularised by a 19th @-@ century Hans Christian Andersen story called The Storks . German folklore held that storks found babies in caves or marshes and brought them to households in a basket on their backs or held in their beaks . These caves contained <unk> or " stork stones " . The babies would then be given to the mother or dropped down the chimney . Households would notify when they wanted children by placing sweets for the stork on the window sill . From there the folklore has spread around the world to countries such as the Philippines and South America . <unk> on the back of the head of newborn baby , nevus flammeus <unk> , are sometimes referred to as stork @-@ bite . 
 In Slavic mythology and religion , storks were thought to carry unborn souls from <unk> to Earth in spring and summer . This belief still persists in the modern folk culture of many Slavic countries , in the simplified child story that " storks bring children into the world " . Storks were seen by the Slavs as bringing luck , and killing one would bring misfortune . A long @-@ term study that showed a spurious correlation between the numbers of stork nests and human births is widely used in the teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation . The child @-@ bringing myth has appeared in different forms in history . Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks , while black babies were born from buzzard eggs . 
 Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need , in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children . Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost , and the stork may have been chosen for its white plumage ( depicting purity ) , size ( in that it is big enough to carry an infant ) , and flight at high altitude ( likened to flying between Earth and Heaven ) . The fable and its relation to the internal world of the child have been discussed by Sigmund Freud , and Carl Jung . In fact , Jung recalled being told the story himself upon the birth of his own sister . The traditional link with the newborn continues with their use in advertising for such products as nappies and birth announcements . 
 There were negative aspects to stork folklore as well ; a Polish folk tale relates how God made the stork 's plumage white , while the Devil gave it black wings , imbuing it with both good and evil impulses . They were also associated with handicapped or stillborn babies in Germany , explained as the stork having dropped the baby en route to the household , or as revenge or punishment for past wrongdoing . A mother who was confined to bed around the time of childbirth was said to have been " bitten " by the stork . In Denmark , storks were said to toss a nestling off the nest and then an egg in successive years . In medieval England , storks were also associated with adultery , possibly inspired by their courtship rituals . Their preening and posture saw them linked with the attribute of self @-@ conceit .

 = The Beatles in Hamburg = 
 The Beatles members John Lennon , Paul McCartney , George Harrison , Stuart Sutcliffe and Pete Best regularly performed at different clubs in Hamburg , Northern Germany , during the period from August 1960 to December 1962 ; a chapter in the group 's history which honed their performance skills , widened their reputation , and led to their first recording , which brought them to the attention of Brian Epstein . 
 The Beatles ' booking agent , Allan Williams , decided to send the group to Hamburg when another group he managed , Derry and the Seniors , proved successful there . Having no permanent drummer at the time , they recruited Best a few days before their departure . After breaking their contract by playing at another club , Harrison was deported for being under @-@ age , and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson ( after McCartney and Best had set fire to a condom in their living quarters ) . 
 The Beatles first met Astrid Kirchherr in Hamburg , who was instrumental in their adoption of the famous Beatle haircut . During their time in Hamburg , Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue his studies . In April 1962 , less than a year after leaving the group , he died of a brain hemorrhage . 
 = = Hamburg in the 1960s = = 
 Hamburg had once been Germany 's main seaport , the fourth largest in the world , but in 1943 virtually the entire city had been reduced to rubble by World War II bombing raids . By 1960 , when they arrived , the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established its reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity . In contrast to an economically depressed post @-@ war Liverpool , Hamburg was a wealthy city . 
 = = = Leaving Liverpool = = = 
 Williams , a 29 @-@ year @-@ old Liverpool businessman and promoter , had sent his leading group , Derry and the Seniors ( later known as Howie Casey and the Seniors ) to Hamburg , where they were enjoying success , and wanted to send an additional group . He initially tried to send Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , but Storm and his group were committed to a Butlins holiday camp and turned Williams ' offer down , as did Gerry and the Pacemakers . Williams started promoting concerts for The Beatles in May 1960 , after they had played at his Jacaranda club in Liverpool , and offered The Beatles the Hamburg bookings . He booked them into Bruno Koschmider 's Indra club in Hamburg for a season of bookings starting on 12 August 1960 , but said that he was not impressed with them as a musical group , and hoped to find a better act to follow them . 
 As they had no permanent drummer , McCartney looked for someone to fill the Hamburg position , which was difficult , as Lennon later said that drummers were " few and far between " , because a set of drums was an expensive item . Harrison had seen Best playing with the Black Jacks in The Casbah Coffee Club ( which was run by his mother , Mona Best ) . He was regarded as a steady drummer , playing the bass drum on all four beats in the bar , which pushed the rhythm , and was known in Liverpool at the time as being " mean , moody , and magnificent " by female fans , which convinced McCartney he would be good for the group . After the Black Jacks broke up , McCartney asked Best to go to Hamburg , telling him they would earn £ 15 per week each . Best had the chance to go to a teacher @-@ training college , as he had passed his school exams — unlike Lennon , McCartney and Harrison , who had failed most of theirs — but decided that playing in Hamburg would be a better career move . 
 The St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg , where the Indra club was located , was well known as an area where prostitutes were to be found , and was a dangerous place for anyone that looked different from the usual clientele . McCartney 's father , Jim McCartney , was reluctant to let his teenage son go to Hamburg , but relented after a visit from Williams , who told him that he " shouldn 't worry " . Lennon 's aunt , Mimi Smith , was also reluctant to allow Lennon to go to Hamburg , wanting Lennon to continue his studies , but Lennon placated her by exaggerating the amount he would earn . Best had an audition in Williams ' Jacaranda club on 15 August 1960 , and travelled to Hamburg the next day as a member of the group . Williams later admitted that the audition with Best was not needed , as they had not found any other drummer willing to travel to Hamburg , but did not tell Best in case he asked for more money . The group were to be paid about £ 100 per week , which was much more than promoters in Liverpool paid . Williams drove the group and their equipment in his Austin J4 minibus which was loaded by crane onto a ferry at Harwich on 16 August 1960 , and landed at the Hook of Holland . 
 All five Beatles , Williams and his wife Beryl , her brother Barry Chang , and " Lord Woodbine " were in the minivan , along with Georg Sterner ( Koschmider 's translator and future waiter ) , making a total of ten people , which resulted in a journey that was both uncomfortable and dangerous . As Williams had not obtained work permits for West Germany , they were detained at Harwich for five hours . Williams finally convinced the authorities that they were students on holiday , although work permits were later obtained after their arrival in Hamburg . Note : ' Lord Woodbine ' and Williams ran a Strip Club called New Cabaret Artistes club at <unk> Upper Parliament Street , Liverpool . Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Sutcliffe once played backing music for " Janice the Stripper " there , in July 1960 . 
 = = Hamburg clubs = = 
 In the early 1960s , the Hamburg scene revolved around the Kaiserkeller , Top Ten , Star @-@ Club , Beer @-@ Shop , Mambo , Holle , <unk> ( pronounced vagabond in German ) and the Pacific Hotel , as well as the less popular clubs like <unk> , the Ice Cream Shop , <unk> , and Sacha 's . The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights , with posters advertising the performers in the clubs . Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside , as the drinks were expensive ( for Babycham and watered @-@ down beer ) . Customers who would not , or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out . 
 = = = The Indra and Kaiserkeller = = = 
 The Beatles arrived very early in the morning of 17 August 1960 , but had no trouble finding the St. Pauli area of Hamburg , as it was so infamous . Unfortunately the Indra Club ( 64 Grosse Freiheit ) was closed , so a manager from a neighbouring club found someone to open it up , and the group slept on the red leather seats in the alcoves . The group played at the club on the same night , but were told they could sleep in a small cinema 's storeroom , which was cold and in very poor condition , the Bambi Kino ( 33 Paul @-@ Roosen Strasse ) . 
 McCartney later said , " We lived backstage in the Bambi Kino , next to the toilets , and you could always smell them . The room had been an old storeroom , and there were just concrete walls and nothing else . No heat , no wallpaper , not a lick of paint ; and two sets of bunk beds , with not very much covers — Union Jack flags — we were frozen . " Lennon remembered : " We were put in this pigsty . We were living in a toilet , like right next to the ladies ' toilet . We 'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German <unk> [ women ] pissing next door . " After having been awoken in this fashion , the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving . They were paid £ 2 @.@ 50 each a day , seven days a week , playing from 8 : 30 @-@ 9 : 30 , 10 until 11 , 11 : 30 @-@ 12 : 30 , and finishing the evening playing from one until two o 'clock in the morning . German customers found the group 's name comical , as " Beatles " sounded like " <unk> " , which meant a small boy 's penis . 
 Harrison remembered the Reeperbahn and Grosse Freiheit as the best thing the group had ever seen , as it had so many neon lights , clubs and restaurants , although also saying , " The whole area was full of transvestites and prostitutes and gangsters , but I couldn 't say that they were the audience ... Hamburg was really like our apprenticeship , learning how to play in front of people . " Best remembered the Indra as being a depressing place that was filled with a few tourists , and having heavy , old , red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller , a club also owned by Koschmider and located nearby at 36 Grosse Freiheit . After the closure of the Indra because of complaints about the noise , the Beatles played in the Kaiserkeller , starting on 4 October 1960 . 
 = = = = Performances = = = = 
 Their playing schedule at the Kaiserkeller remained the same as it had been in the Indra . Lennon said : " We had to play for hours and hours on end . Every song lasted twenty minutes and had twenty solos in it . That 's what improved the playing . There was nobody to copy from . We played what we liked best and the Germans liked it as long as it was loud . " The Beatles had been used to simply standing still when they had performed in Liverpool , but Koschmider would come to the front of the stage and loudly shout “ Mach <unk> , mach <unk> ! ” ( " make [ a ] show " or , more idiomatically , " put on a show " for the customers ) . Harrison explained that this prompted Lennon to “ dance around like a gorilla , and we ’ d all knock our heads together . ” As Best had been the only one to take O @-@ Level German at school , he could communicate with Koschmider and the clientele better than the rest of the group , and was invited to sing a speciality number called " Peppermint Twist " ( while McCartney played the drums ) but Best complained that he always felt uncomfortable being at the front of the stage . Willie <unk> , Koschmider 's business manager , decided that the club would attract more customers if it presented continuous live music . 
 Williams warned the Beatles about the competition they would face by playing in the same club as the Hurricanes by saying , " You 'd better pull your socks up because Rory Storm and the Hurricanes are coming in , and you know how good they are . They 're going to knock you for six . " In early October 1960 , Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg , replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller . They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960 , having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles . They played five or six 90 @-@ minute sets every day , alternating with the Beatles . They were appalled at the living conditions the Beatles and other groups like Howie Casey and the Seniors ( who were sleeping in one room at the back of the Kaiserkeller ) had to put up with , so they booked into Hamburg 's <unk> ' Mission . 
 = = = = Violence and conflict = = = = 
 The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates , so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it . After punishing the stage for days , a slight crack appeared , and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke . Johnny ' Guitar ' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage , it cracked loudly and formed a V @-@ shape around him . He disappeared into it , and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr 's cymbals slid into the hole . Koschmider was furious , and had to replace the live music with a juke box . Both groups went across the road to Harold 's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit , but were followed by Koschmider 's doormen , armed with <unk> , who beat them all as punishment . 
 Horst Fascher ( born 1936 , Hamburg ) was Koschmider 's nightclub bouncer , who had been the 1959 West German featherweight boxing champion , but his career was cut short after he unintentionally killed a sailor in a street fight . He later became a friend of the Beatles , and protected them from drunken customers . Lennon occasionally urinated out of his apartment ’ s window onto the street below , and often started arguments with the audience , so that eventually one member of the audience would jump on stage to hit him , but it was Fascher ’ s job to protect Lennon and the group . In some occasions beer bottles were thrown at them . Fascher remembered Lennon often greeting the audience with a " Heil Hitler " , and a Nazi salute : " He 'd pull out a black comb and pretend it was a moustache ... people laughed . " 
 Lennon was missing for a performance one evening , and Fascher found him in the toilet with a woman . He broke up the tête @-@ à @-@ tête with a bucket of cold water which he threw over them both , and ordered Lennon onto the stage . Lennon was furious , and complained that he could not go on stage dripping wet . Fascher snapped back : " I don 't give a shit , you 're going onstage and I don 't care if you do it naked . " A short time later the audience was roaring with laughter . Fascher ran to see what the commotion was , and saw Lennon playing guitar , but only wearing underpants with a toilet seat around his neck . ( Epstein later asked Liverpool journalist Bill Harry not to publish photos showing Lennon walking along the Reeperbahn in his underpants ) . Fascher 's brother , Fred sang lead vocals with the group on " Be Bop A Lula " , while he sang with them on " Hallelujah I Love Her So " , and his alliance with the Beatles continued , as he later went to work at the Star @-@ Club . 
 = = = = Performance skills = = = = 
 According to McCartney , Sutcliffe was a " typical art student " , with bad skin and pimples , but his reputation grew after he began wearing tight trousers and dark Ray @-@ Ban sunglasses . Sutcliffe 's high spot was singing " Love Me Tender " , which drew more applause than when the other Beatles sang , increasing the friction between himself and McCartney . Lennon also started to criticise Sutcliffe ; making jokes about Sutcliffe 's size and playing . While Sutcliffe is often described in Beatles ' biographies as appearing very uncomfortable onstage , and often playing with his back to the audience , Best denies this , recalling Sutcliffe as usually good @-@ natured and " animated " before an audience . 
 The Beatles steadily improved during their time in Hamburg , and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time . McCartney recalled , " We got better and better and other groups started coming to watch us . The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would come in from the Top Ten ( the big club where we aspired to go ) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [ Starr ] would hang around to watch us . ‘ What 'd I Say ’ was always the one that really got them . " The song was often played by the group , once being played for 90 minutes non @-@ stop , with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning . Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying , " We have improved a thousand @-@ fold since our arrival and Allan Williams , who is here at the moment , tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us . " 
 On Saturday 18 October 1960 , Williams arranged a recording session for Lou Walters ( of the Hurricanes ) at the <unk> Studio , a small booth on the fifth floor of 57 <unk> ( The <unk> @-@ House ) . Williams asked Lennon , McCartney , and Harrison to play and sing harmonies on the recording . Best was in town buying drumsticks , so Starr , the Hurricanes ' drummer , played drums . This was the first time Lennon , McCartney , Harrison and Starr recorded together . They recorded three songs : " Fever " , " September Song " and " Summertime " . 
 = = = The Top Ten = = = 
 Formerly the Hippodrome ( Reeperbahn 136 ) , the Top Ten club was opened in 1960 by Peter Eckhorn , and was operated by Iain Hines , who was an organist . In late October 1960 , The Beatles left Koschmider 's club to work at the Top Ten Club , as Eckhorn offered the group more money , a better PA ( with reverb and echo ) and a slightly better place to sleep ( above the club itself ) although by doing so the group broke their contract with Koschmider . Koschmider then reported Harrison for working under the legal age limit ( even though he had been working at Koschmider 's club ) and Harrison was deported on 21 November 1960 . When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to get their belongings they found it in almost total darkness . As a snub to Koschmider , McCartney and Best found a condom in their luggage , attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room , and set fire to it . There was no real damage done , but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson . McCartney : " One evening we were just walking down the Reeperbahn , when we heard this ' ta @-@ ti @-@ ti @-@ ta ' , and then ' Komm mit mir ! ' ( ' Come with me ! ' ) " . Best and McCartney spent three hours in the <unk> Police Station , and were deported on 1 December 1960 . Lennon 's work permit was revoked a few days later and he went home by train , but as Sutcliffe had a cold , he stayed in Hamburg . Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr ( his German girlfriend ) for the airfare back to Liverpool in early January 1961 . Back in Liverpool , no one contacted each other for two weeks , but Best and his mother made numerous phone calls to Hamburg to recover the group 's equipment . 
 Back in Liverpool , the group played an engagement on 17 December 1960 , at the Casbah Coffee Club , with Chas Newby substituting for Sutcliffe , playing bass with them for four shows . Newby was shocked at the vast improvement of their playing and singing after the residency in Hamburg , and was struck by how powerful Best 's drumming now was , pushing the group to play harder and louder . ( It was probably due to McCartney that Best developed a loud drumming style , as he would often tell Best in Hamburg to " Crank it up " = play as loud as possible ) . 
 After Harrison turned 18 and the immigration problems had been solved , the Beatles went back to Hamburg for another residency at the Top Ten Club , playing from 27 March to 2 July 1961 . To secure their return , Eckhorn paid DM 158 to the German authorities , which was the cost of deporting McCartney and Best back to Liverpool the previous winter . Fellow musician , Tony Sheridan , later remembered the living conditions at the club : “ John , George , Paul , Stuart and Pete and I were booked to open the smart Top Ten in the Reeperbahn . We moved into a dormitory over the club and slept in bunks . It was terrible really , now I look back . We all washed our own shirts and socks so the place smelt like a Chinese laundry . But we had great times and I ’ m afraid we used to tease the life out of the old lady who [ took care of ] us . ” 
 Sutcliffe decided to leave the Beatles to concentrate on his art studies and to be with Kirchherr , so McCartney ( unwillingly ) took over as bass player for the group . Sutcliffe later enrolled at the Hamburg College of Art under the tutelage of the pop artist Eduardo Paolozzi . Sutcliffe lent McCartney his Höfner President 500 / 5 model bass guitar but asked McCartney not to change the strings around , so McCartney had to play it with the strings arranged backwards , until he could buy a specially made left @-@ handed Höfner bass of his own . McCartney bought his first Höfner Violin bass guitar ( model 500 / 1 ) from the Steinway @-@ Haus Music Store ( <unk> 29 ) Lennon bought a Rickenbacker guitar ( 1958 Model 325 ) and Harrison bought a Gibson amplifier . 
 The matching lilac jackets , made by McCartney 's next @-@ door neighbour in Liverpool to be worn as stage clothes , were soon threadbare , as were any other items of clothing , so the group bought cowboy boots , jeans and black leather jackets and trousers , from Paul <unk> 's ( <unk> 9 ) and a tailor 's shop at <unk> 6 . Lennon said : " We had a bit more money the second time so we bought leather pants ... we looked like four Gene Vincents . 
 = = = The Star @-@ Club = = = 
 On 13 April 1962 , the Beatles were booked as the opening act for the launch of a new club . The Star @-@ Club , opened by Manfred <unk> , had a capacity for two thousand people , as well as cinema @-@ style seating . When the Beatles were booked to play there , Neil Aspinall left his job to become the Beatles ' permanent road manager , as he was earning more money driving them around than he was earning by being an accountant , and had his van ferried to Hamburg . The Beatles returned to Hamburg by plane to play from 13 April to 31 May 1962 . Upon their arrival , they were informed of Sutcliffe 's death . 
 By the time of their second Star @-@ Club visit from 1 – 14 November 1962 , Starr had become the group 's drummer . The Beatles stayed at the Hotel Germania ( Detlev @-@ Bremer @-@ Strasse 8 ) , having the luxury of single rooms for the first time , and then stayed at the Hotel Pacific ( Neuer <unk> 30 ) for another booking from 18 – 31 December 1962 . Harrison said : " We came back to play the Star @-@ Club , a big place and fantastic because it had a great sound system . This time we had a hotel . I remember it was quite a long walk from the club , at the top of the Reeperbahn going back towards the city . " Portions of their final performances were taped with a portable recorder by an associate of Ted " King Size " Taylor of the Dominoes , another group playing at the club . The tapes were released on West Germany 's Bellaphon label in 1977 as The Beatles : Live ! at the Star @-@ Club in Hamburg , Germany ; 1962 , and subsequently re @-@ released in various formats and titles .

 = = = Sex , drugs and rock and roll = = = 
 McCartney explained that the Beatles had only experienced sex with girls from Liverpool , but when they got to Hamburg the only women who hung around the clubs late at night were strippers , dancers , or prostitutes . Harrison ( who was then only 17 ) called Hamburg , “ The naughtiest city in the world ” . McCartney said : “ By the time you got to Hamburg , a girlfriend there was likely to be a stripper , so to be suddenly involved with a hard @-@ core striptease artist , who obviously knew a thing or two about sex ... it was quite an eye @-@ opener . ” Gerry Marsden — frontman for Gerry & the Pacemakers — remembered visiting a Hamburg brothel in <unk> with Lennon : " We paid our money , went in and sat down . This guy came out with the biggest lady we had ever seen in our lives . She looked like a bus with a bra on . We ran out that door so quick we didn 't hear it shut . I wanted to go back to get my money back but John said : ' No , we 'd better not . Might cause trouble . ' " 
 The Beatles 's introduction to " <unk> " ( Preludin ) was in Hamburg . As the group had to play for hours , Sheridan offered them Preludin , saying : " Here 's something to keep you awake . " Astrid Kirchherr also supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with Preludin , which when taken with beer , made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until the early hours of the morning . Looking back , Harrison said that the whole group would be “ frothing at the mouth , ” and would sometimes stay awake for days . Lennon recalled , “ The waiters always had these pills [ Preludin ] , so when they saw the musicians falling over with tiredness or drink , they ’ d give you the pill . You could work almost endlessly until the pill wore off , and then you ’ d have another . ” McCartney said that he would usually take one , but Lennon would often take four or five . 
 Legitimate use of Preludin required a doctor 's prescription note , but Kirchherr 's mother was able to obtain it from a local chemist which supplied the drug without asking questions . Epstein later asked the Star @-@ Club owner , <unk> , not to publish photographs showing the group playing with tubes of Preludin . Starr explained that Dexedrine too was in plentiful supply in Hamburg , as it was known to produce increased wakefulness and focus , in association with decreased fatigue , and decreased appetite . 
 = = Record release = = 
 The first recording ever released was the single " My Bonnie " , which was recorded in Hamburg during the group 's time at the Top Ten club . The recording came about when the Beatles were recruited by singer Sheridan , who also had a residency at the Top Ten club , to act as his backing group on a series of recordings . The recordings were made for the German Polydor Records label , and were produced by the famed bandleader Bert Kaempfert , who had an instrumental hit called " Wonderland by Night " ( " Wunderland bei Nacht " ) which reached number one in the U.S. in 1961 , the same year he produced " My Bonnie " . On 22 June 1961 , Sheridan and the Beatles drove to Hamburg @-@ Harburg ( about 30 minutes from Hamburg ) to record in the Friedrich @-@ Ebert @-@ Halle ( auditorium / hall ) and were paid 330 <unk> ( about $ 75 ) for the recording , although there was a second recording session on 23 June and a third session in May 1962 . Kaempfert signed the group to a one @-@ year Polydor contract at the first session on 22 June 1961 . 
 On 31 October 1961 , Polydor released " My Bonnie " ( Mein Herz ist bei dir nur ) which appeared on the West German charts under the name " Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers " — a generic name used for whoever happened to be in Sheridan 's backup group , although McCartney explained : " They didn 't like our name and said , ' Change to the Beat Brothers , this is more understandable for the German audience . ' We went along with it ... it was a record . " The song was later released in the UK , on 5 January 1962 . A few copies were also pressed under the American Decca Records label . 
 = = = Brian Epstein = = = 
 " My Bonnie " was to bring the Beatles to the attention of a key figure in their subsequent development and commercial success , Brian Epstein . In September 1961 , Harrison had a German copy of the record , which Sutcliffe had sent to him , as he was still in Hamburg . Harrison loaned it to Bob Wooler ( The Cavern Club DJ ) who played it at various venues , when the members of the group lent it to him . On 28 October 1961 , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Epstein , manager of the record department in his father 's NEMS music store in Whitechapel Street , Liverpool , was asked for the record by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , Raymond Jones . Epstein could find nothing on his files about the Beatles or the record , but the following day it was requested again by two girls , this time mentioning that the Beatles had been seen playing at the Cavern , a club in nearby Mathew Street . Alistair Taylor ( Epstein 's assistant ) later said that the story had been invented and that he had used the name Jones to order copies of the record himself . 
 Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated the story about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were , as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the band for a long time ( being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat ) and by McCartney saying , “ Brian [ Epstein ] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were , they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat . ” Regardless , the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor , during lunch hour on 9 November 1961 . He was initially repelled by the dark , damp club , but he congratulated them on their performance . 
 = = Astrid Kirchherr , Voormann , and Vollmer = = 
 Kirchherr , Klaus Voormann , and Jürgen Vollmer were early fans of the Beatles after they heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller . Kirchherr , Voormann 's girlfriend , was initially horrified at the idea of spending any time in such a sordid district , but Voormann , after watching the Beatles several times without her , eventually persuaded her to come too . After having previously only listened to Trad jazz , the Platters , and Nat King Cole , the Rock n ' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them . The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night , arriving at 9 o 'clock and sitting by the front of the stage . Kirchherr , then 22 years old , later said : " It was like a merry @-@ go @-@ round in my head , they looked absolutely astonishing ... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes . All I wanted was to be with them and to know them . " Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr , and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in , every head would immediately turn her way . Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club , and tried to talk to her during the next break , but she had already left . 
 Kirchherr asked the Beatles if they would mind letting her take photographs of them in a photo session , which impressed them , as other groups only had snapshots that were taken by friends . The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in a fairground park called " Der Dom " which was close to the Reeperbahn . Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe , and they were engaged in November 1960 . 
 Kirchherr is credited with inventing the Beatles ' moptop haircut , although she personally disagrees . In 1995 , she told BBC Radio Merseyside : " All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles ' haircut , and my boyfriend then , Klaus Voormann , had this hairstyle , and Stuart [ Sutcliffe ] liked it very very much . He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the Brylcreem out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him . Pete [ Best ] has really curly hair and it wouldn 't work . " After suffering blackouts and intense headaches , Sutcliffe was taken to a hospital on 10 April 1962 — Kirchherr rode with him in the ambulance — but died before the ambulance reached the hospital . Three days later Kirchherr met the Beatles at the Hamburg airport and told them Sutcliffe had died of a brain haemorrhage . 
 In 1966 , Voormann was asked by Lennon to design the sleeve for the Beatles ' album Revolver , and also played bass on solo recordings by Lennon , McCartney , Harrison , and Starr .

 The Beatles returned to Hamburg in June 1966 , staying at the <unk> castle ( <unk> 10 ) , and played two concerts in the Ernst @-@ Merck @-@ Halle on 26 and 27 June .

Lennon made the door of Jäger @-@ Passage at <unk> 22 famous when he posed in front of it for a photo which was later used on the covers of the Rock ' n ' Roll and Rock ' n ' Roll Sessions albums . The photo was taken by Jürgen Vollmer , during the time The Beatles were playing at the Top Ten club . 
 Individual Beatles later commented about their memories of Hamburg , with Lennon reflecting , " We 'd outlived the Hamburg stage and wanted to pack that up . We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times . We 'd had that scene . Brian [ Epstein ] made us go back to fulfill the contract ... " . Harrison had positive memories of the period : " I 'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times . We didn 't have any luxury , we didn 't have any bathrooms or any clothes , we were pretty grubby , we couldn 't afford anything , but on the other hand we weren 't yet famous , so we didn 't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame . " McCartney was philosophical : " Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory . But I think all things are enhanced by time . It was very exciting , though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career , once we 'd started to get a bit of success with the records . " 
 A memorial square , Beatles @-@ Platz , was constructed in Hamburg in 2008 at the meeting of Reeperbahn and Große Freiheit streets , containing five stainless steel sculptures of the Beatles . Construction costs amounted to € 550 @,@ 000 ( $ 776 @,@ 000 ) , of which € 200 @,@ 000 was provided by sponsors and donors . The idea of creating a memorial to the Beatles had been initiated in 2001 by Hamburg radio station Oldie 95 .

 = Boron = 
 Boron is a metalloid chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5 . Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis , it is a low @-@ abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth 's crust . Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water @-@ solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds , the borate minerals . These are mined industrially as evaporites , such as borax and <unk> . The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey , the largest producer of boron minerals . 
 Chemically uncombined boron is found in small amounts in meteoroids but is not found naturally on Earth . <unk> , very pure boron is produced with difficulty because of refractory contamination by carbon or other elements . Several allotropes of boron exist : amorphous boron is a brown powder ; crystalline boron is silvery to black , extremely hard ( about 9 @.@ 5 on the Mohs scale ) , and a poor electrical conductor at room temperature . The primary use of elemental boron is as boron filaments with applications similar to carbon fibers in some high @-@ strength materials . 
 Boron is primarily used in chemical compounds . About half of all consumption globally , boron is used as an additive in glass fibers of boron @-@ containing fiberglass for insulation and structural materials . The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high @-@ strength , lightweight structural and refractory materials . Borosilicate glass glassware is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass . Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium <unk> bleaches . A small amount of boron is used as a dopant in semiconductors , and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals . A few boron @-@ containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study . Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes , one of which ( boron @-@ 10 ) has a number of uses as a neutron @-@ capturing agent . 
 In biology , borates have low toxicity in mammals ( similar to table salt ) , but are more toxic to arthropods and are used as insecticides . Boric acid is mildly antimicrobial , and a natural boron @-@ containing organic antibiotic is known . Boron is essential to life . Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the cell walls of all plants , making boron a necessary plant nutrient . Boron is involved in the metabolism of calcium in both plants and animals . It is considered an essential nutrient for humans , and boron deficiency is implicated in osteoporosis . 
 = = History = = 
 The word boron was coined from borax , the mineral from which it was isolated , by analogy with carbon , which boron resembles chemically . 
 Borax , its mineral form then known as <unk> , glazes were used in China from AD 300 , and some crude borax reached the West , where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn <unk> apparently mentioned it in AD 700 . Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century . Agricola , around 1600 , reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy . In 1777 , boric acid was recognized in the hot springs ( <unk> ) near Florence , Italy , and became known as sal <unk> , with primarily medical uses . The rare mineral is called <unk> , which is found at Sasso , Italy . Sasso was the main source of European borax from 1827 to 1872 , when American sources replaced it . Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith 's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost . 
 Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir Humphry Davy and by Joseph Louis Gay @-@ Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard . In 1808 Davy observed that electric current sent through a solution of borates produced a brown precipitate on one of the electrodes . In his subsequent experiments , he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of electrolysis . He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element <unk> . Gay @-@ Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures . By oxidizing boron with air , they showed that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron . Jöns Jakob Berzelius identified boron as an element in 1824 . Pure boron was arguably first produced by the American chemist Ezekiel Weintraub in 1909 . 
 = = Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory = = 
 The earliest routes to elemental boron involved the reduction of boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium . However , the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals . Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures . <unk> boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of diborane at high temperatures and then further purified with the zone melting or Czochralski processes . 
 The production of boron compounds does not involve the formation of elemental boron , but exploits the convenient availability of borates .

 = = = Allotropes = = = 
 Boron is similar to carbon in its capability to form stable covalently bonded molecular networks . Even nominally disordered ( amorphous ) boron contains regular boron icosahedra which are , however , bonded randomly to each other without long @-@ range order . Crystalline boron is a very hard , black material with a melting point of above 2000 ° C. It forms four major polymorphs : α @-@ rhombohedral and β @-@ rhombohedral ( α @-@ R and β @-@ R ) , γ and β @-@ tetragonal ( β @-@ T ) ; α @-@ tetragonal phase also exists ( α @-@ T ) , but is very difficult to produce without significant contamination . Whereas α , β and T phases are based on B12 icosahedra , the γ @-@ phase can be described as a rocksalt @-@ type arrangement of the icosahedra and B2 atomic pairs . It can be produced by compressing other boron phases to 12 – 20 GPa and heating to 1500 – 1800 ° C ; it remains stable after releasing the temperature and pressure . The T phase is produced at similar pressures , but higher temperatures of 1800 – 2200 ° C. As to the α and β phases , they might both coexist at ambient conditions with the β phase being more stable . <unk> boron above 160 GPa produces a boron phase with an as yet unknown structure , and this phase is a superconductor at temperatures 6 – 12 K. <unk> ( fullerene @-@ like <unk> ) molecules ) and <unk> ( proposed graphene @-@ like structure ) have been described in 2014 . 
 = = = Chemistry of the element = = = 
 Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the pure material is extremely difficult to prepare . Most studies of " boron " involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon . The chemical behavior of boron resembles that of silicon more than aluminium . Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid . When finely divided , it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated hydrogen peroxide , hot concentrated nitric acid , hot sulfuric acid or hot mixture of sulfuric and chromic acids . 
 The rate of oxidation of boron depends on the <unk> , particle size , purity and temperature . Boron does not react with air at room temperature , but at higher temperatures it burns to form boron trioxide : 
 4 B + 3 O2 → 2 B2O3 
 Boron undergoes <unk> to give trihalides ; for example , 
 2 B + 3 Br2 → 2 BBr3 
 The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide . 
 = = = = Chemical compounds = = = = 
 In the most familiar compounds , boron has the formal oxidation state III . These include oxides , sulfides , nitrides , and halides . 
 The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure . These compounds are Lewis acids in that they readily form adducts with electron @-@ pair donors , which are called Lewis bases . For example , fluoride ( F − ) and boron trifluoride ( BF3 ) combined to give the tetrafluoroborate anion , BF4 − . Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst . The halides react with water to form boric acid . 
 Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B ( III ) , often associated with other elements . More than one hundred borate minerals contain boron in oxidation state + 3 . These minerals resemble silicates in some respect , although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen , but also in a trigonal planar configuration . Unlike silicates , the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four . A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral borax , shown at left . The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate center is balanced by metal cations in the minerals , such as the sodium ( Na + ) in borax . 
 <unk> are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen , with the generic formula of <unk> . These compounds do not occur in nature . Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air , some violently . The parent member BH3 is called borane , but it is known only in the gaseous state , and <unk> to form diborane , B2H6 . The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral , some of which exist as isomers . For example , isomers of <unk> are based on the fusion of two 10 @-@ atom clusters . 
 The most important boranes are diborane B2H6 and two of its pyrolysis products , <unk> <unk> and decaborane B10H14 . A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known , e.g. [ <unk> ] 2 − . 
 The formal oxidation number in boranes is positive , and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as − 1 as in active metal hydrides . The mean oxidation number for the <unk> is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule . For example , in diborane B2H6 , the boron oxidation state is + 3 , but in decaborane B10H14 , it is 7 / 5 or + 1 @.@ 4 . In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number . 
 The boron nitrides are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt . They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon , including graphite , diamond , and nanotubes . In the diamond @-@ like structure , called cubic boron nitride ( tradename Borazon ) , boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond , but one in every four B @-@ N bonds can be viewed as a coordinate covalent bond , wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron ( III ) centre . Cubic boron nitride , among other applications , is used as an abrasive , as it has a hardness comparable with diamond ( the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other ) . In the BN compound analogue of graphite , hexagonal boron nitride ( h @-@ BN ) , the positively charged boron and negatively charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane . Consequently , graphite and h @-@ BN have very different properties , although both are lubricants , as these planes slip past each other easily . However , h @-@ BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions . 
 = = = = = Organoboron chemistry = = = = = 
 A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in organic synthesis . Many are produced from <unk> , which employs diborane , B2H6 , a simple borane chemical . Organoboron ( III ) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar , for example , tetraphenylborate , [ B ( C6H5 ) 4 ] − vs. <unk> , B ( C6H5 ) 3 . However , multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral ( 12 @-@ sided ) and icosahedral ( 20 @-@ sided ) structures composed completely of boron atoms , or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms . 
 Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as boron carbide ( see below ) , a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron @-@ carbon cluster anions and cations , to carboranes , carbon @-@ boron cluster chemistry compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including <unk> acid , a <unk> . As one example , carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron @-@ containing compounds for boron neutron capture therapy for cancer . 
 = = = = = Compounds of B ( I ) and B ( II ) = = = = = 
 Although these are not found on Earth naturally , boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three . As for many covalent compounds , formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides . The halides also form derivatives of B ( I ) and B ( II ) . BF , isoelectronic with N2 , cannot be isolated in condensed form , but <unk> and <unk> are well characterized . 
 Binary metal @-@ boron compounds , the metal borides , contain boron in negative oxidation states . Illustrative is magnesium diboride ( <unk> ) . Each boron atom has a formal − 1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of + 2 . In this material , the boron centers are trigonal planar with an extra double bond for each boron , forming sheets akin to the carbon in graphite . However , unlike hexagonal boron nitride , which lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms , the delocalized electrons in magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite . In 2001 , this material was found to be a high @-@ temperature superconductor . 
 Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools . Often the boron in borides has fractional oxidation states , such as − 1 / 3 in calcium hexaboride ( <unk> ) . 
 From the structural perspective , the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides . Included in this series are the cluster compounds <unk> ( <unk> − ) , decaborane ( B10H14 ) , and the carboranes such as <unk> . Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Boron has two naturally occurring and stable isotopes , 11B ( 80 @.@ 1 % ) and 10B ( 19 @.@ 9 % ) . The mass difference results in a wide range of <unk> values , which are defined as a fractional difference between the 11B and 10B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand , in natural waters ranging from − 16 to + 59 . There are 13 known isotopes of boron , the shortest @-@ lived isotope is 7B which decays through proton emission and alpha decay . It has a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 5 × 10 − 22 s . Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B ( OH ) 3 and [ B ( OH ) 4 ] − . Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization , during H2O phase changes in hydrothermal systems , and during hydrothermal alteration of rock . The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [ 10B ( OH ) 4 ] − ion onto clays . It results in solutions enriched in 11B ( OH ) 3 and therefore may be responsible for the large 11B enrichment in seawater relative to both oceanic crust and continental crust ; this difference may act as an isotopic signature . 
 The exotic 17B exhibits a nuclear halo , i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model . 
 The 10B isotope is useful for capturing thermal neutrons ( see neutron cross section # Typical cross sections ) . The nuclear industry enriches natural boron to nearly pure 10B . The less @-@ valuable by @-@ product , depleted boron , is nearly pure 11B . 
 = = = = Commercial isotope enrichment = = = = 
 Because of its high neutron cross @-@ section , boron @-@ 10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron @-@ capturing substance . Several industrial @-@ scale enrichment processes have been developed ; however , only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride ( DME @-@ BF3 ) and column chromatography of borates are being used . 
 = = = = Enriched boron ( boron @-@ 10 ) = = = = 
 Enriched boron or 10B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in neutron capture therapy of cancer . In the latter ( " boron neutron capture therapy " or <unk> ) , a compound containing 10B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it . The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose . The neutrons , however , trigger energetic and short @-@ range secondary alpha particle and lithium @-@ 7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron nuclear reaction , and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor , especially from inside the tumor cells . 
 In nuclear reactors , 10B is used for reactivity control and in emergency shutdown systems . It can serve either function in the form of borosilicate control rods or as boric acid . In pressurized water reactors , boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling . It is then slowly filtered out over many months as fissile material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive . 
 In future manned interplanetary spacecraft , 10B has a theoretical role as structural material ( as boron fibers or BN nanotube material ) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield . One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays , which are mostly high energy protons , is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons . Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene , but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding . Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons , 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection .

 Cosmic radiation will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures . Those neutrons will be captured in 10B , if it is present in the spacecraft 's semiconductors , producing a gamma ray , an alpha particle , and a lithium ion . Those resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor " chip " structures , causing data loss ( bit flipping , or single event upset ) . In radiation @-@ hardened semiconductor designs , one countermeasure is to use depleted boron , which is greatly enriched in 11B and contains almost no 10B . This is useful because 11B is largely immune to radiation damage . Depleted boron is a byproduct of the nuclear industry .

 11B is also a candidate as a fuel for <unk> fusion . When struck by a proton with energy of about 500 keV , it produces three alpha particles and 8 @.@ 7 MeV of energy . Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation , which weakens reactor structures and induces long @-@ term radioactivity , thereby endangering operating personnel . However , the alpha particles from 11B fusion can be turned directly into electric power , and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off .

 Both 10B and 11B possess nuclear spin . The nuclear spin of 10B is 3 and that of 11B is 3 / 2 .

The 10B and 11B nuclei also cause splitting in the resonances of attached nuclei .

 Boron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the Big Bang and in stars . It is formed in minor amounts in cosmic ray spallation nucleosynthesis and may be found uncombined in cosmic dust and meteoroid materials . In the high oxygen environment of Earth , boron is always found fully oxidized to borate . Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form . Extremely tiny elemental boron was detected in Lunar regolith 
 Although boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth 's crust , representing only 0 @.@ 001 % of the crust mass , it can be highly concentrated by the action of water , in which many borates are soluble . It is found naturally combined in compounds such as borax and boric acid ( sometimes found in volcanic spring waters ) . About a hundred borate minerals are known .

It holds a government monopoly on the mining of borate minerals in Turkey , which possesses 72 % of the world 's known deposits . In 2012 , it held a 47 % share of production of global borate minerals , ahead of its main competitor , Rio Tinto Group . 
 Almost a quarter ( 23 % ) of global boron production comes from the single Rio Tinto Borax Mine ( also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine ) 35 ° 2 ′ 34 @.@ 447 ″ N 117 ° 40 ′ 45 @.@ 412 ″ W near Boron , California .

 The average cost of crystalline boron is $ 5 / g . Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers , where it is deposited by chemical vapor deposition on a tungsten core ( see below ) . Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications , such as high strength tapes . This use is a very small fraction of total boron use . Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds , by ion implantation . 
 Estimated global consumption of boron ( almost entirely as boron compounds ) was about 4 million tonnes of B2O3 in 2012 . Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade . 
 The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years . The use of ores like colemanite has declined following concerns over arsenic content . Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content . 
 Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity . Turkey 's state @-@ owned Eti Mine Works opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100 @,@ 000 tonnes per year at <unk> in 2003 . Rio Tinto Group increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260 @,@ 000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310 @,@ 000 tonnes per year by May 2005 , with plans to grow this to 366 @,@ 000 tonnes per year in 2006 . Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates . This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ( borax ) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28 % per year over the same period . 
 The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in glass fiber , fiberglass and borosilicate glassware production . A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement @-@ grade boron @-@ containing fiberglass in Asia , has offset the development of boron @-@ free reinforcement @-@ grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA . The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation @-@ grade fiberglass , with consequent growth in the boron consumption . Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3 @.@ 4 % per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010 . The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5 @.@ 7 % per year . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into boric acid and sodium tetraborate pentahydrate . In the United States , 70 % of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics . The major global industrial @-@ scale use of boron compounds ( about 46 % of end @-@ use ) is in production of glass fiber for boron @-@ containing insulating and structural fiberglasses , especially in Asia . Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide , to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers . Another 10 % of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware . About 15 % of global boron is used in boron ceramics , including super @-@ hard materials discussed below . Agriculture consumes 11 % of global boron production , and bleaches and detergents about 6 % .

 Boron fibers ( boron filaments ) are high @-@ strength , lightweight materials that are used chiefly for advanced aerospace structures as a component of composite materials , as well as limited production consumer and sporting goods such as golf clubs and fishing rods . The fibers can be produced by chemical vapor deposition of boron on a tungsten filament . 
 Boron fibers and sub @-@ millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by laser @-@ assisted chemical vapor deposition . Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures . Such structures show good mechanical properties ( elastic modulus 450 GPa , fracture strain 3 @.@ 7 % , fracture stress 17 GPa ) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in <unk> systems . 
 = = = <unk> fiberglass = = = 
 <unk> is a fiber reinforced polymer made of plastic reinforced by glass fibers , commonly woven into a mat . The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use . These glasses all contain silica or silicate , with varying amounts of oxides of calcium , magnesium , and sometimes boron . The boron is present as borosilicate , borax , or boron oxide , and is added to increase the strength of the glass , or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica , which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers . 
 The highly <unk> glasses used in fiberglass are E @-@ glass ( named for " Electrical " use , but now the most common fiberglass for general use ) . E @-@ glass is alumino @-@ borosilicate glass with less than 1 % w / w alkali oxides , mainly used for glass @-@ reinforced plastics . Other common high @-@ boron glasses include C @-@ glass , an alkali @-@ lime glass with high boron oxide content , used for glass staple fibers and insulation , and D @-@ glass , a borosilicate glass , named for its low Dielectric constant ) . 
 Not all fiberglasses contain boron , but on a global scale , most of the fiberglass used does contain it . Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation , boron @-@ containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron , and are the single largest commercial boron market .

 Borosilicate glass , which is typically 12 – 15 % B2O3 , 80 % SiO2 , and 2 % Al2O3 , has a low coefficient of thermal expansion giving it a good resistance to thermal shock . Schott AG 's " Duran " and Owens @-@ Corning 's trademarked Pyrex are two major brand names for this glass , used both in laboratory glassware and in consumer cookware and <unk> , chiefly for this resistance . 
 = = = Boron carbide ceramic = = = 
 Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness . Boron carbide is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B2O3 with carbon in the electric furnace : 
 2 B2O3 + 7 C → <unk> + 6 CO 
 Boron carbide 's structure is only approximately <unk> , and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio . This is due to its very complex structure . The substance can be seen with empirical formula <unk> ( i.e. , with B12 dodecahedra being a motif ) , but with less carbon , as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C @-@ B @-@ C chains , and some smaller ( B6 ) octahedra are present as well ( see the boron carbide article for structural analysis ) . The repeating polymer plus semi @-@ crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight . It is used in tank armor , bulletproof vests , and numerous other structural applications . 
 Boron carbide 's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long @-@ lived radionuclides ( especially when doped with extra boron @-@ 10 ) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants . Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding , control rods and shut @-@ down pellets . Within control rods , boron carbide is often powdered , to increase its surface area .

 Metal borides are used for coating tools through chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition . <unk> of boron ions into metals and alloys , through ion implantation or ion beam deposition , results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and <unk> . Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose . These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools , and their ( treated ) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride . 
 For example , rhenium diboride can be produced at ambient pressures , but is rather expensive because of rhenium . The hardness of <unk> exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure . Its value is comparable to that of tungsten carbide , silicon carbide , titanium diboride or zirconium diboride . Similarly , <unk> + <unk> composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads .

 = = = Semiconductors = = = 
 Boron is a useful dopant for such semiconductors as silicon , germanium , and silicon carbide . Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom , it donates a hole resulting in p @-@ type conductivity . Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures . This process uses either solid ( B2O3 ) , liquid ( BBr3 ) , or gaseous boron sources ( B2H6 or BF3 ) . However , after the 1970s , it was mostly replaced by ion implantation , which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source . Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry , however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides . Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source . Examples are the plasma deposition of boron @-@ containing hard carbon films , silicon nitride @-@ boron nitride films , and for doping of diamond film with boron .

 As an ultratrace element , boron is necessary for the optimal health of rats . Boron deficiency in rats is not easy to produce , since boron is needed by rats in such small amounts that <unk> foods and dust filtration of air are required . Boron deficiency manifests in rats as poor coat or hair quality . Presumably boron is necessary to other mammals . No deficiency syndrome in humans has been described . Small amounts of boron occur widely in the diet , and the amounts needed in the diet would , by extension from rodent studies , be very small . The exact physiological role of boron in the animal kingdom is poorly understood . 
 Boron occurs in all foods produced from plants . Since 1989 its nutritional value has been argued . It is thought that boron plays several biochemical roles in animals , including humans . The United States Department of Agriculture conducted an experiment in which postmenopausal women took 3 mg of boron a day . The results showed that supplemental boron reduced excretion of calcium by 44 % , and activated estrogen and vitamin D , suggesting a possible role in the suppression of osteoporosis . However , whether these effects were conventionally nutritional , or medicinal , could not be determined . The U.S. National Institutes of Health states that " Total daily boron intake in normal human diets ranges from 2 @.@ 1 – 4 @.@ 3 mg boron / day . "

 Elemental boron , boron oxide , boric acid , borates , and many organoboron compounds are nontoxic to humans and animals ( with toxicity similar to that of table salt ) . The LD50 ( dose at which there is 50 % mortality ) for animals is about 6 g per kg of body weight . Substances with LD50 above 2 g are considered nontoxic . The minimum lethal dose for humans has not been established . An intake of 4 g / day of boric acid was reported without incident , but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses . Intakes of more than 0 @.@ 5 grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity . 
 Single medical doses of 20 g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity . Fish have survived for 30 min in a saturated boric acid solution and can survive longer in strong borax solutions . Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals , and is routinely used as an insecticide . 
 The boranes ( boron hydrogen compounds ) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous . As usual , it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous , but their toxicity depends on structure . 
 The boranes are toxic as well as highly flammable and require special care when handling . Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid . Boron halides are corrosive . 
 = Antoinism = 
 Antoinism is a healer and Christian @-@ oriented new religious movement founded in 1910 by the Walloon Louis @-@ Joseph Antoine ( 1846 – 1912 ) in Jemeppe @-@ sur @-@ Meuse , Seraing . With a total of 64 temples , over forty reading rooms across the world and thousands of members , it remains the only religion established in Belgium whose notoriety and success went outside the country . Mainly active in France , the religious movement is characterized by a decentralized structure , simple rites , discretion and tolerance towards other faiths . 
 Raised a Catholic , Antoine worked as a coal miner in his youth , then as a steelworker , before performing his military service in 1866 . After marrying Catherine in 1873 , he moved several times for professional reasons . Deeply impressed by Allan Kardec 's writings , he organized a spiritualist group in the 1890s . In 1893 , the death of his son marked the definitive loss of his faith in Catholicism . In 1896 , he explained his Spiritist views in a book , then discovered the gifts of healing . Quickly known as a healer , he gathered many followers , mainly among workers disappointed by Catholicism or medicine . In 1906 , he broke with Spiritism and started a religion , then published three books outlining his doctrine and consecrated the first Antoinist temple . After his death in 1912 , Catherine ensured the continuity of the religion , promoting a centralized worship around the person of her husband and providing additional rules in the organization . When she died in 1940 , some differences happened between the French and the Belgian temples . 
 Antoinist beliefs combine some elements of Catholicism , reincarnation , and healing . In the Antoinist views , the man must reach consciousness by getting rid of the illusion of matter produced by his intelligence — the source of evil and suffering . The purpose of the life is to release oneself from the cycle of reincarnation through a moral progression aided by " fluids " — all human actions , acquired by silent prayer and the harm caused by diseases and enemies . As freedom of conscience and free will are considered very important in Antoinist creed , the religion does not practice proselytism and is not exclusive . It does not provide any prescription on social issues . Although focused on healing , Antoinism does not interfere with the medical field , and does not discourage the resort to traditional medicine . 
 Simple and brief , services are performed in the temples , generally twice per day , and are composed of two forms of worship : " The General Operation " , which consists of the transmission of the fluid to the churchgoers , and " The Reading " of Antoine 's writings . Members who performed the services wear an entirely black dress , as sign of an intense involvement in the religion ; they are not paid . Temples are also the place of consultations of a healer by people who wish to obtain a request , frequently related to health . Antoinist celebrations include Christian holidays and other three days that commemorate the founding couple and the dedication of the first temple . Registered as organism of public utility in Belgium and as religious association in France , the religion is directed by a college composed of the most active members called desservants . It is financed by anonymous donations and do not ask for money from its followers . In France , the cult classification of Antoinism in the 1995 Parliamentary Report was criticized by the sociologists who studied the religious group , and many people involved in the anti @-@ cults fight did not report cultic <unk> .

 Louis @-@ Joseph Antoine was born on 7 June 1846 in Mons @-@ <unk> , at a place called " In the Chapel " , the youngest of a large family , which belonged to the Roman Catholic Church . His mother was Catherine Castille , born in 1797 . He was raised in the <unk> street and attended primary school in Mons . From the age of twelve , Louis was employed as a coal miner , following in the footsteps of his father . One day , while working at the mine , his lamp went out without apparent reason , which he interpreted as a divine sign that he should abandon this work . He worked for two years in the mine , then was a steelworker in the Cockerill factory in Seraing . He was enrolled in the militia of Belgium in 1866 , and filled his military obligations in Bruges . During the Franco @-@ Prussian War , he accidentally killed a comrade ; although there was no legal action , this event led him to question the meaning of life . After marrying Jeanne Catherine Collon on 15 April 1873 , while he was a hammerer , he became the father of a son , Louis Martin Joseph , born in <unk> , Prussia on 23 September 1873 , and baptized five days later in the Catholic Church of St. John . Then the family went to Belgium in August 1876 , where Antoine bought a horse and became a vegetable vendor . In 1878 , he began to suffer from recurring stomach aches . In February 1879 , he returned to Poland where he was hired as hammerer chief by Mr. Pastor in the <unk> steelworks ; there his wife ran a school canteen . Five years later , the family moved to Jemeppe @-@ sur @-@ Meuse ( Belgium ) , where he built twenty houses for workers . On 5 February 1886 , Antoine was sentenced to a fine of two francs on the grounds of physical violence on Denis Collon on 10 October 1885 . Until 1900 , he was a <unk> and a collector of <unk> factory . 
 = = = = Influence by Spiritism = = = = 
 Though young , Antoine showed great piety , which the historian Pierre Debouxhtay described as a " devotion of a rather scrupulous formalism " . Despite his strong faith , Antoine was unsatisfied with his religion . He began to be influenced by the writings of Allan Kardec and , through his friend Gustave Gon , was initiated in 1884 in Spiritism in attending Spiritist meetings to <unk> , alongside his wife and his nephew Pierre Dor . In Jemeppe @-@ sur @-@ Meuse , with friends , he started a Spiritist movement called " The Vine Growers of the Lord " ( " Les <unk> du Seigneur " ) . Often ill , his son attended evening school in Jemeppe , then worked at the Society of Belgian Northern Railways ( Société des Chemins de Fer du Nord Belge ) ; At his death on 23 April 1893 because of a phlebitis , Antoine and his group definitively broke with Christianity ; moreover , after participating in Spiritist meetings , parents believed that their deceased son was reincarnated as a pharmacist in Paris . Antoine published in 1896 a book entitled Little Spiritist Catechism ( Petit <unk> spirite ) to explain his own doctrinal views ; shaped on the Catechism of the Catholic Church , this writing was successful and was translated into Spanish . Antoine organized public meetings of Spiritism the first Sunday of each month at his home , and the second and the fourth Sundays at Pierre <unk> 's home , people being invited to meetings through flyers . He then discovered the gifts of healing and by 1900 , he received many sufferers to heal ; thenceforth , he was known as the " healer of Jemeppe " . He distributed remedies learned from Spiritism and advocated vegetarianism , as well as temperance and avoidance of fatty foods . 
 On 8 November 1900 , the prosecutor of Liège , who had received an anonymous letter , asked doctors Louis <unk> and Gabriel Corin to investigate the healing activities of Antoine . On 14 December , the Commissioner raided the pharmacist <unk> , installed in Jemeppe , who received orders made by Antoine to heal the sick . Three days later , the prosecutor and the two doctors asked Antoine about his healing activities and attended several consultations . In his report , the prosecutor stated that Anthony was very cooperative , that his treatments were " simple " and that it was certain that he obtained many recoveries but only under suggestion ; he noticed his " absolute sincerity " , but also asserted his activities could be " a danger to public health " . Antoine appeared before the Criminal Court on 19 February 1901 ; Dr. Corin and three patients who reported having been cured succeeded at the witness box . Finally , Antoine was sentenced to a suspended fine of 60 francs , which did not prevent him to enjoy great renown . Meanwhile , on 25 December 1900 , approximately 180 people attended the inauguration of a new building located at the corner of <unk> and Bois @-@ du @-@ Mont streets that Antoine had purchased earlier the same year , and then decorated with portraits of Allan Kardec , the cure of Ars and Dr. House . 
 In 1901 , Antoine posted an advertisement in the Spiritist journal The Messenger ( Le Messager ) , seeking doctors who would associate with him , but the attempt did not meet with success . At the same time , he was deeply influenced by Léon Denis ' book In the Invisible . He began to give up his remedies , particularly because of his then recent trial , and gradually left Spiritism , as he was sometimes deceived by false mediums . In 1902 , his group The Vine Growers of the Lord , although solicited , did not participate in the creation of a Spiritist Federation , then in 1905 , the members did not attend the preparatory meeting of the Congress in Liège and refused the 0 @.@ 25 franc contribution . In 1905 , he <unk> up to 400 patients per day . Around the same time , he published a four @-@ page leaflet which commented passages of the Gospels without reference to Spiritism . 
 = = = = Foundation of a new religion = = = = 
 In 1906 , Antoine discovered a spirituality he called a " new spiritualism " , which led him to definitely give up Spiritism , to decide to heal by faith alone and to perform only collective healing in a temple , and thus started to lay the foundations of a structured religious movement . That year , the followers of The Vine Growers of the Lord attended for the last time the national convention of <unk> in Charleroi , which officially marked the end of their mutual support , <unk> the following year , Antoine publicly abjured any practice of Spiritism . In addition , the moral dimension became more present in the doctrine , while the experimental disappeared . Given this abandonment of the Spiritist doctrine , the new religious group was criticized in Spiritist journals . 
 At that time , Antoine had a student named Martin Jeanfils , an employee at the Corbeau coal . A few years ago , Jeanfils was certain to get a gift of healing by treating knee and foot sprains of his wife and himself , and was then consulted by patients in Jemeppe . Antoine and him were sued on 16 January 1907 on the grounds of illegal practice of the art of healing . Jeanfils explained to the Court that he just wanted to do disappear the pain , and that he always sent his patients to doctors . For his part , Antoine told the judge that he simply put his hand on the forehead of patients and that he prescribed drugs ; he denied the charge , and all the witnesses heard testified of the altruism of Antoine , who distributed money to the poor . Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Criminal Court on 15 June 1907 , and the courtroom was entirely filled . Dr. Delville and the parents of a child cured by Antoine testified at the witness box , Mr. <unk> then pronounced the indictment . <unk> , The judgment was adjourned and was finally , on 21 June 1907 , President <unk> acquitted the two men , who were absent in court then . Following an appeal by the prosecutor , Antoine and Jeanfils appeared before the Court again on 16 October 1907 . The General Advocate Meyers made the indictment , analyzing the legislation of 1918 on the illegal art of healing , claiming that it was not what Antoine did . On 22 October of the same year , the acquittal was confirmed , and Meyers was deeply thanked by several faithful . 
 Mrs. <unk> , a stenographer , transcribed the teachings of Antoine in a magazine , The Halo of Consciousness ( L <unk> de la conscience ) , published from May 1907 to April 1909 , while three books were successively published , works in which the new doctrine was developed and which contained the Antoinist creed , " The Ten Principles of the Father " . At that time , the temple was quickly filled every day and Antoine received daily about 250 letters or telegrams . Unlike today , some <unk> was then performed by 70 hawkers wearing coats and hats and with briefcases . From May 1909 to Easter 1910 , Antoine did not appear in public , and lived alone to practice fasting and prayer , and the worship was assumed by one of his followers , Florian <unk> , who also published the Antoinist literature . On 15 August 1910 , Antoine announced that he would no longer do individual consultations , and consecrated the temple of Jemeppe @-@ sur @-@ Meuse , located rue Alfred <unk> and which cost about 100 @,@ 000 francs . Antoine presented his wife as his successor and appointed a council composed of followers to manage financial issues of the religion . At the meeting of 11 June 1911 , the council proposed the publishing of a newspaper titled The <unk> ( L <unk> ) which was released in September of the same year , with a printing of 400 @,@ 000 copies for the first issue , and 6 @,@ 000 subscribers . In the context of legal proceedings for the worship registration , secretary of the Antoinist committee <unk> wrote to the Minister of the Interior on 29 March 1910 and to the Minister of Justice and Religious Affairs on 19 April 1910 . A petition of 160 @,@ 000 signatures to demand official recognition of the Antoinist religion was sent to the House of Representatives on 2 December 1910 , and forwarded to the Minister of Justice on 27 January 1911 . 
 Although his predictions were sometimes inaccurate , Antoine was then regarded as a prophet by his followers , and some of them said it could perform supernatural apparitions ; for his part , Antoine said nothing about the possible truthfulness of these phenomena . Named " The Father " by his followers , Antoine died — " disembodied " in Antoinist doctrine — on 25 June 1912 as the result of an attack of stroke . Then there were rumors that he would resurrect on the third day , but Debouxhtay believed that they <unk> from " jesters " and that Antoinists did not believe this . The procession which took place at his funeral on 30 June 1912 was a great event in Jemeppe , and on this occasion , 100 @,@ 000 faithful came to pray over his body . Subsequently , Antoinists were allowed to move the body , initially in the pauper 's grave , to the town cemetery . In 1920 , Antoine 's widow asked the country 's Queen to allow her the carry the body in the temple garden of Jemeppe where a chapel would be erected , but this request failed . 
 As legacy , a street in Spa was named " Father Antoine Street " ( " Rue du Père Antoine " ) after a decision by the Liberal Party of the city in 1931 , and a 1952 painted plaster bust of Antoine is exhibited at the Museum of Walloon Life ( Musée de la Vie <unk> ) in Liège . 
 = = = = Splinter groups = = = = 
 When Antoine was alive , a minor split group was led in Verviers by a man named <unk> . A more important schism from Antoinism was <unk> by Pierre Dor ( born 15 May 1862 , Mons @-@ <unk> ) , Louis Antoine 's nephew , and was named " <unk> " . He first participated in the Spiritist circle of his uncle , " The Vine Growers of the Lord " , but decided to splinter off , as he believed he had himself gifts of healing . He tried to heal sufferers , but did not achieve success and returned to the group of his uncle . However , he accompanied one of his patients in Russia , where he enjoyed success since he healed about 7 @,@ 000 people per week , but came back to Belgium after complaints from doctors . In Roux @-@ <unk> , he built a hall called " The Moral School " ( " L 'École Morale " ) where he healed the sick and dispensed roughly the same teachings as that of his uncle . He explained his theory in two books respectively published in 1912 and 1913 , entitled Catechism of the Restoration of the Soul ( <unk> de la <unk> de l <unk> ) and Christ Speaks Again ( Le Christ <unk> à nouveau ) — as he identified himself to Jesus Christ , and Antoine to John the Baptist — which Debouxhtay considered as a potential plagiarism of Antoine 's writings . Dor encouraged a diet of vegetables boiled in water and chastity before marriage . In 1916 , he was convicted of illegally practicing the healing art . Thereafter , he moved to Uccle , and his movement disappeared following his death on 5 March 1947 . As Antoinism , <unk> was criticized by some Catholic clergy members . 
 = = = 1912 – 1940 : Wife Catherine as successor = = = 
 The illiterate wife of Louis Antoine , Catherine ( born 26 May 1850 , Jemeppe sur Meuse – died 3 November 1940 , Jemeppe sur Meuse ) , called " The Mother " by the followers , was designated by him as his successor , but received no advice from him on how to manage the religion . In December 1918 , then in September 1919 , she sent letters respectively to the King of Belgium and the Minister of Justice to obtain legal recognition of the Antoinist worship ; in the month of March of the following two years , Secretary of worship Ferdinand <unk> sent two letters in the same purpose , which resulted in 1922 in the recognition of public utility of the religion . 
 To seek to prevent any misappropriation of the <unk> of Antoine within the movement after his death , the Antoinist journal L <unk> published articles which presented Catherine as the legitimate successor and also redefined precisely the limits of the healers ' role . To avoid a succession crisis and to ensure the continuity of the religion , Catherine decided to promote a centralized worship around the person of her husband and thus established various rules between 1925 and 1930 . For example , she placed , in the temple before the high platform , the photograph of her husband with the mention " The Father is making the Operation " , then added her own portrait . She also authorized the desservants — the members the most involved in the religion — to perform the General Operation from the higher platform , but wanted that the ceremony would be preceded by a statement that it is the Father who performs the Operation and that the faith must be placed in him to obtain satisfaction . She insisted that the desservant installed in the platform would be sat during the reading of Antoine 's writings . She also organized the Father 's day , on 25 June , and rituals such as baptism , communion and marriage , which transformed the group into institutionalized religion . She ordered that nothing should be changed in her husband 's writings and in 1932 closed reading rooms in which followers gave personal teachings . However , unlike the writings of her husband which can be sold by anyone , changes and rules established by Catherine are recorded in books only available to the desservants , thus remaining confidential . From 17 June 1930 , a faithful named Narcisse <unk> replaced her to perform the General Operation at the platform of the temple . 
 = = = 1940 – 2016 : Continuity of the worship = = = 
 The history of Antoinism was very quiet after 1940 . In Belgium , Joseph <unk> , the President of the Antoinist Council , then his successors , led the religion until their death , alongside the members of this body . The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement , which has withdrawn the religious changes she made : removal of photographs in the temples , deletion of baptism , marriage and communion , opposition to the translation of Antoine 's works ... However , a Belgian group who , claiming to be faithful to the true Antoinist tradition , opened a temple in <unk> on 1 April 1943 , preferred to keep the portraits of the <unk> in the temple . In France , the Antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple . In spite of these differences , the two branches show each other support and tolerance . Thus , after the death of Catherine , there were two forms of Antoinism , which still remain different today : one in Belgium , and one in France . 
 In Belgium , the growth of the religion quickly begin to slow down , even to decline , as indicated by the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused because of a lack of dressed members and / or money . In contrast , the constructions of the temples in France has been continued until 1993 , when a new temple in Toulouse was opened . 
 = = Beliefs = = 
 = = = Theology = = = 
 Antoinism believes in a dualistic universe composed of a spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness , and of a corporal world , governed by natural laws , in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence . The man combines in himself both worlds , as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness . In Antoinist views , the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness , but on intelligence . The view of the matter is , however , not considered a sin , but an error that causes suffering . 
 The religious movement believes in a moral progression through reincarnation after death : the transmigration of the spirit in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation . The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives , and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him , at the end , to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation . The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure , as the pain can increase one 's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one 's salvation . The silent prayer is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness . Antoine , who suffered from disease and demonstrated asceticism and dedication throughout his life , is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation . 
 Antoinist doctrine provides another interpretation to the original sin in the book of Genesis : Adam began to follow Eve , who had placed her confidence in a serpent , symbol of matter . By imagining the materiality of the physical world , he abandoned the divine consciousness in which he lived and produced the ideas of good and evil . The " tree of knowledge of good and evil " in the Bible is redefined as " the tree of the science of the sight of evil " . Antoinism claimed to not be an atheist religion , but has a particular conception of God : this one does not exist outside of humans , and they do not exist outside of God . Therefore as God would live in every <unk> , it is highly recommended to love one 's enemies . In addition , the doctrine of the Trinity is not accepted . 
 Flexible and little binding , Antoinist beliefs are close to the contemporary belief , as followers can choose the beliefs they wish and interpret events as they want . The religion attaches great importance to freedom of conscience and free will , which renders it attractive and promotes a diversity of beliefs among the followers who can refer simultaneously to other religious traditions . Some believers see Antoine as an incarnation of God ; others , who continue to practice Catholicism , consider him a prophet equal to Jesus Christ ; others , who adhere to New Age doctrines , perceive him as a spiritual figure . The movement rejects indoctrination of children and <unk> , even towards people who visit the temple , tolerates other religions as they teach the faith and prayer and thus detach people from the material world , and considers tolerance the highest virtue to practise . The religion does not provide any prescription on issues such as divorce , abortion and sexuality , has no political purpose and do not use honorary titles , considering all people equal . A periodical directed by writer Louis Pauwels summarized the main purposes of the religion as being the " mutual aid , spiritual and human solidarity , availability and hospitality " . 
 = = = Fluids = = = 
 Fundamental principle of the cosmos , the fluid is a recurrent theme in Antoinism . Thoughts , words , human actions and social ties are considered as fluids . As their quality depends on the moral progress of a person , there are " spiritual " and " heavy " fluids . They can be transmitted , perceived by the intelligence and purified through meditation . A good fluid is supposed to be acquired by love and prayer , and has various uses : it can act as a divine power that regenerates the whole person , destroy evil and heal . It is believed that Antoine can transmit the good fluid and that the temple platform is the place of the most number of fluids . 
 As good fluids are supposed to be transferable , the Antoinist dress used during the worship is often placed on the bed of a suffering person to help his recovery ; similarly , some faithful put a request on a paper in a box under the platform so that the wish happen , others buy a photo of Antoine at a ceremony to be protected . To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple , several rules were established : for example , those who perform the worship are not allowed to wear jewelry or makeup in the building . 
 = = = Healing = = = 
 Although focused on healing , Antoinism does not propose any diagnosis nor prescription , and does not practice the laying on of hands ; the faithful may also resort to traditional medicine . In the books of the temple , it is stated that desservants are not allowed to discourage them to consult a doctor and they should pray that they find an " inspired " doctor . Generally , consulting an Antoinist healer is merely a supplement to allopathic medicine . Because of its healer doctrine , the religious group is almost always compared to Christian Science ; however , in spite of several similarities with this religion as well as with Friedrich Hegel 's works , Belgian historian Pierre Debouxhtay rejected the idea that they could have been potential influences on Antoine 's doctrines . According to him , it is possible that Antoine was influenced by Doukhobors . 
 When Antoine was alive , many observers thought that the healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only , and Dr. <unk> , who wrote two articles in The Meuse ( La Meuse ) on the subject at the time , criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings . Sociologist Anne @-@ Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against ( 1 ) the efficiency of medicine , ( 2 ) the traditional representation of disease — the real healing can be attained only through a new approach to the disease , which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension — and ( 3 ) the management of disease — sick are always responsible for their own illness . However , she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as ( 1 ) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model , which indicates a process of <unk> of the religion , and ( 2 ) the personal real @-@ life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society . 
 = = Practices = = 
 = = = Worship = = = 
 The Antoinism worship takes place in temples . A dressed member welcomes anyone who enters the temple by calling them " brother " and " sister " , even if they are just visitors . The service is very <unk> and informal , as there is no liturgy , singing , or pre @-@ set prayers , and lasts from 15 to 30 minutes . Attendance at worship is not required and many people come sporadically . According to sociologist Régis Dericquebourg , " the Antoinist worship is a ritual of intercession . ( ... ) It is a time of big emotional intensity with an intimate aspect " . 
 The service is composed of two practices : 
 " The General Operation " ( " L <unk> Générale " ) : Established by Antoine in 1910 , it begins and ends with three strokes of bell . It is briefly announced by a dressed member . After meditating in a room on the back of the temple , a desservant climb to the highest platform , and the dressed follower goes to the other platform . Both are standing and pray for a few minutes to transmit the fluid to the churchgoers . Then , if the reading of the sacred texts is scheduled just after , as it is the case in France , the desservant whispers to the dressed follower to perform the reading . Originally Antoine practiced this form of worship only on holidays ( except Sundays ) and on the 1st and 15th days of each month , before extending it to the first four days of the week . It was in 1932 that the General Operation was performed in all Antoinist temples , and no longer only in the one of Jemeppe ; furthermore , on 3 December 1933 , Catherine decided that the ritual would be also perform every Sunday . 
 " The Reading " ( " La Lecture " ) : It lasts twenty minutes and consists of the reading of Antoine 's book L <unk> by the dressed follower . The reading ends when he thanks the audience . 
 There are few differences in schedules between the services in Belgium and that of France ( see the table ) . 
 = = = Consultations by a healer = = = 
 After the service , some people — regular faithful or visitors — may ask to consult a healer in one of the small rooms of the temple — although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons . During these consultations , both are standing before Antoine 's image : the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain , and the healer prays , sometimes while touching the consultant 's shoulder or hand , presumably to convey the fluid . The healer 's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing . For this purpose , the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant 's problem , which is , in Antoinist beliefs , always linked to a person 's own history , and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life . 
 A 2001 survey reported by Dr. Axel Hoffman showed that an Antoinist healer had received 216 patients over a period of twenty days , that the reasons to <unk> were related to physical ( 47 % ) , psychological ( 19 % ) , sentimental ( 13 % ) and professional ( 13 % ) issues , and that most of these people also consulted a doctor . The Antoinist healing process does not include a doctrinal teaching nor a psychological manipulation . It does not necessarily imply the end of the problem or illness , and can be divided into three phases : the relief provided by the healer through listening and intercession with God , then acceptance of the problem which requires the recognition of one 's responsibilities , and finally the inner peace that results . Whether immediate or gradual , healings are never considered as miracles in the religion because they are supposed to occur inevitably when all necessary conditions , including the faith of the patient , are met . Even after several consultations , the consultant does not necessarily become a follower . Several sociologists deemed the Antoinist healing as " exorcist " as well as " <unk> " . 
 = = = Marriage , communion , baptism and funeral = = = 
 Catherine established rituals such as baptism of infants , blessing of couples and communion of young people . They simply consist of an " elevation of thought " that take place after the services in a consulting room of the temple . These rituals have no particular meaning in the religion and are not considered sacraments ; they are performed only at the request of followers , including young people , who want to provide a religious dimension to the important moments of their lives . Funerals are also performed at the request of the concerned person , unless the family asks for rituals of another religion . The procession always takes place at the cemetery or the funeral home , and the deceased person is never brought to the temple . <unk> read the " Ten Principles of the Father " , then an Antoinist text on reincarnation , to help the soul to come off the body to be reincarnated . Sociologists note that many people who never attend the Antoinist services asked for funeral rites of that religion . 
 = = = Holidays = = = 
 As Antoine decided to model Antoinist holidays on Catholicism , followers celebrate Christian holidays , including All Saints , Christmas , Easter , Easter Monday and Ascension ; these days , appropriate portions of Antoine 's works are read during the services . There are also three special days in Antoinism , and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments : ( 1 ) 25 June , the Father 's Day . It was established by Antoine 's wife shortly after his death . At first , from 1913 , all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed that day in the purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city . So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe @-@ sur @-@ Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine 's life . The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized . That day , the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples . ( 2 ) 15 August , the consecration of the temple 's Day , which commemorates the consecration of the first temple . In 1911 , on that day , the General Operation took place at the temple , then the ceremony continued into a public hall , which shocked followers ; therefore , the following year , the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple . ( 3 ) 3 November , the Mother 's Day , as anniversary of Catherine 's death . 
 = = = Religious clothing and symbols = = = 
 Wearing Antoinist religious clothing indicates an intense involvement in the religion by the person who makes this choice . Although not mandatory , it is devoted to faithful who perform the worship , celebrations and other tasks in the temple — all of them are called " moral work " , as they are expected to participate in the moral elevation of followers . It was in 1906 that Antoine wore a special clothe for the first time , and it was the case of the faithful in 1910 . Entirely black , the dress for men was designed by Antoine , and that for women by Catherine , who precisely codified their dimensions in their writings . There are also dresses for young people of both sexes , but they are never actually worn . Historically , the wearing of the dress was the subject of a debate among the first Antoinists , some of them refusing to wear it , and even generated a scandal so that Antoine had to justify himself on this subject , saying it had been revealed by inspiration . In the past , the dress was also worn in the street , and that was how the followers were immediately identified by the public . Currently , it is generally only worn in the context of worship , and it is put and removed in the locker room of the temple . Clothing for men is composed of a dress which resembles the one worn by Catholic clergy in the monastery , and closed by 13 buttons , plus a cashmere top hat . Clothing for women is a wide dress accompanied with a cape and a bonnet with a veil . In the Antoinist view , the collar is important as it is believed that the fluid resides here . 
 The only emblem of Antoinism is the tree of science of the sight of evil that features on the facade of the highest platform in the temple . It has seven branches which represent the seven deadly sins ( although sin is rejected in the religion ) , two eyes which symbolize the view of the sins , and the tree roots which are the symbol of the intelligence which links man to matter . In the branches the mention " Culte Antoiniste " ( " Antoinist worship " ) is written . 
 = = Organization = = 
 = = = Status = = = 
 In Belgium , the religion was organized as an association without lucrative purpose ( <unk> ) in 1922 and was immediately registered as organism of public utility on a request of the Department of Justice . It is not recognized as a public worship , because there is no worship of a deity in the ceremonies . Currently headed by a college of desservants , the religion is legally registered as religious association in France . It was published in the Journal Officiel de la République Française of 9 February 1924 , and the last modification of the statutes appeared in the <unk> of 3 August 1988 . Antoinist worship has been exempt from property taxes on the public part of its buildings since 1925 in Belgium and in France since 1934 . 
 = = = Places of worship = = = 
 The temples are Antoinism 's only place of worship . They are financed with anonymous donations and patronages , and often members participate in the construction . They are all consecrated prior to their use for worship , which means that , at a ceremony , they received a " good fluid " by one of the founders when they were alive or by a duly authorized follower . 
 The exterior facade displays an architecture which can be variable according to the temples , but always includes the words " Antoinist Worship " ( " Culte Antoiniste " ) and the year of the building consecration . At the entrance , there is a porch where various writings of the religious movement , the internal regulations ( in France only ) , the list of the places of worship and the holidays , as well as photos of the Antoine couple and of the various temples , are exhibited behind display windows . 
 The inside walls are always painted in green , as symbol of reincarnation . There is no decoration , and small papers on the walls indicate to visitors that they should not speak in the temple . Several rows of wooden benches separated by a center aisle are devoted to the faithful and visitors . They are facing a two @-@ floor platform where the worship is performed , and a text called " The Halo of Consciousness " ( " L <unk> de la Conscience " ) which is written on the back wall . In France only , the highest platform is adorned , from left to right , with a representation of the " tree of science of the sight of evil " , the Antoinist symbol , then a photo of Antoine and another one of Catherine ; the photo of the Father is slightly higher than the other two . On the left and the right , side rooms of around 15 m ³ are used as consulting offices whose walls are <unk> with five tables ; the most impressive of them is Antoine 's image . There is also a cloakroom and , adjacent to the temple , a small apartment continuously occupied by an Antoinist healer . 
 The movement is also owner of reading rooms , but no worship is celebrated in these places . As of 2011 , Antoinism counts 64 temples : 32 in Belgium , 31 in France and 1 in the Principality of Monaco . It has also opened reading rooms in Belgium , Metropolitan France , Réunion , Guadeloupe , Australia , Brazil , Italy , Congo and Luxembourg . A reading room in Egypt was quickly closed in November 1913 . 
 = = = Publications = = = 
 The Antoinist literature is mainly composed of Antoine 's writings , which are considered as sacred by followers and should not be modified . They include three doctrinal books grouped into two volumes which are sold in the temples and read during the worship : Revelation of the Father ( La <unk> par le Père ) , The Coronation of the Revealed Work ( Le <unk> de l 'Œuvre <unk> ) and Development of the Teaching of Father ( Le <unk> de l <unk> du Père ) . According to Debouxhtay , " the writings of Antoine do not shine by their qualities of style " , a view shared by other observers . Many statements from the <unk> are gathered into 14 books called Tomes , which remain only accessible to dressed members . From May 1907 to April 1909 , the religion published the journal The Halo of Consciousness , then from September 1911 to August 1914 , The <unk> . In 1936 , Belgian writer Robert Vivier published a hagiographic biography — although based on real facts — of Louis Antoine , which is also used by Antoinists to strengthen their faith , and thus sold in the temples . 
 = = = Hierarchy and financial issues = = = 
 The organization , which is the most reduced as possible , is slightly different in France and Belgium : 
 In Belgium , a General Council was organized in 1911 by Antoine to manage all material issues . It is currently composed of nine members including a chairman , a treasurer and a secretary . The <unk> of the First Representative of the Father was abolished in 1971 , and there are no internal regulations in the temples . In France , the movement is led by a religious association called " Culte Antoiniste " ( " Antoinist Worship " ) . All the desservants are part of a College of <unk> which manage the material issues , and whose decisions are implemented by an Administrative Committee . Within the college , a Moral Secretary is elected and serves as legal representative of the religion . Locally , the desservants nominate auxiliaries among the dressed followers so that they perform reading during worship and / or serve as healers . A Council of Local Interior composed of seven members including desservants is used for issues related to the temple on which it depends . Women as well as men can be chosen as ministers , as Catherine promoted gender equality in the worship . In all cases , Antoine , although deceased , remains the leader of the religion , which led Debouxhtay to compare him to the Pope in the Catholic Church . 
 Antoinist healers are always dressed members , and are not paid . They do not attend specific training or receive any initiation rite . Those who want to access this function must feel spiritually " inspired " and obtain the desservant 's approval . They must also promise to respect Antoinist rules including nondisclosure of confessions by consultants and not discouraging traditional medicine . Before receiving consultants , no kind of asceticism is required , but mental preparation includes prayer and meditation . Regarded as mere intercessors , healers have a " charisma of function " as they reproduce that of Antoine , which does not prevent some healers from becoming very popular among consultants . 
 Worship is practiced voluntarily , and desservants and dressed followers are not paid , neither for worship , nor for consultations . The religion sold nothing , except the sacred books , and refuses any form of contribution and any will made by a person who still has a family . When the founding couple was living , donations were rejected when the religion had enough money in its treasury . Only anonymous donations and bequests are accepted , and they go to the " Antoinist worship " ' s treasury . In Belgium , the finances , which have been published in Le Moniteur Belge every year after the Council meeting , are on the decline and show a minimal activity of the religion . 
 = = = Membership = = = 
 There are four categories of Antoinists : desservants who perform worship , people who wear the religious clothing , regular faithful who attend the service every week , and occasional members or visitors . As its aim is to heal and comfort through faith , Antoinism does not seek to convert new people . The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion . After a period of rapid growth in Belgium , the number of followers is currently on the decline in the country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful ; for example , in 2003 , Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country . In France , however , the religion remains active and counts about 2 @,@ 500 regular members . Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200 @,@ 000 . The future growth of the number of followers , however , can be affected by certain rules of the group . As it does not practice proselytism , Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples in their neighborhood . Moreover , because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion , dressed members and desservants are often old @-@ age retired people . 
 Mainly composed of 40- to 50 @-@ year @-@ old people and a majority of women , the membership is almost the same as that which was attracted by Spiritism in Belgium in the 19th century . The followers have mostly modest social status , such as miners and artisans , and are generally people interested in spirituality , but who are at odds with the Catholic Church or display a skeptical attitude towards traditional medicine . Antoinists are also sometimes Jews , Muslims , Buddhists , adepts of reiki , yoga , or t 'ai chi ch 'uan , or former Catholics . An accurate depiction of Antoinists of Northern France was made by writer André <unk> in his 1928 novel Without Soul ( Sans âme ) . In 1945 , Debouxhtay described followers as " very kind , very charitable and very obliging people " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 = = = Growth and criticism = = = 
 When Antoine died in 1912 , there were fewer than a thousand followers and thousands of supporters ; in the 1920s , the number of followers rose to 700 @,@ 000 , including 300 @,@ 000 in Belgium . During its first decades , Antoinism spread so fast that even American newspapers published <unk> about the religion , one of them stating that it " [ was ] attracting considerable attention in Europe " . Author Françoise d <unk> considered that the physique of Antoine , which she found attractive , may have contributed to his success . According to Bégot , the success of Antoinist healing in the early 20th century can be explained by the fact that " it offered an alternative to the legitimate institutions of control of body and soul " , i.e. the Catholic Church and medicine . She added : " Carrier of a social protest , it is nevertheless a way of socioeconomic integration " . French historian and sociologist Émile Poulat stated that the religion " has always appeared calm and <unk> " . 
 As it disapproved that the group of Antoine turned away from Spiritism , journals from Spiritist circles criticized Antoinism in its beginnings , and the president of the Belgian Federation of Spiritist ( Fédération spirite de Belgique ) Chevalier Clement Saint @-@ Marcq considered the religion as one of the " parasitic stems came on the healthy and strong tree of Spiritism " . From a philosophical standpoint , Antoinism was criticized by René <unk> in an entire chapter of his 1923 book The Spiritist Fallacy ( L <unk> spirite ) , noting , to his point of view , " the nullity of [ Antoine 's ] " teachings " which are only a vague mixture of spiritualist theories and Protestant " moralism " " . As for Theosophists , they displayed a strong fellow feeling to Antoinism in their journals . 
 The religion received little opposition from the Catholic Church , which has sometimes criticized it but only on doctrinal issues , considering it heretic . For example , in 1918 , priest of Liège Hubert <unk> published a 50 @-@ page brochure in which he expressed concerns on the doctrines , qualified the sacred texts of Antoinism as " gibberish " and concluded that Antoine would have suffered from <unk> . In 1925 , Father Lucien Roure considered Antoinism " a doctrine of anarchy and amorality " , with " negative teachings " , confused and incoherent writings , and " credulous and docile " followers . In 1949 , author Jacques Michel blamed Antoine for having substituted himself for Jesus Christ and deemed Antoinism a " demonic " faith . Later , in 1953 , Maurice <unk> , then in 1954 , the Father Henri @-@ Charles <unk> , published books which analyzed non @-@ conformist groups , including Antoinism . According to Debouxhtay , Protestants were concerned about the Antoinist expansion in the 1930s , and several pastors published writings on this subject ( Giron @-@ <unk> , 1910 ; Rumpf , 1917 ; Wyss , <unk> ) . More recently , the religion was studied from a Protestant perspective by pastor Gérard Dagon . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 In France , the Antoinist worship was classified as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary reports which considered it one of the oldest healer groups . Books published by Belgian and French anti @-@ cult associations and activists sometimes included Antoinism in their lists of cults , such as Cults , State of Emergency — Better know them , better defend oneself in France and worldwide ( Les <unk> , État d <unk> — <unk> les <unk> , mieux s 'en <unk> en France et dans le monde ) , published by the Centre Roger <unk> , and others . However , on 27 May 2005 , the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the Antoinist worship was listed , were officially cancelled and invalidated by Jean @-@ Pierre Raffarin 's <unk> . In addition , in a 1984 letter , the French Minister of the Interior wrote that the movement was considered , from an administrative point of view , as having for exclusive purpose the exercise of a religion , thus complying with the 18th and 19th Articles of the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State . He added that <unk> had always been allowed to receive bequests or donations , which meant that its religious nature was never challenged . In the early 2000s , membership of an Antoinist mother in Valenciennes was used by her former husband to remove from her the custody of their son ; the decision received attention from media and was criticized by the French sociologist Régis Dericquebourg as being unjustified . 
 When heard by the Belgian commission on cults , philosopher Luc <unk> said that " the establishment of a directory of cult movements ( ... ) seems to him dangerous , because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as ( ... ) Antoinism " . Eric Brasseur , director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations ( Centre d 'information et d <unk> sur les organisations <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ) said : " This is a Belgian worship for which we have never had a complaint in 12 years , a rare case to report " . Similarly , in 2013 , the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and <unk> Cultic <unk> ( Mission <unk> de vigilance et de <unk> contre les <unk> <unk> , or MIVILUDES ) made this comment : " We have never received reporting from Antoinists . They heal through prayer , but as long as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means ... " In addition , the <unk> généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem . In 2002 , the national service " Pastoral , sects and new beliefs " ( " Pastorale , sectes et <unk> <unk> " ) , which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view , wrote about Antoinism : " Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report , it has no cultish feature . " Similarly , Dericquebourg , who deeply studied the religious group , concluded that Antoinism is not a cult : it " has no totalitarian influence on its members , and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world ; it is not exclusive [ and ] shows no hostility towards social systems " . According to Bégot , the group is a " cult " in the sociological language ( not to be confused with the pejorative word " cult " ) , characterized by a mystical experience , a break with the dominant religious tradition , and primacy of the individual on social issues ; it has both magical and ethical dimensions . 
 Although it does not refer directly to the Gospel , Antoinism is often considered a Christian based new religious movement . In 1970 , British sociologist Bryan Wilson classified Antoinism in the category of " <unk> sects " . Secretary of the French episcopate for the study of cults and new religious movements Jean <unk> also deemed the group a " healer church " and " a new religion of Spiritism , Theosophy and elements of Christianity " . Le Protestant <unk> , a Belgian Protestant periodical , said that the group , although listed as a cult in the 1995 parliamentary report , was " rather a philosophical and religious movement " . In an encyclopedia about sects , the journalist Xavier <unk> qualified Antoinism a " genuine Theosophical religion " , and stated that it " does not ask for money from its followers , and does not practice excessive indoctrination " .

 The Accounting Review is a bimonthly peer @-@ reviewed academic journal covering accounting , and is the flagship journal of the American Accounting Association . Its current Senior Editor is Mark L. <unk> ( University of Southern California ) . The journal 's scope encompasses any accounting @-@ related subject and any research methodology : as of 2010 the proportions of papers accepted for publication across subject areas and research methods was very similar to the proportion of papers received for review . 
 Submissions to The Accounting Review are reviewed by editorial board members and ad hoc reviewers . In 2009 , the journal received over 500 new submissions a year , and about 9 % of the decision letters sent to authors were acceptances or conditional acceptances . 
 = = = Establishment to 1960s = = = 
 The Accounting Review , launched in 1926 by William Andrew Paton , is one of the oldest academic journals in accounting . The American Association of University Instructors of Accounting , which later became the American Accounting Association , originally proposed that the association publish a Quarterly Journal of <unk> , but the proposal did not see fruition , and The Accounting Review was subsequently born . Paton served as editor and production manager in the journal 's first three years . 
 In the first few decades following the journal 's establishment , leading authors in The Accounting Review tended to write articles that would be of interest to accounting practitioners . The journal published articles that focused on accounting education and issues related to particular industries and trade groups , with many articles using anecdotal evidence and hypothetical illustrations . The longest @-@ serving editor during this period was Eric Kohler , an accounting practitioner ; Kohler served as editor from 1928 to 1942 . 
 From the 1940s to the 1960s , The Accounting Review published articles of greater diversity , and leading authors during this period tended to have less practical accounting experience and more formal education . During this period , the three individuals that accounted for most of the editorial duties of the journal were A. C. Littleton ( 1944 @-@ 1947 ) , Frank Smith ( 1950 @-@ 1959 ) and Robert <unk> ( 1960 @-@ 1962 ) , all of whom either had practical accounting experience , or were leading authors prior to 1945 , when the journal was oriented towards the accounting practice . 
 = = = 1960s to present = = = 
 In the 1960s , the journal shifted towards a preference for quantitative model building including econometric models and time series models , and accepted more articles by non @-@ accountants who contributed ideas from other disciplines in solving accounting @-@ related problems . Since the late 1970s , accounting professors have opined that the journal was sacrificing relevance for mathematical rigor , and by 1982 , accounting researchers realized that mathematical analysis and empirical research were a necessary condition for articles to be accepted . 
 In the 1980s , the AAA began to publish two other journals , Issues in Accounting Education and Accounting Horizons . Issues in Accounting Education , first published in 1983 , was created to better serve accounting educators , while Accounting Horizons , first published in 1987 , focused more on issues facing accounting practitioners . This permitted the journal " to focus more heavily on quantitative papers that became increasingly difficult for practitioners and many teachers of accounting to comprehend " . 
 Between the 1980s and the 2000s , with the rise of databases such as <unk> and EDGAR and software such as SAS , articles became mathematically more rigorous with increasingly sophisticated statistical analyses , and accounting practitioners comprised a decreasing proportion of authors in the journal .

 = Homer 's Triple Bypass = 
 " Homer 's Triple Bypass " is the eleventh episode in the fourth season of The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17 , 1992 . In the episode , Homer Simpson suffers a heart attack when Mr. Burns shouts at him at work . Dr. Hibbert tells Homer that he needs a triple bypass , but the Simpson family resorts to a discount surgeon after learning how expensive the operation would be in a regular hospital . The episode was written by Gary Apple and Michael Carrington and directed by David Silverman . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After being warned by Marge about his unhealthy eating , Homer starts to feel chest pains . After several more instances of the chest pains , Homer has a heart attack . 
 Homer is sent to the hospital , where Marge visits him . Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that he needs a triple bypass , which will cost him $ 30 @,@ 000 . Upon hearing this , Homer has another heart attack , which increases the price to $ 40 @,@ 000 . Marge and Homer try to figure out a way to pay for the operation . 
 Homer goes to The Merry Widow Insurance Company , but is denied when he has a heart attack before signing the policy . Unable to afford surgery at the hospital , Marge and Homer see a commercial for Dr. Nick Riviera , an incompetent surgeon who will perform any operation for $ 129 @.@ 95 . Leaving no other alternative , Homer decides to go for the cheaper service . 
 During the operation , Dr. Nick realizes that he does not know what to do , mostly due to a video detailing the procedure being taped over with a show called People Who Look Like Things . Lisa , who is watching the operation in the amphitheater , uses her knowledge of cardiology to guide Dr. Nick . The surgery is successful , and Homer makes a full recovery .

 " Homer 's Triple Bypass " was not written by a member of the show 's regular staff , but instead Gary Apple and Michael Carrington . They were brought in as freelance writers because the show was suffering from a depleted writing team after the third season ended and the remaining members did not bother to do the episode . 
 Carrington would provide voice work for later episodes , such as " I Love Lisa " ( as Sideshow Raheem ) , " Homer and Apu " ( as the head of the Kwik @-@ e @-@ Mart ) , and " Simpson Tide " ( as Homer 's drill instructor ) . The idea for the episode came from James L. Brooks , who pitched the idea of Homer having a heart attack . However , the writers disagreed with such a heavy topic as this . 
 They decided to have a scene where Lisa and Bart visit Homer before his surgery and were unsure of how to do it , so they approached Brooks . Brooks made up the entire scene on the spot . Originally , the surgery was supposed to be performed by Dr. Hibbert , but it was later changed to Dr. Nick . In the original airing of the episode , Dr. Nick 's phone number was the number of a real legal clinic , whose lawyers made them change it to 1 @-@ 600 @-@ <unk> . 
 The episode 's production staff decided that David Silverman would be able to make the episode funny , so he was selected to direct it . He went " all out " and did his best to make Homer 's grimaces as humorous as possible , to keep the episode at least somewhat lighter in tone . Silverman added some special touches : for example , when Homer has an out of body experience , his foot was still touching his body to signify that he was not dead . A doctor acted as a medical consultant for the episode . 
 The episode was to have concluded with Homer eating a pizza in his hospital bed following the operation , and with Marge asking a nurse where the pizza had come from . This reflects the earlier flashback scene where Grampa Simpson watches Homer as an infant , chewing on a slice of pizza in the hospital . The scene was replaced with the family cheering Homer on while he is in intensive care .

 The opening sequence of the episode is a parody of American television show COPS ; it was not in the original animatic and added later because the episode was too short to fit in its required 22 @-@ minute length .

Homer follows behind the house that was the birthplace of Edgar Allan Poe , which was placed in the episode by David Silverman . During this scene Homer starts to hear a heartbeat , a reference to Poe 's " The Telltale Heart " . The scene where Homer sings in a church as a boy is based on the film Empire of the Sun .

 = John C. Calhoun = 
 John Caldwell Calhoun ( / <unk> / ; March 18 , 1782 – March 31 , 1850 ) was an American statesman and political theorist from South Carolina , who is best remembered for his strong defense of slavery and for advancing the concept of minority rights in politics , which he did in the context of defending Southern values from perceived Northern threats . He began his political career as a nationalist , modernizer , and proponent of a strong national government and protective tariffs . By the late 1820s , his views reversed and he became a leading proponent of states ' rights , limited government , nullification , and opposition to high tariffs — he saw Northern acceptance of these policies as the only way to keep the South in the Union . His beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South 's secession from the Union in 1860 – 61 . 
 Calhoun began his political career with election to the House of Representatives . As a prominent leader of the war hawk faction , Calhoun strongly supported the War of 1812 to defend American honor against Britain . He then served as Secretary of War under President James Monroe , and in his position reorganized and modernized the War Department . In the 1824 presidential election , he was the overwhelming choice of the electoral college for Vice President of the United States . He served under John Quincy Adams and continued under Andrew Jackson , who defeated Adams in 1828 . 
 Calhoun had a difficult relationship with Jackson primarily because of the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair . In contrast with his previous nationalism , Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina 's right to nullify Federal tariff legislation which he believed unfairly favored the North , putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson . In 1832 he resigned as vice president , and entered the Senate . He sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1844 , but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk . He served as Secretary of State under John Tyler from 1844 to 1845 . He then returned to the Senate , where he opposed the Mexican – American War , the Wilmot Proviso , and the Compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850 . Calhoun often served as a virtual party @-@ independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and Whigs . 
 Yet Calhoun was known as the " cast @-@ iron man " for his ideological rigidity . His concept of republicanism emphasized approval of slavery and minority rights , as particularly embodied by the Southern states — he owned " dozens of slaves in Fort Hill , South Carolina " . To protect minority rights against majority rule , he called for a concurrent majority whereby the minority could sometimes block proposals that it felt infringed on their liberties . To this end , Calhoun supported states ' rights and nullification , through which states could declare null and void federal laws that they viewed as unconstitutional . Calhoun was one of the " Great Triumvirate " or the " Immortal Trio " of Congressional leaders , along with his Congressional colleagues Daniel Webster and Henry Clay . In 1957 , a Senate Committee selected Calhoun as one of the five greatest United States Senators of all time . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Caldwell Calhoun was born in Abbeville District , South Carolina on March 18 , 1782 , the fourth child of Patrick Calhoun ( 1727 – 1796 ) and his wife Martha Caldwell . His father had joined the Scotch @-@ Irish immigration from County Donegal to the backcountry of South Carolina . Patrick Calhoun belonged to the Calhoun clan in the tight @-@ knit Scots @-@ Irish community on the Southern frontier . He was known as an Indian fighter and an ambitious surveyor , farmer , planter and politician . As a Presbyterian , he stood opposed to the Anglican elite based in Charleston . He was a Patriot in the American Revolution , and opposed ratification of the federal Constitution on grounds of states ' rights and personal liberties . These opinions helped shape his son 's attitudes regarding these issues . 
 Young Calhoun showed scholastic talent , and although schools were scarce on the Carolina frontier , he was enrolled briefly in an academy in Georgia , which soon closed . He continued his studies privately . However , when his father died , his brothers were away starting business careers so 14 year old Calhoun took over management of the family farm and five other farms . For four years he simultaneously kept up his reading and his hunting and fishing . The family decided he should continue his education , so he resumed study of Latin , Greek , history , and mathematics under a local tutor . 
 With financing from his brothers , he went to Yale College in Connecticut in 1802 . For the first time he encountered serious , advanced , well @-@ organized intellectual dialogue that could shape his mind . Yale was dominated by President Timothy Dwight , a Federalist who became his mentor . Dwight 's brilliance entranced ( and sometimes repelled ) Calhoun . Biographer John Niven says : 
 Calhoun admired Dwight 's extemporaneous sermons , his seemingly encyclopedic knowledge , and his awesome mastery of the classics , of the tenets of Calvinism , and of metaphysics . No one , he thought , could explicate the language of John Locke with such clarity . 
 Dwight repeatedly denounced Jeffersonian democracy , and Calhoun challenged him in class . Dwight could not shake Calhoun 's commitment to republicanism . " Young man , " retorted Dwight , " your talents are of a high order and might justify you for any station , but I deeply regret that you do not love sound principles better than sophistry – you seem to possess a most unfortunate bias for error . " Dwight also expounded on the strategy of secession from the Union as a legitimate solution for New England 's disagreements with the national government . 
 Calhoun made friends easily , read widely , and was a noted member of the debating society of Brothers in Unity . He graduated as valedictorian in 1804 . He studied law at the nation 's only real law school , Tapping Reeve Law School in Litchfield , Connecticut , where he worked with Tapping Reeve and James Gould . He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1807 . Biographer Margaret Coit argues that : 
 every principle of secession or states ' rights which Calhoun ever voiced can be traced right back to the thinking of intellectual New England ... Not the South , not slavery , but Yale College and Litchfield Law School made Calhoun a <unk> ... Dwight , Reeve , and Gould could not convince the young patriot from South Carolina as to the desirability of secession , but they left no doubts in his mind as to its legality . 
 = = Marriage , family , and religion = = 
 In January 1811 , Calhoun married Floride Bonneau Colhoun , a first cousin once removed . She was the daughter of wealthy United States Senator and lawyer John E. Colhoun , a leader of Charleston high society . The couple had ten children over eighteen years ; three died in infancy : Andrew Pickens Calhoun , Floride Pure Calhoun , Jane Calhoun , Anna Maria Calhoun , Elizabeth Calhoun , Patrick Calhoun , John Caldwell Calhoun , Jr . , Martha Cornelia Calhoun , James Edward Calhoun , and William Lowndes Calhoun . Calhoun 's fourth child , Anna Maria , married Thomas Green Clemson , founder of Clemson University in South Carolina . 
 While her husband was Vice President in the Jackson administration , Floride Calhoun was a central figure in the Petticoat affair , in which she humiliated key allies of President Andrew Jackson . Mrs. Calhoun was an active Episcopalian and Calhoun sometimes accompanied her to church . However , he was also a founding member of All Souls Unitarian Church in Washington , D.C. He rarely mentioned religion ; a Presbyterian in his early life , historians believe he was closest to the informal Unitarianism typified by Thomas Jefferson . In a letter he wrote to his daughter Anna Maria , Calhoun provided a clue to his religious thought : " Do our best , our duty for our country , and leave the rest to Providence . " In John C. Calhoun : American Portrait , Calhoun biographer Margaret Coit says that he was raised Calvinist , briefly affiliated with Unitarianism , and for most of his life remained somewhere between the two . Before he died , he was touched by the Second Great Awakening , a Protestant revival movement during the late 1700s and early 1800s . Historian Merrill Peterson describes Calhoun , " Intensely serious and severe , he could never write a love poem , though he often tried , because every line began with ' whereas ' ... "

 With a base among the Irish ( or Scotch Irish ) , Calhoun won election to the House of Representatives in 1810 . He immediately became a leader of the War Hawks , along with Speaker Henry Clay of Kentucky and South Carolina congressmen William Lowndes and Langdon <unk> . Brushing aside the vehement objections of anti @-@ war New Englanders , they demanded war against Britain to preserve American honor and republican values . In the spring of 1812 , Calhoun became the acting chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs . On June 3 , 1812 , Calhoun 's committee called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases , denouncing Britain 's " lust for power " , " unbounded tyranny " , and " mad ambition " . Historian James Roark says , " These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor . " The United States declared war on Britain on June 18 , thus inaugurating the War of 1812 . The opening phase involved multiple disasters for American arms , as well as a financial crisis when the Treasury could barely pay the bills . The conflict caused economic hardship for the Americans , as the Royal Navy blockaded the ports and cut off imports , exports and the coastal trade . Several attempted invasions of Canada were fiascos , but the U.S. in 1813 did seize control of Lake Erie and brake the power of hostile Indians in battles such as the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813 and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in Alabama in 1814 . 
 Calhoun labored to raise troops , provide funds , speed logistics , rescue the currency , and regulate commerce to aid the war effort . One colleague hailed him as , " the young Hercules who carried the war on his shoulders . " Disasters on the battlefield made him double his legislative efforts to overcome the obstructionism of John Randolph of Roanoke , Daniel Webster , and other opponents of the war . In December 1814 , with the armies of Napoleon Bonaparte apparently defeated , and the British invasions of New York and Baltimore thwarted , British and American diplomats signed the Treaty of Ghent . It called for a return to the borders of 1812 with no gains or losses . Before the treaty reached the Senate for ratification , and even before news of its signing reached New Orleans , a massive British invasion force was utterly defeated in January 1815 at the Battle of New Orleans , making a national hero of General Andrew Jackson . Americans celebrated what they called a " second war of independence " against Britain , and an " Era of Good Feelings " began . Calhoun , however , realized how badly prepared the nation had been in 1812 . 
 = = = Postwar planning = = = 
 The mismanagement of the Army during the war distressed Calhoun , and he resolved to strengthen and centralize the War Department . The militia had proven itself quite unreliable during the war and Calhoun saw the need for a permanent and professional military force . Historian Ulrich B. Phillips has traced Calhoun 's complex plans to permanently strengthen the nation 's military capabilities . In 1816 he called for building an effective navy , including steam frigates , as well as a standing army of adequate size . The British blockade of the coast had underscored the necessity of rapid means of internal transportation ; Calhoun proposed a system of " great permanent roads . " The blockade had cut off the import of manufactured items , so he emphasized the need to encourage more domestic manufacture , fully realizing that industry was based in the Northeast . The dependence of the old financial system on import duties was devastated when the blockade cut off imports . Calhoun called for a system of internal taxation which would pay for a future war , without reliance on tariffs . The expiration for the charter of the First Bank of the United States had also distressed the Treasury , so to reinvigorate and modernize the economy Calhoun called for a new national bank . A new bank was chartered as the Second Bank of the United States by President James Madison in 1816 . Throughout his proposals , Calhoun emphasized a national footing and downplayed sectionalism and states rights . Phillips says that at this stage of Calhoun 's career , " The word nation was often on his lips , and his conviction was to enhance national unity which he identified with national power . "

 Regarding his career in the House of Representatives , an observer commented that Calhoun was " the most elegant speaker that sits in the House ... His gestures are easy and graceful , his manner forcible , and language elegant ; but above all , he confines himself closely to the subject , which he always understands , and enlightens everyone within hearing . " 
 His talent for public speaking required systematic self @-@ discipline and practice . A later critic noted the sharp contrast between his hesitant conversations and his fluent speaking styles , adding that Calhoun " had so carefully cultivated his naturally poor voice as to make his utterance clear , full , and distinct in speaking and while not at all musical it yet fell pleasantly on the ear " . Calhoun was " a high @-@ strung man of ultra intellectual cast " . As such , Calhoun was not known for charisma . He was often seen as harsh and aggressive with other representatives . But he was a brilliant intellectual orator and strong organizer . Historian Russell Kirk says , " That zeal which flared like Greek fire in Randolph burned in Calhoun , too ; but it was contained in the Cast @-@ iron Man as in a furnace , and Calhoun 's passion glowed out only through his eyes . No man was more stately , more reserved . " 
 John Quincy Adams concluded in 1821 that " Calhoun is a man of fair and candid mind , of honorable principles , of clear and quick understanding , of cool self @-@ possession , of enlarged philosophical views , and of ardent patriotism . He is above all sectional and factious prejudices more than any other statesman of this Union with whom I have ever acted . " Historian Charles Wiltse noted Calhoun 's evolution , " Though he is known today primarily for his sectionalism , Calhoun was the last of the great political leaders of his time to take a sectional position — later than Daniel Webster , later than Henry Clay , later than Adams himself . " 
 = = Secretary of War and Postwar Nationalism = = 
 In 1817 , President James Monroe appointed Calhoun Secretary of War . He took office on December 8 and served until 1825 . Calhoun continued his role as a leading nationalist during the " Era of Good Feelings " . He proposed an elaborate program of national reforms to the infrastructure that would speed economic modernization . His first priority was an effective navy , including steam frigates , and in the second place a standing army of adequate size ; and as further preparation for emergency " great permanent roads " , " a certain encouragement " to manufactures , and a system of internal taxation which would not be subject to collapse by a war @-@ time shrinkage of maritime trade like customs duties . He spoke for a national bank , for internal improvements ( such as harbors , canals and river navigation ) and a protective tariff that would help the industrial Northeast and , especially , pay for the expensive new infrastructure . 
 After the war ended in 1815 the " Old Republicans " in Congress , with their Jeffersonian ideology for economy in the federal government , sought to reduce the operations and finances of the War Department . In 1817 , the deplorable state of the War Department led four men to decline offers to accept the Secretary of War position before Calhoun finally assumed the role . His political rivalry with William H. Crawford , the Secretary of the Treasury , over the pursuit of the presidency in the 1824 election complicated Calhoun 's tenure as War Secretary . In addition , Calhoun opposed the invasion of Florida launched in 1818 by General Jackson during the First Seminole War , which was done without direct authorization from Calhoun or President Monroe . The United States annexed Florida from Spain in 1819 through the Adams @-@ Onis Treaty . The subsequent peace meant that a large army , such as that preferred by Calhoun , was no longer considered necessary , and in 1821 significant cutbacks were made . 
 As secretary , Calhoun had responsibility for management of Indian affairs . He promoted a plan , adopted by Monroe in 1825 , to preserve the sovereignty of Eastern Indians by relocating them to western reservations they could control without interference from state governments . In over seven years Calhoun supervised the negotiation and ratification of 40 treaties with Indian tribes . A reform @-@ minded modernizer , he attempted to institute centralization and efficiency in the Indian department , but Congress either failed to respond to his reforms or responded with hostility . Calhoun 's frustration with congressional inaction , political rivalries , and ideological differences spurred him to create the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824 .

 Calhoun was initially a candidate for President of the United States in the election of 1824 . However , he failed to win the endorsement of the South Carolina legislature , and his supporters in Pennsylvania decided to abandon his candidacy in favor of that of Andrew Jackson , and instead supported him for vice president . Other states soon followed , and Calhoun therefore allowed himself to become a candidate for vice president rather than president . The Electoral College elected Calhoun vice president by a landslide . However , no presidential candidate received a majority in the Electoral College and the election was ultimately resolved by the House of Representatives , where John Quincy Adams was declared the winner over Crawford , Clay , and Jackson , who in the election had led Adams in both popular vote and electoral vote . After Clay , the Speaker of the House , was appointed Secretary of State by Adams , Jackson 's supporters denounced what they considered a " corrupt bargain " between Adams and Clay to give Adams the presidency in exchange for Clay receiving the office of Secretary of State . Calhoun also expressed some concerns , which caused friction between him and Adams . 
 Disillusioned with Adams ' high tariff policies and increased centralization , Calhoun wrote to Jackson on June 4 , 1826 , informing him that he would support Jackson 's second campaign for the presidency in 1828 . The two were never particularly close friends . Calhoun never fully trusted Jackson , a frontiersman and popular war hero , but hoped that his election would bring some reprieve from Adams 's anti @-@ states ' rights policies . Jackson selected Calhoun as his running mate , and together they defeated Adams and his running mate Richard Rush . Calhoun thus became the second of two vice presidents to serve under two different presidents , the other being George Clinton , who served as Vice President from 1805 to 1812 under Thomas Jefferson and James Madison . 
 However , Calhoun 's service under Jackson also proved contentious due largely to the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair . 
 = = = Nullification = = = 
 Calhoun had begun to oppose increases in protective tariffs , as they generally benefitted Northerners more than Southerners . While Vice President in the Adams administration , Jackson 's supporters devised a high tariff legislation that placed duties on imports that were also made in New England . Calhoun had been assured that the northeastern interests would reject the Tariff of 1828 , exposing pro @-@ Adams New England congressmen to charges that they selfishly opposed legislation popular among Jacksonian Democrats in the west and Mid @-@ Atlantic States . The southern legislators miscalculated and the so @-@ called " Tariff of Abominations " passed . Frustrated , Calhoun returned to his South Carolina plantation to write " South Carolina Exposition and Protest , " an essay rejecting the centralization philosophy . The dispute led to the Nullification Crisis . 
 Calhoun supported the idea of nullification through a concurrent majority . Nullification is a legal theory that a state has the right to nullify , or invalidate , any federal law which that state has deemed unconstitutional . In Calhoun 's words , it is " the right of a State to interpose , in the last resort , in order to arrest an unconstitutional act of the General Government , within its limits . " Nullification can be traced back to arguments by Jefferson and Madison in writing the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 against the Alien and Sedition Acts . Madison expressed the hope that the states would declare the acts unconstitutional , while Jefferson explicitly endorsed nullification . Calhoun openly argued for a state 's right to secede from the Union , as a last resort , in order to protect its liberty and sovereignty . Madison rebuked supporters of nullification , stating that no state had the right to nullify federal law . 
 In his 1828 essay " South Carolina Exposition and Protest " , Calhoun argued that a state could veto any federal law that went beyond the enumerated powers and encroached upon the residual powers of the State . President Jackson , meanwhile , generally supported states ' rights , but was strongly against nullification and secession . At the 1830 Jefferson Day dinner at Jesse Brown 's Indian Queen Hotel , Jackson proposed a toast and proclaimed , " Our federal Union , it must be preserved . " Calhoun replied , " the Union , next to our liberty , the most dear . " 
 In May 1830 , Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure then @-@ General Jackson for his invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War . Jackson had invaded Florida during the First Seminole War without explicit public authorization from Calhoun or Monroe . Calhoun 's and Jackson 's relationship deteriorated further . By February 1831 , the break between Calhoun and Jackson was final . Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud , Calhoun had published letters between him and Jackson detailing the conflict in the United States Telegraph . Jackson and Calhoun began an angry correspondence which lasted until Jackson stopped it in July . 
 Jackson sent U.S. Navy warships to Charleston harbor , and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession . Tensions eased after both sides agreed to the Compromise Tariff of 1833 on March 2 , which was proposed by Henry Clay , now a Whig senator , to change the tariff law in a manner which satisfied Calhoun , who by then was in the Senate . On the same day , Congress passed the Force Bill , which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with Federal law . South Carolina then nullified the Force Bill . In Calhoun 's speech on the Force Bill , delivered on February 5 , 1833 , no longer as vice president , he strongly endorsed nullification , at one point saying : 
 Why , then , confer on the President the extensive and unlimited powers provided in this bill ? Why authorize him to use military force to arrest the civil process of the State ? But one answer can be given : That , in a contest between the State and the General Government , if the resistance be limited on both sides to the civil process , the State , by its inherent sovereignty , standing upon its reserved powers , will prove too powerful in such a controversy , and must triumph over the Federal Government , sustained by its delegated and limited authority ; and in this answer we have an acknowledgment of the truth of those great principles for which the State has so firmly and nobly contended .

 The Petticoat affair ended friendly relations between Calhoun and Jackson . Floride Calhoun organized Cabinet wives ( hence the term " petticoats " ) against Peggy Eaton , wife of Secretary of War John Eaton , and refused to associate with her . They alleged that John and Peggy Eaton had engaged in an adulterous affair while she was still legally married to her first husband , and that her recent behavior was unladylike . The allegations of scandal created an intolerable situation for Jackson . 
 Jackson sided with the Eatons . He and his wife Rachel Donelson had undergone similar political attacks stemming from their marriage in 1791 , which occurred despite the fact that , unknown to them , Rachel 's previous husband had failed to finalize their divorce . He saw attacks on Eaton stemming ultimately from the political opposition of Calhoun , who had failed to silence his wife 's criticisms . At the suggestion of Secretary of State Martin Van Buren , who had sided with the Eatons , Jackson replaced all but one of his Cabinet members , thereby limiting Calhoun 's influence . Van Buren began the process by resigning as Secretary of State , facilitating Jackson 's removal of others . Van Buren thereby grew in favor with Jackson , while the rift between the President and Calhoun was widened . Later , in 1832 , Calhoun cast a tie @-@ breaking vote against Van Buren 's confirmation as Minister to Great Britain in a failed attempt to end his political career . 
 = = = Resignation = = = 
 As tensions over nullification escalated , South Carolina Senator Robert Hayne was considered less capable than Calhoun to lead the Senate debates . So in late 1832 Hayne resigned to become governor . On December 28 , Calhoun resigned as vice president to become a senator , with a voice in the debates . Van Buren had already been elected as Jackson 's new vice president , meaning that Calhoun had less than 3 months left on his term anyway . Calhoun was the first of two vice presidents to resign , the second being Spiro Agnew in 1973 . 
 = = First term in the U.S. Senate = = 
 When Calhoun took his seat in the Senate on December 29 , 1832 , his chances of becoming President were considered poor due to his involvement in the Nullification Crisis . After implementation of the Compromise Tariff of 1833 , which helped solve the Nullification Crisis , the <unk> Party , along with other anti @-@ Jackson politicians , formed a coalition known as the Whig Party . Calhoun sometimes affiliated with the Whigs , but chose to remain a virtual independent due to the Whig promotion of federally subsidized " internal improvements " and a national bank . Many Southern politicians opposed these as benefiting Northern industrial interests . By 1837 Calhoun generally had realigned himself with most of the Democrats ' policies . 
 To restore his national stature , Calhoun cooperated with Jackson 's chosen successor , Van Buren , who became president in 1837 . Democrats were very hostile to national banks , and the country 's bankers had joined the Whig Party . The Democratic replacement , meant to help combat the Panic of 1837 , was the " Independent Treasury " system , which Calhoun supported and which went into effect . Calhoun , like Jackson and Van Buren , attacked finance capitalism , which he saw as the common enemy of the Northern laborer , the Southern planter , and every small farmer . Despite being opposed to the concept of political parties , he worked to unite these groups in the Democratic Party , and to dedicate that party to states ' rights and agricultural interests as barriers against encroachment by government and big business . Calhoun resigned from the Senate on March 4 , 1843 , four years before the expiration of his term , and returned to Fort Hill to prepare an attempt to win the Democratic nomination for the 1844 presidential election . However , he gained little support , and decided to quit . Former Tennessee Governor and House Speaker James K. Polk , a strong Jacksonian , eventually won the nomination and the general election , in which he defeated Clay .

 When Whig president William Henry Harrison died in 1841 after a month in office , Vice President John Tyler succeeded him . Tyler was a former Democrat who was expelled from the Whig Party as president after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs . He named Calhoun Secretary of State on April 10 , 1844 , following the death of Abel P. Upshur in the USS Princeton disaster . A major crisis emerged from the persistent Oregon boundary dispute between Great Britain and the United States , due to an increasing number of American migrants . The territory included most of present @-@ day British Columbia , Washington , Oregon , and Idaho . American expansionists used the slogan " 54 @-@ 40 or fight " in reference to the Northern boundary coordinates of the Oregon territory . The parties compromised , ending the war threat , by splitting the area down the middle at the 49th parallel , with the British acquiring British Columbia and the Americans accepting Washington and Oregon . Calhoun , along with President Polk and Secretary of State James Buchanan , continued work on the treaty while he was a senator , and it was ratified by a vote of 41 – 14 on June 18 , 1846 . 
 = = = Texas = = = 
 Tyler and Calhoun were eager to annex the independent Republic of Texas , which wanted to join the Union . Texas was slave country and anti @-@ slavery elements in the North denounced annexation as a plot to enlarge the " Slave Power " . When the Senate could not muster a two @-@ thirds vote to pass a treaty of annexation with Texas , Calhoun devised a joint resolution of the Houses of Congress , which secured the simple majority required , and Texas joined the Union . Mexico had warned repeatedly that it would go to war if Texas joined the Union . In response to the United States presence in Texas , the Mexican – American War broke out in 1846 . 
 = = Second term in the Senate = = 
 Calhoun was reelected to the Senate in 1845 following the resignation of Daniel Elliott Huger , and opposed the Mexican – American War . He believed that it would distort the national character by undermining republicanism in favor of empire and by bringing non @-@ white persons into the country . ( See The Evils of War and Political Parties . ) He ultimately chose to abstain from voting on the war measure . Calhoun also vigorously opposed the Wilmot Proviso , an 1846 proposal by Pennsylvania Representative David Wilmot to ban slavery in all newly acquired territories . The House of Representatives , through its Northern majority , passed the provision several times . However , the Senate , where non @-@ slave and slave states had more equal representation , never passed the measure . Calhoun supported Whig candidate and slaveholder Zachary Taylor for president in 1848 over Democratic candidate Lewis Cass , a Northerner who favored popular sovereignty to determine a new state 's slaveholding status . 
 = = = Rejection of the Compromise of 1850 = = = 
 The Compromise of 1850 , devised by Clay and Stephen Douglas , a first @-@ term Democratic senator from Illinois , was designed to solve the controversy over the status of slavery in the vast new territories acquired from Mexico . Calhoun , weeks from death and too feeble to speak , wrote a blistering attack on the compromise that would become most likely his most famous speech . On March 4 , a friend , Senator James Mason of Virginia , read the remarks . Calhoun affirmed the right of the South to leave the Union in response to Northern subjugation . He warned that the day " the balance between the two sections " was destroyed would be a day not far removed from disunion , anarchy , and civil war . Calhoun queried how the Union might be preserved in light of subjugation by the " stronger " party against the " weaker " one . He maintained that the responsibility of solving the question lay entirely on the North — as the stronger section , to allow the Southern minority an equal share in governance and to cease the agitation . He added , " If you who represent the stronger portion , cannot agree to settle them on the broad principle of justice and duty , say so ; and let the States we both represent agree to separate and part in peace . If you are unwilling we should part in peace , tell us so ; and we shall know what to do , when you reduce the question to submission or resistance . " 
 Calhoun died soon afterwards , and although the compromise measures did eventually pass , Calhoun 's ideas about states ' rights attracted increasing attention across the South . Historian William Barney argues that Calhoun 's ideas proved " appealing to Southerners concerned with preserving slavery ... Southern radicals known as ' fire @-@ eaters ' pushed the doctrine of states rights to its logical extreme by whole upholding the constitutional right of the state to secede . " 
 = = Death and burial = = 
 Calhoun died at the Old Brick Capitol boarding house in Washington , D.C. , on March 31 , 1850 , of tuberculosis , at the age of 68 . He was interred at the St. Philip 's Churchyard in Charleston , South Carolina . During the Civil War , a group of Calhoun 's friends were concerned about the possible desecration of his grave by Federal troops and , during the night , removed his coffin to a hiding place under the stairs of the church . The next night , his coffin was buried in an unmarked grave near the church , where it remained until 1871 , when it was again exhumed and returned to its original place . 
 Calhoun 's widow , Floride , died on July 25 , 1866 , and was buried in St. Paul 's Episcopal Church Cemetery in Pendleton , South Carolina , near their children , but apart from her husband .

 = = = Agrarian republicanism = = = 
 Historian Lee H. Cheek , Jr . , distinguishes between two strands of American republicanism : 
 the puritan tradition , based in New England ; and 
 the agrarian or South Atlantic tradition , which Cheek argues was espoused by Calhoun . 
 While the New England tradition stressed a politically centralized enforcement of moral and religious norms to secure civic virtue , the South Atlantic tradition relied on a decentralized moral and religious order based on the idea of subsidiarity ( or localism ) . Cheek maintains the " Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions " ( 1798 ) , written by Jefferson and Madison , were the cornerstone of Calhoun 's republicanism . Calhoun emphasized the primacy of subsidiarity — holding that popular rule is best expressed in local communities that are nearly autonomous while serving as units of a larger society . 
 = = = Slavery = = = 
 Calhoun led the pro @-@ slavery faction in the Senate , opposing both abolitionism and attempts such as the Wilmot Proviso to limit the expansion of slavery into the western territories . He was a major advocate of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law , which required the cooperation of local law enforcement officials in free states to return escaped slaves . 
 Calhoun 's father , Patrick Calhoun , helped shape his son 's political views . He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on a commitment to the ideal of popular self @-@ government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves . <unk> in a world in which slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization , Calhoun saw little reason to question its morality as an adult . He believed that the spread of slavery improved public morals by ridding the countryside of the shiftless poor whites who had once held the region back . He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic @-@ mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed . From such a standpoint , the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self @-@ worth , as had happened in New England . Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream . 
 Whereas other Southern politicians had excused slavery as a " necessary evil " , in a famous speech on the Senate floor on February 6 , 1837 , Calhoun asserted that slavery was a " positive good " . He rooted this claim on two grounds : white supremacy and paternalism . All societies , Calhoun claimed , are ruled by an elite group which enjoys the fruits of the labor of a less @-@ exceptional group . Senator William Rives of Virginia earlier had referred to slavery as an evil that might become a " lesser evil " in some circumstances . Calhoun believed that conceded too much to the abolitionists : 
 I take higher ground . I hold that in the present state of civilization , where two races of different origin , and distinguished by color , and other physical differences , as well as intellectual , are brought together , the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two , is , instead of an evil , a good — a positive good ... I may say with truth , that in few countries so much is left to the share of the laborer , and so little exacted from him , or where there is more kind attention paid to him in sickness or infirmities of age . Compare his condition with the tenants of the poor houses in the more civilized portions of Europe — look at the sick , and the old and infirm slave , on one hand , in the midst of his family and friends , under the kind superintending care of his master and mistress , and compare it with the forlorn and wretched condition of the pauper in the poorhouse ... I hold then , that there never has yet existed a wealthy and civilized society in which one portion of the community did not , in point of fact , live on the labor of the other . 
 Calhoun rejected the belief of Southern leaders such as Henry Clay that all Americans could agree on the " opinion and feeling " that slavery was wrong , although they might disagree on the most practicable way to respond to that great wrong . Calhoun 's constitutional ideas acted as a viable conservative alternative to Northern appeals to democracy , majority rule , and natural rights . 
 In addition to providing the intellectual justification of slavery , Calhoun played a central role in devising the South 's overall political strategy . According to Phillips : 
 Organization and strategy were widely demanded in Southern defense , and Calhoun came to be regarded as the main source of plans , arguments , and inspiration . His devices were manifold : to suppress agitation , to praise the slaveholding system ; to promote Southern prosperity and expansion ; to procure a Western alliance ; to frame a fresh plan of government by concurrent majorities ; to form a Southern bloc ; to warn the North of the dangers of Southern desperation ; to appeal for Northern magnanimity as indispensable for the saving of the Union . 
 = = = The evils of war and political parties = = = 
 Calhoun was consistently opposed to the War with Mexico from the outset , arguing that an enlarged military effort would only feed the alarming and growing lust of the public for empire regardless of its constitutional dangers , bloat executive powers and patronage , and saddle the republic with a soaring debt that would disrupt finances and encourage speculation . Calhoun feared , moreover , that Southern slave owners would be shut out of any conquered Mexican territories , as nearly happened with the Wilmot Proviso . He argued that the war would detrimentally lead to the annexation of all of Mexico , which would bring Mexicans into the country , whom he considered deficient in moral and intellectual terms . He said , in a speech on January 4 , 1848 : 
 We make a great mistake , sir , when we suppose that all people are capable of self @-@ government . We are anxious to force free government on all ; and I see that it has been urged in a very respectable quarter , that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world , and especially over this continent . It is a great mistake . None but people advanced to a very high state of moral and intellectual improvement are capable , in a civilized state , of maintaining free government ; and amongst those who are so purified , very few , indeed , have had the good fortune of forming a constitution capable of endurance . 
 Anti @-@ slavery Northerners denounced the war as a Southern conspiracy to expand slavery ; Calhoun in turn perceived a connivance of Yankees to destroy the South . By 1847 he decided the Union was threatened by a totally corrupt party system . He believed that in their lust for office , patronage and spoils , politicians in the North pandered to the anti @-@ slavery vote , especially during presidential campaigns , and politicians in the slave states sacrificed Southern rights in an effort to placate the Northern wings of their parties . Thus , the essential first step in any successful assertion of Southern rights had to be the jettisoning of all party ties . In 1848 – 49 , Calhoun tried to give substance to his call for Southern unity . He was the driving force behind the drafting and publication of the " Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress , to Their Constituents . " It alleged Northern violations of the constitutional rights of the South , then warned southern voters to expect forced emancipation of slaves in the near future , followed by their complete subjugation by an unholy alliance of unprincipled Northerners and blacks . Whites would flee and the South would " become the permanent abode of disorder , anarchy , poverty , misery , and wretchedness . " Only the immediate and unflinching unity of Southern whites could prevent such a disaster . Such unity would either bring the North to its senses or lay the foundation for an independent South . But the spirit of union was still strong in the region and fewer than 40 % of the southern congressmen signed the address , and only one Whig . 
 Many Southerners believed his warnings and read every political news story from the North as further evidence of the planned destruction of the southern way of life . The climax came a decade after Calhoun 's death with the election of Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860 , which led to the secession of South Carolina , followed by six other Southern states . They formed the new Confederate States , which , in accord with Calhoun 's theory , did not have any political parties . 
 = = = Concurrent majority = = = 
 Calhoun 's basic concern for protecting the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science — the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority . According to the principle of a numerical majority , the will of the more numerous citizens should always rule , regardless of the burdens on the minority . Such a principle tends toward a consolidation of power in which the interests of the absolute majority always prevail over those of the minority . Calhoun believed that the great achievement of the American constitution was in checking the tyranny of a numerical majority through institutional procedures that required a concurrent majority , such that each important interest in the community must consent to the actions of government . To secure a concurrent majority , those interests that have a numerical majority must compromise with the interests that are in the minority . A concurrent majority requires a unanimous consent of all the major interests in a community , which is the only sure way of preventing tyranny of the majority . This idea supported Calhoun 's doctrine of interposition or nullification , in which the state governments could refuse to enforce or comply with a policy of the Federal government that threatened the vital interests of the states . 
 Historian Richard Hofstadter ( 1948 ) emphasizes that Calhoun 's conception of minority was very different from the minorities of a century later : 
 Not in the slightest was [ Calhoun ] concerned with minority rights as they are chiefly of interest to the modern liberal mind – the rights of dissenters to express unorthodox opinions , of the individual conscience against the State , least of all of ethnic minorities . At bottom he was not interested in any minority that was not a propertied minority . The concurrent majority itself was a device without relevance to the protection of dissent , designed to protect a vested interest of considerable power ... it was minority privileges rather than [ minority ] rights that he really proposed to protect . 
 Unlike Jefferson , Calhoun rejected attempts at economic , social , or political leveling , claiming that true equality could not be achieved if all classes were given equal rights and responsibilities . Rather , to ensure true prosperity , it was necessary for a stronger group to provide protection and care for the weaker one . This meant that the two groups should not be equal before the law . For Calhoun , " protection " ( order ) was more important than freedom . Individual rights were something to be earned , not something bestowed by nature or God . Calhoun was concerned with protecting the interests of the Southern States ( which he identified with the interests of their slaveholding elites ) as a distinct and beleaguered minority among the members of the federal Union . However his idea of a concurrent majority as a protection for minority rights has gained some acceptance in American political thought . Political scientist Malcolm Jewell argues , " The decision @-@ making process in this country resembles John Calhoun 's ' concurrent majority ' : A large number of groups both within and outside the government must , in practice , approve any major policy . " 
 = = = = Disquisition on Government = = = = 
 The Disquisition on Government is a 100 @-@ page essay on Calhoun 's definitive and comprehensive ideas on government , which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion . It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes , sections , and interests and , similarly , that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy . 
 Calhoun offered the concurrent majority as the key to achieving consensus , a formula by which a minority interest had the option to nullify objectionable legislation passed by a majority interest . The consensus would be effected by this tactic of nullification , a veto that would suspend the law within the boundaries of the state . 
 Veto power was linked to the right of secession , which portended anarchy and social chaos . Constituencies would call for compromise to prevent this outcome . With a concurrent majority in place , the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the Federal Judiciary would no longer exert collective authority over the various states . According to the ( Supremacy Clause ) located in Article 6 , laws made by the federal government are the " supreme law of the land " only when they are made " in pursuance " of the U.S. Constitution . 
 These ideas are convincing if one shares Calhoun 's conviction that a functioning concurrent majority never leads to stalemate in the legislature ; rather , talented statesmen , practiced in the arts of conciliation and compromise would pursue " the common good " , however explosive the issue . His formula promised to produce laws satisfactory to all interests . The ultimate goal of these mechanisms were to facilitate the authentic will of the white populace . Calhoun explicitly rejected the founding principles of equality in the Declaration of Independence , denying that humanity is born free and equal in shared nature and basic needs . He regarded this precept as " the most false and dangerous of all political errors " . States could constitutionally take action to free themselves from an overweening government , but slaves as individuals or interest groups could not do so . Calhoun 's stance assumed that with the establishment of a concurrent majority , minority groups would influence their own representatives sufficiently to have a voice in public affairs ; the representatives would perform strictly as high @-@ minded public servants . Under this scenario , the political leadership would improve and persist , corruption and demagoguery would subside , and the interests of the people would be honored . This introduces the second theme in the Disquisition , and a counterpoint to his concept of the concurrent majority — political corruption . 
 Calhoun considered the concurrent majority essential to provide structural restraints to governance , believing that " a vast majority of mankind is entirely biased by motives of self @-@ interest and that by this interest must be governed " . This innate selfishness would inevitably emerge when government revenue became available to political parties for distribution as patronage . Politicians and bureaucrats would succumb to the lure of government <unk> accumulated through taxation , tariff duties and public land sales . Even a diminishment of massive revenue effected through nullification by the permanent minority would not eliminate these temptations . Calhoun predicted that electioneering , political conspiracies , and outright fraud would be employed to mislead and distract a gullible public ; inevitably , perfidious demagogues would come to rule the political scene . A decline in authority among the principal statesmen would follow , and , ultimately , the eclipse of the concurrent majority . 
 Calhoun contended that however confused and misled the masses were by political opportunists , any efforts to impose majority rule upon a minority would be thwarted by a minority veto . What Calhoun fails to explain , according to American historian William W. Freehling , is how a compromise would be achieved in the aftermath of a minority veto , when the ubiquitous demagogues betray their constituencies and abandon the concurrent majority altogether . Calhoun 's two key concepts – the maintenance of the concurrent majority by high @-@ minded statesmen on the one hand ; and the inevitable rise of demagogues who undermine consensus on the other – are never reconciled or resolved in the Disquisition . 
 South Carolina and other Southern states , in the three decades preceding the Civil War , provided legislatures in which the vested interests of land and slaves dominated in the upper houses , while the popular will of the numerical majority prevailed in the lower houses . There was little opportunity for demagogues to establish themselves in this political milieu – the democratic component among the people was too weak to sustain a plebeian politician . The conservative statesmen – the slaveholding gentry – retained control over the political apparatus . Freehling described the state 's political system of the era thus : 
 [ T ] he apportionment of [ state ] legislative seats gave the small majority of low country aristocrats control of the senate and a disproportionate influence in the house . Political power in South Carolina was uniquely concentrated in a legislature of large property holders who set state policy and selected the men to administer it . The characteristics of South Carolina politics cemented the control of upper class planters . Elections to the state legislature – the one control the masses could exert over the government – were often uncontested and rarely allowed the " plebeian " a clear choice between two parties or policies ... 
 The Disquisition was published shortly after his death , as was another book , Discourse on the Constitution and Government of the United States . 
 John C. Calhoun on the " concurrent majority " from his Disquisition ( 1850 ) 
 If the whole community had the same interests , so that the interests of each and every portion would be so affected by the action of the government , that the laws which oppressed or impoverished one portion , would necessarily oppress and impoverish all others – or the reverse – then the right of suffrage , of itself , would be all @-@ sufficient to counteract the tendency of the government to oppression and abuse of its powers . ... But such is not the case . On the contrary , nothing is more difficult than to equalize the action of the government , in reference to the various and diversified interests of the community ; and nothing more easy than to pervert its powers into instruments to <unk> and enrich one or more interests by oppressing and impoverishing the others ; and this too , under the operation of laws , couched in general terms – and which , on their face , appear fair and equal . ... Such being the case , it necessarily results , that the right of suffrage , by placing the control of the government in the community must ... lead to conflict among its different interests – each striving to obtain possession of its powers , as the means of protecting itself against the others – or of advancing its respective interests , regardless of the interests of others . For this purpose , a struggle will take place between the various interests to obtain a majority , in order to control the government . If no one interest be strong enough , of itself , to obtain it , a combination will be formed . ... [ and ] the community will be divided into two great parties – a major and minor – between which there will be incessant struggles on the one side to retain , and on the other to obtain the majority – and , thereby , the control of the government and the advantages it confers . 
 = = = State Sovereignty and the " Calhoun Doctrine " = = = 
 In the 1840s three interpretations of the Constitutional powers of Congress to deal with slavery in territories emerged : the " free @-@ soil doctrine " , the " Calhoun doctrine " , and " popular sovereignty " . The Free Soilers said Congress had the power to outlaw slavery in the territories . The popular sovereignty position said the voters living there should decide . The Calhoun doctrine said Congress and the citizens the territories could never outlaw slavery in the territories . 
 In what historian Robert R. Russell calls the " Calhoun Doctrine " , Calhoun argued that the Federal Government 's role in the territories was only that of the trustee or agent of the several sovereign states : it was obliged not to discriminate among the states and hence was incapable of forbidding the bringing into any territory of anything that was legal property in any state . Calhoun argued that citizens from every state had the right to take their property to any territory . Congress and local voters , he asserted , had no authority to place restrictions on slavery in the territories . As Constitutional historian Hermann von Holst noted , " Calhoun 's doctrine made it a solemn constitutional duty of the United States government and of the American people to act as if the existence or non @-@ existence of slavery in the Territories did not concern them in the least . " The Calhoun Doctrine was vehemently opposed by the Free Soil forces , which merged into the new Republican Party around 1854 . Chief Justice Roger B. Taney based his decision in the 1857 Supreme Court case Dred Scott v. Sandford , in which he ruled that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in any of the territories , upon Calhoun 's arguments .

 Lake Calhoun , a lake of the Chain of Lakes in Minneapolis , was named after Calhoun by surveyors sent by Calhoun during his tenure as Secretary of War to map the area around Fort Snelling in 1817 . 
 The Confederate government honored Calhoun on a one @-@ cent postage stamp , which was printed in 1862 but was never officially released . 
 Calhoun is the namesake of John C. Calhoun Community College in Decatur , Alabama . Calhoun was also honored by his alma mater , Yale University , which named one of its undergraduate residential colleges " Calhoun College " . A sculpture of Calhoun appears on the exterior of Harkness Tower , a prominent campus landmark . The Clemson University campus in South Carolina occupies the site of Calhoun 's Fort Hill plantation , which he bequeathed to his wife and daughter . They sold it and its 50 slaves to a relative . They received $ 15 @,@ 000 for the 1 @,@ 100 acres ( 450 ha ) and $ 29 @,@ 000 for the slaves ( they were valued at about $ 600 apiece ) . When that owner died , Thomas Green Clemson foreclosed the mortgage . He later bequeathed the property to the state for use as an agricultural college to be named after him . 
 Many different places , streets and schools were named after Calhoun , as may be seen on the above list . The " Immortal Trio " were memorialized with streets in Uptown New Orleans . Calhoun Landing , on the Santee @-@ Cooper River in Santee , South Carolina , was named after him . In 1887 , a monument to Calhoun was erected in Marion Square in Charleston . However , it was not well @-@ liked by the residents and was replaced in 1896 by a different monument still in existence . The USS John C.

 = = = Historical reputation = = = 
 Calhoun is often remembered for his defense of minority rights by use of the " concurrent majority " . He is also noted and criticized for his strong defense of slavery . These positions played an enormous role in influencing Southern secessionist leaders . During his lifetime and after , Calhoun was seen as one of the Senate 's most important figures . In 1957 , a Senate committee selected Calhoun as one of the five greatest United States senators in history . 
 Recently , however , Calhoun 's reputation has suffered due to his defense of slavery . 
 The racially @-@ motivated Charleston church shooting in South Carolina , in June 2015 , reinvigorated demands for the removal of monuments dedicated to prominent pro @-@ slavery and Confederate States figures . That month , the monument to Calhoun in Charleston was found vandalized , with spray @-@ painted denunciations of Calhoun as a racist and a defender of slavery . 
 In July 2015 a group of Yale students requested in a petition that Yale rename the Calhoun College , one of the University 's twelve residential colleges . According to an April 2016 article in the New York Times , Yale President Peter Salovey announced that " despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests , " Calhoun 's name will remain on a Yale residential dormitory . In the article Calhoun was described as the United States ' " most egregious racist " and " an avowed white supremacist . " Salovey explained as he announced the contentious decision — that it is preferable for Yale students to live in Calhoun 's " shadow " so they will be " better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future . " He claimed that if they removed Calhoun 's name , it would " obscure " his " legacy of slavery rather than addressing it . " 
 In his defense , Wilson ( 2015 ) argues : 
 Your ordinary run @-@ of @-@ the mill historian will tell you that John C. Calhoun , having defended the bad and lost causes of state rights and slavery , deserves to rest forever in the dustbin of history . Nothing could be further from the truth . No American public figure after the generation of the Founding Fathers has more to say to later times than Calhoun . "

 Boortz began his radio career in College Station , Texas in the 1960s at <unk> @-@ AM , under the name of Randy Neal , while attending Texas A & M University . In 1967 , after leaving Texas , Boortz moved to Atlanta and landed a sales job . For two years he worked at Rich 's Department Store , where he sold jewelry and carpeting . He later recollected that one of his customers was Martin Luther King , Jr . During that time , Boortz was an avid listener of WRNG @-@ AM , which called itself " Ring Radio " , Atlanta 's first talk radio station . He listened to their morning talk show host , Herb Elfman , and soon became a devotee . " Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls , reading him little scripts he 'd scribbled . " While watching the news one evening , he heard that Elfman had committed suicide . The next morning , Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman 's place . Even though the management told him that " they were going to search for a ' qualified ' host to take his place " , Boortz was offered to be a temporary two @-@ week replacement . In the interim , the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening . Two weeks later , Boortz was moved to the morning show , embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years . Boortz honed his skills at the tiny 1 @,@ 000 @-@ watt station , and even wrote a few speeches for then Georgia Governor Lester Maddox . He continued working at the station until 1974 , when WRNG " dumped him " . He worked briefly at a radio station in Schenectady , New York , but soon returned to Atlanta . 
 In 1974 , Boortz enrolled in then @-@ unaccredited John Marshall Law School ( Atlanta ) going to class in his spare time , while he and his wife Donna worked full @-@ time loading mail trucks . Boortz credits his wife with providing " the money to keep me in law school " . After graduating from law school in 1977 , Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993 . During that period , he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio . One of Boortz 's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield . Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team in the aftermath of a failed Subaru dealership investment . Boortz told Atlanta Magazine " It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer . It was settled and disappeared . " Some time later , in a heated on @-@ air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz , Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship : Campbell ( sarcastically ) : By the way , Neal , Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he 's doing now and the fact he 's getting ready to open up his 57 @,@ 000 square @-@ foot , $ 20 million home . How he 's fighting for $ 35 million a fight . I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him . He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road . He was fighting for about $ 20 @,@ 000 a fight . It 's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well @-@ being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an " unethical son of a bitch " . Boortz later remarked " It 's the only time I 've ever been on the air that I lost control . " In 1993 , Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full @-@ time to his radio career .

 Boortz is a self @-@ described libertarian . He advocates a complete overhaul of the U.S. tax system and the release of all non @-@ violent drug offenders who are currently in prison . He has supported Republican candidates and Republican tax policy , though he occasionally clashes with Republicans on social issues . Others describe his political views as being more in line with " <unk> " philosophy that embraces <unk> domestically , and a generally interventionist foreign policy based on self @-@ interest , national defense and the expansion of freedom . Boortz disagrees with the Libertarian Party platform on several key issues including his firm support of the war in Iraq , incremental tax reform , and his opposition to the unrestricted immigration policy advocated by the Libertarian Party . 
 Boortz criticizes the major parties saying " I believe that the principal difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do . " He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion , same @-@ sex marriage , and civil liberties . He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating less government spending and decreasing corporate regulation . He is an advocate for freedom of speech . In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party , Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs , and emphasizing personal responsibility . He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man @-@ made . His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans , who , due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians , make up the majority of his listeners and callers . 
 Boortz 's post @-@ 9 / 11 platforms include support for the US @-@ led War on Terror , a more aggressive foreign policy , and the USA Patriot Act . He is also strongly in favor of a crackdown on illegal immigration , including harsh penalties for businesses who employ persons here illegally . These views occasionally put him in conflict with the Libertarian Party . Justin Raimondo of <unk> has called Boortz a " statist , not a libertarian " and a " <unk> " and has urged the Libertarian Party to " Boot Boortz " . 
 Prior to the 2006 midterm elections , Boortz opined that perhaps it would be a good thing to have the Republicans lose power in Congress , forcing them to wake up and stop taking their base for granted . Boortz told one disgruntled caller : 
 I am happy about it [ the defeat ] . It 's the only way to get these Republicans to wake themselves up and say , ' You have abandoned what you were put in office <unk> 
 Boortz creates controversy among conservatives for his support of abortion rights ( on which Boortz does not allow calls ) , for his refusal to condemn homosexuality or gay marriage , and for his negative comments regarding Baptists and the biblical story of creation . Although he calls himself a Christian , he keeps his religious views private . He has also caused a stir among some Southerners , by coining the term " <unk> " during his frequent jabs at them and at Confederate issues ( such as governmental support of the Confederate flag ) .

 The Neal Boortz Show was a nationally syndicated talk show , which ended in January 2013 . It aired live from 8 : 30am to noon , weekdays . Boortz routinely criticized politicians , Muslim extremism , the homeless , public schools ( which he called ' government schools ' ) , liberals , opponents of the Iraq war , teachers , smokers , the obese , Chevrolet Camaro drivers , cats , and welfare recipients . On air , Boortz referred to himself as an " equal opportunity offender " . 
 Boortz marketed his talk radio show as " insensitivity training " , creating controversy which increased ratings . His stated " beliefs " included a claim that ADD and ADHD are " medical frauds " and a scam that teachers , parents , and drug companies use . His attempts at controversy included referring to homeless people as " urban outdoorsmen " on air , and called public education " taxpayer @-@ funded child abuse " .

Islamic extremism was a favorite topic . 
 Some of his remarks caused controversy . After the Virginia Tech shootings , Boortz criticized the media , saying , " When the history of this event is written , we will have 25 students standing meekly waiting for this guy to execute them . " When public outrage resulted from his comments , members of the Virginia Legislature tried to have Boortz 's show removed from local radio stations . In March 2008 , Boortz attracted controversy by playing an audiotape of a nine @-@ year @-@ old where he repeatedly ridiculed the child ’ s speech , leading to an unsuccessful FCC petition to deny Boortz ’ s employer the right to purchase five local radio stations .

 Marek Sobieski ( 24 May 1628 – 3 June 1652 ) was a Polish noble ( <unk> ) , starosta ( tenant of the Crown lands ) of Krasnystaw and <unk> , older brother of King Jan III Sobieski of Poland . He graduated from Nowodworski College in Kraków and Kraków Academy , then traveled and studied in Western Europe . After returning to Poland in 1648 he fought against the Cossacks and Tatars at Zbaraż and <unk> . He was taken captive by Tatars in 1652 and then killed by Cossacks . 
 = = Childhood and studies = = 
 Sobieski was the oldest child of Jakub Sobieski and his second wife <unk> Zofia <unk> . He was born on 24 May 1628 in Złoczów and spent his childhood in Żółkiew . He grew up in a patriotic family , and his mother often took him and his brother to the grave of her grandfather Stanisław Żółkiewski , Grand Hetman of the Crown , who was killed in the battle of Cecora in 1620 . Zofia <unk> <unk> taught her sons the inscription upon their great @-@ grandfather 's grave : " O quam dulce et decorum est pro patria mori ! " ( How sweet and glorious it is to die for one 's homeland ! ) . On 29 October 1639 Sobieski became Starosta of <unk> . 
 Along with his brother Jan , beginning in 1640 , Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Kraków . On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub <unk> , bishop of Kraków . The next year , on 2 June 1643 , Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent Władysław IV for everything he had done for <unk> College . Two months earlier , in April 1643 , Marek and Jan Sobieski began studies at Kraków Academy . In 1644 Sobieski became Starosta of Krasnystaw . 
 In 1645 Jakub Sobieski , father of Marek and Jan , prepared special instructions and a guidebook for his sons , who were about to go abroad . Jakub Sobieski , who was inspired by Roman authors , emphasized learning foreign languages and physical exercises . He wanted to prepare his sons to be politics and diplomats . 
 After completing their studies in 1646 , the brothers started to travel around Europe under the tutelage of Sebastian <unk> . They departed Żółkiew on 21 February or 25 March 1646 . They visited Berlin , Wittenberg , Leipzig , Halle , Amsterdam and Paris , where they arrived on 9 June 1646 . They spent the next 16 months in France . In October 1647 Marek and Jan Sobieski went to England and subsequently studied mathematics in the Netherlands . The brothers had planned to go to Turkey , but after hearing of the Khmelnytsky Uprising they decided to return to Poland . Marek and John Sobieski left Brussels on 24 July 1648 . 
 = = Adulthood = = 
 After returning to Poland Sobieski and his brother came to Zamość , which at the time was being besieged by Cossacks . In 1648 , 1649 and 1650 Sobieski was elected a member of the parliament ( sejm <unk> ) of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth . In 1649 he was among the electors who voted for Jan II Kazimierz as King of Poland . Then , as a head of a chorągiew <unk> ( military unit formed by Hussars ) of 100 horse , the young starosta joined the army of Jeremi Wiśniowiecki . 
 Sobieski was a member of the Polish defense crew besieged by Cossacks at Zbaraż from 10 July to 22 August 1649 . In 1650 he fought against the Cossacks at Kamieniec Podolski . Marek Sobieski also took part in the Battle of <unk> on 28 – 30 June 1651 . After the Polish victory , due his bravery , he received a saber of Tugay Bey , who had been killed during the battle . In September 1651 he fought at the Battle of Biała <unk> . When the Poles , Cossacks and Tatars began negotiations , Marek Sobieski was sent to the Cossack camp as a guarantor of safety for the Cossack leader , Bohdan Khmelnytsky , who was in the Polish camp . 
 In 1652 Sobieski fought against the Cossacks near Bracław and during Biała <unk> campaign . Marching with Jan <unk> , but without his own hussar banner , Sobieski and his retinue came to the field hetman Kalinowski 's camp at Batoh on May 31 . Marek Sobieski and <unk> were assigned to command cavalry banners during the subsequent battle , and in that capacity they fought on June 1 and 2 . On June 2 , during the second day of the Battle of Batoh after the defeat of Polish cavalry in the field before the Polish camp , Sobieski commanded a cavalry group , perhaps containing wounded filed hetman Kalinowski , that withdrew to the eastern redoubt in Polish camp , where Cossacks destroyed them after bringing artillery . Following Polish soldier <unk> <unk> 's writings Sobieski might have been the last Polish commander defending the Polish camp against the Cossack @-@ Tatar army . Young commander was taken prisoner or surrendered , to be ransomed in a future as it was practice of the day , by the Tatars or Cossacks . After the battle , the Cossacks paid the Tatars for possession of the prisoners , and killed the Polish captives in retaliation for Chmielnicki ’ s defeat at Berestechko . Among the 8 @,@ 000 massacred Polish soldiers was Marek <unk> or the number could have been much higher , up to 15 @,@ 000 killed in action and massacred . 
 Sobieski 's mother returned his body to his home , and to commemorate him she founded the Church of the Assumption of Mary in Żółkiew , which was built between 1653 and 1655 . Sobieski was buried there in 1655 on the day the church was consecrated . His brother , King Jan III Sobieski , commissioned a gravestone by Andreas Schlüter made from black marble , which was destroyed after 1945 . In 1946 Sobieski 's body was taken to the Dominican 's Church in Kraków .

 = Gangtok = 
 Gangtok ( / <unk> / ) is a municipality , the capital and the largest town of the Indian state of Sikkim . It also is the headquarters of the East Sikkim district . Gangtok is located in the eastern Himalayan range , at an elevation of 1 @,@ 650 m ( 5 @,@ 410 ft ) . The town 's population of 100 @,@ 000 belongs to different ethnicities such as Nepali , Lepchas and Bhutia . Nestled within higher peaks of the Himalaya and enjoying a year @-@ round mild temperate climate , Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim 's tourism industry . 
 Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular Buddhist pilgrimage site after the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 . In 1894 , the ruling Sikkimese Chogyal , <unk> Namgyal , transferred the capital to Gangtok . In the early 20th century , Gangtok became a major stopover on the trade route between Lhasa in Tibet and cities such as Kolkata ( then Calcutta ) in British India . After India won its independence from Britain in 1947 , Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy , with Gangtok as its capital . In 1975 , after the integration with the union of India , Gangtok was made India 's 22nd state capital . 
 The precise meaning of the name " Gangtok " is unclear , though the most popular meaning is " hill top " . Today , Gangtok is a centre of Tibetan Buddhist culture and learning , with the presence of several monasteries , religious educational institutions , and centres for Tibetology . 
 = = History = = 
 Like the rest of Sikkim , not much is known about the early history of Gangtok . The earliest records date from the construction of the <unk> Gangtok monastery in 1716 . Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the Enchey Monastery in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center . It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid @-@ 19th century in response to a hostage crisis . After the defeat of the Tibetans by the British , Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century . Most of the roads and the telegraph in the area were built during this time . 
 In 1894 , <unk> Namgyal , the Sikkimese monarch under British rule , shifted the capital from <unk> to Gangtok , increasing the city 's importance . A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital . Following India 's independence in 1947 , Sikkim became a nation @-@ state with Gangtok as its capital . Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India , with the condition that it would retain its independence , by the treaty signed between the Chogyal and the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese . Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the Nathula and <unk> passes , offshoots of the ancient Silk Road near Gangtok . These border passes were sealed after the Sino @-@ Indian War in 1962 , which deprived Gangtok of its trading business . The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006 , fuelling hopes of economic boom . 
 In 1975 , after years of political uncertainty and struggle , including riots , the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India 's twenty @-@ second state , with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum . Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides , resulting in loss of life and damage to property . The largest disaster occurred in June 1997 , when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed .

 Gangtok is located at 27 @.@ <unk> ° N 88 @.@ 6140 ° E ﻿ / 27 @.@ <unk> ; 88 @.@ 6140 ( coordinates of Gangtok head post office ) . It is situated in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of 1 @,@ 650 m ( 5 @,@ 410 ft ) . The town lies on one side of a hill , with " The Ridge " , a promenade housing the Raj Bhawan , the governor 's residence , at one end and the palace , situated at an altitude of about 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) , at the other . The city is flanked on east and west by two streams , namely Roro Chu and Ranikhola , respectively . These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts , the eastern and western parts . Both the streams meet the <unk> and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the Teesta at <unk> . Most of the roads are steep , with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them . 
 Most of Sikkim , including Gangtok , is underlain by Precambrian rocks which contains foliated <unk> and schists ; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides . Surface runoff of water by natural streams ( <unk> ) and man @-@ made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides . According to the Bureau of Indian Standards , the town falls under seismic zone @-@ IV ( on a scale of I to V , in order of increasing seismic activity ) , near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes . The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow @-@ clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance . Mount Kanchenjunga ( 8 @,@ 598 m or 28 @,@ 208 ft ) — the world 's third @-@ highest peak — is visible to the west of the city . The existence of steep slopes , vulnerability to landslides , large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city . 
 There are densely forested regions around Gangtok , consisting of temperate , deciduous forests of poplar , birch , oak , and elm , as well as evergreen , coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone . Orchids are common , and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city . Bamboos are also abundant . In the lower reaches of the town , the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical . Flowers such as sunflower , marigold , <unk> , and others bloom , especially in November and December . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Gangtok features a monsoon @-@ influenced subtropical highland climate ( Köppen : Cwb ) . Because of its elevation and sheltered environment , Gangtok enjoys a mild , temperate climate all year round . Like most Himalayan towns , Gangtok has five seasons : summer , monsoons , autumn , winter and spring . Temperatures range from an average maximum of 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) in summer to an average minimum of 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) in winter . Summers ( lasting from late April to June ) are mild , with maximum temperatures rarely crossing 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) . The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok 's land access to the rest of the country . Rainfall starts to rise from pre @-@ monsoon in May , and peaks during the monsoon , with July recording the highest monthly average of 649 @.@ 6 mm ( 25 @.@ 6 in ) . In winter temperature averages between 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) and 7 ° C ( 45 ° F ) . Snowfall is rare , and in recent times Gangtok has received snow only in 1990 , 2004 , 2005 and January 2011 . Temperatures below freezing are also rare . During this season the weather can be unstable , and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours . During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild . Owing to its elevation , Gangtok is often enveloped in fog during the monsoon and winter months . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The hospitality industry is the largest industry in Gangtok as the city is the main base for Sikkim tourism . Summer and spring seasons are the most popular tourist seasons . Many of Gangtok 's residents are employed directly and indirectly in the tourism industry , with many residents owning and working in hotels and restaurants . 
 Ecotourism has emerged as an important economic activity in the region which includes trekking , mountaineering , river rafting and other nature oriented activities . An estimated 351 @,@ 000 tourists visited Sikkim in 2007 , generating revenue of about Rs 50 crores ( Rs 500 millions ) . 
 The Nathula Pass , located about 50 km ( 31 mi ) from Gangtok , used to be the primary route of the wool , fur and spice trade with Tibet and spurred economic growth for Gangtok till the mid @-@ 20th century . In 1962 , after the border was closed during the Sino @-@ Indian War , Gangtok fell into recession . The pass was reopened in 2006 and trade through the pass is expected to boost the economy of Gangtok . The Sikkim government is keen to open a Lhasa – Gangtok bus service via Nathula pass . Sikkim 's mountainous terrain results in the lack of train or air links , limiting the area 's potential for rapid industrial development . The government is the largest employer in the city , both directly and as contractors . Gangtok 's economy does not have a large manufacturing base , but has a thriving Cottage industry in watch @-@ making , country @-@ made alcohol and handicrafts . Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags . The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state 's rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons . The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis . As part of Sikkim , Gangtok enjoys the status of being an income @-@ tax free region as per the state 's 1948 Income tax law . As Sikkim is a frontier state , the Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok . This leads to a population of semi @-@ permanent residents who bring money into the local economy . The Sikkim government started India 's first online lottery <unk> to boost government income , but this was later closed by a ruling from the Sikkim High Court . 
 In 2013 premier Indian publishing company Thomson Digital opened its production unit in Gangtok . Thus becoming first MNC to venture there and paving path for future private companies to explore potential of young workforce of Gangtok . 
 = = Civic administration = = 
 Gangtok is administered by Gangtok Municipal Corporation along with the various departments of Government of Sikkim , particularly the Urban Development and Housing Department ( UDHD ) and Public Health Engineering Department ( PHED ) . These departments looked after the civic functions such as garbage disposal , water supply , tax collection , license allotments , and civic infrastructure . An administrator appointed by the state government headed the UDHD . 
 As the headquarters of East Sikkim district , Gangtok houses the offices of the district collector , an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India . Gangtok is also the seat of the Sikkim High Court , which is India 's smallest High Court in terms of area and population of jurisdiction . Gangtok does not have its own police <unk> like other major cities in India . Instead , it comes under the jurisdiction of the state police , which is headed by a Director General of Police , although an Inspector General of Police oversees the town . Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate . <unk> jail in Gangtok is Sikkim 's only central jail . 
 Gangtok is within the Sikkim Lok Sabha constituency that elects a member to the Lok Sabha ( Lower House ) of the Indian Parliament . The city elects one member in the Sikkim state legislative assembly , the Vidhan Sabha . The Sikkim Democratic Front ( SDF ) won both the parliamentary election in 2009 and the state assembly seat in the 2009 state assembly polls . 
 = = Utility services = = 
 Electricity is supplied by the power department of the Government of Sikkim . Gangtok has a nearly uninterrupted electricity supply due to Sikkim 's numerous hydroelectric power stations . The rural roads around Gangtok are maintained by the Border Roads Organisation , a division of the Indian army . Several roads in Gangtok are reported to be in a poor condition , whereas building construction activities continue almost unrestrained in this city lacking proper land infrastructure . Most households are supplied by the central water system maintained and operated by the PHED . The main source of PHED water supply is the <unk> River , located about 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) from the city , at an altitude of 2 @,@ 621 m ( 8 @,@ 599 ft ) . Its water treatment plant is located at <unk> . The river <unk> is snow @-@ fed and has perennial streams . Since there is no habitation in the catchment area except for a small army settlement , there is little environmental degradation and the water is of very good quality . 40 seasonal local springs are used by the Rural Management and Development Department of Sikkim Government to supply water to outlying rural areas . 
 Around 40 % of the population has access to sewers . However , only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while sullage is discharged into the drains . Without a proper sanitation system , the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into <unk> and open drains is prevalent . The entire city drains into the two rivers , Ranikhola and Roro Chu , through numerous small streams and <unk> .
