 El Laco is a volcanic complex in the Antofagasta Region of Chile . It is directly south of the Cordón de Puntas Negras volcanic chain . Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , it is a group of seven stratovolcanoes and a caldera . It is about two million years old . The main summit of the volcano is a lava dome called Pico Laco , which is variously reported to be 5 @,@ 325 metres ( 17 @,@ 470 ft ) or 5 @,@ 472 metres ( 17 @,@ 953 ft ) high . The edifice has been affected by glaciation , and some reports indicate that it is still fumarolically active . 
 The volcano is known for its magnetite @-@ containing lava flows of enigmatic origin . In total , there are four lava flows and two dykes , as well as a formation of uncertain nature . In addition to lava flow structures , pyroclastics containing iron ore are also found within the complex . The magmas formed within a magma chamber with a volume of about 30 cubic kilometres ( 7 @.@ 2 cu mi ) ; whether the iron @-@ rich lavas are native magnetite lavas or were formed by hydrothermal processes acting on regular rock is under debate . After their discovery in 1958 , these iron deposits have been mined . Similar deposits of volcanic iron ore exist in Australia , Chile , and Iran .

 El Laco is part of the Cordón de Puntas Negras sector of the Central Volcanic Zone , : 681 @,@ 682 directly south of that volcanic chain . It sits atop a quartzite and sandstone basement that was lifted from the <unk> during the Acadian orogeny and is of Ordovician age . Later , Mesozoic and Cenozoic sedimentation occurred , which was then buried by Tertiary rhyolites . : 681 @,@ 682 Two major volcanic lineaments cross in the El Laco area . El Hueso volcano to the north is 5 @,@ 029 metres ( 16 @,@ 499 ft ) high and has a basement diameter of 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) . It has a crater with a diameter of 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) . 
 The city of Antofagasta is located 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) west of El Laco . : 681 Other close towns are Calama and San Pedro de Atacama . The international road connecting Salta in Argentina with Calama in Chile runs close to El Laco . A number of tourist sites are found in the Atacama Desert adjacent to El Laco , and the dry climate also makes the area suitable for astronomy facilities .

 The El Laco volcanic complex is formed by about seven minor stratovolcanoes and lava domes . The complex started its activity in the Miocene @-@ Pliocene , when <unk> andesites formed a stratovolcano . During the Pliocene , ash and pyroclastic eruptions formed a caldera with a diameter of 4 – 5 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 1 mi ) , which also contains a central lava dome that formed 6 @.@ 5 million years ago . Finally , probably during the Pleistocene , five iron @-@ rich magmas were extruded , named Laco Sur , Laco Norte and <unk> Negros . Laquito and <unk> Grandes , two abyssal iron magma structures , date back to that era . : 682 – 684 The volcanic complex is located an altitude of 4 @,@ 300 – 5 @,@ 470 metres ( 14 @,@ 110 – 17 @,@ 950 ft ) and covers a surface area of 7 by 5 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi × 3 @.@ 1 mi ) . 
 The main summit , Pico Laco , has an altitude of 5 @,@ 325 metres ( 17 @,@ 470 ft ) , although a maximum height of 5 @,@ 472 metres ( 17 @,@ 953 ft ) has also been reported . Pico Laco is an andesitic lava dome with a height of 400 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) above the surrounding terrain . The dome , with dimensions of 1 @.@ 5 by 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 93 mi × 0 @.@ 62 mi ) , has two summits : the higher eastern one and a 5 @,@ 166 @-@ metre ( 16 @,@ 949 ft ) western summit . 
 Other summits include the northwestern Hueso Chico , a cone with a height of 120 metres ( 390 ft ) above its surroundings and a crater 250 metres ( 820 ft ) wide . This cone is of dacitic composition . " Volcano 5009 " is heavily eroded , and its core of lava and hyaloclastite has been exposed . It has a diameter of 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) . Eruptive activity here probably coincided with glacier activity during the Pliocene , as evidenced by moraines in the area . 
 Ages of 5 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 6 mya have been estimated via potassium @-@ argon dating of the andesite lavas and subvolcanic rocks . An age of 5 @.@ 3 ± 1 @.@ 9 mya on lavas in the northern part of the volcanic complex is the oldest obtained date . Other dating has resulted in ages of 3 @.@ 9 ± 1 @.@ 3 mya for Pico Laco 's dome , 3 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 9 mya for lavas beneath San Vicente Bayo , 3 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 9 mya for a lava front next to Laco Norte , 2 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 6 for <unk> Grandes , 2 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 4 for Hueso Chico , and 1 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 5 for " Volcano 5009 " .

Later alteration included hydrothermal alteration and glacial erosion ; the former has left bleached rocks and exhalation deposits . Some minor <unk> alteration occurred at the contact sites between andesites and iron @-@ containing rocks . : 684 Hydrothermal alteration has also been described for lower portions of the volcanic pile and probably occurred because of gases escaping from intruded magma . <unk> found west of El Laco were generated by glaciation both on El Laco and Puntas Negras . Surface exposure dating has indicated ages of 226 and 287 ka for some ice @-@ affected lavas . Further , andesitic volcanism in neighbouring volcanoes has blanketed El Laco . : 684 Reports exist of continuing fumarolic activity and hot springs with the deposition of clay and other minerals .

 On the flank of the volcano , apatite , hematite , and magnetite deposits are found at altitudes of 4 @,@ 600 – 5 @,@ 200 metres ( 15 @,@ 100 – 17 @,@ 100 ft ) . The volcano is mainly known for these flows . The deposits lie on top of flat lava flows of andesitic composition , concentrically around Pico Laco . They are named Laco Norte , Laco Sur , San Vicente Alto , and San Vicente Bajo . The deposits consist of dykes , hydrothermal deposits , lava flows , pyroclastics , and subvolcanic structures and were erupted from parasitic vents and fissures . The magnetite is classified as porphyry @-@ like . <unk> is present as an accessory mineral in the lavas and is abundant in the intrusions . Iron @-@ rich zones also formed in tuffs and lavas . Magnetite in the subvolcanic bodies exists in more massive crystals . : 684 The iron @-@ containing rocks include lava flows , ash , and lapilli , as well as ore breccias . The El Laco magnetite lava flows are unique in the world and formed during active subduction .

 Of these deposits , Laco Norte is the largest and was probably separated from neighbouring Laquito by erosion . It is 60 – 90 metres ( 200 – 300 ft ) thick and covers a surface area of 1 @,@ 000 by 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft × 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . It was erupted from feeder dykes on its southern and eastern end and forms a table @-@ shaped body on a spur , in the shape of a mesa . At Laco Norte , a structure of five layers is found : a basal andesite , ore in pyroclastic form , magnetite lava , pyroclastics which contain ore , and andesite at the top . Laco Sur has a similar morphology and dimensions of 30 – 70 by 600 by 750 metres ( 98 ft – 230 ft × 1 @,@ 969 ft × 2 @,@ 461 ft ) ; it has been mined . San Vicente Alto is a lava flow on the upper parts of the volcano ( 30 by 320 by 480 metres ( 98 ft × 1 @,@ 050 ft × 1 @,@ 575 ft ) ) , and San Vicente Bajo is probably a lava dome ( 250 by 390 metres ( 820 ft × 1 @,@ 280 ft ) ) .

 The magnetite lavas are primarily aa lava , but other surface features are also found , including pahoehoe features . Columnar morphologies are found on the magnetite , implying that they cooled quickly . There is only one other place in the world where columnar magnetite has been found – <unk> , in Sweden . Large tubes coated on the inside by magnetite were formed in the lava by escaping gas . Both before and after the magnetite lavas , layers of magnetite @-@ containing pyroclastics were erupted . A 0 @.@ 5 – 2 @-@ metre ( 1 ft 8 in – 6 ft 7 in ) aureole separates the magnetite rocks from the host rocks . The magnetite lava flows are 50 metres ( 160 ft ) thick , the pyroclastics 30 metres ( 98 ft ) and 20 metres ( 66 ft ) respectively . : 684 – 685 The pyroclastic @-@ like deposits are porous and fragile and show traces of stratification . The pyroclastics at Laco Sur contain spherules of magnetite . An age of 2 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 1 million years has been found for ore by fission track dating . The lavas contain veins likely generated by hydrothermal activity .

 Temperatures estimated for the erupted rocks cover a wide range , with some exceeding 800 ° C ( 1 @,@ 470 ° F ) . These rocks are of enigmatic origin , which may be geothermal or magmatic , with the presence of lava bombs of magnetite lava supporting the magmatic origin theory . Other viewpoints consider the texture and chemical composition of the rocks as evidence that <unk> of andesitic rocks formed the magnetite " lavas " . The role of a post @-@ magmatic fluid phase , which was inferred from inclusions in crystals , has also been suggested . Some magnetite was oxidized to hematite , : 681 probably under the influence of rainwater as indicated by isotope analysis . Only a minor amount of hematite is primary . Isotope data indicate that the formation of this magnetite magma was accompanied by the segregation of plagioclase . This plagioclase may have generated the rhyodacite lava dome . An iron @-@ phosphate @-@ rich magma generated the magnetite lava flows after release of volatile substances . The magma was probably bordering on forming a two @-@ phase melt containing <unk> and rhyolite . A favourable tectonic context associated with the compression of the magma chamber and the presence of faults helped with the eruption of the magnetite . : 688 – 689 The magma formation probably occurred in a magma chamber . During the cooling of the magma , the ores formed . This process was probably not directed by water @-@ rich phases , and the segregation occurred at a shallow depth . High phosphorus and volatile content may have lowered the melting point of the magma and facilitated its eruption , as well as overcoming density @-@ based constraints on the eruption of iron @-@ rich magmas . Suggestions that <unk> of iron @-@ rich sediments generated the iron @-@ rich magmas appear implausible . The ultimate origin of the El Laco iron may be subducted metal @-@ containing sediment .

 These iron oxide deposits were found in 1958 . Mining in Laco Sur removed about two million tons of magnetite between the 1970s and 1990s , leaving an open pit exposing 30 metres ( 98 ft ) of rock . In 2009 , these mineral reserves were mined by Cia Minera del Pacifico S.A. It is estimated that the deposit contains one billion tons of ore , consisting of 50 % iron . : 684 The geological interest in these kinds of mineral deposits is enhanced by their frequent association with other minerals , as has been noted at Olympic Dam , Australia . Other magnetite @-@ apatite ore deposits in the Andes are Incahuasi ( 10 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 8 mya ) , 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) south of El Laco , and <unk> Pedernales ( Tertiary ) , about 300 kilometres ( 190 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Laco .

 The Kiruna <unk> in Sweden resemble the El Laco ones in terms of manganese and vanadium content , and their titanium content is comparably low . Other deposits of volcanic iron ore are the " Chilean iron belt " , the Tertiary Cerro el Mercado deposit in Mexico , the <unk> Bafq district in Iran , and the Proterozoic Kiruna field in Sweden . Of these , Sierra Bandera in the Chilean iron belt may be another example of surface volcanic iron ore rather than subvolcanic ore as is commonly assumed of these deposits .

 The main rocks of the volcano are andesite and dacite , which contain biotite and pyroxene as well as blebs containing iron oxide . The iron @-@ containing rocks are a less important component . The whole rock falls into the calc @-@ alkaline class of volcanic rocks . The andesites contain plagioclase clinopyroxene , orthopyroxene , and phenocrysts of magnetite . : 681 – 682 Magnetite , and in lesser measure hematite , are the most abundant iron minerals ; : 685 anhydrite , diopside , goethite , limonite , <unk> , pyrite , : 685 and <unk> are also found . <unk> magma was probably gas @-@ rich , as the magnetite lavas would otherwise have melting points of over 1 @,@ 500 ° C ( 2 @,@ 730 ° F ) . The lavas lost most of their sulfur and phosphorus after their eruption . High oxygen @-@ 18 amounts in the Laco magmas indicate either crustal contamination or isotopic effects during fractional crystallization . Some atmospheric water influence has been inferred from isotope data as well . 
 Hydrothermal alteration of the central lava dome and iron @-@ bearing deposits has generated alunite , anatase , chlorite , copper <unk> , gypsum , illite , jarosite , <unk> , quartz , rutile , sanidine , smectite , and sulfur . Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock . : 684 <unk> is prominent and has formed <unk> and <unk> . Elemental sulfur is also found . Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of 200 – 250 ° C ( 392 – 482 ° F ) , giving the rock a clear appearance . Minor exhalation deposits are also found in the form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits . Red @-@ coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits , probably due to iron input .

 = Love Story ( Taylor Swift song ) = 
 " Love Story " is a song performed by American singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . The song was written by Swift and produced by Nathan Chapman , alongside Swift . It was released on September 12 , 2008 by Big Machine Records , as the lead single from Swift 's second studio album Fearless ( 2008 ) . The song was written about a love interest of Swift 's who was not popular among Swift 's family and friends . Because of the scenario , Swift related to the plot of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet ( 1597 ) and used it as a source of inspiration to compose the song . However , she replaced Romeo and Juliet 's original tragic conclusion with a happy ending . It is a midtempo song with a dreamy soprano voice , while the melody continually builds . The lyrics are from the perspective of Juliet . 
 The song was a critical success with critics complimenting Swift 's writing style and the song 's plot . It was also a commercial success , selling over 8 million copies worldwide , therefore establishing itself among the best @-@ selling singles of all time . In the United States , the song peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 5 @.@ 8 million paid digital downloads , becoming Swift 's best @-@ selling single to date and the best @-@ selling download by a female country solo artist . It is also one of the best @-@ selling singles in the United States and was once the best @-@ selling digital country single of all time there . The single was certified 8 × Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Internationally , " Love Story " became Swift 's first number one single in Australia , followed by " Shake It Off " in 2014 . The song has been certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) . The song is one of the best @-@ selling singles worldwide , with worldwide sales of more than 8 millions of units ( according to the IFPI ) . 
 The song 's accompanying music video was directed by Trey Fanjoy , who directed the majority of Swift 's prior videos . The video is a period piece that drew influences from the Medieval , Renaissance , and British Regency ( 1813 ) eras . It follows Swift and model Justin Gaston as they meet in a university campus and imagine themselves in a prior era . " Love Story " was promoted through numerous live performances . The song was included on Swift 's first , second , third , and fourth headlining tours , the Fearless Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) , the Speak Now World Tour ( 2011 – 12 ) , the Red Tour ( 2013 – 14 ) , and the 1989 World Tour ( 2015 ) respectively . " Love Story " has been covered by several artists , including Joe McElderry and Forever the Sickest Kids . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 " Love Story " came along late into the production of Fearless . Swift wrote " Love Story " about a man who was never officially her boyfriend . When she introduced him to her family and friends , they did not become fond of him . " His situation was a little complicated , but I didn 't care " , said Swift . Swift also felt like it was the first time she could relate to the plot of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet ( 1597 ) , one of her favorite narratives , which she described as , " The only people who wanted them to be together were them . " She conceived the idea for the song when she reflected about the scenario : " I thought , ' This is difficult but it 's real , it matters — it 's not simple or easy but it 's real ' . " She then centered the song on the line , which was ultimately placed in the " Love Story " ' s second refrain . All events , with the exclusion of the end , narrated in the song regarded Swift 's actual story . The song 's conclusion differed from that of Romeo and Juliet . " I feel like they had such promise and they were so crazy for each other . And if that had just gone a little bit differently , it could have been the best love story ever told . And it is one of the best love stories ever told , but it 's a tragedy . " Instead , she chose to write a happy ending . She took her favorite characters and conceptualized the ending she believed they deserved . She perceived it to be the ideal ending that girls hoped for , including herself . " You want a guy who doesn ’ t care what anyone thinks , what anyone says . " Although it was fictional , Swift said it was an enjoyable experience to write about . Swift wrote the track on her bedroom floor in approximately twenty minutes , feeling too inspired to put the song down unfinished . 
 Swift and her love interest continued their relationship , but then went their separate ways because it was hard for them to see each other . To Swift , the song resembles much optimism regarding love and how encountering the right person could surpass skepticism . She deemed " Love Story " one of her most romantic songs , although she was never in an official relationship with the subject of the song . In retrospect , Swift said about the song , " It ’ s about a love that you 've got to hide because for whatever reason it wouldn 't go over well . I spun it in the direction of Romeo and Juliet . Our parents are fighting . I relate to it more as a love that you cannot really elaborate on — a love that maybe society wouldn 't accept [ or ] maybe your friends wouldn 't accept . "

 " Love Story " was recorded in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville , Tennessee , alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel . Chapman produced all but one song on Swift 's 2006 eponymous debut album , Taylor Swift , and co @-@ produced all songs on Fearless . Swift sang into an <unk> CV @-@ 12 multi @-@ pattern tube microphone , manufactured by Avant Electronics . The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer , record producer , and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman . Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan , as a " try this for a while " experiment . Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift , he had not been able to find one to match her voice perfectly . When Swift came to Chapman 's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift , she immediately grew fond of the microphone . " When she put on the headphones and said , ' Test , ' completely unprompted , she said , ' This is my mic . I love this mic . I just wanna use this one from now on ! ' She had no idea what it was , just loved it , and I went along with something that felt right for her . We 've been using it ever since , and it sounds great on her voice , " Chapman said . 
 " Love Story " was recorded with Pro Tools and tracking vocals , which Swift sang live with the band . The band consisted of acoustic guitars , bass guitars , and drums . All other instruments were overdubbed by Chapman . He said , " I think there are nine acoustic guitars on that track , and I stacked several background vocals — me singing , ' Ah 's ' . " Audio engineering was executed by Chad Carlson in Blackbird Studios ' Studio D , with the usage of the API Legacy Plus equipments : <unk> CV @-@ 12 , Neve 1073 , and Tube @-@ Tech CL @-@ 1B . Audio mixing done by Justin Niebank and was set in Studio F , with the usage of the console Solid State Logic <unk> K series and <unk> 1032 console . In between , overdubs were executed in Studio E by Chapman . " Love Story " , along with the rest of the album , was mastered by Hank Williams at <unk> Studios in Nashville , Tennessee . The song was mixed for mainstream airplay by Chapman . He pulled Niebank 's stems into his Mac OS laptop and used Apple Logic to create the pop version . Chapman made mix tweaks and created new elements with his laptop . In order to do so , he muted the country instruments and replaced them with new elements characteristic to pop music , replacing banjo and fiddle with electric guitar . The pop version 's opening beat is a Logic loop in the <unk> beat generator . All the new electric guitars were done with the <unk> Stomp I / O. 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Love Story " is a country pop song with a length of three minutes and 54 seconds . It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute . It is written in the key of D major and Swift 's vocals span one octave , from A3 to B4 . Swift croons " Love Story " softly and sweetly , with a slight twang . It follows the chord progression D ( add ) 9 – <unk> – Bm – <unk> . The song is of a swirling and dreamy tenor . The melody is simple , containing a <unk> pace which continually grows and concludes with a key change to E major . 
 The lyrics of " Love Story " are written in first person , in which Swift refers to herself as the Romeo and Juliet character Juliet Capulet and her love interest as Romeo Montague . Fraser McAlpine of the BBC described the song as a narrative , in which Swift is the narrator . The song 's plot revolves a youthful romance foiled by parental disapproval . In the end , love prevails and the couple finds their " happily ever after " . The first verse introduces the characters at a ball , where they meet . In the second verse , the story transitions to the couple sneaking about after dark and references Nathaniel Hawthorne 's The Scarlet Letter ( 1850 ) . The song 's refrains have Swift waiting for her love interest to appear : " Romeo , take me somewhere we can be alone / I 'll be waiting / All there 's left to do is run . " The song 's final refrain has Swift narrating from Romeo 's perspective and proposing marriage to Swift .

 " Love Story " was highly acclaimed by critics upon release . Kate Kiefer of Paste magazine recognized the song to be Swift 's best and added that once the lyrics are learned , it is impossible to not sing along . Sean Dooley of About.com credited the song for transitioning Swift from a " fresh @-@ faced star to crossover superstar " . Dooley attributed the song 's commercial success due to her departure from her past lyrical themes , which summarized " I wish this boy knew how I really felt about him ” . While reviewing Fearless , Dooley selected " Love Story " as one of the best tracks on the album . Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine admired how Swift attempted to incorporate sophisticated elements , like Romeo and Juliet and The Scarlet Letter , although it was not successful because of its awkwardness , inexplicable nature , and pointless conceit . Keefe credited its success to its prominent hook . James Reed of The Boston Globe thought otherwise , stating Swift 's charm was in her songwriting skills . 
 Fraser McAlpine of the BBC stated , " ' Love Story ' is a stunning pop song and , because it really does tell a love story , it 's heart @-@ warming and draws the listener into the exciting and romantic fairytale world . " However , she felt Swift 's vocal performance was not incredible , but was passionate to complement the song 's sentiments . McAlpine resumed by stating that " Love Story " , although obvious , a bit dramatic , and probably targeted towards younger audiences , was just lovely and that Swift proved herself a true princess of pop with the song . Chris Neal of Country Weekly called " Love Story " an " ebullient first hit . " Deborah Evans Price of Billboard magazine gave the single a favorable review and called it an " enchanting offering " . Price noted that " Love Story " demonstrates one of Swift 's appeals , her writing and singing of age @-@ appropriate material that can be both relatable to her audience and others . As a result , she predicted the song would have much commercial success in the country music industry . Alex Macpherson of British newspaper The Guardian described the song to be fueled by a " joyous rush " that , according to him , was later replicated by Swift 's own single " Mine " ( 2010 ) . Taste of Country listed the song at number 17 on its list of greatest country songs of all time .

 The accompanying music video for " Love Story " was directed by Trey Fanjoy , who previously directed the videos for the singles from Taylor Swift . Swift decided to collaborate with Fanjoy once again because she had been able to balance both of their ideas for music videos , something Swift appreciated deeply . The video is a period piece that draws influence from Medieval , Renaissance , and Regency eras . Swift had previously desired to film a period piece music video because of its distinctiveness from modern videos and videos she had filmed . When writing the song , she envisioned it in a prior time period , and encoded it with details accordingly . She believed " Love Story " ' s plot was a timeless scenario : " I think it could happen in the 1700s , the 1800s , or 2008 . " Thus , she searched for a timeless quality in demeanor of her love interest . With six months in advance , Swift searched by watching films for actors to interpret the role . An acquaintance of hers , who followed the sixth season of Nashville Star , recommended contestant Justin Gaston . Swift then looked through his pictures , and concluded he was suitable for the music video . Gaston fulfilled the requirements Swift had set out , describing him as a " Prince Charming that could 've been alive in the 1800s . " However , because Gaston was competing on Nashville Star , he was unable to participate in the music video . Gaston was eventually eliminated and Swift contacted him immediately to film the video . Swift was very impressed by Gaston 's acting skills : " I was so impressed by the way his [ expressions ] were in the video . Without even saying anything , he would just do a certain glance and it really came across well . " 
 A castle was chosen for the video 's setting . Personnel researched numerous castles in the United States and were unable to locate one in sufficient condition for filming . They had considered traveling to Europe to find a castle , but were then informed about a castle south of Nashville , Tennessee . Named Castle <unk> , it was built in 1973 and chosen as the video 's setting . Wardrobe for the video was supplied by Jacquard <unk> , excluding Swift 's dress for the balcony scene . The dress was designed by Sandi <unk> with inspiration and suggestions from Swift . " She loves to put her input in her dresses " , stated <unk> . The two had discussed the dress two months prior to the filming of the video . <unk> were made on the video set . The video was filmed in two days in August 2008 in Tennessee . On the first day , the balcony and field scenes were shot . On the set , someone had replaced the playback CD with a high @-@ pitch , altered version of the song . As a result , Swift lent the crew her iPod to play the original track . While filming another scene , sunset was about to occur and , therefore , the process was executed rather rapidly . For the scene , Fanjoy suggested a kiss between Swift and Gaston , but Swift refused to because she believed it would make for a sweeter moment . On the second day , scenes at Cumberland University in Lebanon , Tennessee and at a ballroom were filmed . Swift learned the choreography for the latter in fifteen minutes prior to filming . Approximately 20 dancers were used for the scene . 
 The video commences with Swift , clothed by a black sweater and jeans , walking through a university campus and spotting Gaston sitting under a tree , reading a textbook . As they make eye contact , the video then transitions to an earlier era , in an seemingly 18th century castle ( though the castle was built in 1973 ) , where Swift stands , wearing a corset and gown , and performs in a balcony . After , Gaston enters a party and sees Swift , wearing an elaborate gown , conversing with other females . The two , along with others , engage in ballroom dancing . After dancing , Gaston whispers into Swift 's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern . She meets with Gaston and the two walk , hold hands , and feed a horse by a well . The two then go their separate paths . Afterward , Swift stands in the balcony , looking out from the a window . She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase . Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other . The video then transcends back into modern @-@ day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other 's eyes , where the video concludes . Cut @-@ scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting . To date , the video has over 303 million views on YouTube .

 The video premiered on September 12 , 2008 on CMT . Mandi Bierly of Entertainment Weekly was concerned about the video mark Swift 's artistic evolution as an artist because it made her believe something else in the artist had altered . She , however , stated , " Worry though I might , I can ’ t resist Taylor Swift ’ s evolution from ' Tim McGraw ' ( 2006 ) to her latest , ' Love Story ' . " Bierly also compared Swift 's acting with that of Keira Knightley . Fraser McAlpine of BBC believed Swift played a princess in the video and , therefore , said it would make females envious . The video was nominated for the " Video of the Year " category at the 45th Academy of Country Music Awards , but lost to Brad Paisley 's " Waitin ' on a Woman " ( 2008 ) . At the 2009 CMT Music Awards , the video won the CMT Music Awards for " Video of the Year " and " Female Video of the Year " . It also won the Country Music Association Award for " Music Video of the Year " at the 43rd Country Music Association Awards . The video won " Favorite International Video " at the Philippine Myx Music Awards 2010 .

The performances begun with backup dancers , dressed in Victorian era clothing , dancing ballroom to Baroque composer Johann Pachelbel 's " Pachelbel 's Canon " , as a castle backdrop was projected onto the stage . Swift emerged to upper level of the stage , from below , donning a crimson , 18th century gown with a golden accents . For the song 's last refrain , Swift hid behind backup dancers as she changed her wardrobe to a white wedding dress . Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27 , 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City . Reviewing the May 22 , 2010 concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto , Canada , Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun stated the moment was far too girly for her liking . " Love Story " served as the final performance on the setlist of Swift 's second concert tour , the Speak Now World Tour ( 2011 ) ; the performances featured Swift roaming throughout the stage , wearing a white sundress . On January 25 , 2013 , Swift did an acoustic version of the song , followed by " We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together " at the Los Premios 40 Principales in Spain .

 = Cibolo Creek = 
 Cibolo Creek is a stream in South Central Texas , United States that runs approximately 96 miles ( 154 km ) from its source at Turkey Knob ( in the Texas Hill Country ) near Boerne , Texas , to its confluence with the San Antonio River in Karnes County . The creek serves as a tributary of the San Antonio River and forms the easternmost boundary of its watershed . 
 The stream is used for both recreational and political purposes , serving as the eastern boundary of Bexar County , Texas . A wide variety of fish and other wildlife are known to occupy the waters , and several parks have been established along its banks , including Cibolo Nature Center , Boerne City Park and Jackson Nature Center . Additionally , numerous human settlements have been founded on the creek , such as Boerne , Fair Oaks Ranch , San Antonio , Bulverde , Bracken , Selma , <unk> , Universal City , Cibolo , <unk> , New Berlin , La Vernia , Cestohowa , Kosciusko , Sutherland Springs and Panna Maria . 
 = = Course = = 
 Cibolo Creek rises in the Texas Hill Country northwest of Boerne in Kendall County , Texas . Every second , approximately 30 cubic feet ( 850 L ) of water pass through on its southeastern journey to the San Antonio River . It has been judged as a " scenic " and " picturesque " stream , especially in the upper reaches , as steady flows travel through deep canyons and rocky flats to form falls . Just ahead of its entry into Boerne , the stream is dammed to form Boerne City Lake , which provides drinking water for the town 's residents . In Boerne , the creek flows through the center of town before reaching the Cibolo Nature Center , noted for its shores lined with bald cypress trees . East of the nature center , the Cibolo Canyonlands begin , which features even deeper canyons and direct groundwater recharge . Part of this area is protected by the University of Texas at San Antonio for environmental research purposes . 
 Further downstream , the creek passes through Fair Oaks Ranch and Bulverde . The steady flow begins to dissipate in certain areas as it approaches Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio , leaving dry patches that reveal a rocky bottom . Such dry patches continue as it heads east , forming the boundary between Bexar and Comal Counties . Steady flows pick up on the boundary between Bexar and Guadalupe Counties , passing through Randolph Air Force Base . 
 At its lower reaches , the terrain grows flatter and less rocky , supporting oak , mesquite and juniper . As it meanders through Wilson and Karnes Counties , passing <unk> , New Berlin , La Vernia , Sutherland Springs , and Cestohowa , Cibolo Creek meets with the San Antonio River near the ghost town of Helena . 
 = = Watershed = = 
 The drainage basin of Cibolo Creek is located in the lower reaches of the Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation along the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau . Many springs located in the upper and middle reaches of the watershed engage in karst activity in the limestone prevalent below the surface , forming such caves as Cascade Caverns and Natural Bridge Caverns . An exchange occurs between the stream and these numerous underground springs that serve as a recharge for the Edwards @-@ Trinity aquifer system . This system provides drinking water for millions of people in the surrounding area . Near the recharge zone , distributaries of the creek have carved deep canyons in the landscape of the Texas Hill Country , forming what is known as the Cibolo Canyonlands . The Cibolo Nature Center claims 1 @,@ 300 acres ( 5 @.@ 3 km2 ; 2 @.@ 0 sq mi ) of the watershed , to protect the water quality from the hazards of rapid development and population growth . 
 Several streams serve as distributaries and tributaries of Cibolo Creek , and are included in the watershed . Balcones Creek , a 13 miles ( 21 km ) long stream that rises in Bandera County and acts as the boundary between Bexar and Kendall Counties , is a main tributary of Cibolo Creek that converges at the meeting of Bexar , Kendall and Bandera Counties . Tributaries in the lower watershed include Martinez Creek , a 16 miles ( 26 km ) long stream with a Mesquite tree @-@ supporting bed of clay and sandy loam , located near <unk> in eastern Bexar County ; and Santa Clara Creek , 19 @.@ 5 miles ( 31 @.@ 4 km ) long and Elm Creek , 14 miles ( 23 km ) long , both streams in Guadalupe County near New Berlin that supports conifers along their shores . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to European settlement , Cibolo Creek was referred to as <unk> by the Coahuiltecan Indians . The Tonkawa called it Bata <unk> , as noted by Father Damian Massanet , who referred to the creek as Santa <unk> in 1691 . It is thought that Coahuila Governor Alonso de Leon had one of the earliest encounters with the creek in 1689 while on the first Spanish <unk> to explore the French @-@ claimed lands believed to lie beyond the Nueces River . Records suggest a camp was set up on the creek , identified as Arroyo del Leon , coined from the discovery of a dead mountain lion along the banks . Explorer Domingo Terán de los Ríos named the creek San Ygnacio de Loyola in 1691 during an expedition and Domingo Ramón referred to it as San Xavier in 1716 . The first known use of the term Cibolo came from Marqués de San Miguel de Aguayo who identified the stream as Río Cibolo , or Cibolo River , in 1721 . Cibolo is a Spanish and Native American term for American bison ( buffalo ) , which used to inhabit the area . The Native Americans are believed to have used the steeply banked bluffs along the creek as hunting grounds , chasing herds of buffalo into the bed where the creatures would fall to their deaths . 
 Marqués de Rubí included Cibolo Creek in his 1768 list of potential sites for posts to solidify the Spanish hold on Texas , and a fort called El Fuerte de Santa Cruz del <unk> , built along the banks of Cibolo Creek in 1734 to protect livestock from Apache Indian attacks , was resurrected in 1771 . However , the fort near Cestohowa was destroyed without a trace in 1782 @.@ and eventually the Spanish lost the creek and Texas following the Mexican Revolution . During the Texas Revolution , the creek was the site of two separate skirmishes . First , in October 1835 , at the beginning of the war , Captain Ben Milam was dispatched by Stephen F. Austin to survey the unfamiliar territory toward Cibolo Creek . Milam set up camp and soon discovered the tracks of a Mexican force of about a hundred cavalrymen . Austin sent additional scouts , and one group was confronted by about ten advancing Mexican patrols . The group 's lieutenant led an offensive against the patrols , and forced the Mexicans to retreat to San Antonio , allowing the Texans to march to Salado Creek . One Austin aide remarked : " this little skirmish ... had a happy effect in the army ... [ and ] was regarded as a favorable omen . " The second skirmish occurred in April 1836 , outside Camp Houston , a post established by Juan Seguín on the creek banks near present day Stockdale . Seguín set the post after being ordered to withdraw from San Antonio , with a regiment that severely lacked resources , including clothing and horses . During an exploration of the creek to find wild horses , Seguín and six men met some hostile <unk> . In a brief skirmish , two of the Native Americans were killed , allowing Seguín and his men to return to camp with two additional horses . 
 Also in 1836 at the time of the Battle of the Alamo , during the Texas Revolution , the creek was the site of the temporary camps of the Alamo relief forces . On February 28 , Juan Seguin and his reorganized relief forces , waiting on the Cibolo Creek , encountered Fannin 's advance from Goliad led by Francis L. <unk> and John Chenoweth , while near the Cibolo . On February 29 , the relief forces from Gonzales traveling with the Gonzales Company of Mounted Volunteers arrived at the Cibolo and entered the Alamo the next day . On March 7 , Gonzales relief force and former Alamo commander , James C. Neill with Edward Burleson gathered 50 men and headed for the Alamo . They reached the Cibolo and were heading for the Alamo but were repulsed by Mexican cavalry . 
 In the late 1840s and early 1850s , the communities of Selma , Sutherland Springs , Boerne , La Vernia , and Bulverde were established along the creek . Later on , Cibolo <unk> , and Universal City were founded . These settlements dealt with torrential floods that cost many their homes and lives in later years . The destruction was prominently witnessed during the October 1998 Central Texas floods , and four years later during the flood of July 2002 . The San Antonio River Authority authorized $ 114 @,@ 599 to help clean debris from the creek in 2003 , hoping to improve water quality . Above @-@ average levels of bacteria have been found in certain areas of the creek , leading to such initiatives as the Upper Cibolo Watershed Protection plan , which began in 2010 . Another plan to create a Cibolo Reservoir near Stockdale aimed to control flooding and provide fresh water met fierce opposition from local citizens concerned about the destruction of historic sites along the creek , and the loss of taxable land . 
 = = Recreation = = 
 Several areas along the creek have been established for recreational use . Boerne City Park provides trails for hiking , nature walks and horseback riding , and is a part of the larger Cibolo Nature Center . Camp Bullis , a military training ground found along the stream in north Bexar County , allows hunting for deer and other game , as well as separate locations for archery and fishing . An 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) section of the creek , between Oak Village North and <unk> , is classified as a class two whitewater flow . The area is a popular camping destination , and is ideal for whitewater rafting and kayaking . Additional locations include Universal City Cibolo Creek Preserve area , where a frisbee golf course has been established for play . Between Stockdale and Floresville , Cibolo Creek forms the eastern boundary of Jackson Nature Park , a 50 @-@ acre ( 200 @,@ 000 m2 ) public park owned by Wilson County and operated by the San Antonio River Authority . The park offers a looped trail network showcasing south @-@ central Texas plants , animals , and geology . 
 Several locations are available for fishing . According to Texas Parks and Wildlife , the following fish have been caught in the stream : largemouth bass , bluegill , channel catfish , Rio Grande cichlid , longnose gar , green sunfish , sunfish hybrid , redbreast sunfish , and <unk> sunfish .

 = Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution = 
 The Seventeenth Amendment ( Amendment XVII ) to the United States Constitution established the popular election of United States Senators by the people of the states . The amendment supersedes Article I , § 3 , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution , under which senators were elected by state legislatures . It also alters the procedure for filling vacancies in the Senate , allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held . 
 The amendment was proposed in the 62nd Congress in 1912 and became law in 1913 after being ratified by the required 36 state legislatures . It was implemented in special elections in Maryland ( November 1913 ) and Alabama ( May 1914 ) and then nationwide in the November 1914 election . 
 = = Text = = 
 The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State , elected by the people thereof , for six years ; and each Senator shall have one vote . The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures . 
 When vacancies happen in the representation of any State in the Senate , the executive authority of such State shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies : Provided , That the legislature of any State may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments until the people fill the vacancies by election as the legislature may direct . 
 This amendment shall not be so construed as to affect the election or term of any Senator chosen before it becomes valid as part of the Constitution . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Original composition = = = 
 Originally , under Article I , § 3 , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution , each state legislature elected its state 's senators for a six @-@ year term . Each state , regardless of size , is entitled to two senators as part of the Connecticut Compromise between the small and large states . This contrasted with the House of Representatives , a body elected by popular vote , and was described as an uncontroversial decision ; at the time , James Wilson was the sole advocate of popularly electing the Senate and his proposal was defeated 10 – 1 . There were many advantages to the original method of electing senators . Prior to the Constitution , a federal body was one where states effectively formed nothing more than permanent treaties , with citizens retaining their loyalty to their original state . However , under the Constitution , the states were subordinated to a central government ; the election of senators by the states reassured Anti @-@ federalists that there would be some protection against the swallowing up of states and their powers by the federal government , providing a check on the power of the federal government . 
 Additionally , the longer terms and avoidance of popular election turned the Senate into a body that could " temper " the populism of the House . While the Representatives operated in a two @-@ year direct election cycle , making them frequently accountable to their constituents , the senators could afford to " take a more detached view of issues coming before Congress " . State legislatures retained the theoretical right to " instruct " their senators to vote for or against proposals , thus giving the states both direct and indirect representation in the federal government . The Senate was part of a formal bicameralism , with the members of the Senate and House responsible to completely distinct constituencies ; this helped defeat the problem of the federal government being subject to " special interests " . Members of the Constitutional Convention considered the Senate to be equivalent to the British House of Lords as an ' upper house ' , containing the " better men " of society ; it was hoped that they would provide more coolness and stability than the House of Representatives due to the senators ' status . 
 = = = Issues = = = 
 According to Judge Jay Bybee of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit , those in favor of popular elections for senators believed that two primary problems were caused by the original provisions : legislative corruption and electoral deadlocks . There was a sense that senatorial elections were " bought and sold " , changing hands for favors and sums of money rather than because of the competence of the candidate . Between 1857 and 1900 , the Senate investigated three elections over corruption . In 1900 , for example , William A. Clark had his election voided after the Senate concluded that he had bought votes in the Montana legislature . But , analysts Bybee and Todd <unk> believe this concern was largely unfounded ; there was a " dearth of hard information " on the subject . In more than a century of legislative elections of US senators , only 10 cases were contested for allegations of impropriety . 
 Electoral deadlocks were another issue . Because state legislatures were charged with deciding whom to appoint as senators , the system relied on them being able to agree . Some states could not , and thus delayed sending representatives to Congress ; in a few cases , the system broke down to the point where states completely lacked representation in the Senate . <unk> started to become an issue in the 1850s , with a dead @-@ locked Indiana legislature allowing a Senate seat to sit vacant for two years . Between 1891 and 1905 , 46 elections were deadlocked , in 20 different states ; in one extreme example , a Senate seat for Delaware went unfilled from 1899 until 1903 . The business of holding elections also caused great disruption in the state legislatures , with a full third of the Oregon House of Representatives choosing not to swear the oath of office in 1897 due to a dispute over an open Senate seat . The result was that the legislature was unable to pass legislation that year . 
 <unk> again argues that this was not a serious issue . <unk> were a problem , but they were the exception rather than the norm ; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all . Most of those that did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states , which suffered from " inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline ... as western legislatures gained experience , deadlocks became less frequent . " While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899 , they became " a good teaching experience , " and Utah never again failed to elect senators . Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred , state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business ; James Christian Ure , writing in the South Texas Law Review , notes that this did not in fact occur . In a deadlock situation , state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding " one vote at the beginning of the day — then the legislators would continue with their normal affairs " . 
 State legislative elections were perceived to have become dominated by the business of picking senators . Senator John H. Mitchell noted that the Senate became the " vital issue " in all legislative campaigns , with the policy stances and qualifications of state legislative candidates ignored by voters who were more interested in the indirect Senate election . To remedy this , some state legislatures created " advisory elections " that served as de facto general elections , allowing legislative campaigns to focus on local issues . 
 = = = Calls for reform = = = 
 Calls for a constitutional amendment regarding Senate elections started in the early 19th century , with Henry R. Storrs in 1826 proposing an amendment to provide for popular election . Similar amendments were introduced in 1829 and 1855 , with the " most prominent " proponent being Andrew Johnson , who raised the issue in 1868 and considered the idea 's merits " so palpable " that no additional explanation was necessary . In the 1860s , there was a major Congressional dispute over the issue , with the House and Senate voting to veto the appointment of John P. Stockton to the Senate due to his approval by a plurality rather than a majority vote for the office . In reaction , the Congress passed a bill in July 1866 that required state legislatures to elect senators by an absolute majority . 
 By the 1890s , support for the introduction of direct election for the Senate had substantially increased , and reformers worked on two fronts . On the first front , the Populist Party incorporated the direct election of senators into its Omaha Platform , adopted in 1892 . In 1908 , Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote . Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska . Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non @-@ binding primaries for Senate candidates , in which the candidates would be voted on by the public , effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote ; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method . 
 William Randolph Hearst opened a nationwide popular readership for direct election of U.S. Senators in a 1906 series of articles using flamboyant language attacking “ The Treason of the Senate ” in his Cosmopolitan Magazine . David Graham Philips , one of the " yellow journalists " whom President Teddy Roosevelt called “ <unk> ” , described Nelson Aldrich of Rhode Island as the principal “ traitor ” among the “ scurvy lot ” in control of the Senate by theft , perjury , and bribes corrupting the state legislatures to gain election to the Senate . A few state legislatures began to petition the Congress for direct election of senators . By 1893 , the House had the two @-@ thirds vote for just such an amendment . However , when the joint resolution reached the Senate , it failed from neglect , as it did again in 1900 , 1904 and 1908 ; each time the House approved the appropriate resolution , and each time it died in the Senate . 
 On the second national legislative front , reformers worked toward a constitutional amendment , which was strongly supported in the House of Representatives but initially opposed by the Senate . Bybee notes that the state legislatures , which would lose power if the reforms went through , were supportive of the campaign . By 1910 , 31 state legislatures had passed resolutions calling for a constitutional amendment allowing direct election , and in the same year ten Republican senators who were opposed to reform were forced out of their seats , acting as a " wake @-@ up call to the Senate " . 
 Reformers included William Jennings Bryan , while opponents counted respected figures such as Elihu Root and George Frisbie Hoar among their number ; Root cared so strongly about the issue that after the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , he refused to stand for re ‑ election to the Senate . Bryan and the reformers argued for popular election through highlighting perceived flaws with the existing system , specifically corruption and electoral deadlocks , and through arousing populist sentiment . Most important was the populist argument ; that there was a need to " Awaken , in the senators ... a more acute sense of responsibility to the people " , which it was felt they lacked ; election through state legislatures was seen as an anachronism that was out of step with the wishes of the American people , and one that had led to the Senate becoming " a sort of aristocratic body – too far removed from the people , beyond their reach , and with no special interest in their welfare " . The settlement of the West and continuing absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants expanded the sense of " the people . " 
 Hoar replied that ' the people ' were both a less permanent and a less trusted body than state legislatures , and that moving the responsibility for the election of senators to them would see it passing into the hands of a body that " [ lasted ] but a day " before changing . Other counterarguments were that renowned senators could not have been elected directly , and that since a large number of senators had experience in the House , which was already directly elected , a constitutional amendment would be pointless . The reform was considered by opponents to threaten the rights and independence of the states , who were " sovereign , entitled ... to have a separate branch of Congress ... to which they could send their ambassadors " . This was countered by the argument that a change in the mode in which senators were elected would not change their responsibilities . 
 The Senate freshman class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers . Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators had been elected through party primaries , which amounted to popular choice in their states . More than half of the states had some form of primary selection for the Senate . The Senate finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification , nearly ninety years after it first was presented to the Senate in 1826 . 
 By 1912 , 239 political parties at both the state and national level had pledged some form of direct election , and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries . Twenty @-@ seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject , with 31 states needed to reach the threshold ; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year ( bringing the total number of states to 48 ) , and were expected to support the motion . Alabama and Wyoming , already states , had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one .

 In 1911 , the House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 39 proposing a constitutional amendment for direct election of senators . It included a “ race rider ” meant to bar federal intervention in cases of racial discrimination against voters . Since the turn of the century , most blacks in the South , and many poor whites , had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with provisions that were discriminatory in practice . This meant that their millions of population had no political representation . Most of the South had one @-@ party states . When the resolution came before the Senate , a substitute resolution , one without the rider , was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas . It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24 , with 4 not voting . Nearly a year later , the House accepted the change . The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12 , 1912 , and by the House 238 to 39 , with 110 not voting on May 13 , 1912 .

 = = = Effect = = = 
 The Seventeenth Amendment altered the process for electing United States Senators and changed the way vacancies would be filled . Under the original constitutional provision , state legislatures filled vacancies when a Senator left office before the end of the term ; the Seventeenth Amendment provides that state legislatures can grant governors the right to make temporary appointments , which last until a special election is provided to fill the seat . The power to call such an election can also be granted to the governor . It also had an immediate and dramatic impact on the political composition of the U.S. Senate . 
 Before the Supreme Court required " one man , one vote " in Reynolds v. Sims ( 1964 ) , rural counties and cities could be given equal weight in the state legislatures , enabling one rural vote to equal 200 city votes . The malapportioned state legislatures would have given the Republicans control of the Senate in the 1916 Senate elections . With direct election , each vote represented equally , the Democrats retained control of the Senate . 
 The reputation of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives implementing popular reforms . Judge Bybee has argued that the amendment led to complete " ignominy " for state legislatures without the props of a state @-@ based check on Congress . Progressive measures were enacted to enable the federal government to supersede the discredited states repeatedly over decades . However , <unk> argues that the separation of state legislatures and the Senate has had a beneficial effect on the states , as it has allowed state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues . 
 New Deal legislation is another example of expanding federal regulation overruling the state legislatures promoting their local state interests in coal , oil , corn and cotton . Ure agrees , saying that not only is each Senator now free to ignore his state 's interests , Senators " have incentive to use their advice @-@ and @-@ consent powers to install Supreme Court justices who are inclined to increase federal power at the expense of state sovereignty " . Over the first half of the 20th century , with a popularly elected Senate confirming nominations , both Republican and Democratic , the Supreme Court began to apply the Bill of Rights to the states , overturning state laws whenever they harmed individual state citizens . 
 = = = First direct elections to the Senate = = = 
 Oklahoma , admitted to statehood in 1907 , chose a Senator by legislative election three times : twice in 1907 , when admitted , and once in 1908 . In 1912 , Oklahoma reelected Robert Owen by advisory popular vote . 
 New Mexico , admitted to statehood in 1912 , chose only its first two Senators legislatively . Arizona , admitted to statehood in 1912 , chose its first two Senators by advisory popular vote . Alaska , and Hawaii , admitted to statehood in 1959 , have never chosen a U.S. Senator legislatively . 
 The first direct elections to the Senate following the Seventeenth Amendment being adopted were : 
 In Maryland on November 4 , 1913 : a class 1 special election due to a vacancy , for a term ending in 1917 . 
 In Alabama on May 11 , 1914 : a class 3 special election due to a vacancy , for a term ending in 1915 . 
 Nationwide in 1914 : All 32 class 3 senators , term 1915 – 1921

 In Trinsey v. Pennsylvania ( 1991 ) , the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit was faced with a situation where , following the death of Senator H. John Heinz III of Pennsylvania , Governor Robert P. Casey had provided for a replacement and for a special election that did not include a primary . A voter and prospective candidate , John S. Trinsey , Jr . , argued that the lack of a primary violated the Seventeenth Amendment and his right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment . The Third Circuit rejected these arguments , ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries . 
 Another subject of analysis is whether statutes restricting the authority of governors to appoint temporary replacements are constitutional . Vikram Amar , writing in the Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly , claims that Wyoming 's requirement that its governor fill a senatorial vacancy by nominating a person of the same party as the person who vacated that Senate seat violates the Seventeenth Amendment . This is based on the text of the Seventeenth Amendment , which states that " the legislature of any state may empower the executive thereof to make temporary appointments " . The amendment only empowers the legislature to delegate the authority to the governor and , once that authority has been delegated , does not permit the legislature to intervene . The authority is to decide whether or not the governor shall have the power to appoint temporary senators , not in what fashion he should do so . Sanford Levinson , in his rebuttal to Amar , argues that rather than engaging in a textual interpretation , those examining the meaning of constitutional provisions should interpret them in the fashion that provides the most benefit , and that legislatures being able to restrict gubernatorial appointment authority provides a substantial benefit to the states . 
 Due to the controversy over the effects of the Seventeenth Amendment , advocates have emerged for both reform and / or repeal of the amendment . Under President Barack Obama 's administration in 2009 , four sitting Democratic senators left the Senate for appointed executive branch positions : Barack Obama ( President ) , Joe Biden ( Vice President ) , Hillary Rodham Clinton ( Secretary of State ) , and Ken Salazar ( Secretary of the Interior ) . Controversies developed about the successor appointments made by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and New York Governor David Paterson . New interest was aroused in abolishing the provision for the Senate appointment by the governor . 
 Accordingly , Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and Representative David Dreier of California proposed an amendment to remove this power ; Senators John McCain and Dick Durbin became co @-@ sponsors , as did Representative John Conyers . The Tea Party movement has been arguing for repealing the Seventeenth Amendment entirely , claiming that it would protect states ' rights and reduce the power of the federal government . 
 On March 2 , 2016 , the Utah legislature approved Senate Joint Resolution No. 2 asking Congress to offer an amendment to the United States Constitution that would repeal the Seventeenth Amendment . 
 = Tropical Depression One ( 2009 ) = 
 Tropical Depression One was the first tropical cyclone to develop during the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season . Upon being declared a tropical depression on May 28 , it marked the third time that a pre @-@ season storm formed in three consecutive years . Originating from a disorganized area of low pressure off the coast of North Carolina , Tropical Depression One quickly developed over the Gulf stream . After attaining winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) along with a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 71 inHg ) , the depression began to weaken due to increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures . During the afternoon of May 29 , convection associated with the system was significantly displaced from the center of circulation ; this led the National Hurricane Center to issue their final advisory on the depression as it had degenerated into a remnant @-@ low pressure area . As a tropical cyclone , Tropical Depression One had no effects on land ; however , the precursor to the depression brought minor rainfall and light winds to parts of coastal North Carolina . Its track , formation , and timing were relatively similar to Tropical Storm One of the 1940 Atlantic hurricane season . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During mid @-@ May , a frontal boundary stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated . On May 25 , a shortwave trough caused the northern portion of the system to move north of the Bahamas . The following day , an area of low pressure developed along the boundary about 290 miles ( 465 km ) south @-@ southwest of Wilmington , North Carolina . Tracking towards the north , the system became increasingly organized . On May 27 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for the low while it was located about 120 miles ( 195 km ) south of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . An upper @-@ level ridge situated to the southeast of the system was steering it towards the northeast . The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 0000 UTC on May 28 while the system was located about 90 mi ( 150 km ) east of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina , as development of the low was not expected . 
 On May 28 , the NHC once again initiated outlooks on the system as convection quickly redeveloped . Around 1500 UTC , they designated the system as Tropical Depression One while it was located about 310 mi ( 500 km ) south of Providence , Rhode Island . Upon being classified , the depression exhibited deep convective activity , with the center of circulation situated on the northwestern edge . The redevelopment of the system was the result of low wind shear and warm waters , up to 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) , from the Gulf Stream . Later that day , convection began to diminish as the depression tracked into an area of progressively higher shear and cooler waters . By this time , the system was embedded within the westerlies between a subtropical ridge to the southeast and a trough to the northwest . Around 2330 UTC , a <unk> satellite pass over the depression found tropical storm @-@ force winds ; however , the winds were determined to have been affected by rain and therefore not representative of the depression 's actual intensity . Following the satellite pass , the center of circulation became partially exposed to the northwest and the area of convection associated with the depression diminished in area . 
 Early on May 29 , Tropical Depression One nearly attained tropical storm status , with intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique reaching T2.5 , or 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) ; however , the estimates were also as low as <unk> , leading to the intensity of the depression remaining at 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . After a burst in convective activity overnight , shower and thunderstorm activity waned once more by 0700 UTC . Situated at the edge of the Gulf Stream , intensification into a tropical storm was no longer anticipated . Later that morning , the center of circulation became fully exposed by strong wind shear ; an approaching trough also began absorbing the small depression by this time . The remaining convection associated with the system was displaced to the southeast . With no convection developing around the depression , it degenerated into a remnant @-@ low pressure area during the afternoon of May 29 . At 2100 UTC , the NHC issued their final advisory on Tropical Depression One . The remnants of the depression persisted until 0600 UTC on May 30 , at which time it was absorbed by a warm front south of Nova Scotia . 
 = = Preparations , impact and records = = 
 The precursor to Tropical Depression One produced light showers over parts of North Carolina on May 27 . Rainfall in Hatteras amounted to 0 @.@ 1 in ( 2 @.@ 5 mm ) on May 27 ; sustained wind reached 15 mph ( 24 km / h ) and gusts were measured up to 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) . The lowest sea level pressure recorded in relation to the system was 1009 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 81 inHg ) . Increased winds along coastal areas of the state was possible in relation to the outer edges of the depression . Tropical Depression One was the farthest north a May tropical cyclone is known to have formed , according to the NHC 's Tropical Cyclone Report . 
 = Plum River raid = 
 The Plum River raid was a bloodless skirmish that occurred at present @-@ day Savanna , Illinois , on May 21 , 1832 , as part of the Black Hawk War . Most of the settlement 's inhabitants , except for a few defenders , had fled for Galena , Illinois , before the raid happened . A small band of Native Americans , either Sauk or Fox , attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present . The men who were present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour , after which the attackers withdrew . No one was killed or injured during the attack , but in its aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to Savanna . They returned to Galena without incident and the settlement at Savanna was temporarily abandoned . 
 = = Background = = 
 As a consequence of an 1804 treaty between the Governor of Indiana Territory and a group of Sauk and Fox leaders regarding land settlement , the Sauk and Fox tribes vacated their lands in Illinois and moved west of the Mississippi in 1828 . However , Sauk Chief Black Hawk and others disputed the treaty , claiming that the full tribal councils had not been consulted , nor did those representing the tribes have authorization to cede lands . Angered by the loss of his birthplace , between 1830 – 31 Black Hawk led a number of incursions across the Mississippi River , but was persuaded to return west each time without bloodshed . In April 1832 , encouraged by promises of alliance with other tribes and the British , he again moved his so @-@ called " British Band " of around 1000 warriors and non @-@ combatants into Illinois . Finding no allies , he attempted to return across the Mississippi ( to modern Iowa ) , but ensuing events led to the Battle of Stillman 's Run . A number of other engagements followed and the militia of Michigan Territory and the state of Illinois were mobilized to hunt down Black Hawk 's band . The conflict became known as the Black Hawk War . After Stillman 's Run , an ambush at Buffalo Grove killed one militia member two days before the raid on the Plum River settlement . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The settlement at the mouth of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River . When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832 , the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people . When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk 's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena , Illinois . In the end , while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents , the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick it out on the frontier . They partially disassembled two of the settlement 's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection . Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce , Vance Davidson , Robert Upton , William Blundell , Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays . On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred ( on the same day as the raid at Plum River ) . 
 = = Attack = = 
 On May 21 , 1832 , a small raiding party made up of some independent minded braves from Keokuk 's village or the Fox village at Dubuque 's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present @-@ day Savanna , Illinois on the Plum River . The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated by a desire to collect needed supplies . When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement they found it practically deserted : only three men were present . Of the six men originally at the settlement , three had left when the raiding party arrived : Blundell was away , Upton was hunting nearby , and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse . Of the three men left at the settlement , Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock , while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse . Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river 's edge . He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse . Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification . 
 Goss darted inside , but Hays slipped and fell before he could enter the blockhouse . As he fell , three musket balls lodged themselves into the wall where he had been standing moments before . While the attackers reloaded , Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew . A fourth man , Upton , was out hunting nearby ; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon . Upton escaped the attackers injury @-@ free . In fact , no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid . The small raiding party escaped with three horses , but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire , and the other shot dead by the settlement 's defenders . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The men at the Plum River settlement waited overnight and then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode . He ordered a militia party to the settlement to secure the it and make sure the attackers were dealt with accordingly . When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans , and plenty of bullet holes from the battle . The group continued to Fort Armstrong , where they picked up supplies , and returned to Galena without incident . On June 1 , then @-@ Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events , including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson . He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement , but no one was killed and the site abandoned since . 
 = Project Camel = 
 Project Camel was the codename given to work performed by the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) in support of the Manhattan Project during World War II . These activities included the development of detonators and other equipment , testing of bomb shapes dropped from Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress bombers , and the Salt Wells Pilot Plant , where explosive components of nuclear weapons were manufactured . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early 1930s , an emergency landing field was built by the Works Progress Administration in the Mojave Desert near the small town of Inyokern , California . Opened in 1935 , it was acquired by the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) in 1942 , and became part of the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range . In 1943 , the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) contracted with the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) for the testing and evaluation of rockets for the Navy . A suitable test area was required for this near Pasadena , California , so the area was transferred from the Army to the Navy in October 1943 , and commissioned as the Naval Ordnance Test Station ( NOTS ) in December 1943 . Workshops , laboratories and facilities were constructed for over 600 men . During 1944 , NOTS worked on the development and testing of the 3 @.@ 5 @-@ inch , 5 @-@ inch , <unk> and 11 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( Tiny Tim ) rockets . 
 By late 1944 , rocket development and testing work began to taper off , and production models started to reach the Navy and USAAF in quantity . The director of the OSRD , Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity to use some of the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with , the Manhattan Project . Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen , the head of the rocket team at Caltech , to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory , and meet with the project director , Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , the laboratory director , Robert Oppenheimer , and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory . Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well , as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war . In addition to its scientists , Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team , headed by Trevor Gardner . This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos , which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. <unk> .

 All the work done at NOTS on behalf of the Manhattan Project came under the codename Project " Camel " . The name is said to have come from a remark by a Los Alamos scientist that once a camel ( meaning Caltech ) gets its nose under a tent flap it is hard to dislodge .

 = = = Drop testing = = = 
 The Manhattan Project conducted an extensive series of drop tests to evaluate various bomb shapes . These were initially conducted with scale models of the bomb dropped from a Grumman TBF Avenger at the US Navy test range at Dahlgren , Virginia starting in August 1943 . A new airfield was constructed at NOTS , using Manhattan Project funding , with three runways , 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , 7 @,@ 700 feet ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) and 9 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) long , and 200 feet ( 61 m ) wide to accommodate the Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress . Fuel storage for 200 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 760 @,@ 000 l ) of gasoline and 20 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 76 @,@ 000 l ) of oil . It was opened on 1 June 1945 , and named Armitage Field after Navy Lieutenant John Armitage , who was killed while testing a Tiny Tim rocket at NOTS in August 1944 . 
 Three B @-@ 29s were based at Armitage for drop testing . Caltech 's Gerald Kron developed instrumentation to evaluate the test drops , which were made by aircraft based at NOTS , Muroc and Wendover Army Air Field . Getting the Fat Man to fall properly was quite difficult . One officer described it as : 
 ... a crazy bomb . It was built about like a streamlined brick , and to get [ it ] to fly reasonably well <unk> was quite a chore . 
 The resolution of the problem involved extensive testing with various fin configurations . Commander Chick Hayward initially thought that test bombs dropped at NOTS would be easier to recover than those dropped on the sands at Wendover , but they proved to have considerable ability to penetrate the desert floor , and required no less digging out . 
 The commander of Project Alberta , Captain Deak Parsons , had four bomb assembly kits produced . These kits were fully contained facilities , which included a number of Quonset huts with air conditioning . Two were shipped to the Pacific island of Tinian , where the atomic bombs were assembled . One was kept as a spare at Wendover , and one was erected at Inyokern , where it was used to assemble the explosive but non @-@ nuclear pumpkin bombs for testing . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The design of the Fat Man required that a number of explosive lenses had to be detonated simultaneously . After learning from Luis Alvarez that the Los Alamos Laboratory had encountered problems with the supply of the exploding bridgewire detonators required for this , Lauritsen found manufacturers in the Los Angeles area that could produce them . Alvarez ordered the detonators by the thousand . They were used in the bomb , but most were expended in various diagnostic tests required to verify that the detonators and the lenses worked perfectly . 
 Responsibility for the development and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen 's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson 's group at Los Alamos . By mid @-@ 1945 , the object was to produce 1 @,@ 000 detonators each week . Meeting this target proved challenging . Reliability was the key problem , with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures . In May 1945 , a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side , but were found to still be in working order . 
 = = = Pilot plant = = = 
 The explosive lenses required by the Fat Man had to be fabricated . A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S , as it was a former sawmill . Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S , and considered it only a matter of time before it blew up . On Parsons ' recommendation , Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS , because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants . He had some misgivings about this , because he thought that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety . 
 Groves and Parsons met with Lauritsen and Bruce Sage , who had built the China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made , and it was agreed that Caltech would build and operate the plant . A site was chosen in the Salt Wells Valley and work commenced on 80 buildings , 52 of them permanent , at a cost of $ 13 million . Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days . While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs , it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come . Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used . 
 Equipping the plants involved its own challenges . Some facilities had to be fabricated for the purpose . Some items were hard to locate , while others were in short supply in the wartime economy . The Manhattan Project 's overriding priority overcame this problem . In some cases , the Army had representatives at the factories where items were made who designated them for use by Project Camel . Groves felt that his fears about excessive safety were realized : reinforced concrete , blast proof doors and electrical shielding drove up costs . In the end , after 115 days , the first explosives were melted , mixed and poured on 25 July 1945 . 
 = = After the war = = 
 After the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , the Under Secretary of War , Robert P. Patterson , sent a telegram to " all the men and women employed on the Camel Project " : 
 Today the whole world knows the secret which you have helped us keep for many months . I am pleased to be able to add that the warlords of Japan now know its effects better even than we ourselves . The atomic bomb which you have helped to develop with high devotion to patriotic duty is the most devastating military weapon that any country has ever been able to turn against its enemy . No one of you has worked on the entire project or known the whole story . Each of you has done his own job and kept his own secret , and so today I speak for a grateful nation when I say congratulations and thank you all . I hope you will continue to keep the secrets you have kept so well . The need for security and for continued effort is fully as great now as it ever was . We are proud of every one of you . 
 Production at Site S ceased in late 1945 due to the cold weather . All work was then done at Salt Wells . The plant was completed in January 1946 , and all equipment was installed and working by May 1946 . Work was initially dogged by an unacceptably large number of defects in the form of cracks or imperfections in the explosive blocks . The core of the problem was that the techniques used at Los Alamos did not scale to a production site , so different methods were required . Special instrumentation was devised by Caltech 's Ira Bowen to assess the quality of the explosive blocks . 
 The temporary nature of the accommodation was no longer acceptable after the war , and the Atomic Energy Commission ( AEC ) , which took over from the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947 , spent $ 3 @.@ 252 million on 380 sets of family quarters , streets , electricity , sewers , mains water , and a small school , which was named after Groves , and opened in 1948 . Improved techniques and facilities allowed the plant to triple its output in 1947 . By 1949 , the pilot plant employed over 700 people . The pilot plant helped design and equip and train workers for the new Burlington AEC Plant , which took over responsibility for manufacturing the explosive lenses . The Salt Wells Pilot Plant was closed in 1954 . 
 = M @-@ 150 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 150 is a state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan that runs through Rochester Hills and Rochester . It is more commonly known as Rochester Road and runs from a southern terminus at the M @-@ 59 freeway north through downtown Rochester to a northern terminus at Tienken Road . M @-@ 150 has been a state trunkline since around 1930 , and within a few years of its commissioning , it was extended south through Royal Oak and north into rural Oakland County . After changes in 1960s , the highway terminated in Troy at Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) on the southern end and Tienken Road on the north . Since 1987 , it has ended at M @-@ 59 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 150 follows a single road , known locally as Rochester Road . The trunkline begins at an interchange where Rochester Road crosses the M @-@ 59 freeway at exit 46 in Rochester Hills . From there it travels north past the Hampton Golf Club and the Winchester Mall between the intersections with Auburn and Hamlin roads . Past this commercial development , the trunkline runs through residential subdivisions and near Rochester College . North of the Avon Road intersection , the highway enters Rochester and crosses the Clinton River . Rochester Road forms one of the main streets of the downtown area in Rochester as it passes through the city . North of Romeo Street , the road exits downtown and passes through another residential neighborhood . The highway crosses back into Rochester Hills before it terminates at the intersection with Tienken Road near another commercial development ; Rochester Road continues northward as a locally maintained roadway . 
 Like other state highways in Michigan , M @-@ 150 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) . In 2011 , the department 's traffic surveys showed that on average , 41 @,@ 675 vehicles used the highway daily between M @-@ 59 and Auburn Road and 27 @,@ 320 vehicles did so each day in Rochester , the highest and lowest counts along the highway , respectively . The section of M @-@ 150 between M @-@ 59 and Auburn Road is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 M @-@ 150 has always existed along Rochester Road in Oakland County since it was commissioned around the end of 1930 or in early 1931 At that time , the road ran from a junction with M @-@ 59 in , what is today , Rochester Hills , north to the northern limit of Rochester . Since then , the road has been extended and shortened a number of times . By the middle of 1936 , a 14 @-@ mile ( 23 km ) extension to the south extended the highway along Rochester Road and Stephenson Highway through Royal Oak to end at M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) , and northward to Romeo Road in northern Oakland County . 
 In 1963 , the section south of 11 Mile Road near Royal Oak was removed from M @-@ 150 ; sections were rebuilt as part of I @-@ 75 and the rest was turned over to local control . The northern extension from the 1930s was removed in 1965 when the trunkline was shortened to end on the north side of Rochester at Tienken Road . The southern section was later truncated back to the current southern terminus at M @-@ 59 in 1987 . This southern segment between I @-@ 75 and M @-@ 59 is listed on the National Highway System however .

 Art 's Auto is a historic former service station at 5 – 7 Lonsdale Avenue in Pawtucket , Rhode Island . It is a single @-@ story brick structure , with a flat roof , and a series of towers capped by pointed roofs . It was built as an automotive service station in 1927 – 28 for Arthur Normand , at a time when gasoline producers competed in part by the shape and style of their service stations . This station is one of two stations known to survive from this period in the state . Its front facade has a dramatic presentation , with square towers topped by pyramidal roofs at the corners , and a projecting round bay in the center , topped by a conical roof , with windows arrayed around the bay and on its flanks . Currently , the building is used as an office for Anchor Financial . Art 's Auto was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 .

 Constructed in 1927 – 28 , Art 's Auto stands on a triangular lot intersected by Main Street and Lonsdale Avenue ( Rhode Island Route 122 ) . Also intersecting are Thurston Street and Randall Street , forming a busy intersection in Pawtucket , Rhode Island . Built for Arthur Normand , the service station is a single @-@ story brick structure measuring 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) by 40 feet ( 12 m ) . The interior and exterior of the building is divided into two distinct sections , with the original office and sales display area measuring 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) deep and the rear area being 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) deep . 
 The front division 's corners are marked by four square turret @-@ like piers with pyramidal roofs , each capped with a single over @-@ scaled ball finial . Projecting from the center of southwest facade is a circular tower with a ten @-@ sided conical roof with a large ball finial . The front of the building has two doorways , one on each side , and the large display windows that comprise the majority of the facade , which is topped by a false mansard roof . The rear division is devoid of architectural ornamentation , consisting of a flat metal roof to house the garage of the service station . At the time of the nomination , an overhead garage door allows access for vehicles into the concrete floor service area . In 1978 , the building likely used asbestos shingles for the front roofing , but it may have been removed by later renovations . 
 = = Use = = 
 Originally used as a gas station , it had become abandoned and was slated for demolition after it was acquired by the Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency . In 1978 , the buildings historic nature was better understood and it was decided to try to preserve the property . At the time of its listing on the historic register , the property was in a rundown state when the Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency was advertising it as " the most interesting and best preserved early 20th century service station in Rhode Island " . This local attempt to revitalize and preserve historic sites was not unique because more than 4 @,@ 000 such organizations existed nationally by 1977 with the goal to re @-@ use or save such sites from destruction . The vacant property was later purchased for use by a lawyer and then by an auto dealer before being purchased Joseph Baptista in 2000 . When the property was purchased by Baptista , the ground had to be surveyed to ensure that the gas tanks had been removed . Since 2000 , Baptista 's mortgage finance company , Anchor Financial , has operated out of the location and the building has continued to retain its historic features . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Art 's Auto is historically significant and architecturally significant as a rare surviving type of novelty gas station that was constructed during the phase in which America became highly mobile and yet had not designed specific forms and marketing for automobile service stations . Art 's Auto whimsical design was intended to capture the attention of motorists and likely capitalized on the positive imagery of the design . <unk> ' Art 's Auto and <unk> 's Service Center Building are both rare surviving examples of a dedicated service station displaying whimsical designs in what has been described as the second generation service stations . In this way the building 's design represents the antithesis of standardization and the goal of promoting " image of familiarity and reliability through uniformity " . The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 .

 = Thomas S. Monson = 
 Thomas Spencer Monson ( born August 21 , 1927 ) is an American religious leader , author , and the sixteenth and current President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS Church ) . As president , Monson is considered by adherents of the religion to be a " prophet , seer , and <unk> . " A printer by trade , Monson has spent most of his life engaged in various church leadership positions and in public service . 
 Monson was ordained an LDS apostle at age 36 , served in the First Presidency under three church presidents and was the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles from March 12 , 1995 until he became President of the Church on February 3 , 2008 . He succeeded Gordon B. Hinckley as church president . 
 Monson has received four honorary doctorate degrees , as well as the Boy Scouts of America 's Silver Buffalo and the World Organization of the Scout Movement 's Bronze Wolf — both awards the highest given in each organization . Monson is a member of the National Executive Board of the Boy Scouts of America , the organization 's governing body . 
 Monson is chairman of the Boards of Trustees / Education of the Church Educational System , and was appointed by Ronald Reagan to the U.S. President 's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives . Monson married Frances Beverly Johnson Monson in the Salt Lake Temple in 1948 and they are the parents of three children . Frances Monson died on May 17 , 2013 . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Monson was born on August 21 , 1927 , in Salt Lake City , Utah to G. Spencer Monson ( 1901 – 1979 ) and Gladys <unk> Monson ( 1902 – 1973 ) . The second of six children , he grew up in a " tight @-@ knit " family — many of his mother 's relatives living on the same street and the extended family frequently going on trips together . The family 's neighborhood included several residents of Mexican descent , an environment in which he says he developed a love for the Mexican people and culture . Monson often spent weekends with relatives on their farms in Granger ( now part of West Valley City ) , and as a teenager , he took a job at the printing business that his father managed . 
 From 1940 to 1944 , Monson attended West High School in Salt Lake City . In the fall of 1944 , he enrolled at the University of Utah . Around this time he met his future wife , Frances , whose family came from a higher social class on the east side of the city . Her father , Franz Johnson , felt an immediate connection because Monson 's great uncle had baptized him into the LDS Church in Sweden . 
 In 1945 , Monson joined the United States Naval Reserve and anticipated participating in World War II in the Pacific theater . He was sent to San Diego , California , for training , but was not moved overseas before the end of the war . His tour of duty lasted six months beyond the end of the war , and after it was completed he returned to the University of Utah . Monson graduated cum laude in 1948 with a bachelor 's degree in business management . Monson did not serve a full @-@ time mission as a youth . At age 21 , on October 7 , 1948 , he married Frances Beverly Johnson in the Salt Lake Temple . The couple eventually had three children : Thomas Lee , Ann Frances , and Clark Spencer . His wife died on May 17 , 2013 . 
 After college he rejoined the Naval Reserve with the aim of becoming an officer . Shortly after receiving his commission acceptance letter , his ward bishop asked him to serve as a counselor in the bishopric . Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made serving in the Navy impossible . After discussing the matter with church apostle Harold B. Lee ( his former stake president ) , Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge . The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War . Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop — mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission . 
 Monson taught for a time at the University of Utah , then began a career in publishing . His first job was with the Deseret News , where he became an advertising executive . He joined the advertising operations of the Newspaper Agency Corporation when it was formed in 1952 . Monson later transferred to the Deseret News Press , beginning as sales manager and eventually becoming general manager . While with Deseret News Press , Monson worked to publish LeGrand Richards 's A Marvelous Work And A Wonder . He also worked with Gordon B. Hinckley , the LDS Church 's representative on publications , with whom he later served in the First Presidency . 
 = = = Young adulthood and local church leadership = = = 
 On May 7 , 1950 , Monson became an LDS bishop at age 22 . He had previously served as ward clerk , ward <unk> superintendent , and as a counselor in a bishopric . At the time , Monson 's Salt Lake City ward contained over 1 @,@ 000 people , including 85 widows whom he visited regularly . He continued his visits to these widows when he was released after five years of service . He brought them gifts during the Christmas season , including poultry he had raised himself . Monson eventually spoke at the funerals of each of these women . Also during his time as bishop , 23 men from his ward were serving in the United States military in the Korean War . He wrote personal letters to each of these men on a weekly basis . At least one of these men became fully involved with the Church as a result of Monson 's communication . 
 During the time Monson was bishop of the 6th @-@ 7th Ward sacrament meeting attendance in the ward quadrupled . 
 In June 1955 , at age 27 , Monson became a counselor to Percy K. Fetzer ( later first president of the Berlin Mission ) , president of the Salt Lake Temple View Stake . He was replaced as bishop of the 6th @-@ 7th ward the following month . In the stake presidency , Monson oversaw the stake 's Primary , Sunday School , MIA , athletics and budget . He served in the stake presidency until June 1957 , when he moved to Holladay , Utah . In Holladay , Monson became a member of the ward building committee , with the assignment to coordinate ward members ' volunteer service to build a chapel . 
 In 1959 , Monson became a mission president at age 31 . His youngest child , Clark , was born during the time he was mission president . When he became mission president there were 130 missionaries serving in the mission , with the number of missionaries later peaking at 180 . As mission president , he presided over the church 's Canadian Mission until 1962 , supervising missionaries who were not much younger than he was . The Canadian Mission consisted of Ontario and Quebec ; it was under the leadership of Monson that missionary work began among the French @-@ speaking population of Quebec . Much of the missionary work under his direction was done among immigrants from such places as the Netherlands , Germany , Poland , Italy , the Soviet Union and Hungary . Jacob de Jager , who would later be an LDS general authority , was among the immigrant converts . 
 In addition to overseeing the missionaries , since there were no local stakes , Monson was also responsible for all operations of the church in the area . When he became mission president , there were 55 church branches , divided into 9 districts , under his direction . When he became president , most districts and branches were presided over by full @-@ time missionaries . Monson changed this to have local members serve as presidents of branches and districts soon after arriving . 
 As mission president , Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada and work to build up the church there instead of migrating to the centers of the church in Utah or Alberta as many had done in the past . To assist in this effort , to increase the perception of the church and an air of permanence , and to allow better reach to potential members , he initiated a major building program to replace the rented halls most branches met in with permanent structures . 
 With the organization of a stake in Toronto on August 14 , 1960 much of Monson 's efforts at building the church in Ontario came to fruition . However most of the mission 's area remained in districts and a more complete strengthening of the church in Ontario would not come about until the dedication of the Toronto Ontario Temple in 1990 , which Monson attended as a member of the First Presidency . 
 Immediately after returning from Canada , Monson was called to serve on the high council of the Valley View Stake in Holladay . Two months later he was made area supervisor over nine stake missions , which included the Winder , Wilford , Monument Park , Monument Park West , Hillside , Highland , Parleys , <unk> and Wasatch stakes . These stakes were in either Salt Lake City or its east @-@ side suburbs , except for the Wasatch Stake , based in Heber City , Utah . He was also made a member of the Priesthood Genealogy Committee and later the Priesthood Home Teaching Committee . 
 Upon his return to Utah after his mission to Canada , Monson resumed his work with the Deseret News . He was the assistant general manager of the Deseret News Press , the printing arm of the press mainly doing non @-@ newspaper printing . A month later he was made the general manager of the Deseret News Press . At the time , it was the largest printing plant in the United States , west of the Mississippi River . Monson remained in this position until he was called as an apostle in 1963 , at age 36 . 
 = = = Apostleship = = = 
 Monson was sustained a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles at general conference on October 4 , 1963 . He was the youngest man called to the quorum in 53 years and 17 years younger than the next youngest member , Gordon B. Hinckley . He was ordained an apostle and set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on October 10 , 1963 , by Joseph Fielding Smith . 
 As an LDS Church apostle , Monson worked in many capacities all around the world . With his business background , he helped oversee many operations of the church , including KSL Newsradio and Bonneville International . He was chairman of the Scripture Publication Committee in the 1970s that oversaw publication of the LDS Church edition of the King James Bible and revised editions of church scriptures containing footnotes and guides . He has also overseen the church 's Printing Advisory , Missionary Executive and General Welfare committees . While an apostle , he continued his education and received a master of business administration degree from Brigham Young University in 1974 . As of 1973 , Monson was one of four members of the church 's Missionary Executive Committee . 
 From 1965 to 1968 , Monson had the responsibility of overseeing church operations in the South Pacific and Australia . During this time he organized the first LDS stake in Tonga . 
 Monson also oversaw church operations in Eastern Europe and helped the church gain access to its members in the Soviet bloc . In 1982 , he organized the first stake in East Germany and was instrumental in obtaining permission for the church to build a temple in Freiberg , East Germany , in 1985 .

In 1993 when the bank was bought out by Key Bank , Monson was made a member of the Board of Directors of Key Bank . This was one of multiple positions that Monson resigned in 1996 when it was decided that general authorities of the LDS Church should leave all business boards of directors , with the lone exception of the board of Deseret Management Corporation .

He served until Hinckley 's death on January 27 , 2008 . As the second in seniority among the apostles behind Hinckley , Monson simultaneously served as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles ; Boyd K. Packer ( then third in seniority behind Hinckley and Monson ) served as Acting President during that time .

 Monson became the 16th president of the LDS Church on February 3 , 2008 , succeeding Hinckley , who had died seven days earlier . Monson selected Henry B. Eyring and Dieter F. <unk> as his first and second counselors , respectively . When Monson was born , there were fewer than 650 @,@ 000 members of the church in the world , with most of them being based in the western United States . When he became president , there were over 13 million members worldwide , with the majority of the membership living outside the United States and Canada . As of October 2012 , 31 temples announced by Monson are either under construction or in planning . 
 Monson and his counselors in the First Presidency met with President George W. Bush on May 29 , 2008 during Bush 's visit to Salt Lake City . He and apostle Dallin H. Oaks met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Senator Harry Reid in the Oval Office on July 20 , 2009 and presented Obama with five volumes of personal family history records . 
 Monson was notably absent for a meeting other church leaders , including Eyring and <unk> , had with Obama during his visit to Utah in April 2015 .

 = Battle of the Lippe = 
 The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action fought on 2 September 1595 on the banks of the Lippe river , in Germany , between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de Córdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry , supported by English troops , led by Philip of Nassau . The Dutch <unk> Maurice of Nassau , taking advantage of the fact that the bulk of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France , besieged the town of Groenlo in Gelderland , but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp , Cristóbal de Mondragón , organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege . Mondragón next moved to Wesel , positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack . Maurice aimed then , relying on his superior army , to entice Mondragón into a pitched battle , planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap . However , the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander , who organized a counter @-@ ambush . 
 The Dutch intended to overtake a Spanish foraging convoy and deliver it into their camp in order to draw the Spanish army in pursuit to the banks of the Lippe , where Maurice was awaiting with the Dutch States Army in order of battle . However , Mondragón reinforced the escort of the convoy and hid a large force of cavalry in a wood nearby under his lieutenant Juan de Córdoba . Thanks to Mondragón 's long experience , the Spanish routed the Dutch force and inflicted a number of casualties upon Philip of Nassau 's men , including himself and several other high @-@ ranking Dutch and English officers in the Dutch army . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1595 , Henry IV of France declared war on Spain in response to Philip II 's continued support of the Catholic League of France , and formed an alliance with Elizabeth I of England and the Dutch Republic , who were engaged in their own wars against the Spanish Crown . The Catholic Netherlands were , consequently , caught between two fronts , and French and Dutch forces even tried to create a corridor linking their respective states through the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège . The new Governor @-@ General of the Spanish Netherlands , the Count of Fuentes , directed his efforts against Picardy and Cambrésis , leaving a few troops to defend the loyal provinces from a Dutch attack . 
 In July , while Fuentes was busied in the siege of <unk> , Maurice of Nassau , <unk> of the Dutch Republic , assembled a force of 6 @,@ 000 infantry , some cavalry companies and 16 artillery pieces of the Dutch States Army , and led them under the walls of Groenlo , a medium @-@ sized town in the County of Zutphen . Its northern flank defended by the <unk> , a stream of the Berkel river , Groenlo was fortified with five bulwarks and garrisoned by 11 infantry companies from Count Herman van den Bergh 's regiment numbering 600 troops under Jan van <unk> , a German officer , and four small artillery pieces . 
 On receiving news of the siege , Cristóbal de Mondragón , the elderly Spanish governor of Antwerp , whom Fuentes had left in command of the Spanish forces opposite to the Dutch , collected a little army gathering forces of several garrisons and marched to Groenlo through Brabant and Gelderland . Mondragón 's force comprised two Spanish tercios ( under Luis de Velasco and Antonio de Zúñiga ) , an Irish regiment under William Stanley , a Swiss regiment and 1 @,@ 300 cavalry under Juan de Córdoba , which , having crossed the Meuse at Venlo , were joined by Frederick van den Bergh 's German regiment . 
 At over 80 , Mondragón was still able to mount on horseback , though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour . He first came to prominence at the Battle of Mühlberg , in 1547 , and was one of the few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces , being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter <unk> Hooft . Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo , but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle . The Dutch general , however , on receiving news of his enemy 's march , set fire to supplies , tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo . Mondragón could therefore <unk> the town unmolested . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 After Groenlo was secured , Mondragón marched south to Rheinberg to cover the town from a Dutch attack . He encamped his army near Wesel , at <unk> , while Maurice followed him and took up positions at <unk> , both armies being separated by the Lippe river . The Spanish position was strong ; the rearguard and the left flank covered by the Rhine and the right flank by the Lippe and a range of moorland hills called <unk> . For several weeks both armies looked at each other , often skirmishing when both cavalries sallied to forage . As time passed , the Spanish foragers were forced to look for victuals two or three leagues far away from their camp . Maurice took the opportunity to plan a mock ambush on Mondragón 's foraging convoy aiming to lure him into a general action in which he could destroy the Spanish army . Mondragón also hoped to lure his enemy into a trap . 
 On 1 September , Maurice gave the command of the ambush to his favourite commander , his cousin Philip of Nassau . Maurice instructed him to cross the Lippe river the following day at dawn , hide in a wood next to which the Spanish convoy was expected to pass , and fall on its guard . Maurice 's goal was to seize the foraging convoy , separate it from the escort and lead it to the Dutch camp , thus forcing Mondragón to intervene with a larger force . Then , after the appearance of Mondragón with the main army , Nassau was to retreat to the Dutch camp , thus luring the Spanish army into an ambush . For his task , Nassau received the command of some 500 or 700 Dutch and English horsemen and was accompanied by his two brothers , Ernst Casimir and Ludwig Gunther , as well as several other Dutch officers , Count Ernst of Solms , Paul and Marcellus <unk> , and the English captains Nicholas Parker , Cutler and Robert Vere . 
 The Dutch intentions were anticipated by the Spanish . According to Joseph de La Pise , a French jurist hired by Maurice 's half brother and successor Frederick Henry to write a history of the Princes of Orange , Mondragón had learned of the ambush from English soldiers who had deserted from the Dutch colours , but the Italian Jesuit Angello Gallucci claims that it was Spanish spies who informed Mondragón , who had used spies to gather information on the enemy since the siege of <unk> , in 1576 . In any case , the Spanish general took measures to turn Nassau 's surprise into a trap . The convoy , normally guarded by 300 infantry and 150 cavalry , was reinforced by 300 musketeers and a large force of cavalry under Mondragón 's lieutenant , Juan de Córdoba . 
 = = Action = = 
 On 2 September , at dawn , the Dutch force crossed the Lippe across a pontoon bridge . Maurice awaited them with 5 @,@ 000 infantry and the rest of his cavalry arranged for the battle in the hills near Wesel , along the opposite riverbank . Philip of Nassau divided his troops into four squadrons : the first one of 125 men under the <unk> of <unk> , the second one of 125 men under the Count of Kinsky , the third one , those in which Nassau and his brothers marched , of 150 soldiers under Lieutenant Balen , and the last , closing the way , of 120 men under the English captain Nicholas Parker . Having arrived at <unk> , Nassau sent 40 chosen men from the companies led by Balen to surprise the foraging horses . On finding a force much larger than they expected , the Dutch officers thought that something was wrong and sent a report back to Philip of Nassau . The Dutch commander , nevertheless , believed that it was only the convoy 's escort and moved on with his troops and his entourage to attack the Spanish cavalry , aiming to prevent its escape . 
 The Dutch officers ' report was not mistaken : early in the morning , two Spanish scouts had found the track of the Dutch force crossing the river , and Mondragón , anticipating them , had deployed his cavalry beyond a <unk> , the countryside southwards the Lippe being covered by small woods alternating with moorlands . Besides the troops guarding the convoy , Juan de Córdoba had the command of at least seven cavalry companies : those of Hendrik van den Bergh , Girolamo Caraffa , Carlo Maria Caracciolo , Paulo Emilio Martinengo , his own company , ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch lances under Adolf van den Bergh and Sancho de Leyva 's company . Other authors also list Alonso Mendo 's company . Mondragón had informed the guard of the convoy of the Dutch intentions and encouraged the soldiers to hold their ground , promising them that he was behind them with the whole Spanish army to come in relief . 
 Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky 's company , and followed by the bulk of his force , Nassau passed through a narrow path in a small forest , and , coming out to open field , was surprised by the Spanish troops , namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh , followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch lances . Van den Bergh 's harquebusiers , discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest , fired a volley and , turning right , clashed with the Dutch scouts , starting the action . There was then a <unk> fight . The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons , but caught by surprise in a narrow passage , the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances , so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols . Philip of Nassau , his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight . Kinsky 's and Balen 's troops , coming in relief , were unable to rescue the wounded commanders , and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield . Nicholas Parker , however , managed to collect the fugitives and , renewing the action , he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry . The encounter turned then a general action out the wood , in open ground . 
 At first the Dutch were winning the action , but after they put in disorder two or three Spanish squadrons , Paulo Emilio Martinengo charged ahead his company on their flank and in turn routed a Dutch squadron , which allowed Córdoba to regroup his troops and renew the attack , this time with success . Despite the stubborn resistance offered by the Dutch troops , they were finally broken and fled in a disorderly fashion , attempting to save themselves before the Lippe river . Córdoba sent his cavalry to follow them up , and they found that some of the Dutch soldiers , having been unable to find a good place to ford the river , had drowned . The Spanish captives were freed , and the spoils taken by the Dutch recovered . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle is noted for the heavy death toll among the Dutch commanders . Philip of Nassau was mortally wounded at the beginning of the action , shot at point blank range through the body with an <unk> , his robes being set on fire . Robert Vere , brother of the English colonel Horace Vere , was slain by a lance thrust in the face . The <unk> of <unk> and Count Ferdinand Kinsky were also killed . Count Ernst of Solms was seriously wounded and captured . Together with Philip , he was carried to Rheinberg , where both soldiers were visited by Mondragón and their Catholic cousins , the Van den Bergh brothers , and treated by the Spanish surgeons . Despite all the attentions , both Dutch commanders died of the wounds they had sustained ; Nassau the night after the battle , and Solms three days later . Count Ernst Casimir was captured and ransomed for 10 @,@ 000 florins . Mondragón dispatched him to Maurice of Nassau with the bodies of the dead counts , which were buried with honours at Arnhem . 
 As for the battle losses , sources vary . The Flemish Protestant Guillaume Baudart set Dutch losses at 88 horses , 83 prisoners and 24 killed . The Italian Cardinal Guido Bentivoglio claimed that more than 300 Dutch soldiers were slain as opposed to about 60 Spanish casualties . The Roman Jesuit Angelo Gallucci also wrote of 300 Dutch casualties . The Spanish soldier and writer Carlos Coloma set the Spanish loss as 19 men killed and claimed that the Dutch force lost three flags and about 400 serviceable horses . On the Spanish side the only soldiers of note among the casualties were Caraffa , Martinengo and Caracciolo , all of whom were wounded , but not mortally . Joseph de La Pise stated that the Dutch took seven Spanish prisoners and 15 horses . According to Antonio Carnero , accountant in the Spanish army , an envoy of the King of France to the Dutch camp was present at the battle and found later among the fatalities . 
 The English author Edward <unk> wrote , in his book A General History of the Netherlands , that the battle of the Lippe " was a <unk> <unk> of young and hot <unk> , who <unk> but bad <unk> that got nothing " . Even though it was only a small battle , it was celebrated joyfully at the Spanish camp before Cambrai . Three salvos were fired upon the city by 87 artillery pieces and 6 @,@ 000 muskets and arquebuses . The North @-@ American historian John Lothrop Motley highlighted the key role played by the 91 @-@ year @-@ old Mondragón in the Spanish victory : 
 This skirmish on the Lippe has no special significance in a military point of view , but it derives more than a passing interest , not only from the death of many a brave and distinguished soldier , but for the illustration of human vigour triumphing , both physically and mentally , over the infirmities of old age , given by the achievement of Christopher <unk> . Alone he had planned his expedition across the country from Antwerp , alone he had insisted on crossing the Rhine , while younger soldiers hesitated ; alone , with his own active brain and busy hands , he had outwitted the famous young chieftain of the Netherlands , counteracted his subtle policy , and set the counter @-@ ambush by which his choicest cavalry were cut to pieces , and one of his bravest generals slain . So far could the icy blood of ninety @-@ two prevail against the vigour of twenty @-@ eight . 
 The Spanish and Dutch armies spent 16 more days observing each other from their encampments , but no action of importance ensued . Maurice of Nassau laid a bridge over the Rhine and tried to take <unk> by surprise , but the enterprise was discovered . He also committed Count William Louis of Nassau @-@ Dillenburg to intercept five Spanish companies sent by Mondragón to lodge in Twente , but the Spaniards managed to reach Enschede , leaving only a few chariots with supplies in Dutch hands . On 11 October , lacking of forage , Mondragón retired back to Brabant . Maurice aimed to cut off his retreat , but the Spaniard succeeded in bringing his troops to a secure position . Mondragón re @-@ crossed the Meuse in November and distributed his troops in different towns . Before crossing the river the Swiss mercenaries were paid and <unk> . On 4 January 1596 , the elderly general died in the citadel of Antwerp . On his deathbed he wrote a letter to Philip II asking for the castellany of Antwerp for his son Alonso and a company of lances for his grandson Cristóbal , but both requests were denied .

It is also known as Ford Road for nearly its entire length , except for its westernmost portion where the highway follows a short expressway to the M @-@ 14 freeway . Named for William Ford , father of Henry Ford , Ford Road runs from near Dixboro to the Dearborn – Detroit border . The M @-@ 153 designation continues along Wyoming Avenue where it terminates at a junction with Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) and US Highway 12 ( US 12 ) on the city line . 
 Ford Road has been a part of the state highway system since December 3 , 1930 . Since the state has maintained the roadway as M @-@ 153 , it has been extended westward from Wayne County into Washtenaw County and upgraded in sections to expressway conditions . The first of these improvements were made in the 1930s with additional upgrades in the 1960s and 1970s . The last change was made by 1980 to create the modern routing . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 153 starts as an interchange with M @-@ 14 's exit 10 in Superior Township east of Ann Arbor . The highway starts as an expressway curving southeasterly to meet Ford Road near the curve eastward in the expressway at <unk> Lake Road , a gravel road northeast of the unincorporated community of Dixboro . Ford Road continues west of here to end at Plymouth Road south of the M @-@ 14 freeway , and east of this location , M @-@ 153 follows Ford Road through wooded , partially developed terrain to the Washtenaw – Wayne county line at Napier Road . Near the county line are farms until Ford Road reaches residential subdivisions at Ridge Road in Canton Township . At the east edge of the township , Ford Road meets I @-@ 275 at exit 25 before passing into Westland between <unk> and Hix roads . 
 The interchange with I @-@ 275 is built over the western crossing of Willow Creek , a tributary of the River Rouge ; the eastern crossing is located between Hix and Newburgh roads near Central City Park . Ford Road continues east , forming a section of the Garden City boundary near <unk> Road . The trunkline crosses into Dearborn Heights at Inkster Road . It forms the boundary between Dearborn and Dearborn Heights between Gulley and Evergreen roads , crossing US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) in between . East of Telegraph Road , M @-@ 153 is built to expressway standards complete with interchanges at Edward N. Hines Drive , Evergreen Road , M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) and Greenfield Road . The highway crosses the River Rouge north of the Dearborn Country Club west of Evergreen Road . Ford Road ends at Wyoming Avenue . M @-@ 153 turns south along Wyoming Avenue to cross I @-@ 94 at exit 210 . This interchange is also the location where I @-@ 94 and US 12 ( Michigan Avenue ) cross , marking the eastern end of M @-@ 153 at Michigan Avenue . 
 Ford Road serves as the zero @-@ mile line for the Detroit area 's Mile Road System . From the Canton Center Road intersection eastward , all of M @-@ 153 is a part of the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . M @-@ 153 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 13 were the 64 @,@ 956 vehicles daily between the River Rouge and the Southfield Freeway in Dearborn ; the lowest counts were the 10 @,@ 380 vehicles per day between Plymouth Road and the end of the expressway in Superior Township . 
 = = History = = 
 Ford Road was named for William Ford , father of automobile pioneer Henry Ford . The elder Ford was born in Ireland and settled in Dearborn Township in 1847 . William 's carpentry business lead him around to regional businesses and neighbors , traveling the area until he took up the family business of farming after marriage to Mary <unk> . They settled on a farm near the intersection of modern @-@ day Ford Road and Greenfield Avenue ; this farm was Henry 's birthplace in 1863 . Settling into his family life , William started serving the local community . He was a road commissioner , school board member and a justice of the peace . In honor of his accomplishments , Ford Road was named in his honor before his death in March 1905 . 
 Ford Road remained in township jurisdiction until August 29 , 1924 when it was transferred to Wayne County control . It was transferred again to state control on December 2 , 1930 . The Michigan State Highway Department designated it M @-@ 153 upon transfer to their responsibility . The highway designation was determined to continue west of the county line into Washtenaw County as a northerly bypass of Ann Arbor , but the segment between Canton Center Road and US 12 on Plymouth Road was not built at the time . The first extension west was finished in 1933 from the county line to Napier Road . The road was widened into a major thoroughfare between Detroit and Ann Arbor in 1934 , to relieve congestion on Michigan Avenue . The highway bypass of Ann Arbor was cancelled by 1935 , leaving the western terminus at US 12 ( Plymouth Road ) . 
 Construction of a northerly freeway bypass of Ann Arbor along M @-@ 14 to M @-@ 153 was completed by 1965 . A second freeway section was built between Ford Road at <unk> Lake Road to the contemporary end of the M @-@ 14 freeway . This second freeway was assigned as part of M @-@ 153 and the former routing along Ford Road west to Plymouth Road was removed from the state trunkline highway system . A reconstruction project along M @-@ 153 in 1973 was completed , bringing the highway up to expressway standards . Several interchanges were built along the segment starting west of the M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) to I @-@ 94 in Dearborn . The last extension moved the western terminus in early 1980 when the M @-@ 14 freeway was completed , and M @-@ 153 was extended along a section of freeway used to connect the previous end of the M @-@ 14 freeway to Plymouth Road .

 = Lake Toba = 
 Lake Toba ( Indonesian : <unk> Toba ) is a large natural lake occupying the caldera of a supervolcano . The lake is about 100 kilometres long , 30 kilometres wide , and up to 505 metres ( 1 @,@ 666 ft ) deep . Located in the middle of the northern part of the Indonesian island of Sumatra , with a surface elevation of about 900 metres ( 2 @,@ 953 ft ) , the lake stretches from 2 @.@ 88 ° N 98 @.@ 52 ° E ﻿ / 2 @.@ 88 ; 98 @.@ 52 to 2 @.@ 35 ° N 99 @.@ 1 ° E ﻿ / 2 @.@ 35 ; 99 @.@ 1 . It is the largest lake in Indonesia and also the largest volcanic lake in the world . 
 Lake Toba is the site of a massive <unk> eruption estimated at VEI 8 that occurred 69 @,@ 000 to 77 @,@ 000 years ago , representing a climate @-@ changing event . It is the largest known explosive eruption on Earth in the last 25 million years . According to the Toba catastrophe theory , it had global consequences for human populations : it killed most humans living at that time and is believed to have created a population bottleneck in central east Africa and India , which affects the genetic make up of the human world @-@ wide population to the present . 
 It has been accepted that the eruption of Toba led to a volcanic winter with a worldwide decrease in temperature between 3 to 5 ° C ( 5 @.@ 4 to 9 @.@ 0 ° F ) , and up to 15 ° C ( 27 ° F ) in higher latitudes . Additional studies in Lake Malawi in East Africa show significant amounts of ash being deposited from the Toba eruptions , even at that great distance , but little indication of a significant climatic effect in East Africa . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Toba caldera complex in Northern Sumatra , comprises four overlapping volcanic craters that adjoin the Sumatran " volcanic front . " The fourth and youngest caldera is the world 's largest Quaternary caldera ( 100 by 30 km ( 62 by 19 mi ) ) and intersects the three older calderas . An estimated 2 @,@ 800 km3 ( 670 cu mi ) of dense @-@ rock equivalent pyroclastic material , known as the youngest Toba tuff , was released during one of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions in recent geological history . Following this eruption , a resurgent dome formed within the new caldera , joining two half @-@ domes separated by a longitudinal graben . 
 At least four cones , four stratovolcanoes , and three craters are visible in the lake . The <unk> cone on the northwestern edge of the caldera has only sparse vegetation , suggesting a young age of several hundred years . Also , the <unk> ( Hill Center ) volcano ( 1971 metres above sea level ) on the south edge of the caldera is <unk> active and is a Geology Sanctuary . 
 = = Major eruption = = 
 The Toba eruption ( the Toba event ) occurred at what is now Lake Toba about <unk> ± 900 years ago . It was the last in a series of at least four caldera @-@ forming eruptions at this location , with earlier calderas having formed around <unk> ± 2200 years ago . This last eruption had an estimated VEI = 8 , making it the largest known explosive volcanic eruption within the last 25 million years . 
 Bill Rose and Craig <unk> of Michigan Technological University have estimated that the total amount of material released in the eruption was about 2 @,@ 800 km3 ( 670 cu mi ) — about 2 @,@ 000 km3 ( 480 cu mi ) of ignimbrite that flowed over the ground , and approximately 800 km3 ( 190 cu mi ) that fell as ash mostly to the west . However , based on the new method ( crystal concentration and exponential ) , Toba possibly erupted 3200 km ³ of ignimbrite and co @-@ ignimbrite . The pyroclastic flows of the eruption destroyed an area of least 20 @,@ 000 km2 ( 7 @,@ 722 sq mi ) , with ash deposits as thick as 600 m ( 1 @,@ 969 ft ) by the main vent . 
 The eruption was large enough to have deposited an ash layer approximately 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick over all of South Asia ; at one site in central India , the Toba ash layer today is up to 6 m ( 20 ft ) thick and parts of Malaysia were covered with 9 m ( 30 ft ) of ash fall . In addition it has been variously calculated that 10 @,@ 000 million tonnes ( 1 @.@ 1 × 1010 short tons ) of sulfurous acid or 6 @,@ 000 million tonnes ( 6 @.@ 6 × 109 short tons ) of sulfur dioxide were ejected into the atmosphere by the event . 
 The subsequent collapse formed a caldera that , after filling with water , created Lake Toba . The island in the center of the lake is formed by a resurgent dome . 
 The exact year of the eruption is unknown , but the pattern of ash deposits suggests that it occurred during the northern summer because only the summer monsoon could have deposited Toba ashfall in the South China Sea . The eruption lasted perhaps two weeks , and the ensuing " volcanic winter " resulted in a decrease in average global temperatures by 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 5 ° C ( 5 to 6 ° F ) for several years . Greenland ice cores record a pulse of starkly reduced levels of organic carbon sequestration . Very few plants or animals in southeast Asia would have survived , and it is possible that the eruption caused a planet @-@ wide die @-@ off . However , the global cooling has been discussed by <unk> and Self . Their conclusion is that the cooling had already started before Toba 's eruption . This conclusion was supported by Lane and Zielinski who studied the lake @-@ core from Africa and <unk> . They concluded that there was no volcanic winter after Toba eruption and that high H2SO4 deposits do not cause long @-@ term effects . 
 Evidence from studies of mitochondrial DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given the age of the species . According to the Toba catastrophe theory , proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana @-@ Champaign in 1998 , the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals . However , this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been observed , and paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck . 
 = = = More recent activity = = = 
 Since the major eruption ~ 70 @,@ 000 years ago , eruptions of smaller magnitude have also occurred at Toba . The small cone of <unk> formed on the southwestern margin of the caldera and lava domes . The most recent eruption may have been at <unk> on the northwestern caldera edge , suggested by a lack of vegetation that could be due to an eruption within the last few hundred years . 
 Some parts of the caldera have shown uplift due to partial refilling of the magma chamber , for example , pushing <unk> Island and the <unk> Peninsula above the surface of the lake . The lake sediments on <unk> Island show that it has risen by at least 450 m ( 1 @,@ 476 ft ) since the cataclysmic eruption . Such uplifts are common in very large calderas , apparently due to the upward pressure of below @-@ ground magma . Toba is probably the largest resurgent caldera on Earth . Large earthquakes have recently occurred in the vicinity of the volcano , notably in 1987 along the southern shore of the lake at a depth of 11 km ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) . Such earthquakes have also been recorded in 1892 , 1916 , and 1920 – 1922 . 
 Lake Toba lies near the Great Sumatran fault , which runs along the centre of Sumatra in the Sumatra Fracture Zone . The volcanoes of Sumatra and Java are part of the Sunda Arc , a result of the northeasterly movement of the Indo @-@ Australian Plate , which is sliding under the eastward @-@ moving Eurasian Plate . The subduction zone in this area is very active : the seabed near the west coast of Sumatra has had several major earthquakes since 1995 , including the 9 @.@ 1 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 8 @.@ 7 2005 Nias – <unk> earthquake , the epicenters of which were around 300 km ( 190 mi ) from Toba . 
 = = People = = 
 Most of the people who live around Lake Toba are ethnically <unk> . Traditional Batak houses are noted for their distinctive roofs ( which curve upwards at each end , as a boat 's hull does ) and their colorful decor . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The flora of the lake includes various types of phytoplankton , emerged macrophytes , floating macrophytes , and submerged macrophytes , while the surrounding countryside is rainforest including areas of Sumatran tropical pine forests on the higher mountainsides . 
 The fauna includes several species of zooplankton and benthic animals . Since the lake is oligotrophic ( nutrient @-@ poor ) , the native fish fauna is relatively scarce , and the only endemics are <unk> <unk> ( strictly speaking near @-@ endemic , since also found in some tributary rivers that run into the lake ) and <unk> <unk> , locally known as the Batak fish . The latter species is threatened by deforestation ( causing siltation ) , pollution , changes in water level and the numerous fish species that have been introduced to the lake . Other native fishes include species such as <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Channa <unk> , Channa striata , Clarias <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Danio <unk> , <unk> vittatus , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Tor <unk> , Betta <unk> , Betta <unk> and <unk> albus .

 = Mutiny on the Bounty = 
 The mutiny on the Royal Navy vessel HMS Bounty occurred in the south Pacific on 28 April 1789 . Disaffected crewmen , led by Acting Lieutenant Fletcher Christian , seized control of the ship from their captain Lieutenant William Bligh and set him and 18 loyalists adrift in the ship 's open launch . The mutineers variously settled on Tahiti or on Pitcairn Island . Bligh meanwhile completed a voyage of more than 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ; 4 @,@ 000 mi ) in the launch to reach safety , and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice . 
 Bounty had left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies . A five @-@ month layover in Tahiti , during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians , proved harmful to discipline . Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he began handing out increasingly harsh punishments , criticism and abuse , Christian being a particular target . After three weeks back at sea , Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship . Twenty @-@ five men remained on board afterwards , including loyalists held against their will and others for whom there was no room in the launch . 
 Bligh reached England in April 1790 , whereupon the Admiralty despatched HMS Pandora to apprehend the mutineers . Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board Pandora , which then searched without success for Christian 's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island . After turning back toward England , Pandora ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef , with the loss of 31 crew and 4 prisoners from Bounty . The 10 surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court martialled ; 4 were acquitted , 3 were pardoned , and 3 were hanged . 
 Christian 's group remained undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808 , by which time only one mutineer , John Adams , remained alive . Almost all his fellow mutineers , including Christian , had been killed , either by each other or by their Polynesian companions . No action was taken against Adams ; descendants of the mutineers and their Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century . The generally accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances , as depicted in well @-@ known film accounts , has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st @-@ century historians from whom a more sympathetic picture of Bligh has emerged . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Bounty and her mission = = = 
 His Majesty 's Armed Vessel ( <unk> ) Bounty , or HMS Bounty , was built in 1784 at the Blaydes shipyard in Hull , Yorkshire as a collier named <unk> . She was renamed after being purchased by the Royal Navy for £ 1 @,@ 950 in May 1787 . She was three @-@ masted , 91 feet ( 28 m ) long overall and 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) across at her widest point , and registered at 230 tons burthen . Her armament was four short four @-@ pounder carriage guns and ten half @-@ pounder swivel guns , supplemented by small arms such as muskets . As she was rated by the Admiralty as a cutter , the smallest category of warship , her commander would be a lieutenant rather than a post @-@ captain and would be the only commissioned officer on board . Nor did a cutter warrant the usual detachment of Marines that naval commanders used to enforce their authority . 
 Bounty had been acquired to transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti ( then rendered " <unk> " ) , a Polynesian island in the south Pacific , to the British colonies in the West Indies . The expedition was promoted by the Royal Society and organised by its president Sir Joseph Banks , who shared the view of Caribbean plantation owners that breadfruit might grow well there and provide cheap food for the slaves . Bounty was refitted under Banks 's supervision at Deptford Dockyard on the River Thames . The great cabin , normally the ship 's captain 's quarters , was converted into a greenhouse for over a thousand potted breadfruit plants , with glazed windows , skylights , and a lead @-@ covered deck and drainage system to prevent the waste of fresh water . The space required for these arrangements in the small ship meant that the crew and officers would endure severe overcrowding for the duration of the long voyage . 
 = = = Bligh = = = 
 With Banks 's agreement , command of the expedition was given to Lieutenant William Bligh , whose experiences included Captain James Cook 's third and final voyage ( 1776 – 80 ) in which he had served as sailing master , or chief navigator , on HMS Resolution . Bligh was born in Plymouth in 1754 into a family of naval and military tradition — Admiral Sir Richard Rodney Bligh was his third cousin . Appointment to Cook 's ship at the age of 21 had been a considerable honour , although Bligh believed that his contribution was not properly acknowledged in the expedition 's official account . With the ending of the American War of Independence in 1783 , the navy was reduced in size , and Bligh found himself ashore on half @-@ pay . 
 After a period of idleness , Bligh took temporary employment in the mercantile service and in 1785 was captain of the Britannia , a vessel owned by his wife 's uncle Duncan Campbell . Bligh assumed the prestigious Bounty appointment on 16 August 1787 , at a considerable financial cost ; his lieutenant 's pay of four shillings a day ( £ 70 a year ) contrasted with the £ 500 a year he had earned as captain of Britannia . Because of the limited number of warrant officers allowed on Bounty , Bligh was also required to act as the ship 's purser . His sailing orders stated that he was to enter the Pacific via Cape Horn and then , after collecting the breadfruit plants , sail westward through the Endeavour Strait and across the Indian and Atlantic Oceans to the West Indies . Bounty would thus complete a circumnavigation of the Earth . 
 = = = Crew = = = 
 Bounty 's complement was 46 men , comprising 44 Royal Navy seamen ( including Bligh ) , and two civilian botanists . Directly beneath Bligh were his warrant officers , appointed by the Navy Board and headed by the sailing master John Fryer . The other warrant officers were the boatswain , the surgeon , the carpenter , and the gunner . To the two master 's mates and two midshipmen were added several honorary midshipmen — so @-@ called " young gentlemen " who were aspirant naval officers . These signed the ship 's roster as able seamen , but were quartered with the midshipmen and treated on equal terms with them . 
 Most of Bounty 's crew were chosen by Bligh or were recommended to him by influential patrons . William Peckover the gunner and Joseph Coleman the armourer had been with Cook and Bligh on HMS Resolution ; several others had sailed under Bligh more recently on the Britannia . Among these was the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Fletcher Christian who came from a wealthy Cumberland family descended from Manx gentry . Christian had chosen a life at sea rather than the legal career envisaged by his family . He had twice voyaged with Bligh to the West Indies , and the two had formed a master @-@ pupil relationship through which Christian had become a skilled navigator . Christian was willing to serve on Bounty without pay as one of the " young gentlemen " ; Bligh gave him one of the salaried master 's mate 's berths . Another of the young gentlemen recommended to Bligh was 15 @-@ year @-@ old Peter Heywood , also from a Manx family and a distant relation of Christian 's . Heywood had left school at 14 to spend a year on HMS Powerful , a harbour @-@ bound training vessel at Plymouth . His recommendation to Bligh came from Richard Betham , a Heywood family friend who was Bligh 's father @-@ in @-@ law . 
 The two botanists , or " gardeners " , were chosen by Banks . The chief botanist , David Nelson , was a veteran of Cook 's third expedition who had been to Tahiti and had learned some of the natives ' language . Nelson 's assistant William Brown was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French . Banks also helped to secure the official midshipmen 's berths for two of his protégés , Thomas Hayward and John Hallett . Overall , Bounty 's crew was relatively youthful , the majority being under 30 ; at the time of departure , Bligh was 33 years old . Among the older crew members were the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Peckover , who had sailed on all three of Cook 's voyages , and Lawrence <unk> , a year older and formerly sailmaker on the Britannia . The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood , both 15 when they left England . 
 Living space on the ship was allocated on the basis of rank . Bligh , having yielded the great cabin , occupied private sleeping quarters with an adjacent dining area or pantry on the starboard side of the ship , and Fryer a small cabin on the opposite side . The surgeon Thomas Huggan , the other warrant officers , and Nelson the botanist had tiny cabins on the lower deck , while the master 's mates and the midshipmen , together with the young gentlemen , berthed together in an area behind the captain 's dining room known as the cockpit ; as junior or prospective officers , they were allowed use of the quarterdeck . The other ranks had their quarters in the forecastle , a windowless unventilated area measuring 36 by 22 feet ( 11 @.@ 0 by 6 @.@ 7 m ) with headroom of 5 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 70 m ) . 
 = = Expedition = = 
 = = = To Cape Horn = = = 
 On 15 October 1787 , Bounty left Deptford for Spithead , in the English Channel , to await final sailing orders . Adverse weather delayed arrival at Spithead until 4 November . Bligh was anxious to depart quickly , to reach Cape Horn before the end of the short southern summer , but the Admiralty did not accord him high priority and delayed issuing the orders for a further three weeks . When Bounty finally sailed on 28 November , the ship was trapped by contrary winds and unable to clear Spithead until 23 December . With the prospect of a passage around Cape Horn now in serious doubt , Bligh received permission from the Admiralty to take , if necessary , an alternative route to Tahiti via the Cape of Good Hope . 
 As the ship settled into her sea @-@ going routine , Bligh introduced Cook 's strict discipline regarding sanitation and diet . According to the expedition 's historian Sam McKinney , Bligh enforced these rules " with a fanatical zeal , continually fuss [ ing ] and fum [ ing ] over the cleanliness of his ship and the food served to the crew . " He replaced the navy 's traditional watch system of alternating four @-@ hour spells on and off duty with a three watch system , whereby each four @-@ hour duty was followed by eight hours ' rest . For the crew 's exercise and entertainment , he introduced regular music and dancing sessions . Bligh 's despatches to Campbell and Banks indicated his satisfaction ; he had no occasion to administer punishment because , he wrote : " Both men and officers tractable and well disposed , & cheerfulness & content in the countenance of every one " . The only adverse feature of the voyage to date , according to Bligh , was the conduct of the surgeon Huggan , who was revealed as an indolent , unhygienic drunkard . 
 From the start of the voyage , Bligh had established warm relations with Christian , according him a status which implied that he was Bligh 's second @-@ in @-@ command rather than Fryer . On 2 March , Bligh formalised the position by assigning Christian to the rank of Acting Lieutenant . Fryer showed little outward sign of resentment at his junior 's advancement , but his relations with Bligh significantly worsened from this point . A week after the promotion on Fryer 's insistence , Bligh ordered the flogging of Matthew Quintal , who received 12 lashes for " insolence and mutinous behaviour " , thereby destroying Bligh 's expressed hope of a voyage free from such punishment . 
 On 2 April as Bounty approached Cape Horn , a strong gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which , Bligh wrote , " exceeded what I had ever met with before ... with severe squalls of hail and sleet " . The winds drove the ship back ; on 3 April , she was further north than she had been a week earlier . Again and again , Bligh forced the ship forward , to be repeatedly repelled . On 17 April , he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them , and that they would turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope — " to the great joy of every person on Board " , Bligh recorded . 
 = = = Cape to Pacific = = = 
 On 24 May 1788 , Bounty anchored in False Bay , east of the Cape of Good Hope , where five weeks were spent in repairs and reprovisioning . Bligh 's letters home emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were , by comparison with other vessels , and expressed hope that he would receive credit for this . At one stage during the sojourn , Bligh lent Christian money , a gesture that the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger man . In her account of the voyage , Caroline Alexander describes the loan as " a significant act of friendship " , but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget . 
 After leaving False Bay on 1 July , Bounty set out across the southern Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call , Adventure Bay in Tasmania . They passed the remote Île Saint @-@ Paul , a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring , but he did not attempt a landing . The weather was cold and wintry , conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn , and it was difficult to take navigational observations , but Bligh 's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted <unk> Rock , on the south @-@ west corner of Tasmania and , two days later , made anchorage in Adventure Bay . 
 The Bounty party spent their time at Adventure Bay in recuperation , fishing , replenishment of water casks , and felling timber . There were peaceful encounters with the native population . The first sign of overt discord between Bligh and his officers occurred when the captain exchanged angry words with William Purcell the carpenter over the latter 's methods for cutting wood . Bligh ordered Purcell back to the ship and , when the carpenter stood his ground , Bligh withheld his rations , which " immediately brought him to his senses " , according to Bligh . 
 Further clashes occurred on the final leg of the journey to Tahiti . On 9 October , Fryer refused to sign the ship 's account books unless Bligh provided him with a certificate attesting to his complete competence throughout the voyage . Bligh would not be coerced . He summoned the crew and read the Articles of War , at which Fryer backed down . There was also trouble with the surgeon Huggan , whose careless blood @-@ letting of able seaman James Valentine while treating him for asthma led to the seaman 's death from a blood infection . To cover his error , the surgeon reported to Bligh that Valentine had died from scurvy , which led Bligh to apply his own medicinal and dietary <unk> remedies to the entire ship 's company . By now , Huggan was almost incapacitated with drink , until Bligh confiscated his supply . Huggan briefly returned to duty ; before Bounty 's arrival in Tahiti , he examined all on board for signs of venereal disease and found none . Bounty came to anchor in Matavai Bay , Tahiti on 26 October 1788 , concluding a journey of 27 @,@ 086 nautical miles ( 50 @,@ 163 km ; 31 @,@ 170 mi ) . 
 = = = Tahiti = = = 
 Bligh 's first action on arrival was to secure the co @-@ operation of the local chieftains . The paramount chief <unk> remembered Bligh from Cook 's voyage 15 years previously , and greeted him warmly . Bligh presented the chiefs with gifts and informed them that their own " King George " wished in return only breadfruit plants . They happily agreed with this simple request . Bligh assigned Christian to lead a shore party charged with establishing a compound in which the plants would be nurtured . 
 Whether based ashore or on board , the men 's duties during Bounty 's five @-@ month stay in Tahiti were relatively light . Many led promiscuous lives among the native women — altogether , 18 officers and men , including Christian , received treatment for venereal infections — while others took regular partners . Christian formed a close relationship with a Polynesian woman named <unk> , to whom he gave the name " Isabella " after a former sweetheart from Cumberland . Bligh remained chaste himself , but was tolerant of his men 's activities , unsurprised that they should succumb to temptation when " the <unk> of dissipation are beyond any thing that can be conceived " . Nevertheless , he expected them to do their duty efficiently , and was disappointed to find increasing instances of neglect and slackness on the part of his officers . Infuriated , he wrote : " Such neglectful and worthless petty officers I believe were never in a ship such as are in this " . 
 Huggan died on 10 December . Bligh attributed this to " the effects of intemperance and indolence ... he never would be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time , through the whole course of the voyage " . For all his earlier favoured status , Christian did not escape Bligh 's wrath . He was often humiliated by the captain — sometimes in front of the crew and the Tahitians — for real or imagined slackness , while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment . <unk> , rarely administered during the outward voyage , now became increasingly common . On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew — Charles Churchill , John Millward and William Muspratt — deserted , taking a small boat , arms and ammunition . Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect . Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot — the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood . Bligh was persuaded that his protégé was not planning to desert , and the matter was dropped . Churchill , Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and , on their return to the ship , were flogged . 
 From February onwards , the pace of work increased ; more than 1 @,@ 000 breadfruit plants were potted and carried into the ship , where they filled the great cabin . The ship was overhauled for the long homeward voyage , in many cases by men who regretted the forthcoming departure and loss of their easy life with the Tahitians . Bligh was impatient to be away , but as Richard Hough observes in his account , he " failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea ... after five dissolute , hedonistic months at Tahiti " . The work was done by 1 April 1789 , and four days later , after an affectionate farewell from <unk> and his queen , Bounty left the harbour .

 In their Bounty histories , both Hough and Alexander maintain that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny , however sorry they were to leave Tahiti . The journal of James Morrison , the boatswain 's mate , supports this . The events that followed , Hough suggests , were determined in the three weeks following the departure , when Bligh 's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions . Christian was a particular target , always seeming to bear the brunt of the captain 's rages . Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew , Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal social intercourse . 
 On 22 April 1789 , Bounty arrived at Nomuka , in the Friendly Islands ( now called Tonga ) , intending to pick up wood , water , and further supplies on the final scheduled stop before the Endeavour Strait . Bligh had visited the island with Cook , and knew that the inhabitants could behave unpredictably . He put Christian in charge of the watering party and equipped him with muskets , but at the same time ordered that the arms should be left in the boat , not carried ashore . Christian 's party was harassed and threatened continually but were unable to retaliate , having been denied the use of arms . He returned to the ship with his task incomplete , and was cursed by Bligh as " a damned cowardly rascal " . Further disorder ashore resulted in the thefts of a small anchor and an adze , for which Bligh further berated Fryer and Christian . In an attempt to recover the missing property , Bligh briefly detained the island 's chieftains on the ship , but to no avail . When he finally gave the order to sail , neither the anchor nor the adze had been restored . 
 By 27 April , Christian was in a state of despair , depressed and brooding . His mood was worsened when Bligh accused him of stealing coconuts from the captain 's private supply . Bligh punished the whole crew for this theft , stopping their rum ration and reducing their food by half . Feeling that his position was now intolerable , Christian considered constructing a raft with which he could escape to an island and take his chances with the natives . He may have acquired wood for this purpose from Purcell . In any event , his discontent became common knowledge among his fellow officers . Two of the young gentlemen , George Stewart and Edward Young , urged him not to desert ; Young assured him that he would have the support of almost all on board if he were to seize the ship and depose Bligh . Stewart told him the crew were " ripe for anything " .

 = = = Seizure = = = 
 In the early hours of 28 April 1789 , Bounty lay about 30 nautical miles ( 56 km ; 35 mi ) south of the island of Tofua . After a largely sleepless night , Christian had decided to act . He understood from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and , after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin , he learned the names of several more . With the help of these men , Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck ; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet . At about 05 : 15 , Christian went below , dismissed Hallett ( who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship 's muskets ) , and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh 's cabin . Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands , threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm ; Bligh " called as loudly as [ he ] could in hopes of assistance " . The commotion woke Fryer , who saw , from his cabin opposite , the mutineers <unk> Bligh away . The mutineers ordered Fryer to " lay down again , and hold my tongue or I was a dead man " . 
 Bligh was brought to the quarterdeck , his hands bound by a cord held by Christian , who was brandishing a bayonet ; some reports maintained that Christian had a sounding plummet hanging from his neck so that he could jump overboard and drown himself if the mutiny failed . Others who had been awakened by the noise left their berths and joined in the general pandemonium . It was unclear at this stage who were and who were not active mutineers . Hough describes the scene : " Everyone was , more or less , making a noise , either cursing , jeering or just shouting for the reassurance it gave them to do so " . Bligh shouted continually , demanding to be set free , sometimes addressing individuals by name , and otherwise exhorting the company generally to " knock Christian down ! " Fryer was briefly permitted on deck to speak to Christian , but was then forced below at bayonet @-@ point ; according to Fryer , Christian told him : " I have been in hell for weeks past . Captain Bligh has brought this on himself . " 
 Christian originally thought to cast Bligh adrift in Bounty 's small jolly boat , together with his clerk John Samuel and the loyalist midshipmen Hayward and Hallett . This boat proved unseaworthy , so Christian ordered the launching of a larger ship 's boat , with a capacity of around ten . However , Christian and his allies had overestimated the extent of the mutiny — at least half on board were determined to leave with Bligh . Thus the ship 's largest boat , a 23 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 0 m ) launch , was put into the water . During the following hours the loyalists collected their possessions and entered the boat . Among these was Fryer , who with Bligh 's approval sought to stay on board — in the hope , he later claimed , that he would be able to retake the ship — but Christian ordered him into the launch . Soon , the vessel was badly overloaded , with more than 20 persons and others still vying for places . Christian ordered the two carpenter 's mates , Norman and McIntosh , and the armourer , Joseph Coleman , to return to the ship , considering their presence essential if he were to navigate Bounty with a reduced crew . Reluctantly they obeyed , beseeching Bligh to remember that they had remained with the ship against their will . Bligh assured them : " Never fear , lads , I 'll do you justice if ever I reach England " . 
 Samuel saved the captain 's journal , commission papers and purser 's documents , but was forced to leave behind Bligh 's maps and charts — 15 years of navigational work . The launch was supplied with about five days ' food and water , a sextant , compass and nautical tables , and Purcell 's tool chest . At the last minute the mutineers threw four cutlasses down into the boat . Of Bounty 's complement — 44 after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine — 19 men were crowded into the launch , leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of freeboard . The 25 men remaining on Bounty included the committed mutineers who had taken up arms , the loyalists detained against their will , and others for whom there was no room in the launch . At around 10 : 00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut ; a little later , Bligh ordered a sail to be raised . Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua , clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano . 
 = = = Bligh 's open @-@ boat voyage = = = 
 Bligh hoped to find water and food on Tofua , then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King <unk> ( whom he knew from his visit with Cook ) in provisioning the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies . Ashore at Tofua , there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed . On 2 May , four days after landing , Bligh realised that an attack was imminent . He directed his men back to the sea , shortly before the <unk> seized the launch 's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore . Bligh coolly shepherded the last of his shore party and their supplies into the boat . In an attempt to free the rope from its captors , the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water ; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death . 
 The launch escaped to the open sea , where the shaken crew reconsidered their options . A visit to Tongatapu , or any island landfall , might incur similarly violent consequences ; their best chance of salvation , Bligh reckoned , lay in sailing directly to the Dutch settlement of Coupang in Timor , using the rations presently on board . This was a journey of some 3 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 500 km ; 4 @,@ 000 mi ) to the west , beyond the Endeavour Strait , and it would necessitate daily rations of an ounce of bread and a quarter @-@ pint of water for each man . The plan was unanimously agreed . 
 From the outset , the weather was wet and stormy , with mountainous seas that constantly threatened to overwhelm the boat . When the sun appeared , Bligh noted in his daily journal that it " gave us as much pleasure as a winter 's day in England " . Bligh endeavoured to continue his journal throughout the voyage , observing , sketching , and charting as they made their way west . To keep up morale , he told stories of his prior experiences at sea , got the men singing , and occasionally said prayers . The launch made the first passage by Europeans through the Fiji Islands , but they dared not stop because of the islanders ' reputation for cannibalism . On 17 May , Bligh recorded that " our situation was miserable ; always wet , and suffering extreme cold ... without the least shelter from the weather " . 
 A week later with the skies clearing , birds began to appear , signalling a proximity to land . On 28 May , the Great Barrier Reef was sighted ; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon . Late that afternoon , he ran the boat ashore on a small island which he named Restoration Island , where the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply and were able to eat ravenously . Over the next four days , the party island @-@ hopped northward within the lagoon , aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland . Strains were showing within the party ; following a heated disagreement with Purcell , Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight . Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain , but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered . 
 On 2 June , the launch cleared Cape York , the extreme northern point of the Australian continent . Bligh turned south @-@ west , and steered through a maze of shoals , reefs , sandbanks , and small islands . The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait , but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel . At 20 : 00 that evening , they reached the open Arafura Sea , still 1 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 000 km ; 1 @,@ 300 mi ) from Coupang . The following eight days encompassed some of the toughest travel of the entire journey and , by 11 June , many were close to collapse . The next day , the coast of Timor was sighted : " It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us " , Bligh wrote . On 14 June , with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted , they sailed into Coupang harbour . 
 In Coupang , Bligh reported the mutiny to the authorities , and wrote to his wife : " Know then , my own Dear Betsey , I have lost the Bounty ... " Nelson the botanist quickly succumbed to the harsh Coupang climate and died . On 20 August , the party departed for Batavia ( now Jakarta ) to await a ship for Europe ; the cook Thomas Hall died there , having been ill for weeks . Bligh obtained passages home for himself , his clerk Samuel , and his servant John Smith , and sailed on 16 October 1789 . Four of the remainder — the master 's mate Elphinstone , the quartermaster Peter Linkletter , the butcher Robert Lamb and the assistant surgeon Thomas Ledward — all died either in Batavia or on their journeys home . 
 = = = Bounty under Christian = = = 
 After the departure of Bligh 's launch , Christian divided the personal effects of the departed loyalists among the remaining crew and threw the breadfruit plants into the sea . He recognised that Bligh could conceivably survive to report the mutiny , and that anyway the non @-@ return of Bounty would occasion a search mission , with Tahiti as its first port of call . Christian therefore headed Bounty towards the small island of Tubuai , some 450 nautical miles ( 830 km ; 520 mi ) south of Tahiti . Tubuai had been discovered and roughly charted by Cook ; except for a single small channel , it was entirely surrounded by a coral reef and could , Christian surmised , be easily defended against any attack from the sea . 
 Bounty arrived at Tubuai on 28 May 1789 . The reception from the native population was hostile ; when a flotilla of war canoes headed for the ship , Christian used a four @-@ pounder gun to repel the attackers . At least a dozen warriors were killed , and the rest scattered . Undeterred , Christian and an armed party surveyed the island , and decided it would be suitable for their purposes . However , to create a permanent settlement , they needed compliant native labour and women . The most likely source for these was Tahiti , to which Bounty returned on 6 June . To ensure the co @-@ operation of the Tahiti chiefs , Christian concocted a story that he , Bligh , and Captain Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki . Cook 's name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods and , on 16 June , the well @-@ provisioned Bounty sailed back to Tubuai . On board were nearly 30 Tahitian men and women , some of whom were there by deception . 
 For the next two months , Christian and his forces struggled to establish themselves on Tubuai . They began to construct a large moated enclosure — called " Fort George " , after the British king — to provide a secure fortress against attack by land or sea . Christian attempted to form friendly relations with the local chiefs , but his party was unwelcome . There were persistent clashes with the native population , mainly over property and women , culminating in a pitched battle in which 66 islanders were killed and many wounded . Discontent was rising among the Bounty party , and Christian sensed that his authority was slipping . He called a meeting to discuss future plans and offered a free vote . Eight remained loyal to Christian , the hard core of the active mutineers , but sixteen wished to return to Tahiti and take their chances there . Christian accepted this decision ; after depositing the majority at Tahiti , he would " run before the wind , and ... land upon the first island the ship drives . After what I have done I cannot remain at Tahiti " . 
 = = = Mutineers divided = = = 
 When Bounty returned to Tahiti , on 22 September , the welcome was much less effusive than previously . The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship that the story of Cook and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication , and that Cook had been long dead . Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent , and did not stay long . Of the 16 men who had voted to settle in Tahiti , he allowed 15 ashore ; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship , as Christian required his skills as an armourer . That evening , Christian inveigled aboard Bounty a party of Tahitians , mainly women , for a social gathering . With the festivities under way , he cut the anchor rope and Bounty sailed away with her captive guests . Coleman escaped by diving overboard and reached land . Among the abducted group were six elderly women , for whom Christian had no use ; he put them ashore on the nearby island of Mo <unk> . Bounty 's complement now comprised nine mutineers — Christian , Young , Quintal , Brown , Martin , John Williams , William McCoy , John Mills , and John Adams ( known by the crew as " Alexander Smith " ) — and 20 Polynesians , of whom 14 were women . 
 The 16 sailors on Tahiti began to organise their lives . One group , led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh , began building a schooner , which they named Resolution after Cook 's ship . Morrison had not been an active mutineer ; rather than waiting for recapture , he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there , hoping that such action would confirm his innocence . Morrison 's group maintained ship 's routine and discipline , even to the extent of holding divine service each Sunday . Churchill and Matthew Thompson , on the other hand , chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives , which ended in the violent deaths of both . Churchill was murdered by Thompson , who was in turn killed by Churchill 's native friends . Others , such as Stewart and Heywood , settled into quiet domesticity ; Heywood spent much of his time studying the Tahitian language . He adopted native dress and , in accordance with the local custom , was heavily tattooed on his body .

 When Bligh landed in England on 14 March 1790 , news of the mutiny had preceded him and he was fêted as a hero . In October 1790 at a formal court martial for the loss of Bounty , he was honourably acquitted of responsibility for the loss and was promoted to post @-@ captain . As an adjunct to the court martial , Bligh brought charges against Purcell for misconduct and insubordination ; the former carpenter received a reprimand . 
 In November 1790 , the Admiralty despatched the frigate HMS Pandora under Captain Edward Edwards to capture the mutineers and return them to England to stand trial . Pandora arrived at Tahiti on 23 March 1791 and , within a few days , all 14 surviving Bounty men had either surrendered or been captured . Edwards made no distinction between mutineers and those detained on Bounty unwillingly ; all were incarcerated in a specially constructed prison erected on Pandora 's quarterdeck , dubbed " Pandora 's Box " . Pandora remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Captain Edwards vainly sought information on Bounty 's whereabouts . The ship finally sailed on 8 May , to search for Christian and Bounty among the thousands of southern Pacific islands . Apart from a few spars discovered at Palmerston Island , no traces of the fugitive vessel were found . Edwards continued the search until August , when he turned west and headed for the Dutch East Indies . 
 On 29 August 1791 , Pandora ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef . The men in " Pandora 's Box " were ignored as the regular crew attempted to prevent the ship from foundering . When Edwards gave the order to abandon ship , Pandora 's armourer began to remove the prisoners ' shackles , but the ship sank before he had finished . Heywood and nine other prisoners escaped ; four Bounty men — Stewart , Henry <unk> , Richard Skinner and John Sumner — drowned , along with 31 of Pandora 's crew . The survivors , including the ten remaining prisoners , then embarked on an open @-@ boat journey that largely followed Bligh 's course of two years earlier . The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot until they reached Coupang on 17 September . 
 The prisoners were confined for seven weeks , at first in prison and later on a Dutch East India Company ship , before being transported to Cape Town . On 5 April 1792 , they embarked for England on a British warship , HMS Gorgon , and arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June . There they were transferred to the guardship HMS Hector to await trial . The prisoners included the three detained loyalists — Coleman , McIntosh and Norman — to whom Bligh had promised justice , the blind fiddler Michael Byrne ( or " <unk> " ) , Heywood , Morrison , and four active mutineers : Thomas Burkett , John Millward , Thomas Ellison and William Muspratt . Bligh , who had been given command of HMS Providence for a second breadfruit expedition , had left England in August 1791 , and thus would be absent from the pending court martial proceedings . 
 = = = Court martial , verdict , and sentences = = = 
 The court martial opened on 12 September 1792 on HMS Duke in Portsmouth harbour , with Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Hood , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Portsmouth , presiding . Heywood 's family secured him competent legal advisers ; of the other defendants , only Muspratt employed legal counsel . The survivors of Bligh 's open @-@ boat journey gave evidence against their former comrades — the testimonies from Thomas Hayward and John Hallett were particularly damaging to Heywood and Morrison , who each maintained their innocence of any mutinous intention and had surrendered voluntarily to Pandora . The court did not challenge the statements of Coleman , McIntosh , Norman and Byrne , all of whom were acquitted . On 18 September the six remaining defendants were found guilty of mutiny and were sentenced to death by hanging , with recommendations of mercy for Heywood and Morrison " in consideration of various circumstances " . 
 On 26 October 1792 Heywood and Morrison received royal pardons from King George III and were released . Muspratt , through his lawyer , won a stay of execution by filing a petition protesting that court martial rules had prevented his calling Norman and Byrne as witnesses in his defence . He was still awaiting the outcome when Burkett , Ellison and Millward were hanged from the yardarm of HMS Brunswick in Portsmouth dock on 28 October . Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment , while others speak of their " manly firmness that ... was the admiration of all " . There was some unease expressed in the press — a suspicion that " money had bought the lives of some , and others fell sacrifice to their poverty . " A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded ; nevertheless , Dening asserts that " in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference . " In December Muspratt heard that he was reprieved , and on 11 February 1793 he , too , was pardoned and freed . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Much of the court martial testimony was critical of Bligh 's conduct — by the time of his return to England in August 1793 , following his successful conveyance of breadfruit to the West Indies aboard Providence , professional and public opinion had turned against him . He was snubbed at the Admiralty when he went to present his report , and was left on half pay for 19 months before receiving his next appointment . In late 1794 the jurist Edward Christian , brother of Fletcher , published his Appendix to the court martial proceedings , which was said by the press to " palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers , and to criminate Captain Bligh " . Bligh 's position was further undermined when the loyalist gunner Peckover confirmed that much of what was alleged in the Appendix was true . 
 Bligh commanded HMS Director at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797 and HMS Glatton in the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801 . In 1805 while commanding HMS Warrior , he was court @-@ martialled for using bad language to his officers , and reprimanded . In 1806 , he was appointed Governor of New South Wales in Australia ; after two years a group of army officers arrested and deposed him in the so @-@ called Rum Rebellion . After his return to England , Bligh was promoted to rear @-@ admiral in 1811 and vice @-@ admiral in 1814 , but was not offered further naval appointments . He died , aged 63 , in December 1817 . 
 Of the pardoned mutineers , Heywood and Morrison returned to naval duty . Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and , by 1803 at the age of 31 , had achieved the rank of captain . After a distinguished career , he died in 1831 . Morrison became a master gunner , and was eventually lost in 1807 when HMS Blenheim foundered in the Indian Ocean . Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death , in or before 1798 . The other principal participants in the court martial — Fryer , Peckover , Coleman , McIntosh and others — generally vanished from the public eye after the closing of the procedures .

 = = = Settlement = = = 
 After leaving Tahiti on 22 September 1789 , Christian sailed Bounty west in search of a safe haven . He then formed the idea of settling on Pitcairn Island , far to the east of Tahiti ; the island had been reported in 1767 , but its exact location never verified . After months of searching , Christian rediscovered the island on 15 January 1790 , 188 nautical miles ( 348 km ; 216 mi ) east of its recorded position . This longitudinal error contributed to the mutineers ' decision to settle on Pitcairn . 
 On arrival the ship was unloaded and stripped of most of its masts and spars , for use on the island . It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January , either as an agreed precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal — in either case , there was now no means of escape . The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers — uninhabited , virtually inaccessible , with plenty of food , water and fertile land . For a while , mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably . Christian settled down with Isabella ; a son , Thursday October Christian , was born , as were other children . Christian 's authority as leader gradually diminished , and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection . 
 Gradually , tensions and rivalries arose over the increasing extent to which the Europeans regarded the Tahitians as their property , in particular the women who , according to Alexander , were " passed around from one ' husband ' to the other " . In September 1793 matters degenerated into extreme violence , when five of the mutineers — Christian , Williams , Martin , Mills , and Brown — were killed by Tahitians in a carefully executed series of murders . Christian was set upon while working in his fields , first shot and then butchered with an axe ; his last words , supposedly , were " Oh , dear ! " In @-@ fighting continued thereafter , and by 1794 the six Tahitian men were all dead , killed by the widows of the murdered mutineers or by each other . 
 Two of the four surviving mutineers , Young and Adams , assumed leadership and secured a tenuous calm , which was disrupted by the drunkenness of McCoy and Quintal after the former distilled an alcoholic beverage from a local plant . Some of the women attempted to leave the island in a makeshift boat , but could not launch it successfully . Life continued uneasily until McCoy 's suicide in 1798 . A year later , after Quintal threatened fresh murder and mayhem , Adams and Young killed him and were able to restore peace . 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 After Young succumbed to asthma in 1800 , Adams took responsibility for the education and well @-@ being of the nine remaining women and 19 children . Using the ship 's Bible from Bounty , he taught literacy and Christianity , and kept peace on the island . This was the situation in February 1808 , when the American sealer Topaz came unexpectedly upon Pitcairn , landed , and discovered the by then thriving community . News of Topaz 's discovery did not reach Britain until 1810 , when it was overlooked by an Admiralty preoccupied by war with France . In 1814 , two British warships , HMS Briton and HMS Tagus , chanced upon Pitcairn . Among those who greeted them were Thursday October Christian and Edward Young 's son , George — the respective captains , Sir Thomas Staines and Philip <unk> , reported that Christian the son displayed " in his benevolent countenance , all the features of an honest English face " . On shore they found a population of 46 mainly young islanders led by Adams , upon whom , it was clear to them , the islanders ' welfare was wholly dependent . 
 After receiving Staines 's report , the Admiralty decided to take no action . In the following years , many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams 's various stories of the foundation of the Pitcairn settlement . Adams died in 1829 , honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality . Over the years , many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs ; in 1999 , the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies , to survey and document all the material remaining on @-@ site , as part of a detailed study of the settlement 's development . 
 = = Cultural impact = = 
 The perception of Bligh as an overbearing tyrant began with Edward Christian 's Appendix of 1794 . Apart from Bligh 's journal , the first published account of the mutiny was that of Sir John Barrow , published in 1831 . Barrow was a friend of the Heywood family ; his book mitigated Heywood 's role while emphasising Bligh 's severity . The book also instigated the legend that Christian had not died on Pitcairn , but had somehow returned to England and been recognised by Heywood in Plymouth , around 1808 – 09 . An account written in 1870 by Heywood 's stepdaughter Diana Belcher further exonerated Heywood and Christian and , according to Alexander , " cemented ... many falsehoods that had insinuated their way into the narrative " . 
 In addition to the many books and articles about the mutiny , in the 20th century five featured films were produced . The first , from 1916 , was a silent Australian film , subsequently lost . The second , in 1933 , also from Australia , was entitled In the Wake of the Bounty and saw the screen debut of Errol Flynn in the role of Christian . The impact of this film was overshadowed by that of the 1935 MGM version , Mutiny on the Bounty , based on the popular namesake novel by Charles <unk> and James Norman Hall , and starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable as Bligh and Christian . The film 's story was presented , says Dening , as " the classic conflict between tyranny and a just cause " ; Laughton 's portrayal became in the public mind the definitive Bligh , " a byword for sadistic tyranny " . The two subsequent major films , Mutiny on the Bounty ( 1962 ) with Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando , and The Bounty ( 1984 ) with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson , largely perpetuated this image of Bligh , and that of Christian as tragic hero . The latter film added a level of homoeroticism to the Bligh – Christian relationship . 
 Among historians ' attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough ( 1972 ) and Caroline Alexander ( 2003 ) . Hough depicts " an unsurpassed foul @-@ weather commander ... I would go through hell and high water with him , but not for one day in the same ship on a calm sea " . Alexander presents Bligh as over @-@ anxious , solicitous of his crew 's well @-@ being , and utterly devoted to his task . He was unfortunate in his timing ; the story of the mutiny became public knowledge when the Romantic poets first commanded the literary scene . Bligh 's chief apologist was Sir Joseph Banks , while Christian was championed by Wordsworth and Coleridge . " Poetry routed science " , wrote the Baltimore Sun 's reviewer of Alexander 's book , " and it has held the field ever since " . In 1998 , in advance of a BBC documentary film aimed at Bligh 's rehabilitation , the respective descendants of the captain and Christian feuded over their contrary versions of the truth . The programme 's presenter , Dea Birkett , suggested that " Christian versus Bligh has come to represent rebellion versus authoritarianism , a life constrained versus a life of freedom , sexual repression versus sexual licence .

 Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino , ( 23 August 1747 , <unk> – 28 June 1816 , Paris ) , was a general and politician of France . Born in the Savoy , he was the son of a low @-@ ranking officer in the Habsburg military . In 1789 , during the French Revolution , he went to France , where he received a commission in the French Army . In 1793 , his troops deposed him , for his strict discipline , but he was immediately reinstated and rose rapidly through the ranks of the general staff . He helped to push the Austrians back to Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign , and then covered Moreau 's retreat to France later that year , defending the Rhine bridge at Hüningen until the last units had crossed to safety . 
 Ferino commanded the southern @-@ most wing of Army of the Danube in 1799 , and participated in the battles of Ostrach and Stockach . Napoleon awarded him the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1804 ; in 1805 , Ferino became a Senator , and in 1808 , raised him to Count of the Empire . His name is engraved in the Arc de Triomphe . 
 = = Family = = 
 Barthélemy Ferino was born in <unk> , in the <unk> valley , near the border of the Swiss Confederation . This section was known as the Piedmont which , at the time of his birth , was under the rule of the House of Savoy . His father , Bernardo Ferino , was an officer of the so @-@ called Bender regiment and served in the Austrian military during the Seven Years ' War . Barthélemy Ferino entered Austrian military service in 1768 and in 1779 he was brevetted as captain . His promotions in the Habsburg military were few . Responding to perceived inequalities , at the time of the French Revolution he moved to France and , in 1792 , acquired a commission in the French army . 
 = = Service in French Revolutionary Wars = = 
 On 1 August 1792 , he was named lieutenant colonel of the Legion of Biron , also called the Chasseurs of the Rhine , part of the Army of the Rhine under the over @-@ all command of Philippe Custine . Ferino was named general of brigade in December , and on 23 August 1793 , he became general of division , in command of the advance guard . Although he was deposed for maintaining discipline too strictly , he was immediately reinstated ; he was assigned to the Army of the Moselle under the command of Jean Victor Moreau . In 1795 , he was appointed Lieutenant General of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle , and in 1796 , Commander of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle , Right Wing . With this force , he participated in the Battle of Landau , and helped Moreau and Jean @-@ Baptiste Jourdan to push the Austrian army from the Rhineland into Bavaria in the 1796 summer campaign . He defeated the Conde 's Emigré Army at Bregenz , on Lake Constance . In the subsequent Austrian resurgence , he maintained the right flank 's protective cover of Moreau 's main army as the French retreated through southern Germany in August and September of that year ; he participated in the Battle of Schliengen . When the French withdrew after Schliengen , he defended the Rhine crossing at Hüningen , north of the Swiss city of Basel , until the last French units crossed the river to safety . 
 During the attempted royalist coup in 1797 , Ferino was accused of having royalist leanings and removed from his command , but restored to active duty in 1798 as part of the Army of the Mainz ( French : Armée de Mayence ) . He continued the rigorous discipline for which he became known and his troops maintained good order , despite the many abuses by other troops that occurred in the Rhine region . In late 1798 , he commanded the former Army of the Mainz , now called the Army of Observation when , in November , Jean Baptiste Jourdan assumed command and organized the army for the planned invasion of southern Germany in 1799 . 
 In the War of the Second Coalition , as commander of the I. Division of the Army of the Danube , Ferino led the division across the Rhine River at Hüningen , passed through the Duchy of Baden and marched toward Schaffhausen . He was familiar with this territory from the 1796 campaign . His division secured the right flank for Jourdan 's main force for the Battle of Ostrach on 21 March 1799 . Although his troops remained outside of the primary battle zone , during the retreat , a portion of his column was cut off by Archduke Charles ' army , and captured . 
 In the French withdrawal from Ostrach , he again secured the flank , and retraced his steps west toward Bodman , a small village on the furthest western point of Lake Constance , near Stockach . From there , he guarded the main army against an Austrian approach from Switzerland at the Stockach in March 1799 . 
 While maintaining a cordon between the Austrian forces approaching from Switzerland , under command of Baron von Hotze , most of Ferino 's division participated in a simultaneous assault in the first hours of the engagement at Stockach . With part of Joseph Souham 's Center ( the II . Division of the Army of the Danube ) , they assaulted the Austrian left , but were stopped by overwhelming numbers . Ferino tried to attack again , initiating his assault with a cannonade , followed by an attack through the woods on both sides of the road between Asch and Stockach . Two columns made two attacks , both of which were repulsed ; finally , Ferino added his third column to the assault , which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line , cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade . Ferino could not respond , because he had run out of artillery ammunition , but his troops fixed bayonets and charged the village of <unk> , capturing it despite the heavy fire and massive numbers . They were forced to relinquish the village at darkness .

 Immediately after the coup of 18 <unk> , Napoleon appointed Ferino as commander of the 8th Division . He became a member and grand officer of the Légion d 'honneur on 19 frimaire , and 25 <unk> , respectively . Napoleon appointed him to the Senate of Florence , and made him a Count of the Empire in 1808 , and then appointed him as military governor of the Netherlands . In 1813 , Ferino organized the National Guard of the Netherlands .

 As a member of the French Senate , Ferino voted to request Napoleon 's abdication in 1814 and in 1815 did not participate in the Hundred Days , Napoleon 's return from exile on Elba .

This allowed him to continue to sit in the new Chamber of Peers . <unk> died in Paris on 28 June 1816 . His name is engraved on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris . 
 = Kid Icarus = 
 Kid Icarus is an action platform video game for the Family Computer Disk System in Japan and the Nintendo Entertainment System in Europe and North America . The first entry in Nintendo 's Kid Icarus series , it was published in Japan in December 1986 , and in Europe and North America in February and July 1987 , respectively . It was later re @-@ released for the Game Boy Advance in Japan during 2004 , and for the Wii 's Virtual Console online service in 2007 . A sequel to this game was released for the Game Boy in 1991 , and a third entry to the series was published for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console in March 2012 . 
 The plot of Kid Icarus revolves around protagonist Pit 's quest for three sacred treasures , which he must equip to rescue the Grecian fantasy world Angel Land and its ruler , the goddess Palutena . The player controls Pit through platform areas while fighting monsters and collecting items . Their objective is to reach the end of the levels , and to find and defeat boss monsters that guard the three treasures . The game was developed by Nintendo 's Research and Development 1 division , and co @-@ developed with TOSE . It was designed by Toru Osawa and Yoshio Sakamoto , directed by Satoru Okada , and produced by Gunpei Yokoi . 
 Despite its mixed critical reception , Kid Icarus is a cult classic . Reviewers praised the game for its music and its mixture of gameplay elements from different genres , but criticized its graphics and high difficulty level . It was included in several lists of the best games compiled by IGN and Nintendo Power . After the release of the Game Boy sequel Kid Icarus : Of Myths and Monsters in 1991 , the game series lay dormant for 21 years . It was eventually revived with a 3D shooter for the Nintendo 3DS , titled Kid Icarus : Uprising , after Pit 's inclusion as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Kid Icarus is an action platformer with role @-@ playing elements . The player controls the protagonist Pit through two @-@ dimensional levels , which contain monsters , obstacles and items . Pit 's primary weapon is a bow with an unlimited supply of arrows that can be upgraded with three collectable power items : the guard crystal shields Pit from enemies , the flaming arrows hit multiple targets , and the holy bow increases the range of the arrows . These upgrades will work only if Pit 's health is high enough . The game keeps track of the player 's score , and increases Pit 's health bar at the end of a level if enough points were collected . 
 Throughout the stages , the player may enter doors to access seven different types of chambers . Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts , which are left behind by defeated monsters . Treasure chambers contain items , enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts , and hot springs restore Pit 's health . In the god 's chamber , the strength of Pit 's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors , such as the number of enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle . In the training chamber , Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance . 
 The game world is divided into three stages – the underworld , the over world ( Earth ) and the sky world . Each stage encompasses three unidirectional area levels and a fortress . The areas of the underworld and sky world stages have Pit climb to the top , while those of the surface world are side @-@ scrolling levels . The fortresses at the end of the stages are labyrinths with non @-@ scrolling rooms , in which the player must find and defeat a gatekeeper boss . Within a fortress , Pit may buy a check sheet , pencil and torch to guide him through the labyrinth . A single @-@ use item , the hammer , can destroy stone statues , which frees a flying soldier called a Centurion that will aid the player in boss battles . For each of the bosses destroyed , Pit receives one of three sacred treasures that are needed to access the fourth and final stage , the sky temple . This last portion abandons the platforming elements of the previous levels , and resembles a scrolling shooter . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game is set in Angel Land , which is a fantasy world with a Greek mythology theme . The backstory of Kid Icarus is described in the instruction booklet : before the events of the game , Earth was ruled by the goddess , or Queen of light , Palutena , and the goddess , or Queen of darkness , Medusa . Palutena bestowed the people with light to make them happy , but Medusa hated the humans , dried up their crop and turned them to stone . Enraged by this , Palutena transformed Medusa into a monster , and banished her to the underworld . Out of revenge , Medusa conspired with the monsters of the underworld to take over Palutena 's residence , the sky temple . She launched a surprise attack , and stole the three sacred treasures — the Mirror Shield , the Light Arrows and the Wings of Pegasus — which deprived Palutena 's army of its power . After her soldiers had been turned to stone by Medusa , Palutena was defeated in battle , and imprisoned deep inside the sky temple . With her last power , she sent a bow and arrow to the young angel Pit . He escapes from his prison in the underworld , and sets out to save Palutena and Earth . Throughout the course of the story , Pit retrieves the three sacred treasures from the fortress gatekeepers at the end of the game 's stages . Afterward , he equips himself with the treasures , and storms the sky temple , where he defeats Medusa and rescues Palutena . The game has multiple endings : depending on the player 's performance , Palutena either presents Pit with headgear , or transforms him into a full @-@ grown angel . 
 = = Development and releases = = 
 This game was designed at Nintendo 's Research and Development 1 ( R & D1 ) division , while the programming was handled by the external company Intelligent Systems ( known as Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena at the time ) . The game was developed for the Family Computer Disk System ( FDS ) because the peripheral 's Disk Card media allowed for three times the storage capacity of the Family Computer 's ( and NES 's ) console 's cartridges . Combined with the possibility to store the players ' progress , the floppy disk format enabled the developers to create a longer game with a more extensive game world . Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena was Toru Osawa 's debut as a video game designer , and he was the only staff member working on the game at the beginning of the project . Osawa ( credited in the U.S. version as <unk> ) intended to make Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena an action game with role @-@ playing elements , and wrote a story rooted in Greek mythology , which he had always been fond of . He drew the pixel art , and wrote the technical specifications , which were the basis for the playable prototype that was programmed by Intelligent Systems . After Nintendo 's action @-@ adventure Metroid had been finished , more staff members were allotted to the development of Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena . 
 The game was directed by Satoru Okada ( credited as S. Okada ) , and produced by the general manager of the R & D1 division , Gunpei Yokoi ( credited as G. Yokoi ) . Hirokazu Tanaka ( credited as Hip Tanaka ) composed the music for Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena . Yoshio Sakamoto ( credited as <unk> ) joined the team as soon as he had returned from his vacation after the completion of Metroid . He streamlined the development process , and made many decisions that affected the game design of Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena . Several out @-@ of @-@ place elements were included in the game , such as credit cards , a wizard turning player character Pit into an eggplant , and a large , moving nose that was meant to resemble composer Tanaka . Sakamoto attributed this unrestrained humor to the former personnel of the R & D1 division , which he referred to as " strange " . Osawa said that he had originally tried to make Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena completely serious , but opted for a more humorous approach after objections from the team . 
 To meet the game 's projected release date of December 19 , 1986 , the staff members worked overtime and often stayed in the office at night . They used torn cardboard boxes as beds , and covered themselves in curtains to resist the low temperatures of the unheated development building . Eventually , Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena was finished and entered production a mere three days before the release date . Several ideas for additional stages had to be dropped because of these scheduling conflicts . In February and July 1987 , respectively , a cartridge @-@ based version was published for the NES in Europe and North America under the name Kid Icarus . For this release , the graphics of the ending were updated , and staff credits were added to the game . Unlike Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena , which saves the player 's progress on the Disk Card , Kid Icarus uses a password system to return to a game after the console was turned off . In August 2004 , Myth of Light : The Mirror of Palutena was re @-@ released as part of the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the Game Boy Advance . The game was published internationally for the Wii 's Virtual Console in 2007 . The North American , European and Australian versions of this digital release have the cheat codes of the NES version removed . 
 = = = 3D Classics = = = 
 A 3D Classics remake of Kid Icarus was published for the Nintendo 3DS handheld console . The remake features stereoscopic 3D along with updated graphics including backgrounds , which the original lacked . It also uses the same save system as the Family Computer Disk System version does , as opposed to the Password system from the NES version . The 3D Classics version also utilizes the Family Computer Disk System 's music and sound effects ( utilizing the extra sound channel not available in the NES version ) . 
 The game became available for purchase on the eShop on January 18 , 2012 in Japan , on February 2 , 2012 in Europe , on April 12 , 2012 in Australia and on April 19 , 2012 in North America . The game was available early for free via download code to users who registered two selected 3DS games with Nintendo in Japan , Europe and Australia : in Japan , it was available to users who registered any two Nintendo 3DS titles on Club Nintendo between October 1 , 2011 and January 15 , 2012 with the game available for download starting December 19 , 2011 ; in Europe , it was available to users who registered any two of a selection of Nintendo 3DS titles on Club Nintendo between November 1 , 2011 and January 31 , 2012 , with the first batch of emails with codes being sent out on January 5 , 2012 ; in Australia , it was available to users who registered any two of a selection of Nintendo 3DS titles on Club Nintendo between November 1 , 2011 and March 31 , 2012 , with the first batch of emails with codes being sent out in January 2012 .

 = = Reception = = 
 Kid Icarus had shipped 1 @.@ 76 million copies worldwide by late 2003 , and has gained a cult following . Game Informer ranked it the 83rd best game ever made in 2001 . They claimed that despite its high level of difficulty and frustration , it was fun enough to be worth playing . The game has been met with mixed reviews from critics over the years . In October 1992 , a staff writer of the UK publication Nintendo Magazine System said that Kid Icarus was " pretty good fun " , but did not " compare too well " to other platform games , owing in part to its " rather dated " graphics . Retro Gamer magazine 's Stuart Hunt called Kid Icarus an " unsung hero of the NES " that " looks and sounds pretty " . He described the music by Hirokazu Tanaka as " sublime " , and the enemy characters as " brilliantly drawn " . Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success , he said that Kid Icarus suffered from " frustrating " design flaws , such as its high difficulty level . Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com expressed his disagreement with the game 's status as an " unfairly forgotten masterpiece " among its substantial Internet following . He found Kid Icarus to be " underwhelming " , " buggy " and " pretty annoying " , and noted that it exhibited " shrill music [ , ... ] loose controls and some weird design decisions " . Notwithstanding his disapproval of these elements , Parish said that the game was " [ not ] terrible , or even bad – just a little lacking . " He recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version , if only because it allowed them to experience Kid Icarus " with a fresh perspective " . 
 GameSpot 's Frank Provo reviewed the Virtual Console version of the game . He noted that the gameplay of Kid Icarus was " [ not ] the most unique blueprint for a video game " , but that it had been " fairly fresh back in 1987 " . He considered the difficulty level " excessive " , and found certain areas to be designed " solely to frustrate players " . Provo said that the presentation of the game had " [ not ] aged gracefully " . Despite his favorable comments on the Grecian scenery , he criticized the graphics for its small , <unk> and barely animated sprites , its black backgrounds , and the absence of multiple scrolling layers . He thought that the music was " nicely composed " , but that the sound effects were " all taps and thuds " . He was dissatisfied with the emulation of the game , as the Virtual Console release preserves the slowdown problems of the original NES version , but has its cheat codes removed . Provo closed his review with a warning for potential buyers : he said that players could appreciate Kid Icarus for its " straightforward gameplay and challenging level layouts " , but might " find nothing special in the gameplay and recoil in horror at the unflinching difficulty . " Lucas M. Thomas of IGN noted that the game design was " odd " and " not Nintendo 's most focused " . He thought that it had " [ not ] aged in as timeless a manner as many other first @-@ party Nintendo games from the NES era , " and described Kid Icarus as " one of those games that made a lot more sense back in the ' 80s , accompanied by a tips and tricks strategy sheet . " He complimented the theme music , which he considered " heroic and memorable " . In his review of the Virtual Console release , Thomas frowned upon Nintendo 's decision to remove the NES cheat codes , and called the omission " nonsensical " . He found it to be " not an issue worthy of a prolonged rant " , but said that " [ Nintendo has ] willfully edited its product , and damaged its nostalgic value in the process " . 
 Kid Icarus was included in IGN 's lists of the top 100 NES games and the top 100 games of all time ; it came in 20th and 84th place , respectively . The game was inducted into GameSpy 's " Hall of Fame " , and was voted 54th place in Nintendo Power 's top 200 Nintendo games . Nintendo Power also listed it as the 20th best NES video game , and praised it for its " unique vertically scrolling stages , fun platforming , and infectious 8 @-@ bit tunes " , in spite of its " unmerciful difficulty " .

 A Game Boy sequel to Kid Icarus , titled Kid Icarus : Of Myths and Monsters , was released in North America in November 1991 , and in Europe on May 21 , 1992 . It was developed by Nintendo in cooperation with the independent company Tose , and largely adopts the gameplay mechanics of its predecessor . Kid Icarus : Of Myths and Monsters remained the last installment in the series for over 20 years . 
 Pit is a recurring character in the American animated television series Captain N : The Game Master , albeit has been erroneously named as " Kid Icarus " , and made cameo appearances in Nintendo games such as Tetris , F @-@ 1 Race and Super Smash Bros. Melee . He became a playable character in the fighting game Super Smash Bros. Brawl , for which his appearance was redesigned . 
 In 2008 , there were rumors of a three @-@ dimensional Kid Icarus game for the Wii that was allegedly developed by the German American studio Factor 5 . However , the title was said to be in production without the approval of Nintendo , and Factor 5 cancelled multiple projects following the closure of its American branch in early 2009 . In a 2010 interview , Yoshio Sakamoto was asked about a Kid Icarus game for the Wii , to which he replied that he was not aware of any plans to revive the franchise . A new series entry for the Nintendo 3DS , Kid Icarus : Uprising , was eventually revealed at the E3 2010 trade show and was released in 2012 . The game is a 3D shooter , and was developed by Project Sora , the company of Super Smash Bros. designer Masahiro Sakurai . 
 In May 2011 , independent development studio Flip Industries released Super Kid Icarus , an unofficial Flash game . Super Kid Icarus is noted for having a SNES style look and including cheats to reduce the difficulty . 
 = Halo 4 Original Soundtrack = 
 The Halo 4 Original Soundtrack is the official soundtrack to the first @-@ person shooter video game Halo 4 , developed by 343 Industries and published by Microsoft Studios . British record producer Neil Davidge was Halo 4 's main composer and producer . The soundtrack was released on October 19 , 2012 in Australia and New Zealand , and October 22 everywhere else . A second volume containing more of the score was released digitally on April 8 , 2013 . 
 Davidge was a Halo fan who was honored to have the chance to write music for the games . Drawing inspiration from the game 's concept art and other visuals , he began writing music for the game in December 2010 . Davidge described his music as an evolution of previous Halo music , designed to accompany the new style of the universe . 
 Critical reception to Halo 4 's music and the soundtrack was generally positive . However the absence of the iconic theme from the original Halo trilogy , without the establishment of a new one , received polarised views from players . The album debuted the No. 50 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States , making it the highest @-@ charting game soundtrack ever . 
 = = Background = = 
 The majority of previous Halo soundtracks had been composed by Martin O 'Donnell , Michael Salvatori , and the Bungie audio team ; Stephen Rippy composed the music for the spinoff game Halo Wars . Davidge is best known for his work as a co @-@ writer and producer for Massive Attack , and has also composed the scores for a number of films . 
 Halo 4 audio director <unk> Tojima began looking for the game 's composer in 2010 . " I had a vision for the overall Halo 4 music production that I think of as ' Digital and Organic ' , " he wrote — " something very much inspired by the game script . " This vision led him to explore electronica and dance music to find his chosen sound . Tojima decided on Davidge after a year 's search . 343 Industries officially named Davidge as Halo 4 's main composer on April 11 , 2012 ; by that point the name of Halo 4 's composer had been kept a secret for fifteen months . 
 Davidge is a longtime Halo fan ; he would play Combat Evolved during downtime while producing Massive Attack albums in 2001 . Davidge credits the games with providing a heroic story that reminded him of his youth reading comic books . " I 'd love to be able to inspire people [ like Halo does ] , " he said . Davidge flew to Seattle , Washington in December 2010 to meet 343 Industries personnel . Afterwards he began writing concept and prototype music for the project before being officially engaged in July or August 2011 . 
 Davidge initially thought that scoring the video game would be similar to the process for a film ; " Pretty soon I discovered the similarities were few , " he later told Rolling Stone , since music for the game had to dynamically change its length and composition depending on player actions . Much of Halo 4 's music was written guitar or piano ; at home , Davidge would sometimes sing melodies into a dictaphone for later transcription . While composing , he viewed slideshow images and visual material to influence his work . Davidge played through unfinished portions of the game for inspiration ; he ended up using the game 's development concept art as inspiration for his music . 
 While Davidge professed himself as a huge fan of O 'Donnell 's work , he felt the music needed to change to fit the new trilogy . " The phrase that kept going around was ' evolution not revolution ' of the score , " he said . " [ They wanted a ] more electronic , slightly more beat @-@ driven direction , which is one reason why they came to me . They wanted to flesh out , sonically , a new universe . One that they could expand on in subsequent sequels . ” 
 = = Recording = = 
 Recording of much of the soundtrack took place at Abbey Road Studios and Angel Studios , both situated in London , United Kingdom . Davidge and his production team enlisted the 50 @-@ piece Chamber Orchestra of London , as well as 26 male and female vocalists and other performers . 
 Track 12 , " 117 " , was composed by Kazuma Jinnouchi and performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony . Recording took place at 20th Century Fox 's Newman Scoring Stage in Los Angeles , United States .

 The original soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats . Customers who purchased the physical compact disc received a free download voucher for remixes and additional music that are not included in the soundtrack but featured in @-@ game . A limited edition two @-@ disc box set was also released featuring both the Halo 4 Original Soundtrack and Halo 4 Original Soundtrack Remixes as well as a DVD featuring over 70 minutes of behind the scenes footage from Abbey Road Studios . A special digital edition is available which features the soundtrack and six tracks from the remix album . 
 On October 3 , 2012 , 343 Industries announced that they would be holding a Halo 4 Soundtrack Remix Contest . The competition took place from October 3 , 2012 , until October 29 , 2012 ; participants could use samples from the tracks " Awakening " , " To Galaxy " , and " Revival " and submit their own remixes . Entries were judged by Davidge , Tojima , and music producers Caspa and Sander van Doorn . Participants of the winning entries received prizes , including the Xbox 360 Limited Edition Halo 4 console bundle , the Halo 4 Original Soundtrack itself and many more . 
 On October 3 , 2012 , it was also announced that the release date for the special limited edition box set version would be pushed to November 6 , 2012 , to coincide with the release date of the game ; this was due to an exclusive content reveal . On December 4 , 2012 , Halo 4 Original Soundtrack Remixes was released digitally .

 = = Reception = = 
 In the United States , the album debuted at No. 50 on the Billboard 200 chart , becoming the highest video game soundtrack to peak on the chart . During the first week , it sold nearly 9 @,@ 000 units . 
 Critical reception to the music and soundtrack was generally positive . James <unk> , writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly , summed up the soundtrack and the remix album as " a fun and enjoyable collection of songs " , with Davidge 's work introducing new elements to the series while harking back to classic themes . Gaming Age 's Dustin Chadwell appreciated that Davidge avoided retreading old material in the series and wrote a " unique " soundtrack for the release with several standout tracks . Francesca Reyes of Official Xbox Magazine wrote that many areas of Halo 4 was highly polished , including the score ; " the music by new composer Neil Davidge combines orchestrated swells with subtle electronic blips and bleeps to great effect . " 
 Ryan McCaffrey of IGN wrote that while it was a wise choice for Microsoft to move in a different direction than O 'Donnell 's style , " the results [ were ] mixed " ; Davidge 's " atmospheric " compositions were not memorable in McCaffrey 's estimation , and complemented the action rather than adding to it . 
 The soundtrack for Halo 4 was nominated in the category for Best Original Score at the 2012 Inside Gaming Awards and the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards .

 = Karma in Jainism = 
 Karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho @-@ cosmology in Jainism . Human moral actions form the basis of the transmigration of the soul ( jīva ) . The soul is constrained to a cycle of rebirth , trapped within the temporal world ( saṃsāra ) , until it finally achieves liberation ( mokṣa ) . Liberation is achieved by following a path of purification . 
 Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration , but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter , which infiltrates the soul — obscuring its natural , transparent and pure qualities . Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution , that taints the soul with various colours ( leśyā ) . Based on its karma , a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence — like heavens or hells , or as humans or animals . 
 Jains cite inequalities , sufferings , and pain as evidence for the existence of karma . Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on the potency of the soul . The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx ( āsrava ) and bondage ( bandha ) , placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves , and the intentions behind those deeds . The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions , and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution . The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma , and to obtain release from it , through the austerities and purity of conduct . 
 = = Philosophical overview = = 
 According to Jains , all souls are intrinsically pure in their inherent and ideal state , possessing the qualities of infinite knowledge , infinite perception , infinite bliss and infinite energy . However , in contemporary experience , these qualities are found to be defiled and obstructed , on account of the association of these souls with karma . The soul has been associated with karma in this way throughout an eternity of <unk> time . This bondage of the soul is explained in the Jain texts by analogy with gold ore , which — in its natural state — is always found unrefined of admixture with impurities . Similarly , the ideally pure state of the soul has always been overlaid with the impurities of karma . This analogy with gold ore is also taken one step further : the purification of the soul can be achieved if the proper methods of refining are applied . Over the centuries , Jain monks have developed a large and sophisticated corpus of literature describing the nature of the soul , various aspects of the working of karma , and the ways and means of attaining mokṣa . 
 = = = Material theory = = = 
 Jainism speaks of karmic " dirt " , as karma is thought to be manifest as very subtle and microscopically imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe . They are so small that one space @-@ point — the smallest possible extent of space — contains an infinite number of karmic particles ( or quantity of karmic dirt ) . It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency . This material karma is called dravya karma ; and the resultant emotions — pleasure , pain , love , hatred , and so on — experienced by the soul are called bhava karma , psychic karma . The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect . The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls , which — in turn — give rise to psychic karma , causing emotional modifications within the soul . These emotions , yet again , result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma . Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe . They are the material carrier of a soul 's desire to physically experience this world . When attracted to the consciousness , they are stored in an interactive karmic field called <unk> <unk> , which emanates from the soul . Thus , karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul . When these two components — consciousness and ripened karma — interact , the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe .

 According to Indologist Robert J. <unk> , karma is a system of natural laws , where actions that carry moral significance are considered to cause certain consequences in the same way as physical actions . When one holds an apple and then lets it go , the apple will fall . There is no judge , and no moral judgment involved , since this is a mechanical consequence of the physical action . In the same manner , consequences occur naturally when one utters a lie , steals something , commits senseless violence or leads a life of debauchery . Rather than assume that these consequences — the moral rewards and retributions — are a work of some divine judge , Jains believe that there is an innate moral order in the cosmos , self @-@ regulating through the workings of the law of karma . Morality and ethics are important in Jainism not because of a God , but because a life led in agreement with moral and ethical principles ( <unk> ) is considered beneficial : it leads to a decrease — and finally to the total loss of — karma , which in turn leads to everlasting happiness . The Jain conception of karma takes away the responsibility for salvation from God and bestows it on man himself . In the words of the Jain scholar , J. L. Jaini : 
 Jainism , more than any other creed , gives absolute religious independence and freedom to man . Nothing can intervene between the actions which we do and the fruits thereof . Once done , they become our masters and must <unk> . As my independence is great , so my responsibility is co @-@ extensive with it . I can live as I like ; but my voice is irrevocable , and I cannot escape the consequences of it . No God , his Prophet or his deputy or beloved can interfere with human life . The soul , and it alone is responsible for all it does .

 According to Jainism , karmic consequences are unerringly certain and inescapable . No divine grace can save a person from experiencing them . Only the practice of austerities and self @-@ control can modify or alleviate the consequences of karma . Even then , in some cases , there is no option but to accept karma with equanimity . The second @-@ century Jain text , <unk> <unk> ( verse no . 1616 ) sums up the predominance of karma in Jain doctrine : 
 There is nothing mightier in the world than karma ; karma tramples down all powers , as an elephant a clump of lotuses . 
 This predominance of karma is a theme often explored by Jain ascetics in the literature they have produced , throughout all centuries . Paul Dundas notes that the ascetics often used cautionary tales to underline the full karmic implications of morally incorrect modes of life , or excessively intense emotional relationships . However , he notes that such narratives were often softened by concluding statements about the transforming effects of the protagonists ' pious actions , and their eventual attainment of liberation . 
 The biographies of legendary persons like Rama and Krishna , in the Jain versions of the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata , also have karma as one of the major themes . The major events , characters and circumstances are explained by reference to their past lives , with examples of specific actions of particular intensity in one life determining events in the next . Jain texts narrate how even Māhavīra , one of the most popular propagators of Jainism and the 24th <unk> ( ford @-@ maker ) , had to bear the brunt of his previous karma before attaining <unk> <unk> ( enlightenment ) . He attained it only after bearing twelve years of severe austerity with detachment . The <unk> Sūtra speaks of how Māhavīra bore his karma with complete equanimity , as follows : 
 He was struck with a stick , the fist , a lance , hit with a fruit , a clod , a potsherd . Beating him again and again many cried . When he once sat without moving his body many cut his flesh , tore his hair under pain , or covered him with dust . Throwing him up they let him fall , or disturbed him in his religious postures ; abandoning the care of his body , the Venerable One humbled himself and bore pain , free from desires . As a hero at the head of the battle is surrounded by all sides , so was there Māhavīra . Bearing all hardships , the Venerable One , undisturbed , proceeded on the road to <unk> .

 Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith , being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration , reincarnation , liberation , non @-@ violence ( ahiṃsā ) and non @-@ attachment , among others . Actions are seen to have consequences : some immediate , some delayed , even into future incarnations . So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life @-@ time , but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives . Uttarādhyayana @-@ sūtra 3 @.@ 3 – 4 states : 
 The jīva or the soul is sometimes born in the world of gods , sometimes in hell . Sometimes it acquires the body of a demon ; all this happens on account of its karma . This jīva sometimes takes birth as a worm , as an insect or as an ant . 
 The text further states ( 32 @.@ 7 ) : 
 Karma is the root of birth and death . The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence . 
 There is no retribution , judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly . Hence , whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past . As a result of this doctrine , Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior . 
 = = = Four states of existence = = = 
 The Jain texts postulate four gatis , that is states @-@ of @-@ existence or birth @-@ categories , within which the soul <unk> . The four gatis are : deva ( demi @-@ gods ) , <unk> ( humans ) , <unk> ( hell beings ) and <unk> ( animals , plants and micro @-@ organisms ) . The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe : demi @-@ gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated ; humans , plants and animals occupy the middle levels ; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated . 
 Single @-@ sensed souls , however , called nigoda , and element @-@ bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe . <unk> are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy . They are so tiny and undifferentiated , that they lack even individual bodies , living in colonies . According to Jain texts , this infinity of nigodas can also be found in plant tissues , root vegetables and animal bodies . Depending on its karma , a soul <unk> and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies . The four main destinies are further divided into sub @-@ categories and still smaller sub – sub categories . In all , Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8 @.@ 4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara . 
 In Jainism , God has no role to play in an individual 's destiny ; one 's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment , but rather as a result of its own personal karma . A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon , <unk> sūtra 8 @.@ 9 @.@ 9 , links specific states of existence to specific karmas . Violent deeds , killing of creatures having five sense organs , eating fish , and so on , lead to rebirth in hell . Deception , fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world . Kindness , compassion and humble character result in human birth ; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth in heaven .
