 ferrous hydroxide → magnetite + water + hydrogen 
 The well crystallized magnetite ( Fe

 This process occurs during the anaerobic corrosion of iron and steel in oxygen @-@ free groundwater and in reducing soils below the water table .

 In the absence of atmospheric oxygen ( O

 2 ) is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons ( H + ) of the ferrous ( Fe2 + ) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the <unk> ( Fe 
 2SiO 
 4 , the olivine iron @-@ <unk> ) . The corresponding reaction leading to the formation of magnetite ( Fe

 Large quantities of H 
 2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries . The largest application of H 
 2 is for the processing ( " upgrading " ) of fossil fuels , and in the production of ammonia . The key consumers of H 
 2 in the petrochemical plant include <unk> , hydrodesulfurization , and hydrocracking . H 
 2 has several other important uses . H 
 2 is used as a <unk> agent , particularly in increasing the level of saturation of unsaturated fats and oils ( found in items such as margarine ) , and in the production of methanol . It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the manufacture of hydrochloric acid . H 
 2 is also used as a reducing agent of metallic ores . 
 Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals . Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice . These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks . 
 Apart from its use as a reactant , H 
 2 has wide applications in physics and engineering . It is used as a shielding gas in welding methods such as atomic hydrogen welding . H2 is used as the rotor coolant in electrical generators at power stations , because it has the highest thermal conductivity of any gas . Liquid H2 is used in cryogenic research , including superconductivity studies . Because H 
 2 is lighter than air , having a little more than 1 ⁄ 14 of the density of air , it was once widely used as a lifting gas in balloons and airships . 
 In more recent applications , hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen ( sometimes called forming gas ) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection . Applications can be found in the automotive , chemical , power generation , aerospace , and telecommunications industries . Hydrogen is an authorized food additive ( E 949 ) that allows food package leak testing among other anti @-@ oxidizing properties . 
 Hydrogen 's rarer isotopes also each have specific applications . Deuterium ( hydrogen @-@ 2 ) is used in nuclear fission applications as a moderator to slow neutrons , and in nuclear fusion reactions . Deuterium compounds have applications in chemistry and biology in studies of reaction isotope effects . Tritium ( hydrogen @-@ 3 ) , produced in nuclear reactors , is used in the production of hydrogen bombs , as an isotopic label in the <unk> , and as a radiation source in luminous paints . 
 The triple point temperature of equilibrium hydrogen is a defining fixed point on the ITS @-@ 90 temperature scale at 13 @.@ <unk> kelvins . 
 = = = Coolant = = = 
 Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules . These include low density , low viscosity , and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases . 
 = = = Energy carrier = = = 
 Hydrogen is not an energy resource , except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium , a technology presently far from development . The Sun 's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen , but this process is difficult to achieve <unk> on Earth . Elemental hydrogen from solar , biological , or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it , so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier , like a battery . Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources ( such as methane ) , but these sources are unsustainable . 
 The energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources , although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher . Nevertheless , elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy , as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy @-@ wide scale . For example , CO 
 2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of H 
 2 production from fossil fuels . Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly , with some NOx emissions , but without carbon emissions . However , the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial . Fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines . 
 = = = Semiconductor industry = = = 
 Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken ( " dangling " ) bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties . It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials , including ZnO , <unk> , <unk> , MgO , ZrO2 , HfO2 , La2O3 , <unk> , TiO2 , <unk> , <unk> , SiO2 , Al2O3 , ZrSiO4 , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = Biological reactions = = 
 H2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms , usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel @-@ containing enzymes called hydrogenases . These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons . Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water . The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle . 
 Water splitting , in which water is decomposed into its component protons , electrons , and oxygen , occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms . Some such organisms , including the alga <unk> <unk> and cyanobacteria , have evolved a second step in the dark reactions in which protons and electrons are reduced to form H2 gas by specialized hydrogenases in the chloroplast . Efforts have been undertaken to genetically modify cyanobacterial hydrogenases to efficiently synthesize H2 gas even in the presence of oxygen . Efforts have also been undertaken with genetically modified alga in a bioreactor . 
 = = Safety and precautions = = 
 Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety , from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure , oxygen @-@ free form . In addition , liquid hydrogen is a <unk> and presents dangers ( such as frostbite ) associated with very cold liquids . Hydrogen dissolves in many metals , and , in addition to leaking out , may have adverse effects on them , such as hydrogen embrittlement , leading to cracks and explosions . Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite . Moreover , hydrogen fire , while being extremely hot , is almost invisible , and thus can lead to accidental burns . 
 Even interpreting the hydrogen data ( including safety data ) is confounded by a number of phenomena . Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen / orthohydrogen ratio ( it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio , for which the data is usually given ) . Hydrogen detonation parameters , such as critical detonation pressure and temperature , strongly depend on the container geometry . 
 = Bigfin reef squid = 
 Sepioteuthis lessoniana , commonly known as the bigfin reef squid or oval squid , is a commercially important species of <unk> squid . It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus Sepioteuthis . Studies in 1993 , however , have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex . The species is likely to include several very similar and closely related species . 
 Bigfin reef squids are characterised by a large oval fin that extends throughout the margins of its mantle , giving them a superficial similarity to cuttlefish . They are small to medium @-@ sized squids , averaging 3 @.@ 8 to 33 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 0 in ) in length . They exhibit elaborate mating displays and usually spawn in May , but it can vary by location . The <unk> resemble miniature adults and are remarkable for already having the capability to change body colouration upon hatching . Bigfin reef squids have the fastest recorded growth rates of any large marine invertebrate , reaching 600 g ( 1 @.@ 3 lb ) in only four months . They are a short @-@ lived species , with a maximum recorded lifespan of 315 days . 
 The diet of bigfin reef squids comprises mainly crustaceans and small fish . They are found in the temperate and tropical waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans , and have recently been introduced into the Mediterranean as a Lessepsian migrant . They are commonly found near the shoreline , near rocks , and coral reefs . They are fished in vast quantities for human food in Asia . Because of their rapid growth rate , short life span , and tolerance to handling and captivity , bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture . They are also a valuable source of giant axons for medical research . 
 = = Taxonomy and nomenclature = = 
 Bigfin reef squids are also known as northern <unk> in Australia and New Zealand , to distinguish them from the southern reef squid ( or southern <unk> ) , Sepioteuthis australis . Other common names include green @-@ eyed squid in English , <unk> in Malayalam , <unk> <unk> in Tamil , <unk> <unk> in French , <unk> <unk> in Spanish , <unk> @-@ <unk> in German , mu <unk> in Hawaiian , <unk> in Chinese , <unk> in Malaysian , <unk> ( <unk> @-@ ika ) in Japanese , <unk> mon in <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> @-@ o @-@ jing @-@ au ) in Korean . 
 Sepioteuthis lessoniana is one of the three currently recognised species classified under the genus Sepioteuthis of the pencil squid family , <unk> . It belongs to the suborder <unk> of the squid order <unk> . Sepioteuthis literally means ' cuttlefish squid ' , from Greek : <unk> ( <unk> , ' cuttlefish ' ) and <unk> ( <unk> , ' squid ' ) . 
 It was first described by the French naturalist André Étienne d <unk> de <unk> and named after René Primevère Lesson . The type specimen was collected by Lesson off the coast of New Guinea during the <unk> voyage of the French corvette La Coquille ( 1822 – 1825 ) under the command of Louis Isidore <unk> . Numerous other species of Sepioteuthis were described from the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the late 19th century and in the early 20th century . In 1939 the Belgian malacologist William Adam examined the specimens of Sepioteuthis recovered from the tropical western Pacific . He synonymised the twelve species then considered valid under Sepioteuthis lessoniana . 
 A study in 1993 by <unk> et al. revealed that the population of S. lessoniana in Okinawa may actually be composed of three distinct species . This was confirmed in genetic studies by Izuka et al. in 1994 . <unk> and Adams in 2005 also showed that S. lessoniana in Shark Bay , Australia is composed of two species . These findings indicate that S. lessoniana may actually comprise several very similar and closely related species . It is now believed that S. lessoniana is a cryptic species complex . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like other members of the genus Sepioteuthis , bigfin reef squids are easy to distinguish from other squids in that they possess thick and muscular oval fins that extend around almost the entire mantle . The fins extend about 83 to 97 % of the mantle length and are 67 to 70 % of the mantle length in width . Because of these fins , bigfin reef squids are sometimes mistaken for cuttlefish , a fact reflected by their scientific names . A narrow blue or white line is visible at the point of attachment of the fins to the mantle . A fleshy ridge is also present where the fins meet at the back of the squid . 
 The mantles of bigfin reef squids are cylindrical , tapering to a blunt cone at the posterior . The mantle is usually 4 to 33 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 0 in ) long in males and 3 @.@ 8 to 25 @.@ 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 to 10 @.@ 1 in ) long in females . Both sexes can reach a maximum mantle length of 38 cm ( 15 in ) . Adult males weigh 403 @.@ 5 to 1 @,@ 415 g ( 0 @.@ 890 to 3 @.@ 120 lb ) , while adult females are 165 to 1 @,@ 046 g ( 0 @.@ 364 to 2 @.@ 306 lb ) . Both sexes can attain a maximum documented weight of 1 @.@ 8 kg ( 4 @.@ 0 lb ) . The forward margin of the mantle on the ventral side is concave . 
 Their eyes are large and covered entirely by a transparent secondary cornea . They are greenish at the base . A pair of prominent ridges ( olfactory crests ) are present on the ventral surface of the head at the rear edge of the eyes . The mouth area is supported by seven triangular flaps ( buccal lappets ) , each with 0 to 7 suckers of less than 0 @.@ 2 mm in diameter and 18 to 25 teeth . The strong , curved , and short beaks ( rostra ) are mostly black to dark brown . The radula has seven rows of teeth . 
 The spermatophores of males are about 4 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 18 in ) long and 0 @.@ 15 mm wide . The ink sac is pear @-@ shaped , with a silvery blue @-@ green outer layer . The vane of the gladius ( the rigid internal remnants of the mollusc shell ) is oval @-@ shaped and pointed at both ends ( lanceolate ) . It has a broad midrib ( rachis ) . 
 The eight arms are thick , tapering to a narrow point . They are unequal in length , with arm pair I the shortest , followed by arm pair II and arm pair IV , and arm pair III the longest . All of them possess two rows of suckers . Each sucker has a diameter less than 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) , decreasing distally , and a ring of 17 to 28 sharp acute teeth . The left arm of pair IV in males is modified into a sexual organ known as the hectocotylus . They bear long fleshy protrusions ( papillae ) with toothless suckers at the distal portion . The tentacles are thick and long , extending the length of the mantle when retracted . They are slightly compressed laterally . A prominent ridge ( a keel ) is present on the outer surface of each of the tentacle clubs ( the wide tip of the tentacles ) . There are four rows of suckers on the manus ( proximal part of the club ) and the dactylus ( distal part of the club ) . The larger suckers in the centre of the manus have 17 to 18 widely spaced teeth . 
 = = = Coloration = = = 
 Large chromatophores densely cover the upper surfaces of the head , mantle and arms . They are distributed more sparsely on the ventral side . The fins do not possess chromatophores on the underside . Living specimens range in colour from translucent creamy white through pale yellow to brownish pink and brownish violet . 
 Like some other cephalopods , bigfin reef squids are capable of metachrosis – rapidly changing body colouration and patterns through voluntary control of chromatophores . They also possess iridophores ( particularly in the head ) , a form of structural colouration that produces iridescent metallic greens and red when illuminated . They are also possibly one of two squid species with <unk> . <unk> are a reflector @-@ type structural colouration that reflects ambient light , such that they are white in white light , green in green light , and so on . Bigfin reef squids are remarkable for having the ability to produce complex body patterns from the moment they hatch . In comparison , other <unk> squid species do not produce complex body patterns at less than four months of age . The patterns produced by bigfin reef squids , however , are less diverse than those of the Caribbean reef squids . 
 Bigfin reef squids do not possess photophores , and are thus not truly bioluminescent . 
 = = = Sexual dimorphism = = = 
 It is often difficult to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids . Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males , but this distinction is not observed in other studies . Closer examination of sexually mature specimens , however , will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males , and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females . Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution and habitat = = = 
 The bigfin reef squid is a neritic warm water @-@ dwelling squid . They are usually found 0 to 100 m ( 0 to 328 ft ) below the water 's surface . They tend to remain close to the shoreline , near rocks and reefs . They are slightly more active during the night and will move to deeper waters or find cover in daytime . Large numbers of juveniles can often be found hiding beneath floating driftwood . 
 The bigfin reef squid is the most widespread species in the genus Sepioteuthis . It is found in temperate and tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean . Their original range extends east to the Hawaiian Islands , west to the Red Sea , north to Japan , and south to Australia and New Zealand ( 42 ° N to 42 ° S and 32 ° E to 154 ° W ) . The range has also expanded to include parts of the Mediterranean Sea . In 2002 , bigfin reef squids were first documented in the Gulf of İskenderun of the southeastern Mediterranean Sea . They may have already existed in significant populations in the area as they have acquired a common name among the fishermen of the Aegean Sea – <unk> ( <unk> , literally " cuttlefish @-@ like squid " ) . It is a Lessepsian migrant , reaching the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal . 
 = = = Diet and predators = = = 
 The bigfin reef squid eats a variety of different marine organisms . Its main prey are usually prawns and other crustaceans , and fish . Captive specimens were observed to consume one fish every 2 to 25 hours .

 = = Biology and behaviour = = 
 Bigfin reef squids are closely related to the Caribbean reef squid ( Sepioteuthis sepioidea ) , a species noted for its complex social interactions . Like Caribbean reef squids , bigfin reef squids also exhibit elaborate mating displays . 
 Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both schooling and shoaling behaviours . Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together ( shoaling ) , but do not swim together parallel to each other ( schooling ) . Unlike most other squid species , bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic . Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members . Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Bigfin reef squids exhibit strong positive phototactic behaviour ( attraction to light ) and will move readily within a certain distance of a light source . Studies have proposed that this might be an involuntary stimulus behaviour , as the squids immediately stop all other movements once a light source is switched on . The colour of the light does not matter , but it has been shown that they react more strongly to underwater lights between the intensities of 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 5 lx , with peak ranges of 2 @.@ 5 to 10 @.@ 0 lx . 
 = = = Hearing = = = 
 Bigfin reef squids and the common octopus ( Octopus vulgaris ) were studied to resolve a century @-@ long debate over whether cephalopods can hear . Unlike fishes , cephalopods do not possess air @-@ filled swim bladders , which might amplify sound waves travelling in water . The results were published in 2009 . It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations , an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation . The common octopus can hear sounds between 400 Hz and 1000 Hz . Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400 Hz to 1500 Hz . Both hear best at a frequency of 600 Hz . Relatively , their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes . 
 The difference in the hearing ranges for octopus and bigfin reef squids may be explained by the difference in their habitats . The octopus is demersal ( bottom @-@ dwelling ) with excellent camouflage capabilities . Bigfin reef squids , on the other hand , are usually in open water with limited hiding places . Hearing would thus be more important for the squids to escape predators . The ability to hear is particularly relevant for avoiding mammalian predators of the suborder Odontoceti ( particularly dolphins ) , who use echolocation to find prey . 
 = = = Mating behaviour = = = 
 Bigfin reef squids exhibit two most common social body patterning and posturing behaviours related to mating . 
 The first is dubbed " accentuated gonads " , in which they will sometimes increase the visibility of their gonads while reducing the rest of their body colouration . This makes their reproductive organs appear bright white through the transparent mantle . It may indicate the reproductive condition of the signalling squid . 
 Another common behaviour , primarily seen in males , is dubbed " spread arms " , in which the squid will slightly tilt its body forward , head down and arms spread widely and raised above . The mantle is darkened . This behaviour is exhibited mostly when the squids are chasing or following another individual . It is thought to be a signal of reproductive arousal or aggression , similar to the " zebra display " behaviour of Sepioteuthis sepioidea , the " intense zebra display " behaviour of Sepia officinalis , and the " lateral display " of Loligo <unk> . Females will also sometimes use this display to rebuff courting males . 
 There are three known courtship behaviours in bigfin reef squids , dubbed " male @-@ upturned " mating , " male @-@ parallel " mating , and " head @-@ to @-@ head " mating . Actual insertion in each position lasts for only a few seconds . 
 " Male @-@ upturned " mating involves rapid back and forth swimming by the courting male beside a slower @-@ swimming female . The male will then flip over so that he is swimming upside down and quickly lunge forward towards the female . He will quickly eject several spermatophores from his funnel into his hectocotylus and attempt to deposit them on the female 's mouth funnel , then jet away from the female . " Head @-@ to @-@ head " mating is regarded as a variation of this tactic . 
 " Male @-@ parallel " mating involves the male and female swimming side by side . The male will then raise one or two of his arm pair I upwards and swing them back and forth . He moves below the female and clasps the female 's neck with his arms . In contrast to the previous behaviours , in this position the male actually inserts his <unk> into the mantle cavity of the female , attaching the spermatophores right at the opening of the oviduct rather than at the mouth . Possibly for this reason , it is usually more successful in fertilizing the female than other mating behaviours . 
 In addition to the above , males will often engage in " sneaking " behaviour . In this scenario , a smaller male will attach spermatophores to the female 's mouth area while she is being courted by a larger male using the " male @-@ upturned " behaviour . Even when successful , the male using this strategy is usually chased away by the larger male afterwards . 
 The spermatophores usually remain embedded near the mouth of the female . Mating usually occurs well before spawning , but may also happen on the spawning grounds themselves . In those cases , the male will stay near the female 's side as she lays eggs . 
 Males have been observed to exhibit mating behaviours with other males . Some males have been found with numerous spermatophores embedded in their mouth funnels . Since bigfin reef squids distinguish sex by visual cues , this may be a form of deception . The smaller males ( termed " female mimics " or " sneaker males " ) might have assumed body patterning typical of females in order to trick larger males . Believing they are females , they will then waste their spermatophores on them . This behaviour has also been observed in other cephalopods . 
 = = = Reproduction and life cycle = = = 
 The main spawning season for bigfin reef squids usually begins in May , but they lay eggs all year round and spawning seasons can vary by location . A single female can spawn more than once in her lifetime . Females can release 20 to 1180 eggs per individual and will die soon afterwards . 
 The females spawn by passing eggs from their oviducts . These eggs are then coated in gelatinous substances from the nidamental glands and <unk> glands , forming an egg ' capsule ' . The egg capsules of the bigfin reef squids contain two to nine eggs each . These are laid in single straight strands on rocks , corals , aquatic plants , submerged branches and other surfaces . At this point , the eggs are 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) in diameter and the egg capsules about 58 @.@ 2 mm ( 2 @.@ 29 in ) in length and 12 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) in width , on average . 
 The capsules incubate for about 3 weeks , depending on temperature . In warmer Indonesia , the incubation period was recorded to be only 15 to 16 days , while in Thailand it takes around 20 to 22 days . They gradually enlarge by absorbing water , reaching around 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 in ) in length and 14 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 57 in ) in width . <unk> eggs remain milky white and do not develop further . Fertilised eggs undergo cell division reaching a diameter of 16 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 in ) with the developing embryo at 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 43 in ) on the day before hatching . Upon hatching , the <unk> are 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) in mantle length ( excluding tentacles ) , with fully functioning fins and ink sacs . They resemble miniature adults and are already strong swimmers . They exhibit schooling behaviour two weeks after hatching . 
 Hatchlings are often cannibalistic . This is regarded as the main cause of death in young squids , particularly in dense populations . However , cannibalism usually happens only when eaten individuals were already weakened significantly or dead , so the actual cause of death may have been something else . Subadults are usually recognisable by their size , ranging from 20 to 60 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 to 2 @.@ 36 in ) in length . They reach sexual maturity at less than 210 days in the wild . Males reach sexual maturity earlier than females . In captive populations , males mature 140 days after hatching at most . Females will begin spawning at around 156 to 196 days after hatching . Both males and females mature earlier in captivity than in the wild . Water temperature may play an important role in the earlier sexual maturation of captive specimens . High temperatures may induce shorter lifespans and smaller body sizes , while cooler temperatures favour longer lifespans and larger individuals . 
 Bigfin reef squids have one of the fastest recorded growth rates for any large marine invertebrate . They can reach 600 g ( 1 @.@ 3 lb ) in only four months . Nonetheless , size can not often be reliably correlated with age , as variations of body size within a generation is fairly common . In captivity , bigfin reef squids have a lifespan of 161 to 315 days for both sexes . 
 = = Economic importance = = 
 = = = Commercial fishing and human consumption = = = 
 Bigfin reef squids are one of the most commercially important squid species , and are widely consumed as human food . They are usually caught in large numbers by trawling , seine fishing , or fixed net traps . In small @-@ scale fishing , they are caught by jigging , drive @-@ in nets , slingshot @-@ driven <unk> , or with squid pots . 
 Fishing operations for bigfin reef squids ( particularly in jigging ) are usually done at night and utilise bright lights , taking advantage of their attraction to illumination . They are especially abundant during the full moon and in foggy weather . Populations of bigfin reef squids are not seasonal , and they can be fished throughout the year . They are also used as fish bait in hook and line fishing . 
 Because of their rapid growth rate , short life span , and tolerance to handling and captivity , bigfin reef squids are regarded as one of the most promising species for mariculture . Although there have been several studies about this , there have been no reported commercial @-@ scale cultures , as of 2011 . 
 = = = Biomedical research = = = 
 The bigfin reef squid is the first squid species to have been cultured for more than one generation . It is remarkable for its ability to readily adapt to being confined in tanks , and is one of the few squid species of which the entire life span has been observed under laboratory conditions . 
 Bigfin reef squids are also valuable sources for squid giant axons used in research in neuroscience and physiology . Unlike axons of other animals , squid axons are very large . Those of bigfin reef squids can range in diameter from 350 to 560 μm ( in contrast to the typical 1 μm for humans ) . In life , these giant axons are used by the squids to coordinate escape jetting behaviour , enabling the squid to contract its muscles in a split second directly from the brain . 
 = = = Global warming = = = 
 Bigfin reef squids adapt to warmer temperatures by laying more eggs , making them a good indicator species for climate change . In conjunction with their rapid growth rates and short lifespans , bigfin reef squid populations may rise dramatically in response to global warming . Overfishing may also play an important role . In the Gulf of Thailand , the fishing industry has been forced to adapt to the large numbers of bigfin reef squids now present in the area , believed to be the result of overfishing of the squid 's natural predators . The Australian scientist George Jackson describes them as " the weeds of the sea . " 
 Warmer waters may also accelerate the squid 's expansion into areas in which it was not previously native . Its recent discovery as a Lessepsian migrant in the Mediterranean Sea may be an example . 
 = William Arnold ( settler ) = 
 William Arnold ( 24 June 1587 – c . 1676 ) was one of the founding settlers of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations , and with his sons was among the wealthiest people in the colony . He was raised and educated in England where he was the warden of St. Mary 's , the parish church of Ilchester in southeastern Somerset . In 1635 , along with family and associates , he immigrated to New England , where he initially settled in Hingham in the Massachusetts Bay Colony , but soon relocated to the new settlement of Providence with Roger Williams . He was one of the 13 original proprietors of Providence , appearing on the deed signed by Roger Williams in 1638 , and was one of the twelve founding members of the first Baptist church to be established in America . 
 After living in Providence for about two years , Arnold moved with his family and other relatives and associates to the north side of the Pawtuxet River forming a settlement commonly called Pawtuxet , later a part of Cranston , Rhode Island . He and his fellow settlers had serious disputes with their Warwick neighbors on the south side of the river and as a result separated themselves from the Providence government , putting themselves under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Bay Colony . This separation from Providence lasted for 16 years , and as the head of the settlement , Arnold was appointed as the keeper of the peace . He died sometime during the great turmoil of King Philip 's War in 1675 or 1676 . Arnold 's son , Benedict Arnold , succeeded Roger Williams as President of the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations in 1657 , and under the royal charter of 1663 became the first Governor of the colony . 
 Highly unusual for a 17th @-@ century American settler , Arnold began a family record based on entries from the local parish registers in England and brought this with him to New England ; this family record would eventually span more than 200 years and six generations . Nearly 300 years after his birth , a fabricated pedigree for Arnold was published , claiming his descent from 12th @-@ century kings living in Wales . Three and a half decades later , in 1915 , his correct ancestry was published , but not before the misinformation had been printed in an important source for Rhode Island genealogy . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Ilchester , Somerset , England on 24 June 1587 , William Arnold was the son of Nicholas Arnold ( c . 1550 – 1623 ) by his first wife Alice Gully ( 1553 – 1596 ) . In about 1610 he married Christian Peak who was baptized 15 February 1584 , the daughter of Thomas Peak of Muchelney , Somerset , a village about six miles ( 10 km ) west of Ilchester . 
 Arnold 's parents lived in the small village of Northover , located across the River Yeo ( also known as the River Ivel ) from the town of Ilchester . Nicholas was a tailor , and the mention of his occupation in his will and the vital records of some of his family members suggests that he was prominent in his work , and likely a member of the Tailor 's Guild , which carried professional and political clout in its day . As he advanced in his profession , and after the baptism of his oldest daughter Thomasine in 1572 , Nicholas moved with his small family from Northover across the river to the much larger town of Ilchester where he became well established in his trade , and where the remainder of his children were born . 
 Arnold 's mother , Alice Gully , was the daughter of John Gully ( c . 1508 – 1559 ) and his wife Alice ( c . 1510 – 1583 ) of Northover . His mother died in 1596 shortly after child birth , when Arnold was eight years old , and he was thereafter largely raised and influenced by his sister Joanne who was ten years older than he . Though Joanne eventually married William Hopkins of Yeovilton and died at an early age in England , two of her children , Frances ( Hopkins ) Man and Thomas Hopkins , immigrated to New England with their Uncle William Arnold . 
 Arnold and his siblings were likely educated at the Free Grammar School associated with the parish church in Limington , slightly more than a mile to the east of Ilchester . This ancient school is where Thomas Wolsey was the curate and schoolmaster from 1500 to 1509 . Wolsey later became the Lord Cardinal and Primate of England . 
 Only two records for Arnold are known to exist while he still lived in England . The first of these was a transcript of baptisms , marriages and burials that he signed in 1622 as the warden of St. Mary 's , the parish church of Ilchester . These bishop 's transcripts , as they were called , were sent to the City of Wells , Somerset , a central repository for such records . The other record mentioning his name was the will of his father , Nicholas Arnold , dated 18 January 1623 . William Arnold was appointed by the will as overseer along with Ambrose Chappell , a friend of Nicholas . 
 There is no record of Arnold between 1623 and his sailing to New England in 1635 . He was an educated man , since he had to be able to read and write as the warden of his parish church , and appeared to have a secure relationship with his church and community . Unknown are his motives for emigrating from England and when he began planning to do so . For whatever reasons , his plan to leave England with his family and associates materialized in 1635 . 
 = = Voyage to New England = = 
 With members of his immediate family and other relatives and associates , Arnold gathered his group together with their baggage and supplies in the spring of 1635 and made the trip from Ilchester to Dartmouth on the coast of Devon . While the exact route of the travelers was not recorded , a probable path was through Yeovil , Crewkerne and Axminster to Exeter . From there the party likely turned south along the Devonshire coast traveling through Teignmouth and Torquay to the port city of Dartmouth . 
 Fred Arnold , in 1921 , provided a perspective of the group as they prepared to load their ship destined for the New World : " While their eyes rested upon these last scenes in the home land , the ... young people ... were perhaps thinking more of the village greens of Ilchester and Yeovil ... and their playmates from whom they were now separated ... while the older ones were more likely turning their thoughts toward the unknown sea with some doubts and misgivings <unk> , but yet with stout hearts and strong hopes facing the great adventure that lay before them in a new world . " 
 The ship carrying William Arnold and his group sailed from England to New England in 1635 , with some brief particulars of the voyage given by his son Benedict in the family record : " <unk> my father and his family Sett Sayle <unk> Dartmouth in Old England , the first of May , friday & c . Arrived In New England June <unk> Ano 1635 " The name of the ship on which this group sailed was not recorded , nor has it been identified since . Governor Winthrop recorded that in the six @-@ week period beginning 4 June 1635 , fifteen ships had arrived in the Massachusetts Bay area , but he gave the names of only two of them . The ship on which the Arnolds sailed was not the Plain Joan , as stated in some accounts , which vessel carried a Thomas Arnold from England to Virginia . There is no known record of any event that took place at sea , only the length of the trip . The journey to America was less than two months in duration and ended on William Arnold 's 48th birthday . 
 = = Settling Providence and Pawtuxet = = 
 Once in New England , Arnold joined a group of settlers from Hingham , Norfolk , England who were about to establish the new settlement of Hingham , in the Massachusetts Bay Colony . On 18 September 1635 the town of Hingham gave Arnold a 2 @-@ acre ( 8 @,@ 100 m2 ) house lot " lying in the Town Street . " 
 According to historian John Barry , William Arnold was banished from Hingham for reasons that were not religious , but the reason is not given , nor are any references . Years later , Arnold 's son , Benedict , recorded in the family record , " <unk> . We came to Providence to Dwell the 20th of April , 1636 @.@ per me <unk> Arnold . " The younger Arnold was using the place name of Providence loosely , since Providence had not yet been founded ; the Arnolds actually settled with Roger Williams at Seekonk near the western edge of the Plymouth Colony ( now Rehoboth , Massachusetts ) . That the Arnolds came here before arriving in Providence is borne out by a statement made by William Arnold in 1659 : " for as much that I was one that the very first day <unk> [ sic ] with some others upon the land of providence , and so laid out my money to buy and <unk> pay for it , ... " The settlers could not remain in Seekonk , because Plymouth would then be harangued by Massachusetts for harboring its fugitives . The Plymouth governor Edward Winslow , gently urged Williams to move with his fellow settlers across the Seekonk River into the lands of the Narragansetts . Most historians agree that it was about June 1636 when the small group of settlers moved across the river , and settled on the bank of the <unk> River at a place that Roger Williams soon named Providence . 
 Arnold became one of the 13 original proprietors of Providence , and his initials appear second on the " initial deed " signed by Roger Williams in 1638 , following the initials of his son Benedict 's future father @-@ in @-@ law , Stukeley Westcott . He was assigned a house lot on what was later North Main Street , but his stay in this part of Providence was short . About 1638 he , his wife and children , his son @-@ in @-@ law William Carpenter , his nephew Thomas Hopkins and a few associates and all their families moved four miles ( six km ) south to the Pawtuxet River , at the far southern edge of Williams 's Providence purchase . They settled at the ford where the Pequot Trail crossed the river , close to where the Warwick Avenue ( US Hwy 1A / Hwy 117 ) bridge later crossed the river in the town of Cranston . Here Arnold remained until the end of his life . Though in some deeds he continued to be called " of Providence " after his move to Pawtuxet , this was before a dividing line had been created between the two localities , and he physically resided at the location called Pawtuxet . 
 William Arnold had been important to his church in England , and Samuel Gorton , in his work Simplicity 's Defence ... , wrote that Arnold had been a great professor of religion in the west of England . Once in the New World , Arnold became one of the original 12 members to organize the First Baptist Church in Providence in 1638 . This church , founded by Roger Williams , was also the first Baptist church established in America . 
 Arnold had a good relationship with the native people , and in the words of Elisha Stephen Arnold , author of the family genealogy ( 1935 ) , " he felt for the Indians a conscientious kindliness and in his dealings with them was actuated by a sense of strictest justice . " Also , like Roger Williams , he made an effort to learn their language and acted as interpreter many times , being paid , in one instance , 26 shillings for his services . Being able to communicate with the Indians , he was able to buy large tracts of land from them , and soon he and his sons owned nearly 10 @,@ 000 acres ( 40 km2 ) . In 1650 he paid more than three and a half pounds and his son Benedict paid five pounds , the highest taxes paid in the colony , implying that the Arnold family was among the wealthiest , if not the wealthiest , families in the colony in terms of land holdings . 
 = = Difficulty with the Gortonites = = 
 In 1641 the Pawtuxet settlers complained to the Massachusetts authorities of their neighbors in Warwick , the Gortonites , so called , led by the Samuel Gorton mentioned earlier . Gorton had been causing disturbances for several years , and had already been evicted from several places for creating difficulties which centered around his religious beliefs , insubordination towards the magistrates , refusal to pay taxes , and his dealings with and treatment of the Indians . The Massachusetts authorities replied that they were unable to help because the Pawtuxet settlement fell under the jurisdiction of neither the Massachusetts Bay Colony nor the Plymouth Colony . As a result , in 1642 William Arnold and other Pawtuxet settlers subjected themselves to the Massachusetts government with Arnold appointed to keep the peace . This separation from Providence lasted for 16 years . 
 One of the primary reasons for the separation from Providence was dissension over admitting Samuel Gorton and his Warwick friends to equal rights in Providence . After being evicted from other places Gorton attempted to join in the Providence government , but the Pawtuxet settlers wanted no part of him or his followers . On a personal level , Gorton had bought from the Indians some of the same land that Arnold had bought four years earlier and attempted to seize the land . Another cause of dissatisfaction was Gorton 's treatment of the Indians . Having acquired the language of the Narragansett people , Arnold felt a strong affinity towards them , and in a long letter to Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts in 1648 he complained of the injustice shown them by Gorton and the other Warwick settlers . 
 So unhappy was Arnold with the conduct of the Gortonites that on 1 September 1651 he wrote to Massachusetts protesting Roger William 's proposed errand to England to seek a charter for the colony . In this letter he spoke in very uncomplimentary terms of the Warwick settlers saying " under the pretense of liberty of conscience about these parts there came to live all the scum and runaways of the country , which in time for want of better order may bring a heavy burden on the land . " Over time these sentiments dissipated ; following an appeal to the Massachusetts government , Gorton 's objectionable activities ceased , and he accepted Arnold 's ownership of disputed land . Being able to coexist with Gorton , in 1658 the Pawtuxet settlers expressed the desire to reunite with Providence , and upon their own motion it was done . 
 = = End of life = = 
 In the two decades following Pawtuxet 's reunification with Providence , William Arnold continued to reside in Pawtuxet being a party to several land transactions where he deeded away some of his properties . Here he lived in relative peace until July 1675 when King Philip 's War erupted into a major confrontation between the natives and the English settlers . Pawtuxet was not a safe place to be , but Arnold refused to go to his son Benedict 's house in Newport , nor would he go up to Providence . He was eventually persuaded to go to his son Stephen 's garrison house further up the Pawtuxet River . In December 1675 a detachment of Massachusetts troops led by General Josiah Winslow , en route to the " Great Swamp Fight " in Kingston , Rhode Island , stayed at this garrison house and was given provisions . 
 In January 1676 , after the Kingston fight , about 300 Indians attacked Pawtuxet , burning buildings on William Carpenter 's land , driving away livestock and killing two members of his family . The attacks continued , and by March the Indians had burned all the houses in Warwick and Pawtuxet , and most of them in Providence , scattering the residents to other localities . William Carpenter and Thomas Hopkins most likely went to Oyster Bay , Long Island where they had family . Where Stephen Arnold went with his family is not known , but William Arnold was probably not with him . He likely died that winter or spring , aged 88 , and was buried in a family plot with his wife and grandson William , son of Benedict . Confirmation of his death did not occur until 3 November 1677 when his son Benedict described himself as " eldest son and heir of William Arnold late of <unk> in the said Colony deceased . " 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 The genealogy of the early Arnold family has been pieced together from a number of historical documents , but two such documents were of enough significance to be published as entire articles in an early genealogical journal . The first of these was a family record created by William Arnold and brought to New England by him in 1635 . The second of these was a fabricated pedigree of Arnold 's lineage , showing descent from some early kings in Wales dating back to the 12th century . Both of these documents were published side @-@ by @-@ side in the New England Historical and Genealogical Register in October 1879 . 
 = = = The Arnold family record = = = 
 While events concerning the immediate families of many colonial immigrants to America were recorded in family Bibles , some of which exist to this day , what William Arnold did was highly unusual among those immigrating to the New World in the 17th century . As the warden of St. Mary 's Church in Ilchester , Arnold had access to the records of baptisms , marriages and burials that were kept in the parish register . As he contemplated immigrating with his family to New England , he recorded all the baptismal entries in the Ilchester parish register pertaining to his children and siblings . He then took the process a step further , crossing the River Ivel to the parish of Northover , where his parents had lived and where his oldest sister was baptized , recording pertinent information from that register as well , thus creating a personal family record . 
 This family document sailed with Arnold from England to the New World in 1635 , but the record did not end then . In later years Arnold 's son , Benedict , added his own notes and family events to the document , and then Benedict 's son Josiah Arnold added his family . The latest entries in the family record were made by the son of Josiah , Josiah Arnold Jr . This exceptional historical document , spanning a total of 223 years and six generations , began with the baptism of William Arnold 's mother Alice Gully in 1553 and ended with the death of Josiah Arnold III in 1776 . 
 What became of the document between 1776 and the mid @-@ 19th century is uncertain , but it eventually came into the possession of Mr. Patrick Anderson McEwen ( a descendant of Governor Benedict Arnold ) of Windsor , Ontario , Canada , from whom it passed to Isaac N. Arnold , president of the Chicago Historical Society . A copy was then made by Edwin Hubbard in 1878 , and ultimately published under his name the following year . ( It turns out that Isaac N. Arnold was descended from Thomas Arnold of Watertown , and thus not from William Arnold of Pawtuxet . ) As with any historical document , genealogists and historians wanted to know how reliable it was . Once the original parish registers were discovered by a researcher in 1902 , it was demonstrated that every entry in Arnold 's original document that could be corroborated with these parish records in England was correct and precise to the minutest detail . 
 = = = The false pedigree of the Arnold family = = = 
 Published in the same issue of the New England Historical and Genealogical Register with the Arnold family record was another article giving a lineage for William Arnold going back 16 generations . In 1870 the genealogist Horatio G. Somerby compiled this pedigree of the Arnold family for a client in New York based on his research in England . In this pedigree , William Arnold was shown to be a son of a Thomas Arnold and to descend from a 12th @-@ century King of <unk> ( in modern day Wales ) whose name was <unk> . Mr. Somerby 's manuscript was " compiled from Herald 's Visitations , Inquisitions Post Mortem , Subsidy rolls , Wills , Parish registers , and other original documents . " A few years after this pedigree was published , John O. Austin incorporated some of it into his Genealogical Dictionary of Rhode Island . 
 In 1902 , Edson S. Jones , a descendant of Thomas Arnold of Watertown and Providence mentioned earlier , visited England in search of records pertaining to his family . Thinking that Thomas Arnold was connected with William Arnold ( which , it turned out , he was not ) , he visited Northover and Ilchester , finding the original parish registers , as well as other important source documents . He discovered that every entry in the Arnold record that could be compared with entries in the parish registers matched perfectly . He also discovered that the Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family had serious discrepancies with original documents . As he checked the source documents from which Somerby supposedly compiled the pedigree , he found that some of the generations in the Somerby pedigree had been shuffled from the original documents , some members of the lineage came from unrelated families , and some place names seemed to have been totally made up . It had earlier been believed that a Thomas Arnold was the father of William Arnold , and Somerby stated that this Thomas Arnold came from a place called Northover near <unk> in County Dorset . No such place exists . The Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family published in 1879 was riddled with misinformation , and it had been accepted as fact for over three decades by even prominent genealogists such as John O. Austin . Fred Arnold wrote in 1921 , " The most regrettable feature in Somerby 's work is , that in the absence of any English record , known here to disprove it , so reliable a genealogist as Mr. John O. Austin was led to accept and use it in his dictionary , although neither give any record evidence . Very rarely has Mr. Austin accepted another 's statement , unless he has himself seen evidence to support it . " This fabricated research was not an isolated incident ; Mr. Somerby had also been implicated in other fraudulent research and was out to please his clients regardless of the veracity of his work . 
 = = = The correct ancestry and English home of William Arnold = = = 
 Edson Jones eventually published his findings on the Arnold family in 1915 , demonstrating the accuracy of the Arnold family record , and then carefully revealing each inconsistency and factual error found in Somerby 's pedigree . In 1921 , Fred Arnold summarized these findings and synthesized them into a coherent lineage of the Arnold family which is consistent with every known historical document , and presented his findings to the Rhode Island Historical Society . To summarize the work of both Edson Jones and Fred Arnold , William Arnold was the son of Nicholas Arnold of Northover and Ilchester in Somerset based on the Arnold family record and the Northover parish register . Arnold 's mother was Alice Gully , and her parents were John and Alice Gully based on the same two documents . These are the only known ancestors of William Arnold based on known historical records , and the parents of Nicholas Arnold have not been identified in any historical document . 
 The Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family indicated that the family had lived in many counties in both England and Wales . This was not the case ; the Arnolds and their associates all lived in a small area within southeastern Somerset . While in England William Arnold and his family lived in Ilchester . His parents had come from the village of Northover , scarcely one half mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) across the River Yeo to the north . When Arnold 's son Benedict mentioned his " Lemmington " farm in his will , he was referring to a New England property named after the village of Limington in old England ; this village is less than a mile and a half ( 2 @.@ 5 km ) east of Ilchester . A very short distance north of Limington across the River Yeo is the town of Yeovilton where William Hopkins , the husband of Arnold 's sister Joanne , lived . Six miles ( 10 km ) west of Ilchester is the village of Muchelney , the home of Arnold 's wife Christian Peak , and five miles ( 8 km ) south of Ilchester is Yeovil , the home of Stukeley Westcott , whose daughter Damaris married Arnold 's son Benedict , and who may have accompanied the Arnolds on their voyage to the New World . Thus , Arnold and all of his known kinsmen had lived within six miles ( 10 km ) of each other in southeastern Somerset . 
 = = Children = = 
 William and Christian Arnold had four children , all born in Ilchester , Somerset . The oldest child was Elizabeth ( 1611 – after 7 September 1685 ) who married William Carpenter ( c . 1610 – 1685 ) , the son of Richard Carpenter of Amesbury , Wiltshire , England ; the couple had eight children . William and Elizabeth Carpenter settled in Providence , and then followed her parents to the settlement of Pawtuxet , where they lived the remainder of their lives , except for a short time during King Philip 's War , when they were forced to flee to Long Island . 
 The second child and oldest son was Benedict ( 1615 – 1678 ) who married Damaris Westcott ( 1621 – after 1678 ) , the daughter of Stukeley and <unk> ( <unk> ) Westcott . They had nine children . Stukeley Westcott lived in Yeovil , five miles ( eight km ) south of Ilchester , where he was married and where Damaris was baptized . The <unk> may have sailed to New England with the Arnolds ; if not they likely sailed at about the same time . Benedict moved with his family from Pawtuxet to Newport in 1651 , and in 1657 succeeded Roger Williams as the President of the colony . When the royal charter arrived from England in 1663 , Benedict Arnold became the first Governor of the colony , and served as either president or governor for a total of 11 years . 
 The third child and youngest daughter , Joanna ( 1617 – after 11 February 1693 ) , married first Zachariah Rhodes ( c . 1603 – 1665 ) , and settled in Pawtuxet near Joanna 's brother Stephen . Following Zachariah 's death by drowning , Joanna married Samuel <unk> . She had eight children , all by her first husband , and became the ancestress of the Rhodes family of Rhode Island . 
 The fourth and youngest child of William and Christian Arnold was Stephen ( 1622 – 1699 ) who married Sarah Smith ( 1629 – 1713 ) , the daughter of Edward Smith of Rehoboth , Massachusetts . Stephen and Sarah had seven children . Stephen was either a Deputy to the General Assembly or colonial Assistant nearly every year for a period of three decades . He and his family settled in Pawtuxet near his father , and had a garrison house along the Pawtuxet River . Stephen was 13 years old when he sailed from England to the New World with his parents and relatives , and he was the last surviving member of that sailing party .

 Several descendants of William Arnold became prominent in either the military or the civil affairs of the United States . A great @-@ great grandson , named Benedict Arnold , became one of the great generals of the American Revolutionary War but was better known for his betrayal of the American revolutionary cause . Other well @-@ known descendants include U.S. Presidents George Herbert Walker Bush and George W. Bush ; Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry , American hero of the Great Lakes during the War of 1812 and his younger brother Commodore Matthew <unk> Perry who was sent across the Pacific in 1852 by President Millard Fillmore to open Japan to western trade ; and Stephen Arnold Douglas who debated Abraham Lincoln in 1858 while vying for the Illinois Senate seat and winning the contest , but later losing to Lincoln in the 1860 presidential race . Stephen A. Douglas descends from both sons of William Arnold . Rhode Island colonial Deputy Governor George Hazard is another descendant . The hall of fame rodeo cowboy and western artist Earl W. Bascom is also a noted descendant . A published line of descent from Arnold to U.S. President James A. Garfield was later disproven . 
 = Bart of Darkness = 
 " Bart of Darkness " is the first episode of The Simpsons ' sixth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 4 , 1994 . It was written by Dan McGrath , and directed by Jim Reardon . In the episode , Bart breaks his leg and becomes increasingly isolated in his room . He starts spying on the neighbors with a telescope and begins to suspect that Ned Flanders has murdered his wife . The episode was produced during the 1994 Northridge earthquake which delayed production by a month , and is largely a parody of the film Rear Window . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A heatwave in Springfield leads Bart and Lisa to persuade Homer into getting a swimming pool . To avoid months of persistence , he gives in instantly . Word soon spreads that the Simpsons have a pool and every child in the town comes to use the new facility . After being dared , Bart attempts an ambitious dive into the pool from the top of his treehouse , but gets distracted by Nelson , and falls and breaks his leg . This forces him to spend the rest of the summer wearing a cast and , unable to socialize with the other children , he retreats to his bedroom . His isolation slowly makes him more and more irritable and paranoid . Lisa loans Bart her telescope to entertain him . Soon , Bart hears a woman 's scream next door , and witnesses Ned Flanders burying something in his backyard and screaming " I 'm a murderer ! " He becomes convinced that Ned has murdered his wife Maude , and vows to reveal the truth . 
 Meanwhile , Lisa basks in the glow of her new popularity . However , Martin Prince gets a larger pool , and everyone abandons Lisa , leaving her inside the empty pool with no idea of how to get out . After Lisa apologizes to her brother for neglecting him , Bart asks Lisa to go and look for evidence of the murder while Ned is out of the house . When Ned returns early , Lisa becomes trapped in the Flanders house , eventually being cornered in the attic ; Bart painfully makes his way over there by himself , just in time to discover that Ned was actually storing an axe and not using it to threaten Lisa . Maude , as it turns out , is actually alive , and had gone to Bible Camp for the weekend , to learn to be more judgemental . The victim of Ned 's " murder " was merely her favorite plant , and the woman screaming actually came from Ned himself . Meanwhile , Martin 's swimming pool explodes after being full with too many kids , and everyone abandons him , although Nelson steals his bathing suit first . When the episode ends , Martin sadly sings " Summer Wind " to himself as he stands naked in the wreckage of his pool . 
 = = Production = = 
 Dan McGrath was chosen to pen the episode , while Jim Reardon directed . The episode was originally produced as the season finale of the fifth season , but was held over and aired as the premiere of the sixth . This was because , along with " Lisa 's Rival " , the episode was in production at the time of the Northridge earthquake of 1994 . The earthquake damaged much of the Film Roman building in which The Simpsons writing and animation staff worked , forcing them to move out for three months and continue production in a temporary building . David X. Cohen came in the weekend after the earthquake to see what had happened , and was told that " it was no more dangerous than it was before the earthquake , " as the building was " a ninety year old , decrepit shack . " The only staff members that came in expecting to work were future show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein . As a result , the staff was given a month more than they would usually have had to work on the episode , which Reardon described as " greatly benefiting " it . Having been a director on the series for five years before this episode , he believed that this " was closer to what [ he ] was trying to achieve as a director than [ he ] had done before . " He credited this to the extra time , and used it to insert little details , such as having Bart get stuck on the fabric of the chair he was in , and wearing his underwear instead of a swimsuit . 
 Many of the heat wave jokes at the start of the episode were based on past events of the crew 's lives . The sitting in front of the fridge @-@ freezer joke , came from McGrath , who had done a similar thing as a child . The Springfield Pool @-@ Mobile was based on a similar vehicle from David Mirkin 's childhood , where a truck with a " spinning cars " fairground ride on the back would often come around his neighborhood . Flanders ' feminine scream was performed by Tress MacNeille and not his regular voice actor Harry Shearer . Krusty 's mispronunciation of Ravi Shankar 's name was an ad @-@ lib , that Mirkin kept in after the editing process because he liked it so much . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title of the episode is a reference to the novella Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad . The third act of the episode is largely a pastiche of Alfred Hitchcock 's Rear Window . As in the film , a wheelchair @-@ using Bart witnesses an apparent murder through his telescope , with musical cues from the film also being used . James Stewart 's character L. B. " Jeff " Jefferies appears twice , caricatured as he looks in the film . Also , the pictures on the wall of Jeff 's room are a racing car accident and a plane , the same as in Rear Window . The barn building scene with the onlooking Amish man is a reference to Peter Weir 's film Witness . The Itchy & Scratchy episode 's title is a reference to The Planet of the Apes , with the mutants being a reference to the Star Trek episode " The Menagerie " , as well as Beneath the Planet of the Apes . Itchy 's sealing of Scratchy behind a brick wall alludes to Edgar Allan Poe 's short story The Cask of <unk> . At the end of the episode Martin sings Frank Sinatra 's " Summer Wind " . Springfield 's wax museum features models of The Beatles and the cast of M * A * S * H , and Bart plays <unk> on his own . The pool dance scene sees Lisa in a role like those of Esther Williams , while Bart 's play has similar elements of the works of Anton Chekhov . Dr. Hibbert is watching Jay Leno in his living room .

 For season six , Fox moved The Simpsons back to its original Sunday night time of 8 p.m. , having aired on Thursdays for the previous four seasons . It has remained in this slot ever since . In this original American broadcast , " Bart of Darkness " finished 44th in the ratings for the week of August 29 to September 4 , 1994 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 9 and an audience share of 17 % . The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 Mike Duffy praised the episode , stating it showed that The Simpsons was " just as strong and funny as it ever was . " Elaine Liner of the Corpus Christi Caller @-@ Times praised the writing as " crisp , hilarious and multi @-@ layered " , praising its many cultural references and noting the " biting commentary " of Maude Flanders ' line " I was at Bible camp learning to be more judgmental . " Later reviews shared these sentiments . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , called it a " fine episode " and found that the " eventual explanation for [ Flanders ' ] murderous behavior is hilarious . " Tim Knight called it " a terrific opener to the season . " 
 = Lettuce = 
 Lettuce ( Lactuca sativa ) is an annual plant of the daisy family Asteraceae . It is most often grown as a leaf vegetable , but sometimes for its stem and seeds . Lettuce was first cultivated by the ancient Egyptians who turned it from a weed , whose seeds were used to produce oil , into a food plant grown for its succulent leaves , in addition to its oil @-@ rich seeds . Lettuce spread to the Greeks and Romans , the latter of whom gave it the name lactuca , from which the English lettuce is ultimately derived . By 50 AD , multiple types were described , and lettuce appeared often in medieval writings , including several herbals . The 16th through 18th centuries saw the development of many varieties in Europe , and by the mid @-@ 18th century cultivars were described that can still be found in gardens . Europe and North America originally dominated the market for lettuce , but by the late 20th century the consumption of lettuce had spread throughout the world . 
 Generally grown as a hardy annual , lettuce is easily cultivated , although it requires relatively low temperatures to prevent it from flowering quickly . It can be plagued with numerous nutrient deficiencies , as well as insect and mammal pests and fungal and bacterial diseases . L. sativa crosses easily within the species and with some other species within the Lactuca genus ; although this trait can be a problem to home gardeners who attempt to save seeds , biologists have used it to broaden the gene pool of cultivated lettuce varieties . World production of lettuce and chicory for calendar year 2010 stood at 23 @,@ 620 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 23 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 long tons ; 26 @,@ 040 @,@ 000 short tons ) , over half of which came from China . 
 Lettuce is most often used for salads , although it is also seen in other kinds of food , such as soups , sandwiches and wraps ; it can also be grilled . One variety , the <unk> ( <unk> ) , or asparagus lettuce , is grown for its stems , which are eaten either raw or cooked . Lettuce is a rich source of vitamin K and vitamin A , and is a moderate source of folate and iron . Contaminated lettuce is often a source of bacterial , viral and parasitic outbreaks in humans , including E. coli and Salmonella . In addition to its main use as a leafy green , it has also gathered religious and medicinal significance over centuries of human consumption . 
 = = Taxonomy and etymology = = 
 Lactuca sativa is a member of the Lactuca ( lettuce ) genus and the Asteraceae ( sunflower or aster ) family . The species was first described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus in the second volume of his Species Plantarum . Synonyms for L. sativa include Lactuca scariola var. sativa , L. scariola var. <unk> and L. scariola var. integrifolia . L. scariola is itself a synonym for L. serriola , the common wild or prickly lettuce . L. sativa also has many identified taxonomic groups , subspecies and varieties , which delineate the various cultivar groups of domesticated lettuce . Lettuce is closely related to several Lactuca species from southwest Asia ; the closest relationship is to L. serriola , an aggressive weed common in temperate and subtropical zones in much of the world . 
 The Romans referred to lettuce as lactuca ( lac meaning milk in Latin ) , an allusion to the white substance , now called latex , exuded by cut stems . This word has become the genus name , while sativa ( meaning " sown " or " cultivated " ) was added to create the species name . The current word lettuce , originally from Middle English , came from the Old French <unk> or <unk> , which derived from the Roman name . The name romaine came from that type 's use in the Roman papal gardens , while cos , another term for romaine lettuce , came from the earliest European seeds of the type from the Greek island of Cos , a center of lettuce farming in the Byzantine period . 
 = = Description = = 
 Lettuce 's native range spreads from the Mediterranean to Siberia , although it has been transported to almost all areas of the world . Plants generally have a height and spread of 6 to 12 inches ( 15 to 30 cm ) . The leaves are colorful , mainly in the green and red color spectrums , with some variegated varieties . There are also a few varieties with yellow , gold or blue @-@ teal leaves . Lettuces have a wide range of shapes and textures , from the dense heads of the iceberg type to the notched , scalloped , frilly or <unk> leaves of leaf varieties . Lettuce plants have a root system that includes a main taproot and smaller secondary roots . Some varieties , especially those found in the United States and Western Europe , have long , narrow taproots and a small set of secondary roots . Longer taproots and more extensive secondary systems are found in varieties from Asia . 
 Depending on the variety and time of year , lettuce generally lives 65 – 130 days from planting to harvesting . Because lettuce that flowers ( through the process known as " bolting " ) becomes bitter and <unk> , plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity . Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures , while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves . Once plants move past the edible stage , they develop flower stalks up to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) high with small yellow blossoms . Like other members of the tribe <unk> , lettuce inflorescences ( also known as flower heads or <unk> ) are composed of multiple florets , each with a modified calyx called a pappus ( which becomes the feathery " parachute " of the fruit ) , a corolla of five petals fused into a <unk> or strap , and the reproductive parts . These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and bipartite stigma . As the anthers shed pollen , the style elongates to allow the stigmas , now coated with pollen , to emerge from the tube . The ovaries form compressed , obovate ( teardrop @-@ shaped ) dry fruits that do not open at maturity , measuring 3 to 4 mm long . The fruits have 5 – 7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs . The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure . Each fruit contains one seed , which can be white , yellow , gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce . 
 The domestication of lettuce over the centuries has resulted in several changes through selective breeding : delayed bolting , larger seeds , larger leaves and heads , better taste and texture , a lower latex content , and different leaf shapes and colors . Work in these areas continues through the present day . Scientific research into the genetic modification of lettuce is ongoing , with over 85 field trials taking place between 1992 and 2005 in the European Union and United States to test modifications allowing greater herbicide tolerance , greater resistance to insects and fungi and slower bolting patterns . However , genetically modified lettuce is not currently used in commercial agriculture . 
 = = History = = 
 Lettuce was first cultivated in ancient Egypt for the production of oil from its seeds . This plant was probably selectively bred by the Egyptians into a plant grown for its edible leaves , with evidence of its cultivation appearing as early as <unk> BC . Lettuce was considered a sacred plant of the reproduction god Min , and it was carried during his festivals and placed near his images . The plant was thought to help the god " perform the sexual act <unk> . " Its use in religious ceremonies resulted in the creation of many images in tombs and wall paintings . The cultivated variety appears to have been about 30 inches ( 76 cm ) tall and resembled a large version of the modern romaine lettuce . These upright lettuces were developed by the Egyptians and passed to the Greeks , who in turn shared them with the Romans . Circa 50 AD , Roman agriculturalist Columella described several lettuce varieties – some of which may have been ancestors of today 's lettuces . 
 Lettuce appears in many medieval writings , especially as a medicinal herb . Hildegard of Bingen mentioned it in her writings on medicinal herbs between 1098 and 1179 , and many early herbals also describe its uses . In 1586 , Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces – head lettuce , loose @-@ leaf lettuce , and romaine ( or cos ) lettuce . Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century . Between the late 16th century and the early 18th century , many varieties were developed in Europe , particularly Holland . Books published in the mid @-@ 18th and early 19th centuries describe several varieties found in gardens today . 
 Due to its short lifespan after harvest , lettuce was originally sold relatively close to where it was grown . The early 20th century saw the development of new packing , storage and shipping technologies that improved the lifespan and <unk> of lettuce and resulted in a significant increase in availability . During the 1950s , lettuce production was revolutionized with the development of vacuum cooling , which allowed field cooling and packing of lettuce , replacing the previously used method of ice @-@ cooling in packing houses outside the fields . 
 Lettuce is very easy to grow , and as such has been a significant source of sales for many seed companies . Tracing the history of many varieties is complicated by the practice of many companies , particularly in the US , of changing a variety 's name from year to year . This was done for several reasons , the most prominent being to boost sales by promoting a " new " variety or to prevent customers from knowing that the variety had been developed by a competing seed company . Documentation from the late 19th century shows between 65 and 140 distinct varieties of lettuce , depending on the amount of variation allowed between types – a distinct difference from the 1 @,@ 100 named lettuce varieties on the market at the time . Names also often changed significantly from country to country . Although most lettuce grown today is used as a vegetable , a minor amount is used in the production of tobacco @-@ free cigarettes ; however , domestic lettuce 's wild relatives produce a leaf that visually more closely resembles tobacco . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 A hardy annual , some varieties of lettuce can be overwintered even in relatively cold climates under a layer of straw , and older , heirloom varieties are often grown in cold frames . Lettuces meant for the cutting of individual leaves are generally planted straight into the garden in thick rows . Heading varieties of lettuces are commonly started in flats , then transplanted to individual spots , usually 8 to 14 inches ( 20 to 36 cm ) apart , in the garden after developing several leaves . Lettuce spaced further apart receives more sunlight , which improves color and nutrient quantities in the leaves . Pale to white lettuce , such as the centers in some iceberg lettuce , contain few nutrients . 
 Lettuce grows best in full sun in loose , nitrogen @-@ rich soils with a pH of between 6 @.@ 0 and 6 @.@ 8 . Heat generally prompts lettuce to bolt , with most varieties growing poorly above 75 ° F ( 24 ° C ) ; cool temperatures prompt better performance , with 60 to 65 ° F ( 16 to 18 ° C ) being preferred and as low as 45 ° F ( 7 ° C ) being tolerated . Plants in hot areas that are provided partial shade during the hottest part of the day will bolt more slowly . Temperatures above 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) will generally result in poor or non @-@ existent germination of lettuce seeds . After harvest , lettuce lasts the longest when kept at 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) and 96 percent humidity . Lettuce quickly degrades when stored with fruit such as apples , pears and bananas that release the ripening agent ethylene gas . The high water content of lettuce ( 94 @.@ 9 percent ) creates problems when attempting to preserve the plant – it cannot be successfully frozen , canned or dried and must be eaten fresh . 
 Lettuce varieties will cross with each other , making spacing of 5 to 20 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) between varieties necessary to prevent contamination when saving seeds . Lettuce will also cross with Lactuca serriola ( wild lettuce ) , with the resulting seeds often producing a plant with tough , bitter leaves . <unk> , a lettuce variety grown primarily in Asia for its stems , crosses easily with lettuces grown for their leaves . This propensity for crossing , however , has led to breeding programs using closely related species in Lactuca , such as L. serriola , L. saligna , and L. virosa , to broaden the available gene pool . Starting in the 1990s , such programs began to include more distantly related species such as L. tatarica . Seeds keep best when stored in cool conditions , and , unless stored cryogenically , remain viable the longest when stored at − 4 ° F ( − 20 ° C ) ; they are relatively short lived in storage . At room temperature , lettuce seeds remain viable for only a few months . However , when newly harvested lettuce seed is stored cryogenically , this life increases to a half @-@ life of 500 years for vaporized nitrogen and 3 @,@ 400 years for liquid nitrogen ; this advantage is lost if seeds are not frozen promptly after harvesting . 
 = = = Cultivars = = = 
 There are several types of lettuce , but three ( leaf , head and cos or romaine ) are the most common . There are seven main cultivar groups of lettuce , each including many varieties : 
 Leaf – Also known as looseleaf , cutting or bunching lettuce , this type has loosely bunched leaves and is the most widely planted . It is used mainly for salads . 
 Romaine / Cos – Used mainly for salads and sandwiches , this type forms long , upright heads . This is the most often used lettuce in Caesar salads . 
 Iceberg / <unk> - the most popular type in the US , it is very heat @-@ sensitive and was originally adapted for growth in the northern US . It ships well , but is low in flavor and nutritional content , being composed of even more water than other lettuce types . 
 <unk> – Also known as Boston or Bibb lettuce , this type is a head lettuce with a loose arrangement of leaves , known for its sweet flavor and tender texture . 
 <unk> – Also called Batavian or French crisp , this lettuce is midway between the crisphead and leaf types . These lettuces tend to be larger , bolt @-@ resistant and well @-@ flavored . 
 Stem – This type is grown for its <unk> , rather than its leaves , and is used in Asian cooking , primarily Chinese , as well as stewed and creamed dishes . 
 <unk> – This type is grown for its seeds , which are pressed to extract an oil mainly used for cooking . It has few leaves , bolts quickly and produces seeds around 50 percent larger than other types of lettuce . 
 The <unk> and crisphead types are sometimes known together as " cabbage " lettuce , because their heads are shorter , flatter , and more cabbage @-@ like than romaine lettuces . 
 = = = Cultivation problems = = = 
 Soil nutrient deficiencies can cause a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants to a lack of head growth . Many insects are attracted to lettuce , including cutworms , which cut seedlings off at the soil line ; wireworms and nematodes , which cause yellow , stunted plants ; tarnished plant bugs and aphids , which cause yellow , distorted leaves ; leafhoppers , which cause stunted growth and pale leaves ; thrips , which turn leaves gray @-@ green or silver ; <unk> , which create tunnels within the leaves ; flea beetles , which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars , slugs and snails , which cut large holes in leaves . Mammals , including rabbits and groundhogs , also eat the plants . Lettuce contains several defensive compounds , including sesquiterpene lactones , and other natural phenolics such as <unk> and glycosides , which help to protect it against pests . Certain varieties contain more than others , and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance . 
 Lettuce also suffers from several viral diseases , including big vein , which causes yellow , distorted leaves , and mosaic virus , which is spread by aphids and causes stunted plant growth and deformed leaves . Aster yellows are a disease @-@ causing bacteria carried by leafhoppers , which causes deformed leaves . Fungal diseases include powdery mildew and downy mildew , which cause leaves to mold and die and bottom rot , lettuce drop and gray mold , which cause entire plants to rot and collapse . <unk> lettuce tends to attract pests and diseases . Weeds can also be an issue , as cultivated lettuce is generally not competitive with them , especially when directly seeded into the ground . <unk> lettuce ( started in flats and later moved to growing beds ) is generally more competitive initially , but can still be crowded later in the season , causing misshapen lettuce and lower yields . Weeds also act as homes for insects and disease and can make harvesting more difficult . <unk> are often used to control weeds in commercial production . However , this has led to the development of herbicide @-@ resistant weeds and prompted environmental and health concerns . 
 = = Production = = 
 Lettuce is the only member of the Lactuca genus to be grown commercially . The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) reports that world production of lettuce and chicory ( the two crops are combined by the FAO for reporting purposes ) for calendar year 2010 was 23 @,@ 622 @,@ 366 metric tons ( 23 @,@ 249 @,@ 287 long tons ; 26 @,@ 039 @,@ 201 short tons ) . This came primarily from China ( 53 percent ) , the US ( 17 percent ) and India ( 4 percent ) . Although China is the top world producer of lettuce , the majority of the crop is consumed domestically . Spain is the world 's largest exporter of lettuce , with the US ranking second . 
 Western Europe and North America were the original major markets for large @-@ scale lettuce production . By the late 1900s , Asia , South America , Australia and Africa became more substantial markets . Different locations tended to prefer different types of lettuce , with <unk> prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain , romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt . By the late 20th century , the preferred types began to change , with crisphead , especially iceberg , lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe . In the US , no one type predominated until the early 20th century , when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity . After the 1940s , with the development of iceberg lettuce , 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce . By the end of the century , other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production . Stem lettuce was first developed in China , and remains primarily cultivated in that country . 
 Lettuce production methods , including all of the processes from growing to sales , have become much larger in scale during the 20th century . The majority of agricultural production is done with the application of large amounts of chemicals , including fertilizers and pesticides , but organic production makes up a growing percentage of the market – a trend that began with small growers but moved to a more industrial scale . More non @-@ heading types , mostly leaf and romaine lettuces , are also being grown . In the first years of the 21st century , bagged salad products began to hold a growing portion of the lettuce market , especially in the US . Processed from what was previously waste lettuce not considered acceptable for the fresh market , these products are packaged in a manner that makes them last longer than standard head lettuce after harvest . As of 2007 , 70 percent of the lettuce production in the US came from California ; in that country it ranks third in produce consumption behind tomatoes and oranges . 
 = = Culinary use = = 
 As described around 50 AD , lettuce leaves were often cooked and served by the Romans with an oil @-@ and @-@ vinegar dressing ; however , smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw . During the 81 – 96 AD reign of Domitian , the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began . Post @-@ Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce , mainly with large romaine types , as well as the method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves . Today , the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves , although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds , which are made into an oil . Most lettuce is used in salads , either alone or with other greens , vegetables , meats and cheeses . Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads , with a dressing that includes anchovies and eggs . Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups , sandwiches and wraps , while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked . The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries , due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves . In that country , " salads " were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold . Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries , contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes , soups and stir @-@ frys plain or with other vegetables . Stem lettuce , widely consumed in China , is eaten either raw or cooked , the latter primarily in soups and stir @-@ frys . Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup . 
 = = Nutritional content = = 
 Depending on the variety , lettuce is an excellent source ( 20 % of the Daily Value , DV , or higher ) of vitamin K ( 97 % DV ) and vitamin A ( 21 % DV ) ( table ) , with higher concentrations of the <unk> A compound , beta @-@ carotene , found in darker green lettuces , such as Romaine . With the exception of the iceberg variety , lettuce is also a good source ( 10 @-@ 19 % DV ) of folate and iron ( table ) . 
 = = Food @-@ borne illness = = 
 Food @-@ borne pathogens that can survive on lettuce include Listeria monocytogenes , the causative agent of listeriosis , which multiplies in storage . However , despite high levels of bacteria being found on ready @-@ to @-@ eat lettuce products , a 2008 study found no incidences of food @-@ borne illness related to listeriosis , possibly due to the product 's short shelf life , indigenous microflora competing with the Listeria bacteria or inhibition of bacteria to cause listeriosis . 
 Other bacteria found on lettuce include Aeromonas species , which have not been linked to any outbreaks ; Campylobacter species , which cause campylobacteriosis ; and Yersinia intermedia and Yersinia <unk> ( species of Yersinia ) , which have been found mainly in lettuce . Lettuce has been linked to numerous outbreaks of the bacteria E. coli O157 : H7 and Shigella ; the plants were most likely contaminated through contact with animal feces . A 2007 study determined that the vacuum cooling method , especially prevalent in the California lettuce industry , increased the uptake and survival rates of E. coli O157 : H7 . Salmonella bacteria , including the uncommon Salmonella <unk> type , have also caused outbreaks traced to contaminated lettuce . Viruses , including hepatitis A , <unk> and a Norwalk @-@ like strain , have been found in lettuce . The vegetable has also been linked to outbreaks of parasitic infestations , including Giardia <unk> . 
 = = Religious and medicinal lore = = 
 In addition to its usual purpose as an edible leafy vegetable , lettuce has had a number of uses in ancient ( and even some more modern ) times as a medicinal herb and religious symbol . For example , ancient Egyptians thought lettuce to be a symbol of sexual prowess and a promoter of love and childbearing in women . The Romans likewise claimed that it increased sexual potency . In contrast , the ancient Greeks connected the plant with male impotency , and served it during funerals ( probably due to its role in the myth of Adonis ' death ) , and British women in the 19th century believed it would cause infertility and sterility . Lettuce has mild narcotic properties ; it was called " <unk> " by the Anglo @-@ Saxons because of this attribute , although the cultivated L. sativa has lower levels of the narcotic than its wild cousins . This narcotic effect is a property of two sesquiterpene lactones which are found in the white liquid ( latex ) in the stems of lettuce , called <unk> or " lettuce opium " . 
 Lettuce is also eaten as part of the Jewish Passover Seder , where it is considered the optimal choice for use as the bitter herb , which is eaten together with the matzah . 
 Some American settlers claimed that smallpox could be prevented through the ingestion of lettuce , and an Iranian belief suggested consumption of the seeds when afflicted with typhoid . Folk medicine has also claimed it as a treatment for pain , rheumatism , tension and nervousness , coughs and insanity ; scientific evidence of these benefits in humans has not been found . The religious ties of lettuce continue into the present day among the Yazidi people of northern Iraq , who have a religious prohibition against eating the plant .

 = Borscht = 
 Borscht is a tart soup popular in several East European cuisines , including Ukrainian , Russian , Polish , Belarusian , Lithuanian , Romanian and Ashkenazi Jewish . The variety most commonly associated with the name in English is of Ukrainian origin and includes beetroots as one of the main ingredients , which gives the dish a distinctive red color . It shares the name , however , with a wide selection of sour @-@ tasting soups without beetroots , such as sorrel @-@ based green borscht , rye @-@ based white borscht , cabbage borscht , etc . 
 Borscht derives from an ancient soup originally cooked from pickled stems , leaves and umbels of common hogweed , a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows , which lent the dish its Slavic name . With time , it evolved into a diverse array of tart soups , among which the beet @-@ based red borscht has become the most popular . It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables , which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage , carrots , onions , potatoes and tomatoes . Depending on the recipe , borscht may include meat or fish , or be purely vegetarian ; it may be served either hot or cold ; and it may range from a hearty one @-@ pot meal to a dainty clear broth or a smooth refreshing drink . It is often served with smetana or sour cream , hard @-@ boiled eggs and / or potatoes , but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes , such as uszka or pampushky , that can be served with the soup . 
 Its popularity has spread throughout Eastern Europe and the former Russian Empire , and – by way of migration – to other continents . In North America , borscht is often linked with either Jews or Mennonites , the groups who first brought it there from Europe . Today , several ethnic groups claim borscht , in its variegated local guises , as their own national dish and consume it as part of ritual meals within Eastern Orthodox , Greek Catholic , Roman Catholic , and Jewish religious traditions . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The English word borscht , also spelled borsch , borsht , or bortsch , comes from Yiddish <unk> ( borsht ) . The latter derives from the word <unk> ( borshch ) , which is common to East Slavic languages , such as Ukrainian or Russian . Together with cognates in other Slavic languages , it comes from Proto @-@ Slavic * <unk> ' hogweed ' and ultimately from Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European * <unk> ̥ <unk> < * <unk> / <unk> ' point , stubble ' . Common hogweed ( Heracleum sphondylium ) was the soup 's principal ingredient before it was replaced with other vegetables , notably beetroot . The beetroot borscht was invented in what is now Ukraine and first popularized in North America by Yiddish @-@ speaking Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe . 
 = = Ingredients and preparation = = 
 Typical Ukrainian borscht is traditionally made from meat and / or bone stock , sautéed vegetables , and beet sour , that is , fermented beetroot juice . Depending on the recipe , some of these components may be omitted or substituted . 
 The stock is typically made by boiling meat , bones , or both . Beef , pork or a combination of both are most commonly used , with brisket , ribs , shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results , especially if cooked on a high flame . Marrow bones are considered best for the bone stock . Meat stock is usually cooked for about two hours , whereas bone stock takes four to six hours to prepare . Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10 – 15 minutes before the borscht is done . Some recipes call for smoked meats , resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht , while others use poultry or mutton stock . Fasting varieties are typically made with fish stock to avoid the use of meat , while purely vegetarian recipes often substitute the stock with forest mushroom broth . 
 The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots , white cabbage , carrots , parsley root , potatoes , onions and tomatoes . Some recipes may also call for beans , tart apples , turnip , celeriac , zucchini or bell peppers . Parsnip may be used as a substitute for parsley root , and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes . The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to <unk> the vegetables – by sautéing , braising , boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock . This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven ( traditional masonry stove , used for both cooking and heating ) , wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time . The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language , where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form <unk> rather than borshch . Vegetables are usually julienned , except for potatoes and zucchini , which are diced . The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables . Onions , carrots , parsley root , turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed ( traditionally in animal fat , especially lard or butter ) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste . Dry beans are boiled separately . Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the <unk> vegetables are added . 
 The dominant tastes in borscht are sweet and sour . This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour . It is made by covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm <unk> water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into <unk> ( which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency ) , mannitol , acetic acid and lactic acid . Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process , but usually omitted in Jewish recipes , as chametz ( leavened bread ) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals . Sugar , salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor . After about 2 – 5 days ( or 2 – 3 weeks without the bread ) , the deep red , sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use . It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done , as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate . The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as <unk> ( literally ' sour , acid ' ; compare kvass ) and in Yiddish as <unk> ( from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water ; compare Russian <unk> ' pickle juice ' , Polish <unk> ' broth ' ) . Apart from its employment in borscht , it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade . 
 As the traditional method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning at least several days ahead , many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice , while the sour taste is imparted by other ingredients , such as vinegar , lemon juice or citric acid , tomatoes , tart apples , dry red wine , dill pickle juice , sauerkraut juice , fermented rye flour and water mixture , etc . The soup is typically flavored with a wide selection of herbs , spices and condiments . Salt , black pepper , garlic , bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used . Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice , celery stalks , parsley , marjoram , hot peppers , saffron , horseradish , ginger and prunes . Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht . A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it . 
 = = Varieties = = 
 As the home country of beetroot borscht , Ukraine boasts great diversity of the soup 's regional variants , with virtually every district having its own recipe . Differences between particular varieties may regard the type of stock used ( meat , bone , or both ) , the kind of meat ( beef , pork , poultry , etc . ) , the choice of vegetables and the method of cutting and cooking them . For example , although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork , the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef , while in the Poltava region , the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat , that is , chicken , duck or goose . The use of zucchini , beans and apples is characteristic of the Chernihiv borscht ; in this variant , beetroots are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard , and the sour taste comes solely from tomatoes and tart apples . The Lviv borscht is based on bone stock and is served with chunks of Vienna sausages . 
 Many regional recipes for borscht have also developed in Russian cuisine . Examples include the Moscow borscht , served with pieces of beef , ham and Vienna sausages ; Siberian borscht with meatballs ; and Pskov borscht with dried smelt from the local lakes . Other unique Russian variants include a monastic Lenten borscht with marinated kelp instead of cabbage and the Russian Navy borscht ( <unk> borshch ) , the defining characteristic of which is that the vegetables are cut into square or diamond @-@ shaped chunks rather than julienned . 
 As well as the thick <unk> described above , Polish cuisine offers a ruby @-@ colored beetroot bouillon known as barszcz <unk> <unk> , or clear red borscht . It is made by combining strained meat @-@ and @-@ vegetable stock with wild mushroom broth and beet sour . In some versions , smoked meat may be used for the stock and the tartness may be obtained or enhanced by adding lemon juice , dill pickle brine , or dry red wine . It may be served either in a soup bowl or – especially at dinner parties – as a hot beverage in a twin @-@ handled cup , with a croquette or a filled pastry on the side . Unlike other types of borscht , it is not whitened with sour cream . <unk> <unk> , or Christmas Eve borscht , is a variant of the clear borscht that is traditionally served during the Polish Christmas Eve supper . In this version , meat stock is either omitted or replaced with fish broth , usually made by boiling the heads cut off from fish used in other Christmas Eve dishes . The mushrooms used for cooking the mushroom broth are reserved for uszka ( small filled dumplings ) , which are then served with the borscht . 
 In the summertime , cold borscht is a popular , refreshing alternative to the aforementioned variants , which are normally served hot . It consists of beet sour or beet juice blended with sour cream , buttermilk , soured milk , kefir and / or yogurt , and is refrigerated . The mixture has a distinctive pink or magenta color . It is typically served over finely chopped beetroot , cucumbers , radishes and green onion , together with halves of a hard @-@ boiled egg and sprinkled with fresh dill . Chopped veal , ham , or crawfish tails may be added as well . This soup probably originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , which comprised the territories of modern @-@ day Lithuania and Belarus , and it is still part of the culinary traditions of these and neighboring nations . The Lithuanian language is the only one in the region which actually refers to it as ' cold borscht ' ( <unk> ) . In Belarusian it is known simply as <unk> , or ' cold soup ' ; in Polish as <unk> litewski , or ' Lithuanian cold soup ' ; and in Russian as <unk> , or ' beetroot soup ' . 
 Ashkenazi Jews living in Eastern Europe adopted beetroot borscht from their Slavic neighbors and adapted it to their taste and religious requirements . As combining meat with milk is proscribed by kosher dietary laws , Jews have developed two variants of the soup : meat ( <unk> ) and dairy ( <unk> ) . The meat variant is typically made from beef brisket ( pork is never used ) and cabbage , while the dairy one is vegetarian , blended with sour cream or a mixture of milk and egg yolks . Both variants typically contain beetroots and onions , and are flavored with beet sour , vinegar or citric acid for tartness and beet sugar for sweetness . Galician Jews traditionally liked their borscht particularly sweet . Jewish borscht may be served either hot or cold , typically with a hot boiled potato on the side . In prewar Eastern Europe it was traditionally put up to ferment around Purim so that it would be ready four weeks later for the Passover holiday .

 Although in the English language borscht refers almost invariably to a beet @-@ based soup , in some culinary cultures there exist soups with the same or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional . The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour @-@ tasting ingredients . 
 Green borscht ( <unk> borshch ) , a light soup made from leaf vegetables , is an example common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines . The naturally tart @-@ tasting sorrel is most commonly used , but spinach , chard , nettle , garden orache and occasionally dandelion , <unk> or ramsons , may be added as well , especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed . Like beetroot borscht , it is based on meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard @-@ boiled eggs , sprinkled with dill . There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots . 
 In Polish cuisine , white borscht ( barszcz biały , also known as żur or <unk> , ' sour soup ' ) is made from a fermented mixture of rye flour or oatmeal and water . It is typically flavored with garlic and marjoram , and served over eggs and boiled fresh sausage ; the water in which the sausage was boiled is often used instead of meat stock . In the Carpathian Mountains of southern Poland , variants of borscht are also made in which the tart taste comes from fermented milk products , such as whey or buttermilk . Although the deep red color of beetroot borscht may remind those unfamiliar with Polish cuisine of blood , the kind of borscht that does contain animal ( usually poultry ) blood mixed with vinegar is dark brownish @-@ gray in color and aptly called " gray borscht " ( barszcz <unk> ) , which is a regional name of the Polish blood soup better known as <unk> . 
 In Romanian and Moldovan cuisines , a mixture of wheat bran or cornmeal with water that has been left to ferment , similar to that used in Polish white borscht , is called borș . It is used to impart a sour taste to a variety of tangy Romanian soups , known as either also borș or ciorbă . Variants include ciorbă de <unk> ( with meatballs ) , ciorbă de <unk> ( with tripe ) , borş de <unk> ( with fish ) and borş de <unk> <unk> ( with beetroots ) . 
 The Armenian version of borscht is a hot soup made with beef stock , green peppers and other vegetables , which may or may not include beetroots , and flavored with parsley and cilantro . In Chinese cuisine , a soup known as <unk> sòng <unk> , or " Russian soup " , is based on red cabbage and tomatoes , and lacks beetroots altogether ; also known as " Chinese borscht " , it originated in Harbin , close to the Russian border in northeast China . In ethnic Mennonite cuisine , borscht refers to a whole range of seasonal vegetable soups based on beef or chicken stock – from spring borscht made with spinach , sorrel and chard to summer borscht with cabbage , tomatoes , corn and squash to fall and winter borscht with cabbage , beets and potatoes .

 The diversity of borscht styles is matched by the wide choice of garnishes and side dishes with which various kinds of borscht may be served . 
 Most often , borscht is dished up with sour cream , the East European version of which , known as smetana , is <unk> than its American counterpart . The sour cream may be served in a separate pitcher for the diners to add the desired amount themselves or the borscht may come already " whitened " , that is , blended with sour cream . Sometimes the cream is thickened with flour before being added to the soup . Yogurt and a mixture of milk and yolks are possible substitutes . 
 Chopped herbs are often sprinkled on the surface of the soup ; dill is most common , but parsley , chives or scallion are often added as well . Individual helpings may be spiced up with minced hot peppers or garlic . Many kinds of borscht are served over halves or quarters of hard @-@ boiled chicken or quail eggs . Navy beans , broad beans or string beans are also a common addition . 
 Meat , removed from the stock on which the borscht was based , may be cut into smaller chunks and either added back into the soup or served on the side with horseradish or mustard . Bacon and sausages are also commonly used as borscht garnishes . Borscht based on bone stock may be served Old Polish style , with marrow from the bones . 
 Some kinds of the soup , such as Poltava borscht , may be served with <unk> , or thick noodles of wheat or buckwheat flour . Siberian borscht is eaten with boiled meatballs ( <unk> ) of minced beef and onion . In Poland and parts of western Ukraine , borscht is typically ladled over uszka , or bite @-@ sized ear @-@ shaped dumplings made from pasta dough wrapped around mushroom , buckwheat or meat filling . Mushroom @-@ filled uszka are particularly associated with Polish Christmas Eve borscht . 
 Borscht , like any other soup in East Slavic cuisines , is seldom eaten by itself , but rather accompanied by a side dish . At a minimum , spoonfuls of borscht are alternated with bites of a slice of bread . Buckwheat groats or boiled potatoes , often topped with pork <unk> , are other simple possibilities , but a range of more involved sides exists as well . 
 In Ukraine , borscht is often accompanied with pampushky , or savory , puffy yeast @-@ raised rolls glazed with oil and crushed garlic . In Russian cuisine , borscht may be served with any of assorted side dishes based on <unk> , or the East European variant of farmer cheese , such as <unk> , syrniki or <unk> . <unk> are baked round cheese @-@ filled tarts ; syrniki are small pancakes wherein the cheese is mixed into the batter ; and a <unk> is a casserole of buckwheat groats baked with cheese . 
 <unk> , or baked dumplings with fillings as for uszka , are another common side for both hearty and clear variants of borscht . Polish clear borscht may be also served with a croquette or paszteciki . A typical Polish croquette ( <unk> ) is made by wrapping a crêpe ( thin pancake ) around a filling and coating it in breadcrumbs before <unk> ; paszteciki ( literally , ' little pâtés ' ) are variously shaped filled hand @-@ held pastries of yeast @-@ raised or flaky dough . An even more exquisite way to serve borscht is with a coulibiac , or a large loaf @-@ shaped pie . Possible fillings for croquettes , paszteciki and <unk> include mushrooms , sauerkraut and minced meat . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 Borscht derives from a soup originally made by the Slavs from common hogweed ( Heracleum sphondylium , also known as cow parsnip ) , which lent the dish its Slavic name . Growing commonly in damp meadows throughout the north temperate zone , hogweed was used not only as fodder ( as its English names suggest ) , but also for human consumption – from Eastern Europe to Siberia , to northwestern North America . 
 The Slavs collected hogweed in May and used its roots for stewing with meat , while the stems , leaves and umbels were chopped , covered with water and left in a warm place to ferment . After a few days , lactic and alcoholic fermentation produced a mixture described as " something between beer and sauerkraut " . This concoction was then used for cooking a soup characterized by a mouth @-@ puckering sour taste and pungent smell . As the Polish ethnographer Łukasz <unk> wrote in 1830 , " Poles have been always partial to tart dishes , which are somewhat peculiar to their homeland and vital to their health . " 
 The earliest written reference to the Slavic hogweed soup can be found in <unk> ( Domestic Order ) , a 16th @-@ century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice . It recommends growing the plant " by the fence , around the whole garden , where the nettle grows " , to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to , " for the Lord 's sake , share it with those in need " . Simon <unk> ( Szymon <unk> ) , a 17th @-@ century Polish botanist , described " our Polish hogweed " as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland , Rus ' , Lithuania and Samogitia ( that is , most of the northern part of Eastern Europe ) , typically used for cooking a " tasty and graceful soup " with capon stock , eggs , sour cream and millet . More interested in the plant 's medicinal properties than its culinary use , he also recommended pickled hogweed juice as a cure for fever or hangover . 
 Hogweed borscht was mostly a poor man 's food . The soup 's humble beginnings are still reflected in Polish fixed expressions , where " cheap like borscht " is the equivalent of " dirt cheap " ( also attested as a calque in Yiddish and Canadian English ) , whereas adding " two mushrooms into borscht " is synonymous with excess . For the professors of the University of Kraków , who led a monastic way of life in the 17th century , hogweed borscht was a fasting dish which they ate regularly ( sometimes with deviled eggs ) from Lent till Rogation days . It was uncommon on the royal table , although according to the 16th @-@ century Polish botanist Marcin of Urzędów – citing Giovanni <unk> , a court physician to the Jagiellonian kings of Hungary – the Polish @-@ born King Vladislaus II used to have a Polish hogweed @-@ based dish prepared for him at his court in Buda . 
 = = = Diversification = = = 
 With time , other ingredients were added to the soup , eventually replacing hogweed altogether , and the names borshch or barszcz became generic terms for any sour @-@ tasting soup . In 19th @-@ century rural Poland , this term included soups made from barberries , currants , gooseberries , cranberries , celery or plums . 
 When describing the uses of common hogweed , John Gerard , a 17th @-@ century English botanist , observed that " the people of [ Poland ] and Lithuania use to make [ a ] drink with the decoction of this herb and leaven or some other thing made of meal , which is used instead of beer and other ordinary drink . " It may suggest that hogweed soup was on some occasions combined with a fermented mixture of water and barley flour , oatmeal or rye flour . Such soured , gelatinous flour @-@ and @-@ water mixture , originally known as kissel ( from the Proto @-@ Slavic root * <unk> , ' sour ' ) had been already mentioned in The Tale of <unk> Years , a 12th @-@ century chronicle of Kievan Rus ' , and continued to be a staple of Ukrainian and Russian cooking until the middle of the 19th century . In Poland , a soup based on diluted kissel became known as either żur ( from Middle High German sur ' sour ' ) or barszcz and later – to distinguish it from the red beetroot borscht – as barszcz biały ' white borscht ' . 
 The earliest known Polish recipes for borscht , written by chefs catering to Polish magnates ( aristocrats ) , are from the late 17th century . Stanisław <unk> , head chef to Prince Aleksander Michał Lubomirski , included several borscht recipes in his Compendium <unk> ( A Collection of Dishes ) , the first cookbook published originally in Polish , in 1682 . They include such sour soups as lemon borscht and " royal borscht " , the latter made from assorted dried , smoked or fresh fish and fermented rye bran . A manuscript recipe collection from the Radziwiłł family court , dating back to ca . 1686 , contains an instruction for making hogweed borscht mixed with poppy seeds or ground almonds . As this was a Lenten dish , it was garnished , in a trompe @-@ l 'œil fashion typical of Baroque cuisine , with mock eggs made from finely chopped pike that was partly dyed with saffron and formed into oval balls . An alternative recipe for the almond borscht replaced pickled hogweed with vinegar . 
 Borscht also evolved into a variety of sour soups to the east of Poland . Examples include onion borscht , a recipe for which was included in a 1905 Russian cookbook , and sorrel @-@ based green borscht , which is still a popular summer soup in Ukraine and Russia . A Gift to Young Housewives by Elena <unk> , the best @-@ selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century , first published in 1861 , contains nine recipes for borscht , some of which are based on kvass , a traditional Slavic fermented beverage made from rye bread . Kvass @-@ based variants were also known in Ukraine at that time ; some of them were types of green borscht , while others were similar to the Russian <unk> . 
 Before the advent of beet @-@ based borscht , cabbage borscht was of particular importance . Made from either fresh cabbage or sauerkraut , it could be indistinguishable from the Russian shchi . Indeed , the mid @-@ 19th @-@ century Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language defines borshch as " a kind of shchi " with beet sour added for tartness . The significance of cabbage as an essential ingredient of borscht is manifest in the Ukrainian proverb , " without bread , it 's no lunch ; without cabbage , it 's no borscht . "

 Beet ( Beta vulgaris ) , a plant native to the Mediterranean Basin , was already grown in antiquity . Only the leaves were of culinary use , as the tapered , tough , whitish and bitter @-@ tasting root was considered unfit for human consumption . It is likely that beet greens were used in variants of green borscht long before the invention of the beetroot @-@ based red borscht . Beet varieties with round , red , sweet taproots , known as beetroots , were not reliably reported until the 12th century and did not spread to Eastern Europe before the 16th century . Mikołaj Rej , a Polish Renaissance poet and moralist , included the earliest known Polish recipe for pickled beetroots in his 1568 book , Life of an Honest Man . It would later evolve into <unk> , or <unk> mit <unk> , a beet @-@ and @-@ horseradish relish popular in Polish and Jewish cuisines . Rej also recommended the " very tasty brine " left over from beetroot pickling , which was an early version of beet sour . The sour found some applications in Polish folk medicine as a cure for hangover and – mixed with honey – as a sore throat remedy . 
 It may never be known who first thought of using beet sour to flavor borscht , which also gave the soup its now @-@ familiar red color . Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie 's Polish @-@ German dictionary published in 1806 was the first to define barszcz as a tart soup made from pickled beetroots . The fact that certain 19th @-@ century Russian and Polish cookbooks , such as Handbook of the Experienced Russian Housewife ( 1842 ) by Yekaterina <unk> and The Lithuanian Cook ( 1854 ) by <unk> <unk> , refer to beetroot @-@ based borscht as " Little Russian borscht " ( where " Little Russian " is a term used at the time for ethnic Ukrainians under imperial Russian rule ) suggests that this innovation took place in what is now Ukraine , whose soils and climate are particularly well suited to beet cultivation . Ukrainian legends , probably of 19th @-@ century origin , attribute the invention of beetroot borscht either to Zaporozhian Cossacks , serving in the Polish army , on their way to break the siege of Vienna in 1683 , or to Don Cossacks , serving in the Russian army , while laying siege to Azov in 1695 . 
 Spanish conquistadors brought potatoes and tomatoes from the Americas to Europe in the 16th century , but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern Europe in the 19th century . Eventually , both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht . Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes , and tomatoes – fresh , canned or paste – took over from beet sour as the source of tartness . The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes , and even then , together with potatoes . In Ukraine , beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century .

 Over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries , borscht 's popularity spread beyond its Slavic homeland , largely due to such factors as territorial expansion of the Russian Empire , Russia 's growing political clout and cultural stature , and waves of emigration out of the country . As Russia grew to cover most of northern and central Eurasia , borscht was introduced to the cuisines of various peoples inhabiting the territories both within and adjacent to the empire , from Finland to the Caucasus and Iran , to Central Asia and China , and to Alaska ( Russian America ) . 
 Borscht 's westward expansion was less successful ; Germans used to scoff at the soup along with other East European fare . What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors , as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats , to employ celebrated French chefs , who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France . One of the first French chefs to do so was Marie @-@ Antoine Carême , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819 . In his take on borscht , the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant haute cuisine dish with an air of eastern exoticism . Apart from vegetables and beet sour , his recipe calls for a roast chicken , a fried chicken , a duck , a piece of veal , an <unk> , a marrow bone , one pound of bacon , and six large sausages , and suggests serving with beef quenelles , deviled eggs , and <unk> . Auguste Escoffier , Carême 's apprentice , who was mostly fascinated by the soup 's vivid ruby @-@ red color , simplified his master 's recipe , while also securing the place of potage bortsch ( " borscht soup " ) in French cuisine . Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts , presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup ; their cookbook , La cuisine classique , published in 1856 , contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name , potage au jus de <unk> à la polonaise ( " Polish @-@ style beet @-@ juice soup " ) , which had been changed to potage <unk> à la polonaise by the third edition in 1868 . In 1867 , beetroot borscht was served , along with herrings , sturgeon , coulibiac , Pozharsky cutlets and vinaigrette salad , at a Russian @-@ themed dinner at the International Exposition in Paris , strengthening its international association with Russian culture . 
 Mass migration from the Russian Empire to North America – initially <unk> by members of persecuted religious minorities – was instrumental in bringing borscht across the Atlantic . The earliest waves of migration occurred at a time when cabbage @-@ based borscht was still the dominant variant of the soup in at least parts of Russia . The Mennonites , who began arriving in Canada and the United States from Russia 's Volga region in the 1870s , still eschew beetroots in their borscht ; instead , Mennonite varieties include <unk> Borscht ( with cabbage or sauerkraut ) and Somma Borscht ( sorrel @-@ based " summer borscht " ) . According to the Jewish Encyclopedia published in 1906 , cabbage @-@ based <unk> borscht was also more popular than the beet @-@ based variant in American Jewish cuisine at the time . Subsequent Jewish immigration helped popularize the red borscht in America . 
 In the 1930s , when most American hotels refused to accept Jewish guests due to widespread anti @-@ Semitism , New York Jews began flocking to Jewish @-@ owned resorts in the Catskill Mountains for their summer vacations . The area grew into a major center of Jewish entertainment , with restaurants offering all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat Ashkenazi Jewish fare , including copious amounts of borscht . Grossinger 's , one of the largest resorts , served borscht throughout the day , every day of the year . The region became known , initially in derision , as the " Borscht Belt " , reinforcing the popular association between borscht and American Jewish culture . As most visitors arrived in the summertime , the borscht was typically served cold . Marc Gold was one of its largest suppliers , producing 1 @,@ 750 short tons ( 1 @,@ 590 t ) a year in his business 's heyday . Gold 's borscht consists of puréed beetroots seasoned with sugar , salt and citric acid ; it is usually blended with sour cream and served as a refreshing beverage , more aptly described as a " beet smoothie " . Such kind of " purplish , watery broth " is , according to Nikolai Burlakoff , author of The World of Russian Borsch , " associated in America with borsch , in general , and Jewish borsch in particular . " 
 In the Soviet Union , borscht was one of the most popular everyday dishes . It was described by James Meek , a British correspondent in Kiev and Moscow , as " the common denominator of the Soviet kitchen , the dish that tied together ... the high table of the Kremlin and the meanest canteen in the <unk> of the Urals , ... the beetroot soup that pumped like a main artery through the kitchens of the east Slav lands " . Among Soviet leaders , the Ukrainian @-@ born Leonid Brezhnev was especially partial to borscht , which his wife continued to personally cook for him even after they had moved into the Kremlin . 
 The soup has even played a role in the Soviet space program . In March 1961 , as part of a communications equipment test , a pre @-@ recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl @-@ Sputnik 4 spacecraft . The craft , carrying animals and a mannequin , had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights . Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and , later , Russian cosmonauts . Originally , a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes . All ingredients for the space borscht ( which include beef , beetroots , cabbage , potatoes , carrots , onions , parsley root and tomato paste ) were cooked separately , then combined one by one in strictly controlled order , sterilized , packed into tubes , sealed airtight and autoclaved . In the 1970s , the tubes were replaced with packages of <unk> freeze @-@ dried borscht with regular @-@ size bits of cooked vegetables .

 Borscht is often associated with its role in religious traditions of various denominations ( Eastern Orthodox , Greek and Roman Catholic , and Jewish ) that are common in Eastern Europe . In East Slavic countries , " memorial borscht " is served as the first course at a post @-@ funeral wake . According to a traditional belief , the soul of the departed either feeds on or is carried up to heaven by puffs of steam rising from bowls of borscht and other hot dishes , such as <unk> , porridge , boiled potatoes or freshly baked bread . In the region of Polesye , straddling the Belarusian @-@ Ukrainian border , the same steaming @-@ hot dishes , including borscht , are given as an offering to the souls of deceased ancestors during the annual semi @-@ pagan remembrance ceremony known as <unk> , or Forefathers ' Night . 
 In Poland and Ukraine , borscht is usually one of the dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner . Celebrated after the first star has appeared in the sky on December 25 ( Roman Catholic ) or January 6 ( Greek Catholic ) , it is a meal which is at the same time festive and fasting , a <unk> affair ( traditionally , with twelve distinct dishes ) that excludes ingredients of land @-@ animal origin . Christmas Eve borscht is , therefore , either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream . In Ukraine , the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard , as well as beans and mushrooms . It may be also thickened with wheat flour dry @-@ roasted in a pan instead of the usual roux . The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby @-@ red broth . Both Ukrainian and Polish variants are often served with uszka . 
 While Christmas in Poland is traditionally linked to red borscht , Lent – the fasting period that leads up to Easter – is associated with a meatless version of white borscht , or żur . Youths used to celebrate Holy Saturday , the last day of the fast , with a mock " funeral " of the white borscht , in which a pot of the soup was either buried in the ground or broken , sometimes – to the crowd 's amusement – while being carried by an unsuspecting boy on his head . On the next day , the white borscht would reappear on the Easter table , but this time , in its more coveted , meat @-@ based guise with sausage , bacon and eggs . 
 In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition , vegetarian borscht served with sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side , known as <unk> borsht , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period . As the holiday is observed in spring ( March or April ) , the preparation of Passover borscht used to provide an opportunity to use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter , remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season . Cold borscht blended with sour cream is also popular on Shavuot ( Feast of Weeks ) , a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods , observed in late May or early June . <unk> <unk> , or the third meal of the Shabbat , often includes borscht as well . 
 = = = As an ethnic dish = = = 
 Borscht is associated with and claimed by several ethnic groups , especially Ukrainians , Russians , Poles , Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews , as their own national or ethnic dish and cultural icon . Such claims are not necessarily mutually exclusive , as the soup 's history predates the emergence of modern nation states , with their ever @-@ shifting borders , in Eastern Europe . Borscht , in the words of Burlakoff , " is perfectly suited to a global culture . " He describes it as " a global phenomenon " , in which " local variants are so numerous and diverse that it is hard sometimes for a non @-@ specialist to grasp that any single example of it is something that is part of a unified tradition . " In his view , borscht " is an almost perfect example of ... ' <unk> ' – a phenomenon that is global in distribution but reflective of local needs and ways in its variants and adaptation ; ... a highly localized product that became globalized , and in the process adapted to conditions other than the original ones . " However , according to Irina <unk> , a Russian linguist and anthropologist , " people tend to be very <unk> about their food and proud of it . " A " connection between culinary and territorial claims " may be observed , which results in the culinary area turning into " a battlefield generating and proliferating all kinds of myths . " 
 In its currently most popular , beet @-@ based version , borscht most likely originated in what is now Ukraine . Borscht 's role as a staple of everyday Ukrainian diet is reflected in the Ukrainian saying , " borscht and porridge are our food " ( compare the equivalent Russian saying , where borscht is replaced with shchi ) . The hearty soup in which the beetroot is just one of sundry vegetables , as opposed to the typically Polish clear beet broth , is still known in Poland as " Ukrainian borscht " . 
 In the Soviet Union , government @-@ sponsored cookbooks , such as The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food curated by Anastas Mikoyan , Cookery and Directory of Recipes and Culinary Production , promoted a unified Soviet cuisine with standardized and nutritionally " rational " versions of traditional dishes . The same cooking techniques and recipes were taught in culinary vocational schools throughout the country , establishing a common cooking style in Soviet cafés and restaurants . Though inspired by the cuisines of the country 's various ethnic groups , many recipes were presented as part of an overall Soviet heritage , disassociated from their individual geographic origins . By many people both inside and outside the Soviet Union , borscht was increasingly seen not as an ethnic Ukrainian soup , but as a Soviet or – metonymically – Russian dish . This approach was criticized by William Pokhlebkin , a preeminent Russian food writer , who unequivocally described beet @-@ based borscht as one of the " dishes of Ukrainian cookery " which " have entered the menu of international cuisine " . " One could understand " , he wrote , " and forgive foreigners for calling borscht or <unk> Russian national dishes , but when it turns out that they gleaned the information from Soviet cookbooks or from restaurant menus , one is embarrassed for our authors and chefs , who popularize the national cuisines of our peoples [ that is , the ethnic groups of the Soviet Union ] with such ignorance . " 
 According to Meek , 
 Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead , yet <unk> lives on . Recipes , like birds , ignore political boundaries ... The faint outline of the Tsarist @-@ Soviet imperium still glimmers in the collective steam off bowls of beetroot and cabbage in meat stock , and the soft sound of dollops of sour cream slipping into soup , from the Black Sea to the Sea of Japan and , in emigration , from Brooklyn to Berlin .

 = Tony Benn = 
 Anthony Neil Wedgwood Benn ( 3 April 1925 – 14 March 2014 ) , originally known as Anthony Wedgwood Benn or Wedgie Benn , but later as Tony Benn , was a British politician who was a Member of Parliament ( MP ) for 47 years between the 1950 and 2001 general elections and a Cabinet minister in the Labour governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan in the 1960s and 1970s . Originally a " moderate " , he was identified as being on the party 's hard left from the early 1980s , and was widely seen as a key proponent of democratic socialism within the party . 
 Benn inherited a peerage on his father 's death ( as 2nd Viscount Stansgate ) , which prevented his continuing as an MP . He fought to remain in the House of Commons , and then campaigned for the ability to renounce the title , a campaign which succeeded with the Peerage Act 1963 . In the Labour Government of 1964 – 70 he served first as Postmaster General , where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower , and later as a " technocratic " Minister of Technology . 
 He served as Chairman of the Labour Party in 1971 – 72 while in opposition , and in the Labour Government of 1974 – 1979 , he returned to the Cabinet , initially as Secretary of State for Industry , before being made Secretary of State for Energy , retaining his post when James Callaghan replaced Wilson as Prime Minister . When the Labour Party was again in opposition through the 1980s , he emerged as a prominent figure on its left wing and the term " Bennite " came into currency as someone associated with radical left @-@ wing politics . 
 Benn was described as " one of the few UK politicians to have become more left @-@ wing after holding ministerial office . " After leaving Parliament , Benn was President of the Stop the War Coalition from 2001 until his death in 2014 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Benn was born in London on 3 April 1925 . Benn 's father William Wedgwood Benn was a Liberal Member of Parliament from 1906 who crossed the floor to the Labour Party in 1928 and was appointed Secretary of State for India by Ramsay MacDonald in 1929 , a position he held until 1931 . William Benn was elevated to the House of Lords with the title of Viscount Stansgate in 1942 – the new wartime coalition government was short of working Labour peers in the upper house . In 1945 – 46 , William Benn was the Secretary of State for Air in the first majority Labour Government . 
 Benn 's mother , Margaret Wedgwood Benn ( née Holmes , 1897 – 1991 ) , was a theologian , feminist and the founder President of the Congregational Federation . She was a member of the League of the Church Militant , which was the predecessor of the Movement for the Ordination of Women ; in 1925 , she was rebuked by Randall Davidson , the Archbishop of Canterbury , for advocating the ordination of women . His mother 's theology had a profound influence on Benn , as she taught him that the stories in the Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings , who had power , as the prophets taught righteousness . 
 Benn asserted that the teachings of Jesus Christ had a " radical political importance " on his life , and made a distinction between the historical Jesus as " a carpenter of Nazareth " who advocated social justice and egalitarianism and " the way in which he 's presented by some religious authorities ; by popes , archbishops and bishops who present Jesus as justification for their power " , believing this to be a gross misunderstanding of the role of Jesus . He believed that it was a " great mistake " to assume that the teachings of Christianity are outdated in modern Britain , and Higgins wrote in The Benn Inheritance that Benn was " a socialist whose political commitment owes much more to the teaching of Jesus than the writing of Marx " . Later in his life , Benn emphasised issues regarding morality and righteousness , as well as various ethical principles of Nonconformism . " I 've never thought we can understand the world we lived in unless we understood the history of the church " , Benn said to the Catholic Herald . " All political freedoms were won , first of all , through religious freedom . Some of the arguments about the control of the media today , which are very big arguments , are the arguments that would have been fought in the religious wars . You have the satellites coming in now — well , it is the multinational church all over again . That 's why Mrs Thatcher pulled Britain out of UNESCO : she was not prepared , any more than Ronald Reagan was , to be part of an organisation that talked about a New World Information Order , people speaking to each other without the help of Murdoch or Maxwell . " According to Peter Wilby in the New Statesman , Benn " decided to do without the paraphernalia and doctrine of organised religion but not without the teachings of Jesus " . Although Benn became more agnostic as he became older , Benn was intrigued by the interconnections between Christianity , radicalism and socialism . Wilby also wrote in The Guardian that although former Chancellor Stafford Cripps described Benn as " as keen a Christian as I am myself " , Benn wrote in 2005 that he was " a Christian agnostic " who believed " in Jesus the prophet , not Christ the king " , specifically rejecting the label of " humanist " . 
 Both of Benn 's grandfathers were Liberal MPs ; his paternal grandfather was John Benn , a successful politician , MP for Tower Hamlets and later Devonport , who was created a baronet in 1914 ( and who founded a publishing company , Benn Brothers ) , and his maternal grandfather was Daniel Holmes , MP for Glasgow Govan . Benn 's contact with leading politicians of the day dates back to his earliest years ; he met Ramsay MacDonald when he was five , whom he described as : " A kindly old gentleman [ who ] leaned over me and offered me a chocolate biscuit . I 've looked at Labour leaders in a funny way ever since . " Benn also met David Lloyd George when he was 12 and later recalled that , while still a boy , he once shook hands with Mahatma Gandhi . This was in 1931 , while his father was Secretary of State for India . 
 In the Second World War , Benn joined and trained with the Home Guard from the age of 16 , later recalling ( 2009 ) in a speech : " I could use a bayonet , a rifle , a revolver , and if I 'd seen a German officer having a meal I 'd have tossed a grenade through the window . Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist ? " 
 In July 1943 , Benn enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman 2nd Class . His father and elder brother Michael ( who was later killed in an accident ) were already serving in the RAF . He was granted an emergency commission as a pilot officer ( on probation ) on 10 March 1945 . As a pilot officer , Benn served as a pilot in South Africa and Rhodesia . He relinquished his commission with effect from 10 August 1945 , three months after the European Second World War ended on 8 May , and just days before the war with Japan ended on 2 September . 
 Benn attended Westminster School and studied at New College , Oxford , where he read Philosophy , Politics and Economics and was elected President of the Oxford Union in 1947 . In later life , Benn removed public references to his private education from Who 's Who ; in 1970 all references to Westminster School were removed ; in the 1975 edition his entry stated " Education — still in progress " . In the 1976 edition , almost all details were omitted save for his name , jobs as a Member of Parliament and as a Government Minister , and address ; the publishers confirmed that Benn had sent back the draft entry with everything else struck through . In the 1977 edition , Benn 's entry disappeared entirely , and when he returned to Who 's Who in 1983 , he was listed as " Tony Benn " and all references to his education or service record were removed . 
 In 1972 , Benn said in his diaries that " Today I had the idea that I would resign my Privy <unk> , my MA and all my honorary doctorates in order to strip myself of what the world had to offer " . While he acknowledged that he " might be ridiculed " for doing so , Benn said that " But ' Wedgie Benn ' and ' the Rt Honourable Anthony Wedgwood Benn ' and all that stuff is impossible . I have been Tony Benn in Bristol for a long time . " In October 1973 he announced on BBC Radio that he wished to be known as Mr. Tony Benn rather than Anthony Wedgwood Benn , and his book Speeches from 1974 is credited to " Tony Benn " . Despite this name change , social historian Alwyn W. Turner writes that " Just as those with an agenda to pursue still call Muhammed Ali by his original name ... so most newspapers continued to refer to Tony Benn as Wedgwood Benn , or Wedgie in the case of the tabloids , for years to come ( some older Tories were still doing so three decades later ) . " 
 Benn met Caroline Middleton DeCamp ( born 13 October 1926 , Cincinnati , Ohio , United States ) over tea at Worcester College , Oxford , in 1949 and nine days later he proposed to her on a park bench in the city . Later , he bought the bench from Oxford City Council and installed it in the garden of their home in Holland Park . Tony and Caroline had four children – Stephen , Hilary , Melissa , a feminist writer , and Joshua – and ten grandchildren . Caroline Benn died of cancer on 22 November 2000 , aged 74 , after a career as an educationalist . 
 Two of Benn 's children have been active in Labour Party politics . His first son , Stephen , was an elected Member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1986 to 1990 . His second son , Hilary , was a councillor in London , and stood for Parliament in 1983 and 1987 , becoming the Labour MP for Leeds Central in 1999 . He was Secretary of State for International Development from 2003 to 2007 , and then Secretary of State for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs until 2010 , serving as Shadow Foreign Secretary ( 2015 – 16 ) . This makes him the third generation of his family to have been a member of the Cabinet , a rare distinction for a modern political family in Britain . Benn 's granddaughter Emily Benn was the Labour Party 's youngest @-@ ever candidate when she failed to win East Worthing and Shoreham in 2010 . Benn was a first cousin once removed of the actress Margaret Rutherford . 
 He became a vegetarian in 1970 , for ethical reasons , and remained so for the rest of his life .

 Following the Second World War Benn worked briefly as a BBC Radio producer . On 1 November 1950 , he was selected to succeed Stafford Cripps as the Labour candidate for Bristol South East , after Cripps stood down because of ill @-@ health . He won the seat in a by @-@ election on 30 November 1950 . Anthony Crosland helped him get the seat as he was the MP for nearby South Gloucestershire at the time . Upon taking the oath on 4 December 1950 Benn became " Baby of the House " , the youngest MP , for one day , being succeeded by Thomas Teevan , who was two years younger but took his oath a day later . He became the " Baby " again in 1951 , when Teevan was not re @-@ elected . In the 1950s , Benn held middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road or soft left views , and was not associated with the young left wing group around Aneurin Bevan . 
 Benn as Bristol South East MP helped organise the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott against the colour bar of the Bristol Omnibus Company against employing Black British and British Asian drivers . Benn said that he would " stay off the buses , even if I have to find a bike " , and Labour leader Harold Wilson also told an anti @-@ apartheid rally in London he was " glad that so many Bristolians are supporting the [ boycott ] campaign " , adding that he " wish [ ed ] them every success " . 
 = = = Peerage reform = = = 
 Benn 's father had been created Viscount Stansgate in 1942 when Winston Churchill increased the number of Labour peers to aid political work in the House of Lords ; at this time , Benn 's elder brother Michael was intending to enter the priesthood and had no objections to inheriting a peerage . However , Michael was later killed in an accident while on active service in the Second World War , and this left Benn as the heir to the peerage . He made several unsuccessful attempts to renounce the succession . 
 In November 1960 , Lord Stansgate died . Benn automatically became a peer , preventing him from sitting in the House of Commons . The Speaker of the Commons , Sir Harry Hylton @-@ Foster , did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by @-@ election was being called . Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage , Benn fought to retain his seat in a by @-@ election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961 . Although he was disqualified from taking his seat , he was re @-@ elected . An election court found that the voters were fully aware that Benn was disqualified , and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner @-@ up , Malcolm St Clair , who was at the time also the heir presumptive to a peerage . 
 Benn continued his campaign outside Parliament . Within two years , though , the Conservative Government of the time , which had members in the same or similar situation to Benn 's ( i.e. , who were going to receive title , or who had already applied for writs of summons ) , changed the law . The Peerage Act 1963 , allowing lifetime disclaimer of peerages , became law shortly after 6 pm on 31 July 1963 . Benn was the first peer to renounce his title , doing so at 6 @.@ 22 pm that day . St Clair , fulfilling a promise he had made at the time of his election , then accepted the office of Steward of the Manor of <unk> , disqualifying himself from the House ( outright resignation not being possible ) . Benn returned to the Commons after winning a by @-@ election on 20 August 1963 . 
 = = In government , 1964 – 70 = = 
 In the 1964 Government of Harold Wilson , Benn was Postmaster General , where he oversaw the opening of the Post Office Tower , then the UK 's tallest building , and the creations of the Post Bus service and <unk> . He proposed issuing stamps without the Sovereign 's head , but this met with private opposition from the Queen . Instead , the portrait was reduced to a small profile in silhouette , a format that is still used on commemorative <unk> 
 Benn also led the government 's opposition to the " pirate " radio stations broadcasting from international waters , which he was aware would be an unpopular measure . Some of these stations were causing problems , such as interference to emergency radio used by shipping , although he was not responsible for introducing the Marine Broadcasting Offences Bill when it came before Parliament at the end of July 1966 for its first reading . 
 Earlier in the month , Benn was promoted to Minister of Technology , which included responsibility for the development of Concorde and the formation of International Computers Ltd ( ICL ) . The period also saw government involvement in industrial rationalisation , and the merger of several car companies to form British Leyland . Following Conservative MP Enoch Powell 's 1968 " Rivers of Blood " speech to a Conservative Association meeting , in opposition to Harold Wilson 's insistence on not " stirring up the Powell issue " , Benn said during the 1970 general election campaign : 
 The flag of racialism which has been hoisted in Wolverhampton is beginning to look like the one that fluttered 25 years ago over Dachau and Belsen . If we do not speak up now against the filthy and obscene racialist propaganda ... the forces of hatred will mark up their first success and mobilise their first offensive . ... 
 Enoch Powell has emerged as the real leader of the Conservative Party . He is a far stronger character than Mr. Heath . He speaks his mind ; Heath does not . The final proof of Powell 's power is that Heath dare not attack him publicly , even when he says things things that disgust decent Conservatives . 
 The mainstream press attacked Benn for using language deemed as intemperate as Powell 's language in his " Rivers of Blood " speech ( which was widely regarded as racist ) , and Benn noted in his diary that " letters began pouring in on the Powell speech : 2 : 1 against me but some very sympathetic ones saying that my speech was overdue " . Harold Wilson later reprimanded Benn for this speech , accusing him of losing Labour seats in the 1970 general election . 
 Labour lost the 1970 election to Edward Heath 's Conservatives and upon Heath 's application to join the European Economic Community , a surge in left @-@ wing <unk> emerged . Benn " was stridently against membership " , and campaigned in favour of a referendum on the UK 's membership . The Shadow Cabinet voted to support a referendum on 29 March 1972 , and as a result Roy Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader of the Labour Party . 
 = = In government , 1974 – 79 = = 
 In the Labour Government of 1974 Benn was Secretary of State for Industry and as such increased nationalised industry pay , provided better terms and conditions for workers such as the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and was involved in setting up worker cooperatives in firms which were struggling , the best known being at Meriden , outside Coventry , producing Triumph Motorcycles . In 1975 he was appointed Secretary of State for Energy , immediately following his unsuccessful campaign for a " No " vote in the referendum on the UK 's continued membership of the European Community ( Common Market ) . Later in his diary ( 25 October 1977 ) Benn wrote that he " loathed " the EEC ; he claimed it was " bureaucratic and centralised " and " of course it is really dominated by Germany . All the Common Market countries except the UK have been occupied by Germany , and they have this mixed feeling of hatred and subservience towards the Germans " . 
 Upon the death of Mao Zedong in 1976 , Benn described Mao as " one of the greatest – if not the greatest – figures of the twentieth century : a schoolteacher who transformed China , released it from civil war and foreign attack and constructed a new society there " in his diaries , adding that " he certainly towers above any twentieth @-@ century figure I can think of in his philosophical contribution and military genius " . On his trip to the Chinese embassy after Mao 's death , Benn recorded in an earlier volume of his diaries that he was " a great admirer of Mao " , while also admitting that " he made mistakes , because everybody does " . 
 Harold Wilson resigned as Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in March 1976 . Benn later attributed the collapse of the Wilson government to cuts enforced on the UK by global capital , in particular the International Monetary Fund . In the resulting leadership contest Benn came in fourth out of the six cabinet ministers who stood — he withdrew as 11 @.@ 8 % of colleagues voted for him in the first ballot . Benn withdrew from the second ballot and supported Michael Foot ; James Callaghan eventually won . Despite not receiving his support in the second and third rounds of the vote , Callaghan kept Benn on as Energy Secretary . In 1976 there was a sterling crisis , and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund . Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state , Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under Ramsay MacDonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers . As he highlighted , these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald and his allies formed a National Government with Conservatives and Liberals . Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward the Alternative Economic Strategy , which consisted of a self @-@ sufficient economy less dependent on low @-@ rate fresh borrowing , but the AES , which according to opponents would have led to a " siege economy " , was rejected by the Cabinet . In response , Benn later recalled that : " I retorted that their policy was a siege economy , only they had the bankers inside the castle with all our supporters left outside , whereas my policy would have our supporters in the castle with the bankers outside . " Benn blamed the Winter of Discontent on these cuts to socialist policies . 
 = = = Move to the left = = = 
 By the end of the 1970s , Benn had migrated to the left wing of the Labour Party . He attributed this political shift to his experience as a Cabinet Minister in the 1964 – 1970 Labour Government . Benn ascribed his move to the left to four lessons : 
 How " the Civil Service can frustrate the policies and decisions of popularly elected governments " ; 
 The centralised nature of the Labour Party which allowed the Leader to run " the Party almost as if it were his personal kingdom " 
 " The power of industrialists and bankers to get their way by use of the crudest form of economic pressure , even blackmail , against a Labour Government " ; and 
 The power of the media , which " like the power of the medieval Church , ensures that events of the day are always presented from the point of the view of those who enjoy economic privilege . 
 As regards the power of industrialists and bankers , Benn remarked : 
 Compared to this , the pressure brought to bear in industrial disputes by the unions is minuscule . This power was revealed even more clearly in 1976 when the International Monetary Fund secured cuts in our public expenditure . ... These [ four ] lessons led me to the conclusion that the UK is only superficially governed by MPs and the voters who elect them . Parliamentary democracy is , in truth , little more than a means of securing a periodical change in the management team , which is then allowed to preside over a system that remains in essence intact . If the British people were ever to ask themselves what power they truly enjoyed under our political system they would be amazed to discover how little it is , and some new Chartist agitation might be born and might quickly gather momentum . 
 Benn 's philosophy consisted of a form of syndicalism , state planning where necessary to ensure national competitiveness , greater democracy in the structures of the Labour Party and observance of Party Conference decisions . Alongside an alleged twelve Labour MPs , he spent twelve years affiliated with the Institute for Workers ' Control , beginning in 1971 when he visited the Upper Clyde Shipyards , arguing in 1975 for the " labour movement to intensify its discussion about industrial democracy " . 
 He was vilified by most of the press while his opponents implied and stated that a Benn @-@ led Labour Government would implement a type of Eastern European socialism , with Edward Heath referring to Benn as " Commissar Benn " and others referring to Benn as a " Bollinger Bolshevik " . Despite this , Benn was overwhelmingly popular with Labour activists in the constituencies : a survey of delegates at the Labour Party Conference in 1978 found that by large margins they supported Benn for the leadership , as well as many Bennite policies . 
 He publicly supported Sinn Féin and the unification of Ireland , although in 2005 he suggested to Sinn Féin leaders that it abandon its long @-@ standing policy of not taking seats at Westminster ( abstentionism ) . Sinn Féin in turn argued that to do so would recognise Britain 's claim over Northern Ireland , and the Sinn Féin constitution prevented its elected members from taking their seats in any British @-@ created institution . A supporter of the Scottish Parliament and political devolution , Benn however opposed the Scottish National Party and Scottish independence , saying : " I think nationalism is a mistake . And I am half Scots and feel it would divide me in half with a knife . The thought that my mother would suddenly be a foreigner would upset me very much . " 
 = = In opposition , 1979 – 97 = = 
 In a keynote speech to the Labour Party Conference of 1980 , shortly before the resignation of party leader James Callaghan and election of Michael Foot as successor , Benn outlined what he envisaged the next Labour Government would do . " Within days " , a Labour Government would gain powers to nationalise industries , control capital and implement industrial democracy ; " within weeks " , all powers from Brussels would be returned to Westminster , and the House of Lords would be abolished by creating one thousand new peers and then abolishing the peerage . Benn received tumultuous applause . On 25 January 1981 , Roy Jenkins , David Owen , Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers ( known collectively as the " Gang of Four " ) launched the Council for Social Democracy , which became the Social Democratic Party in March . The " Gang of Four " left the Labour Party because of what they perceived to be the influence of the Militant tendency and the Bennite " hard left " within the party . Benn was highly critical of the SDP , saying that " Britain has had SDP governments for the past 25 years . " 
 Benn stood against Denis Healey , the party 's incumbent deputy leader , triggering the 1981 Deputy Leadership election , disregarding an appeal from Michael Foot to either stand for the leadership or abstain from inflaming the party 's divisions . Benn defended his decision insisting that it was " not about personalities , but about policies . " Healey retained his position by a margin of barely 1 % . The decision of several soft left MPs , including Neil Kinnock , to abstain triggered the split of the Socialist Campaign Group from the left of the Tribune Group . After Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands in April 1982 , Benn argued that the dispute should be settled by the United Nations and that the British Government should not send a task force to recapture the islands . The task force was sent , and following the Falklands War , they were back in British control by mid @-@ June . In a debate in the Commons just after the Falklands were recaptured , Benn 's demand for " a full analysis of the costs in life , equipment and money in this tragic and unnecessary war " was rejected by Margaret Thatcher , who stated that " he would not enjoy the freedom of speech that he put to such excellent use unless people had been prepared to fight for it " . 
 For the 1983 election Benn 's Bristol South East constituency was abolished by boundary changes , and he lost to Michael Cocks in the selection of a candidate to stand in the new winnable seat of Bristol South . Rejecting offers from the new seat of Livingston in Scotland , Benn contested Bristol East , losing to the Conservative 's Jonathan Sayeed in June 1983 . 
 In a by @-@ election , Benn was elected as the MP for Chesterfield , the next Labour seat to fall vacant , after Eric Varley had left the Commons to head <unk> . On the day of the by @-@ election , 1 March 1984 , The Sun newspaper ran a hostile feature article , " Benn on the Couch " , which purported to be the opinions of an American psychiatrist . In the period since Benn 's defeat in Bristol , Michael Foot had stepped down after the general election ( which saw a return of only 209 Labour MPs ) and was succeeded in October of that year by Neil Kinnock . 
 Newly elected to a mining seat , Benn was a supporter of the 1984 – 85 UK miners ' strike , which was beginning when he returned to the Commons , and of his long @-@ standing friend , the National Union of Mineworkers leader Arthur Scargill . However , some miners considered Benn 's 1977 industry reforms to have caused problems during the strike ; firstly , that they led to huge wage differences and distrust between miners of different regions ; and secondly that the controversy over balloting miners for these reforms made it unclear as to whether a ballot was needed for a strike or whether it could be deemed as a " regional matter " in the same way that the 1977 reforms had been . Benn also spoke at a Militant tendency rally held in 1984 , saying : " The labour movement is not engaged in a personalised battle against individual cabinet ministers , nor do we seek to win public support by arguing that the crisis could be ended by the election of a new and more humane team of ministers who are better qualified to administer capitalism . We are working for a majority labour government , elected on a socialist programme , as decided by conference . " This guest appearance was considered one reason why Benn did not become a member of Labour 's Shadow Cabinet . 
 In June 1985 , three months after the miners admitted defeat and ended their strike , Benn introduced the Miners ' Amnesty ( General Pardon ) Bill into the Commons , which would have extended an amnesty to all miners imprisoned during the strike . This would have included two men convicted of murder ( later reduced to manslaughter ) for the killing of David Wilkie , a taxi driver driving a non @-@ striking miner to work in South Wales during the strike . 
 Benn stood for election as Party Leader in 1988 , against Neil Kinnock , following Labour 's third successive defeat in the 1987 general election , losing by a substantial margin , and received only about 11 % of the vote . In May 1989 he made an extended appearance on Channel 4 's late @-@ night discussion programme After Dark , alongside among others Lord Dacre and Miles Copeland . During the Gulf War , Benn visited Baghdad in order to try and persuade Saddam Hussein to release the hostages who had been captured . 
 Benn supported various LGBT social movements , which were then known as gay liberation ; Benn had voted in favour of decriminalisation in 1967 . Talking about Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act , a piece of anti @-@ gay legislation preventing the " promotion of homosexuality " , Benn said : 
 if the sense of the word " promote " can be read across from " describe " , every murder play promotes murder , every war play promotes war , every drama involving the eternal triangle promotes adultery ; and Mr. Richard Branson 's condom campaign promotes fornication . The House had better be very careful before it gives to judges , who come from a narrow section of society , the power to interpret " promote " . 
 Benn later voted for the repeal of Section 28 during the first term of Tony Blair 's New Labour Government , and voted in favour of equalising the age of consent . 
 In 1990 he proposed a " Margaret Thatcher ( Global Repeal ) Bill " , which he said " could go through both Houses in 24 hours . It would be easy to reverse the policies and replace the personalities — the process has begun — but the rotten values that have been propagated from the platform of political power in Britain during the past 10 years will be an infection — a virulent strain of right @-@ wing capitalist thinking which it will take time to overcome . " In 1991 , with Labour still in opposition and a general election due by June 1992 , he proposed the Commonwealth of Britain Bill , abolishing the monarchy in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a " democratic , federal and secular commonwealth " , a republic with a written constitution . It was read in Parliament a number of times until his retirement at the 2001 election , but never achieved a second reading . He presented an account of his proposal in Common Sense : A New Constitution for Britain . In 1992 , Tony Benn also received a Pipe Smoker of the Year award , claiming in his acceptance speech that " pipe smoking stopped you going to war " . 
 In 1991 , Benn reiterated his opposition to the European Commission and highlighted an alleged democratic deficit in the institution , saying : " Some people genuinely believe that we shall never get social justice from the British Government , but we shall get it from Jacques Delors . They believe that a good king is better than a bad Parliament . I have never taken that view . " This argument has also been used by many on the right @-@ wing Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party , such as Daniel Hannan MEP . Jonathan Freedland writes in The Guardian that " For [ Tony Benn ] , even benign rule by a monarch was worthless because the king 's whim could change and there 'd be nothing you could do about it . "

 In 1997 , the Labour Party under Tony Blair won the election . Despite later calling Labour under Tony Blair " the idea of a Conservative group who had taken over Labour " and saying " [ Blair ] set up a new political party , New Labour " , Benn 's political diaries Free at Last show that Benn was initially somewhat sympathetic to Blair , welcoming a change of government . Benn supported the introduction of the national minimum wage , and welcomed the progress towards peace and security in Northern Ireland ( particularly under Mo Mowlam ) . He was supportive of the extra public money given to public services in the New Labour years but believed it to be under the guise of privatisation . Overall , his concluding judgement on New Labour is highly critical ; he describes its evolution as a way of retaining office by abandoning socialism and distancing the party from the trade union movement , adopting a <unk> style of politics , overriding the concept of the collective ministerial responsibility by reducing the power of the Cabinet , eliminated any effective influence from the annual conference of the Labour Party and " hinged its foreign policy on support for one of the worst presidents in US history " . 
 Benn strongly objected to the " immoral " bombing of Iraq in December 1998 , saying : " Aren 't Arabs terrified ? Aren 't Iraqis terrified ? Don 't Arab and Iraqi women weep when their children die ? Does bombing strengthen their determination ? ... Every Member of Parliament tonight who votes for the government motion will be consciously and deliberately accepting the responsibility for the deaths of innocent people if the war begins , as I fear it will . " 
 Several months prior to his retirement , Benn was a signatory to a letter , alongside Niki Adams ( Legal Action for Women ) , Ian Macdonald QC , Gareth Peirce , and other legal professionals , that was published in The Guardian newspaper on 22 February 2001 " condemning " raids of more than 50 brothels in the central London area of Soho . At the time , a police spokesman said : " As far as we know , this is the biggest simultaneous crackdown on brothels and prostitution in this country in recent times " , the arrest of 28 people in an operation that involved around 110 police officers . The letter read : 
 In the name of " protecting " women from trafficking , about 40 women , including a woman from Iraq , were arrested , detained and in some cases summarily removed from Britain . If any of these women have been trafficked ... they deserve protection and resources , not punishment by expulsion . ... Having forced women into destitution , the government first criminalised those who begged . Now it is trying to use prostitution as a way to make deportation of the vulnerable more acceptable . We will not allow such injustice to go unchallenged .

 Benn did not stand at the 2001 general election , saying he was " leaving parliament in order to spend more time on politics . " Along with Edward Heath , Benn was permitted by the Speaker to continue using the House of Commons Library and Members ' refreshment facilities . Shortly after his retirement , he became the president of the Stop the War Coalition . He became a leading figure of the British opposition to the War in Afghanistan from 2001 and the Iraq War , and in February 2003 he travelled to Baghdad to meet Saddam Hussein . The interview was shown on British television . 
 He spoke against the war at the February 2003 protest in London organised by the Stop the War Coalition , with police saying it was the biggest ever demonstration in the UK with about 750 @,@ 000 marchers , and the organisers estimating nearly a million people participating . In February 2004 and 2008 , he was re @-@ elected President of the Stop the War Coalition . 
 He toured with a one @-@ man stage show and appeared a few times each year in a two @-@ man show with folk singer Roy Bailey . In 2003 , his show with Bailey was voted ' Best Live Act ' at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards . In 2002 he opened the " Left Field " stage at the Glastonbury Festival . He continued to speak at each subsequent festival ; attending one of his speeches was described as a " Glastonbury rite of passage " . In October 2003 , he was a guest of British Airways on the last scheduled Concorde flight from New York to London . In June 2005 , he was a panellist on a special edition of BBC One 's Question Time edited entirely by a school @-@ age film crew selected by a BBC competition . 
 On 21 June 2005 , Benn presented a programme on democracy as part of the Channel 5 series Big Ideas That Changed The World . He presented a left @-@ wing view of democracy as the means to pass power from the " wallet to the ballot " . He argued that traditional social democratic values were under threat in an increasingly globalised world in which powerful institutions such as the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the European Commission are unelected and unaccountable to those whose lives they affect daily . 
 On 27 September 2005 , Benn became ill while at the Labour Party Conference in Brighton and was taken by ambulance to the Royal Sussex County Hospital after being treated by paramedics at the Brighton Centre . Benn reportedly fell and struck his head . He was kept in hospital for observation and was described as being in a " comfortable condition " . He was subsequently fitted with an artificial pacemaker to help regulate his heartbeat . 
 In a list compiled by the magazine New Statesman in 2006 , he was voted twelfth in the list of " Heroes of our Time " . In September 2006 , Benn joined the " Time to Go " demonstration in Manchester the day before the start of the final Labour Party Conference with Tony Blair as Party Leader , with the aim of persuading the Labour Government to withdraw troops from Iraq , to refrain from attacking Iran and to reject replacing the Trident missile and submarines with a new system . He spoke to the demonstrators in the rally afterwards . In 2007 , he appeared in an extended segment in the Michael Moore film Sicko giving comments about democracy , social responsibility and health care , notably , " If we can find the money to kill people , we can find the money to help people . " 
 A poll by the BBC2 The Daily Politics programme in January 2007 selected Benn as the UK 's " Political Hero " with 38 % of the vote , beating Margaret Thatcher , who had 35 % , by 3 % . 
 In the 2007 Labour Party leadership election , Benn backed the left @-@ wing MP John McDonnell in his unsuccessful bid . In September 2007 , Benn called for the government to hold a referendum on the EU Reform Treaty . In October 2007 , at the age of 82 , and when it appeared that a general election was about to be held , Benn reportedly announced that he wanted to stand , having written to his local Kensington and Chelsea Constituency Labour Party offering himself as a prospective candidate for the seat held by the Conservative Malcolm Rifkind . However , there was no election in 2007 , and the constituency was subsequently abolished . 
 In early 2008 Benn appeared on Scottish singer @-@ songwriter Colin MacIntyre 's album The Water , reading a poem he had composed himself . In September 2008 , he appeared on the DVD release for the Doctor Who story The War Machines with a vignette discussing the Post Office Tower ; he became the second Labour politician , after Roy Hattersley to appear on a Doctor Who DVD . 
 Conservatives Daniel Hannan , Douglas Carswell and David Cameron praised Benn in 2008 . In their book The Plan , Carswell and Hannan write that " Historically , it was the left that sought to disperse power among the people . ... It was the cause of the Levellers and the Chartists and the Suffragettes , the cause of religious toleration and meritocracy , of the secret ballot and universal education " , adding : 
 These days , though , the radical cause should have different targets . The elites have altered in character and composition . The citizen is far less likely to be impacted by the decisions of dukes or bishops than by those of Nice or his local education authority . The employees of these and similar agencies are , today , the unaccountable crown office @-@ holders against whom earlier generations of radicals would have railed . Yet , with some exceptions – among whom , in a special place of honour , stands Tony Benn – few contemporary British leftists show any interest in dispersing power when doing so would mean challenging public sector monopolies . 
 Cameron also said in 2008 that , alongside George Orwell 's Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four , Benn 's Arguments for Democracy was " a very powerful book which makes the important point that we vest power in people who are elected , and that we can get rid of , rather than those we can 't " . 
 Benn was invited by Richard Branson and Peter Gabriel to join The Elders , an advocacy group comprising Nelson Mandela , Mary Robinson and Jimmy Carter . 
 At the Stop the War Conference 2009 , he described the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as " Imperialist war ( s ) " and discussed the killing of American and allied troops by Iraqi or foreign insurgents , questioning whether they were in fact freedom fighters , and comparing the insurgents to a British Dad 's Army , saying : " If you are invaded you have a right to self @-@ defence , and this idea that people in Iraq and Afghanistan who are resisting the invasion are militant Muslim extremists is a complete bloody lie . I joined Dad 's Army when I was sixteen , and if the Germans had arrived , I tell you , I could use a bayonet , a rifle , a revolver , and if I 'd seen a German officer having a meal I 'd have tossed a grenade through the window . Would I have been a freedom fighter or a terrorist ? " 
 In an interview published in Dartford Living in September 2009 , Benn was critical of the Government 's decision to delay the findings of the Iraq War Inquiry until after the General Election , stating that " people can take into account what the inquiry has reported on but they ’ ve deliberately pushed it beyond the election . Government is responsible for explaining what it has done and I don 't think we were told the truth . " He also stated that local government was strangled by Margaret Thatcher and had not been liberated by New Labour . 
 In 2009 Benn was admitted to hospital and An Evening with Tony Benn , scheduled to take place at London 's Cadogan Hall , was cancelled . He performed his show , The Writing on the Wall , with Roy Bailey at St Mary 's Church , Ashford , Kent , in September 2011 , as part of the arts venue 's first Revelation St Mary 's Season . In July 2011 Benn was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Glamorgan , Wales . 
 Tony Benn headed a the " coalition of resistance " , a group with was opposed to the UK austerity programme . In interviews in 2010 with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now ! and 2013 with Afshin <unk> on RT UK , Benn claimed that the actions of New Labour in the leadup to and aftermath of the Iraq War were such that the former Prime Minister Tony Blair should be tried for war crimes . Benn also claimed in 2010 that Blair had lost the " trust of the nation " regarding the war in Iraq . 
 In November 2011 it was reported that Benn had moved out of his home in Holland Park Avenue , London , into a smaller flat nearby that benefited from a warden . In 2012 Benn was awarded an honorary degree from Goldsmiths , University of London . He was also the honorary president of the Goldsmiths Students ' Union , who successfully campaigned for him to retract comments dismissing the Julian Assange rape allegations . In February 2013 Benn was among those who gave their support to the People 's Assembly in a letter published by The Guardian newspaper . He gave a speech at the People 's Assembly Conference held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013 . 
 In 2013 , Tony Benn reiterated his previous opposition to European integration . Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by " UKIP and Tory backbenchers " , he said : 
 I took the view that having fought [ Europeans in the Second World War ] that we should now work with them , and co @-@ operate , and that was my first thought about it . Then how I saw how the European Union was developing , it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic . ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions , and if you come in on their terms , they will tell you what you can and cannot do . And that is unacceptable . My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners , but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they 're building an empire there , they want us to be a part of their empire and I don 't want that . 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 In 1990 , Benn was diagnosed with chronic lymphatic leukaemia and given three or four years to live ; at this time , he kept the news of his leukaemia from everyone except his immediate family . Benn said : " When you 're in parliament , you can 't describe your medical condition . People immediately start wondering what your majority is and when there will be a by @-@ election . They 're very brutal . " This was revealed in 2002 with the release of his 1990 – 2001 diaries . 
 Benn suffered a stroke in 2012 , and spent much of the following year in hospital . He was reported to be " seriously ill " in hospital in February 2014 . Benn died at home , surrounded by his family , on 14 March 2014 , at age 88 . 
 Benn 's funeral took place on 27 March 2014 at St Margaret 's Church , Westminster . His body had lain in rest at St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of Westminster the night before the funeral service . The service ended with the singing of " The Red Flag " . His body was then cremated ; the ashes are expected to be buried alongside those of his wife at the family home near Steeple , Essex . 
 Figures from across the political spectrum praised Benn following his death , and the leaders of all three major political parties ( the Conservatives , Labour and the Liberal Democrats ) in the United Kingdom paid tributes to Benn on his death . 
 David Cameron ( Conservative leader and Prime Minister ) said : 
 ... he was an extraordinary man : a great writer , a brilliant speaker , extraordinary in Parliament , and a great life of public and political and parliamentary service . I mean , I disagreed with most of what he said . But he was always engaging and interesting , and you were never bored when reading or listening to him , and the country a great campaigner , a great writer , and someone who I 'm sure whose words will be followed keenly for many , many years to come . 
 Deputy Prime Minister , Nick Clegg called Benn a " astonishing , iconic figure " and a " veteran parliamentarian , he was a great writer , he had great warmth and he had great conviction ... his political life will be looked back on with affection and admiration " . 
 Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband , who knew Benn personally as a family friend , said : 
 I think Tony Benn will be remembered as a champion of the powerless , as a conviction politician , as somebody of deep principle and integrity . The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for , and who he stood up for . And I think that 's why he was admired right across the political spectrum . There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him , including in my own party , but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn .

 Benn was a prolific diarist : nine volumes of his diaries have been published . The final volume was published in 2013 . Collections of his speeches and writings were published as Arguments for Socialism ( 1979 ) , Arguments for Democracy ( 1981 ) , ( both edited by Chris Mullin ) , Fighting Back ( 1988 ) and ( with Andrew Hood ) Common Sense ( 1993 ) , as well as Free Radical : New Century Essays ( 2004 ) .

 During his final years in Parliament , Benn placed three plaques within the Houses of Parliament . Two are in a room between the Central Lobby and Strangers ' Gallery that holds a permanent display about the suffragettes . The first was placed in 1995 . The second was placed in 1996 and is dedicated to all who work within the Houses of Parliament . 
 The third is dedicated to Suffragette Emily Wilding Davison and was placed in the broom cupboard next to the Undercroft Chapel within the Palace of Westminster , where Davison is said to have hidden during the 1911 census in order to establish her address as the House of Commons . 
 In 2011 Benn unveiled a plaque in Highbury , North London , to commemorate the Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 .

 In Bristol , where Benn first served as a Member of Parliament , a number of tributes exist in his honour . A bust of him was unveiled in Bristol 's City Hall in 2005 . In 2012 Transport House on Victoria Street , headquarters of Unite the Union 's regional office , was officially renamed Tony Benn House and opened by Benn himself . As of 2015 he appears , alongside other famous people associated with the city , on the reverse of the Bristol Pound 's £ B5 banknote . 
 Benn told the Socialist Review in 2007 that : 
 I 'd like to have on my gravestone : " He encouraged us . " I 'm proud to have been in the parliament that introduced the health service , the welfare state and voted against means testing . I did my maiden speech on nationalising the steel industry , put down the first motion for the boycott of South African goods , and resigned from the shadow cabinet in 1958 because of their support for nuclear weapons . 
 I think you do plant a few acorns , and I have lived to see one or two trees growing : gay rights , freedom of information , CND . I 'm not claiming them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing . 
 I 'm not ashamed of making mistakes . I 've made a million mistakes and they 're all in the diary . When we edit the diary – which is cut to around 10 percent – every mistake has to be printed because people look to see if you do .

 = William Speirs Bruce = 
 William Speirs Bruce FRSE ( 1 August 1867 – 28 October 1921 ) was a Scottish naturalist , polar scientist and oceanographer who organized and led the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition ( SNAE , 1902 – 04 ) to the South Orkney Islands and the Weddell Sea . Among other achievements , the expedition established the first permanent weather station in Antarctica . Bruce later founded the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory in Edinburgh , but his plans for a transcontinental Antarctic march via the South Pole were abandoned because of lack of public and financial support . 
 In 1892 Bruce gave up his medical studies at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Dundee Whaling Expedition to Antarctica as a scientific assistant . This was followed by Arctic voyages to Novaya Zemlya , Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land . In 1899 Bruce , by then Britain 's most experienced polar scientist , applied for a post on Robert Falcon Scott 's Discovery Expedition , but delays over this appointment and clashes with Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) president Sir Clements Markham led him instead to organise his own expedition , and earned him the permanent enmity of the British geographical establishment . Although Bruce received various awards for his polar work , including an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen , neither he nor any of his SNAE colleagues were recommended by the RGS for the prestigious Polar Medal . 
 Between 1907 and 1920 Bruce made many journeys to the Arctic regions , both for scientific and for commercial purposes . His failure to mount any major exploration ventures after the SNAE is usually attributed to his lack of public relations skills , powerful enemies , and his fervent Scottish nationalism . By 1919 his health was failing , and he experienced several spells in hospital before his death in 1921 , after which he was almost totally forgotten . In recent years , following the centenary of the Scottish Expedition , efforts have been made to give fuller recognition to his role in the history of scientific polar exploration . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Home and school = = = 
 William Speirs Bruce was born at 43 Kensington Gardens Square in London , the fourth child of Samuel Noble Bruce , a Scottish physician , and his Welsh wife Mary , née Lloyd . His middle name came from another branch of the family ; its unusual spelling , as distinct from the more common " Spiers " , tended to cause problems for reporters , reviewers and biographers . William passed his early childhood in the family 's London home at 18 Royal Crescent , Holland Park , under the tutelage of his grandfather , the Revd William Bruce . There were regular visits to nearby Kensington Gardens , and sometimes to the Natural History Museum ; according to Samuel Bruce these outings first ignited young William 's interest in life and nature . 
 In 1879 , at the age of 12 , William was sent to a progressive boarding school , Norfolk County School ( later Watts Naval School ) in the village of North Elmham , Norfolk . He remained there until 1885 , and then spent two further years at University College School , Hampstead , preparing for the matriculation examination that would admit him to the medical school at University College London ( UCL ) . He succeeded at his third attempt , and was ready to start his medical studies in the autumn of 1887 . 
 = = = Edinburgh = = = 
 During the summer of 1887 , Bruce travelled north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences . The six @-@ week courses , at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth , were under the direction of Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson , and included sections on botany and practical zoology . The experience of Granton , and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists , convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland . He abandoned his place at UCL , and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh . This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson , and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified . Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan , and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation . 
 = = First voyages = = 
 = = = Dundee Whaling Expedition = = = 
 The Dundee Whaling Expedition , 1892 – 93 , was an attempt to investigate the commercial possibilities of whaling in Antarctic waters by locating a source of right whales in the region . Scientific observations and oceanographic research would also be carried out in the four whaling ships : Balaena , Active , Diana and Polar Star . Bruce was recommended to the expedition by Hugh Robert Mill , an acquaintance from Granton who was now librarian to the Royal Geographical Society in London . Although it would finally curtail his medical studies , Bruce did not hesitate ; with William Gordon Burn Murdoch as an assistant he took up his duties on Balaena under Capt. Alexander Fairweather . The four ships sailed from Dundee on 6 September 1892 . 
 The relatively short expedition — Bruce was back in Scotland in May 1893 — failed in its main purpose , and gave only limited opportunities for scientific work . No right whales were found , and to cut the expedition 's losses a mass slaughter of seals was ordered , to secure skins , oil and blubber . Bruce found this distasteful , especially as he was expected to share in the killing . The scientific output from the voyage was , in Bruce 's words " a miserable show " . In a letter to the Royal Geographical Society he wrote : " The general bearing of the master ( Captain Fairweather ) was far from being favourable to scientific work " . Bruce was denied access to charts , so was unable to establish the accurate location of phenomena . He was required to work " in the boats " when he should have been making meteorological and other observations , and no facilities were allowed him for the preparation of specimens , many of which were lost through careless handling by the crew . Nevertheless , his letter to the RGS ends : " I have to thank the Society for assisting me in what has been , despite all drawbacks , an instructive and delightful experience . " In a further letter to Mill he outlined his wishes to go South again , adding : " the taste I have had has made me ravenous " . 
 Within months he was making proposals for a scientific expedition to South Georgia , but the RGS would not support his plans . In early 1896 he considered collaboration with the Norwegians Henryk Bull and Carsten Borchgrevink in an attempt to reach the South Magnetic Pole . This , too , failed to materialise . 
 = = = Jackson – Harmsworth Expedition = = = 
 From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce worked at the Ben Nevis summit meteorological station , where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments . In June 1896 , again on the recommendation of Mill , he left this post to join the Jackson – Harmsworth Expedition , then in its third year in the Arctic on Franz Josef Land . This expedition , led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth , had left London in 1894 . It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago , which had been discovered , though not properly mapped , during an Austrian expedition 20 years earlier . Jackson 's party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island , the southernmost island of the archipelago . It was supplied through regular visits from its expedition ship Windward , on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896 . 
 Windward arrived at Cape Flora on 25 July where Bruce found that Jackson 's expedition party had been joined by Fridtjof Nansen and his companion Hjalmar Johansen . The two Norwegians had been living on the ice for more than a year since leaving their ship Fram for a dash to the North Pole , and it was pure chance that had brought them to the one inhabited spot among thousands of square miles of Arctic wastes . Bruce mentions meeting Nansen in a letter to Mill , and his acquaintance with the celebrated Norwegian would be a future source of much advice and encouragement . 
 During his year at Cape Flora Bruce collected around 700 zoological specimens , in often very disagreeable conditions . According to Jackson : " It is no pleasant job to dabble in icy @-@ cold water , with the thermometer some degrees below zero , or to plod in the summer through snow , slush and mud many miles in search of animal life , as I have known Mr Bruce frequently to do " . Jackson named Cape Bruce after him , on the northern edge of Northbrook Island , at 80 ° 55 ′ N. Jackson was less pleased with Bruce 's <unk> attitude to his personal specimens , which he refused to entrust to the British Museum with the expedition 's other finds . This " tendency towards scientific conceit " , and lack of tact in interpersonal dealings , were early demonstrations of character flaws that in later life would be held against him . 
 = = = Arctic voyages = = = 
 On his return from Franz Josef Land in 1897 , Bruce worked in Edinburgh as an assistant to his former mentor John Arthur Thomson , and resumed his duties at the Ben Nevis observatory . In March 1898 he received an offer to join Major Andrew Coats on a hunting voyage to the Arctic waters around Novaya Zemlya and Spitsbergen , in the private yacht Blencathra . This offer had originally been made to Mill , who was unable to obtain leave from the Royal Geographical Society , and once again suggested Bruce as a replacement . Andrew Coats was a member of the prosperous Coats family of thread manufacturers , who had founded the Coats Observatory at Paisley . Bruce joined Blencathra at Tromsø , Norway in May 1898 , for a cruise which explored the Barents Sea , the dual islands of Novaya Zemlya , and the island of <unk> , before a retreat to Vardø in north @-@ eastern Norway to re @-@ provision for the voyage to Spitsbergen . In a letter to Mill , Bruce reported : " This is a pure yachting cruise and life is luxurious " . But his scientific work was unabated : " I have been taking 4 @-@ hourly observations in meteorology and temperature of the sea surface [ ... ] have tested salinity with Buchanan 's <unk> ; my tow @-@ nets [ ... ] have been going almost constantly " . 
 Blencathra sailed for Spitsbergen , but was stopped by ice , so she returned to Tromsø . Here she encountered the research ship Princesse Alice , purpose @-@ built for Prince Albert I of Monaco , a leading oceanographer . Bruce was delighted when the Prince invited him to join Princesse Alice on a hydrographic survey around Spitsbergen . The ship sailed up the west coast of the main island of the Spitsbergen group , and visited Adventfjorden and <unk> in the north . During the latter stages of the voyage Bruce was placed in charge of the voyage 's scientific observations . 
 In the following summer Bruce was invited to join Prince Albert on another oceanographic cruise to Spitsbergen . At Red Bay , latitude 80 ° N , Bruce ascended the highest peak in the area , which the Prince named " Ben Nevis " in his honour . When Princesse Alice ran aground on a submerged rock and appeared stranded , Prince Albert instructed Bruce to begin preparations for a winter camp , in the belief that it might be impossible for the ship to escape . Fortunately she floated free , and was able to return to Tromsø for repairs . 
 = = Marriage and family life = = 
 It is uncertain how Bruce was employed after his return from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899 . In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work , and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts . Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married . His bride was Jessie Mackenzie , who had worked as a nurse in Samuel Bruce 's London surgery . Bruce 's secretive nature , even among his circle of close friends and colleagues , was such that precise information about the wedding — its exact date , its location — has not been recorded by his biographers . 
 In 1907 the Bruces settled in a house at South Morton Street in Joppa near the coastal Edinburgh suburb of Portobello , in the first of a series of addresses in that area . They named their <unk> " Antarctica " . A son , <unk> Alastair , was born in April 1902 , and a daughter , Sheila Mackenzie , was born seven years later . During these years Bruce founded the Scottish Ski Club and became its first president . He was also a co @-@ founder of Edinburgh Zoo . 
 Bruce 's chosen life as an explorer , his unreliable sources of income and his frequent extended absences , all placed severe strains on the marriage , and the couple became estranged around 1916 . However , they continued to live in the same house until Bruce 's death . <unk> became a Merchant Navy officer , eventually captaining a Fisheries Research Ship which , by chance , bore the name Scotia .

 = = = Dispute with Markham = = = 
 On 15 March 1899 Bruce wrote to Sir Clements Markham at the RGS , offering himself for the scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition , then in its early planning stages . Markham 's reply was a non @-@ committal one @-@ line acknowledgement , after which Bruce heard nothing for a year . He was then told , indirectly , to apply for a scientific assistant 's post . On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier , and went on to reveal that he " was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship " . He followed this up a few days later , and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured , making his first explicit references to a " Scottish Expedition " . This alarmed Markham , who replied with some anger : " Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition [ ... ] A second ship is not in the least required [ ... ] I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started " . Bruce replied by return , denying rivalry , and asserting : " If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [ ... ] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable " . <unk> , Markham wrote back : " As I was doing my best to get you appointed ( to the National Antarctic Expedition ) I had a right to think you would not take such a step [ ... ] without at least consulting me " . He continued : " You will cripple the National Expedition [ ... ] in order to get up a scheme for yourself " . 
 Bruce replied formally , saying that the funds he had raised in Scotland would not have been forthcoming for any other project . There was no further correspondence between the two , beyond a short conciliatory note from Markham , in February 1901 , which read " I can now see things from your point of view , and wish you success " — a sentiment apparently not reflected in Markham 's subsequent attitude towards the Scottish expedition . 
 = = = Voyage of the Scotia = = = 
 With financial support from the Coats family , Bruce had acquired a Norwegian whaler , Hekla , which he transformed into a fully equipped Antarctic research ship , renamed Scotia . He then appointed an all @-@ Scottish crew and scientific team . Scotia left Troon on 2 November 1902 , and headed south towards Antarctica , where Bruce intended to set up winter quarters in the Weddell Sea quadrant , " as near to the South Pole as is practicable " . On 22 February the ship reached 70 ° 25 ′ S , but could proceed no further because of heavy ice . She retreated to Laurie Island in the South Orkneys chain , and wintered there . A meteorological station , Omond House , was established as part of a full programme of scientific work . 
 In November 1903 Scotia retreated to Buenos Aires for repair and reprovisioning . While in Argentina , Bruce negotiated an agreement with the government whereby Omond House became a permanent weather station , under Argentinian control . Renamed Orcadas Base , the site has been continuously in operation since then , and provides the longest historical meteorological series of Antarctica . In January 1904 Scotia sailed south again , to explore the Weddell Sea . On 6 March , new land was sighted , part of the sea 's eastern boundary ; Bruce named this Coats Land after the expedition 's chief backers . On 14 March , at 74 ° 01 ′ S and in danger of becoming icebound , Scotia turned north . The long voyage back to Scotland , via Cape Town , was completed on 21 July 1904 . 
 This expedition assembled a large collection of animal , marine and plant specimens , and carried out extensive hydrographic , magnetic and meteorological observations . One hundred years later it was recognised that the expedition 's work had " laid the foundation of modern climate change studies " , and that its experimental work had showed this part of the globe to be crucially important to the world 's climate . According to the oceanographer Tony Rice , it fulfilled a more comprehensive programme than any other Antarctic expedition of its day . At the time , however , its reception in Britain was relatively muted ; although its work was highly praised within sections of the scientific community , Bruce struggled to raise the funding to publish his scientific results , and blamed Markham for the lack of national recognition . 
 = = Post @-@ expedition years = = 
 = = = Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory = = = 
 Bruce 's collection of specimens , gathered from more than a decade of Arctic and Antarctic travel , required a permanent home . Bruce himself needed a base from which the detailed scientific reports of the Scotia voyage could be prepared for publication . He obtained premises in Nicolson Street , Edinburgh , in which he established a laboratory and museum , naming it the Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory , with the ultimate ambition that it should become the Scottish National Oceanographic Institute . It was officially opened by Prince Albert of Monaco in 1906 . 
 Within these premises Bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment , in preparation for future expeditions . He also met there with fellow @-@ explorers , including Nansen , Shackleton , and Roald Amundsen . His main task , however , was masterminding the preparation of the SNAE scientific reports . These , at considerable cost and much delay , were published between 1907 and 1920 , except for one volume — Bruce 's own log — that remained unpublished until 1992 , after its rediscovery . Bruce maintained a wide correspondence with experts , including Sir Joseph Hooker , who had travelled to the Antarctic with James Clark Ross in 1839 – 43 , and to whom Bruce dedicated his short book Polar Exploration . 
 In 1914 discussions began toward finding more permanent homes , both for Bruce 's collection and , following the death that year of oceanographer Sir John Murray , for the specimens and library of the Challenger expedition . Bruce proposed that a new centre should be created as a memorial to Murray . There was unanimous agreement to proceed , but the project was curtailed by the outbreak of war , and not revived . The Scottish Oceanographical Laboratory continued until 1919 , when Bruce , in poor health , was forced to close it , dispersing its contents to the Royal Scottish Museum , the Royal Scottish Geographical Society ( RSGS ) , and the University of Edinburgh . 
 = = = Further Antarctic plans = = = 
 On 17 March 1910 Bruce presented proposals to the Royal Scottish Geographical Society ( RSGS ) for a new Scottish Antarctic expedition . His plan envisaged a party wintering in or near Coats Land , while the ship took another group to the Ross Sea , on the opposite side of the continent . During the second season the Coats Land party would cross the continent on foot , via the South Pole , while the Ross Sea party pushed south to meet them and assist them home . The expedition would also carry out extensive oceanographical and other scientific work . Bruce estimated that the total cost would be about £ 50 @,@ 000 ( 2016 value about £ 4 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 ) . 
 The RSGS supported these proposals , as did the Royal Society of Edinburgh , the University of Edinburgh , and other Scottish organisations . However , the timing was wrong ; the Royal Geographical Society in London was fully occupied with Captain Scott 's Terra Nova Expedition , and showed no interest in Bruce 's plans . No rich private benefactors came forward , and persistent and intensive lobbying of the government for financial backing failed . Bruce suspected that his efforts were , as usual , being undermined by the aged but still influential Markham . Finally accepting that his venture would not take place , he gave generous support and advice to Ernest Shackleton , who in 1913 announced plans , similar to Bruce 's , for his Imperial Trans @-@ Antarctic Expedition . Shackleton not only received £ 10 @,@ 000 from the government , but raised large sums from private sources , including £ 24 @,@ 000 from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird of Dundee . 
 Shackleton 's expedition was an epic adventure , but failed completely in its main endeavour of a transcontinental crossing . Bruce was not consulted by the Shackleton relief committee about that expedition 's rescue , when the need arose in 1916 . " Myself , I suppose , " he wrote , " because of being north of the Tweed , they think dead " . 
 = = = Scottish Spitsbergen syndicate = = = 
 During his Spitsbergen visits with Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899 , Bruce had detected the presence of coal , gypsum and possibly oil . In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago , with the primary purpose of surveying and mapping Prince Charles Foreland , an island unvisited during the earlier voyages . Here Bruce found further deposits of coal , and indications of iron . On the basis of these finds , Bruce set up a mineral prospecting company , the Scottish Spitsbergen Syndicate , in July 1909 . 
 At that time , in international law Spitsbergen was regarded as terra nullius — rights to mine and extract could be established simply by registering a claim . Bruce 's syndicate registered claims on Prince Charles Foreland and on the islands of <unk> and Edgeøya , among other areas . A sum of £ 4 @,@ 000 ( out of a target of £ 6 @,@ 000 ) was subscribed to finance the costs of a detailed prospecting expedition during the summer of 1909 , in a chartered vessel with a full scientific team . The results , however were " disappointing " , and the voyage absorbed almost all of the syndicate 's funds . 
 Bruce paid two further visits to Spitsbergen , in 1912 and 1914 , but the outbreak of war prevented further immediate developments . However , early in 1919 the old syndicate was replaced by a larger and better @-@ financed company . Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil , but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence , although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered . Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement . The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures , and although it continued to exist , under various ownerships , until 1952 , there is no record of profitable extraction . Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern .

 = = = Polar Medals withheld = = = 
 During his lifetime Bruce received many awards : the Gold Medal of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society in 1904 ; the Patron 's Medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1910 ; the Neill prize and Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1913 , and the Livingstone Medal of the American Geographical Society in 1920 . He also received an honorary LLD degree from the University of Aberdeen . The honour that eluded him , however , was the Polar Medal , awarded by the Sovereign on the recommendation of the Royal Geographical Society . Although the Medal was awarded to the members of every other British or Commonwealth Antarctic expedition during the early 20th century , the SNAE was the exception ; the medal was withheld . 
 Bruce , and those close to him , blamed Markham for this omission . The matter was raised , repeatedly , with anyone thought to have influence . Robert Rudmose Brown , chronicler of the Scotia voyage and later Bruce 's first biographer , wrote in a 1913 letter to the President of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society that this neglect was " a slight to Scotland and to Scottish endeavour " . Bruce wrote in March 1915 to the President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh , who agreed in his reply that " Markham had much to answer for " . After Markham 's death in 1916 Bruce sent a long letter to his Member of Parliament , Charles Price , detailing Sir Clements 's malice towards him and the Scottish expedition , ending with a heartfelt cry on behalf of his old comrades : " Robertson is dying without his well won white ribbon ! The Mate is dead ! ! The Chief Engineer is dead ! ! ! Everyone as good men as have ever served on any Polar Expedition , yet they did not receive the white ribbon . " No action followed this plea . 
 No award had been made nearly a century later , when the matter was raised in the Scottish Parliament . On 4 November 2002 MSP Michael Russell tabled a motion relating to the SNAE centenary , which concluded : " The Polar Medal Advisory Committee should recommend the posthumous award of the Polar Medal to Dr William Speirs Bruce , in recognition of his status as one of the key figures in early 20th century polar scientific exploration " . 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 After the outbreak of war in 1914 , Bruce 's prospecting ventures were on hold . He offered his services to the Admiralty , but failed to obtain an appointment . In 1915 he accepted a post as director and manager of a whaling company based in the Seychelles , and spent four months there , but the venture failed . On his return to Britain he finally secured a minor post at the Admiralty . 
 Bruce continued to lobby for recognition , highlighting the distinctions between the treatment of SNAE and that of English expeditions . When the war finished he attempted to revive his various interests , but his health was failing , forcing him to close his laboratory . On the 1920 voyage to Spitsbergen he travelled in an advisory role , unable to participate in the detailed work . On return , he was confined in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and later in the Liberton Hospital , Edinburgh , where he died on 28 October 1921 . In accordance with his wishes he was cremated , and the ashes taken to South Georgia to be scattered on the southern sea . Despite his irregular income and general lack of funds , his estate realised £ 7 @,@ 000 ( 2016 value about £ 280 @,@ 000 ) . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 After Bruce 's death his long @-@ time friend and colleague Robert Rudmose Brown wrote , in a letter to Bruce 's father : " His name is <unk> enrolled among the world 's great explorers , and the martyrs to unselfish scientific devotion " . Rudmose Brown 's biography was published in 1923 , and in the same year a joint committee of Edinburgh 's learned societies instituted the Bruce Memorial Prize , an award for young polar scientists . Thereafter , although his name continued to be respected in scientific circles , Bruce and his achievements were forgotten by the general public . Occasional mentions of him , in polar histories and biographies of major figures such as Scott and Shackleton , tended to be dismissive and inaccurate . 
 The early years of the 21st century , however , have seen a reassessment of Bruce 's work . <unk> factors have been the SNAE centenary , and Scotland 's renewed sense of national identity . A 2003 expedition , in a modern research ship " Scotia " , used information collected by Bruce as a basis for examining climate change in South Georgia . This expedition predicted " dramatic conclusions " relating to global warming from its research , and saw this contribution as a " fitting tribute to Britain 's forgotten polar hero , William Speirs Bruce " . An hour @-@ long BBC television documentary on Bruce presented by Neil Oliver in 2011 contrasted his meticulous science with his rivals ' aim of enhancing imperial prestige . A new biographer , Peter Speak ( 2003 ) , claims that the SNAE was " by far the most cost @-@ effective and carefully planned scientific expedition of the Heroic Age " . 
 The same author considers reasons why Bruce 's efforts to capitalise on this success met with failure , and suggests a combination of his shy , solitary , <unk> nature and his " fervent " Scottish nationalism . Bruce seemingly lacked public relations skills and the ability to promote his work , after the fashion of Scott and Shackleton ; a lifelong friend described him as being " as prickly as the Scottish thistle itself " . On occasion he behaved tactlessly , as with Jackson over the question of the specimens brought back from Franz Josef Land , and on another occasion with the Royal Geographical Society , over the question of a minor expense claim . 
 As to his nationalism , he wished to see Scotland on an equal footing with other nations . His national pride was intense ; in a Preparatory Note to The Voyage of the Scotia he wrote : " While ' Science ' was the talisman of the Expedition , ' Scotland ' was emblazoned on its flag " . This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion . However , he retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led , and of those who had known him longest . John Arthur Thomson , who had known Bruce since Granton , wrote of him when reviewing Rudmose Brown 's 1923 biography : " We never heard him once grumble about himself , though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to , or slight cast on , his men , on his colleagues , on his laboratory , on his Scotland . Then one got glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping " . 
 = French ironclad Marceau = 
 Marceau was an ironclad turret ship built for the French Navy during the 1880s , the lead ship of her class . She served in the Mediterranean Squadron until 1900 , when she was rebuilt and subsequently placed in reserve . She returned to service in 1906 as a torpedo training ship . During World War I , she served in Malta and Corfu as a submarine tender . The old ironclad was sold for scrapping in 1920 , and while being towed to Toulon , she ran aground in a gale off Bizerte and became stranded . The wreck remained visible there until the 1930s . 
 = = Design = = 
 Marceau had an overall length of 101 @.@ 6 meters ( 333 ft 4 in ) and was 98 @.@ 6 meters ( 323 ft 6 in ) long between perpendiculars . She had a beam of 20 @.@ 23 m ( 66 ft 4 in ) and a draft up to 8 @.@ 3 m ( 27 ft 3 in ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 850 tonnes ( 10 @,@ 680 long tons ) . The ship was powered by a pair of vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , using steam provided by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers that were trunked into a single large funnel . The engines were designed to reach 12 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 8 @,@ 800 kW ) and propel the ship at a top speed of 16 @.@ 5 knots ( 30 @.@ 6 km / h ; 19 @.@ 0 mph ) , but they only managed 11 @,@ 169 metric horsepower ( 8 @,@ 215 kW ) and 16 @.@ 194 knots ( 29 @.@ 991 km / h ; 18 @.@ 636 mph ) on the ship 's sea trials . Marceau had a range of 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 643 – 651 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of two 340 @-@ millimeter ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) <unk> 28 @-@ caliber guns and two slightly newer M1884 guns of the same caliber . These weapons were mounted in individual barbettes in a " lozenge " arrangement , with one gun forward , one aft , and two amidships . The secondary battery consisted of sixteen 138 @.@ 6 mm ( 5 @.@ 46 in ) M1884 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , all firing through unarmored embrasures in the hull . Marceau 's light armament varies widely between sources : Chesneau & Kolesnik give a range of three to six 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) 9 @-@ pounder guns , nine to eighteen 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) 3 @-@ pounder guns , eight to twelve 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 1 @-@ pounder five @-@ barrel Hotchkiss revolving cannon , and three to five 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes in deck @-@ mounted launchers ; naval historian Eric Gille gives four to seven 65 mm guns , nine to twelve 47 mm guns , eight 37 mm guns and five to six torpedo tubes , all above water ; naval historian Paul Silverstone says six 65 mm guns , twelve 47 mm guns and five torpedo tubes . The ship 's compound armor belt was 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) at the stern and 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) . The barbettes were also 450 mm thick . The conning tower was protected by 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) of armor plating and the deck was 80 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) thick .

 Marceau was ordered in October 1880 , but was not laid down until 27 January 1882 at the Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée shipyard in La Seyne @-@ sur @-@ Mer . Work proceeded slowly , and she was not launched until April 1890 . This was a result of the influence of Admiral Théophile Aube , who was the Minister of Marine in 1886 – 87 ; Aube was a staunch advocate of the so @-@ called Jeune École and opposed new battleship construction . Fitting out work was completed much more quickly , however , and she was commissioned into the French fleet on 14 March 1891 . After her commissioning , she joined a French fleet that visited Kronstadt and was inspected by Czar Alexander III of Russia . On the return voyage , the fleet stopped in Spithead , where Queen Victoria reviewed the ships . This turned out to be the only time Marceau operated in the Atlantic ; after returning to France , she was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron , where she remained for the duration of her career . 
 In 1895 , Marceau and the ironclads Courbet , Amiral Baudin , and Formidable all nearly ran aground off Hyères ; Marceau and three tugs used to tow Amiral Baudin back to port . During the 1897 fleet gunnery trials , which saw the first use of a new system of centralized fire control in the French fleet , Marceau , her sister Neptune , and the new battleship Brennus all achieved more than 25 percent hits at ranges of between 3 @,@ 000 yd ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) and 4 @,@ 000 yd ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . On 30 August 1900 , Marceau returned to La Seyne for a major reconstruction . Her heavy military masts were cut down , her engines were modernized and her boilers were replaced with 16 Niclausse boilers . Another 138 @.@ 6 mm gun was installed in the bow under the forecastle . The work was completed in May 1902 , and Marceau underwent a series of sea trials for the remainder of the year . She did not return to active service with the fleet , however , and was placed in reserve at Toulon . In 1906 , she was converted into a training ship for torpedo operators in Toulon . 
 After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Marceau was converted into a floating workshop to support torpedo boats and submarines . She was initially based in Malta , but was later moved to Corfu and then to Bizerte in 1918 . She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1920 , and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Toulon in 1921 . While she was being towed to Toulon , a storm caused her to run aground off Bizerte . She remained visible there until the 1930s . 
 = Privy Council of the United Kingdom = 
 Her Majesty 's Most Honourable Privy Council , usually known simply as the Privy Council , is a formal body of advisers to the Sovereign of the United Kingdom . Its membership mainly comprises senior politicians , who are present or former members of either the House of Commons or the House of Lords . 
 The Privy Council formally advises the sovereign on the exercise of the Royal Prerogative , and corporately ( as Queen @-@ in @-@ Council ) it issues executive instruments known as Orders in Council , which among other powers enact Acts of Parliament . The Council also holds the delegated authority to issue Orders of Council , mostly used to regulate certain public institutions . The Council advises the sovereign on the issuing of Royal Charters , which are used to grant special status to incorporated bodies , and city or borough status to local authorities . Otherwise , the Privy Council 's powers have now been largely replaced by the Cabinet of the United Kingdom . 
 Certain judicial functions are also performed by the Queen @-@ in @-@ Council , although in practice its actual work of hearing and deciding upon cases is carried out day @-@ to @-@ day by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . The Judicial Committee consists of senior judges appointed as Privy Counsellors : predominantly Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and senior judges from the Commonwealth . The Privy Council formerly acted as the High Court of Appeal for the entire British Empire ( other than for the United Kingdom itself ) , and continues to hear appeals from the Crown Dependencies , the British Overseas Territories , and some independent Commonwealth states . 
 = = History = = 
 The Privy Council of the United Kingdom was preceded by the Privy Council of Scotland and the Privy Council of England . The key events in the formation of the modern Privy Council are given below : 
 Witenagemot was an early equivalent to the Privy Council of England . During the reigns of the Norman monarchs , the English Crown was advised by a royal court or curia regis , which consisted of magnates , ecclesiastics and high officials . The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign on legislation , administration and justice . Later , different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court . The courts of law took over the business of dispensing justice , while Parliament became the supreme legislature of the kingdom . Nevertheless , the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes , either in the first instance or on appeal . Furthermore , laws made by the sovereign on the advice of the Council , rather than on the advice of Parliament , were accepted as valid . Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament . For example , a committee of the Council — which later became the Court of the Star Chamber — was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death , without being bound by normal court procedure . During Henry VIII 's reign , the sovereign , on the advice of the Council , was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation . The legislative pre @-@ eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIII 's death . Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities , it became a primarily administrative body . The Council consisted of forty members in 1553 , but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee , which later evolved into the modern Cabinet . 
 By the end of the English Civil War , the monarchy , House of Lords , and Privy Council had been abolished . The remaining parliamentary chamber , the House of Commons , instituted a Council of State to execute laws and to direct administrative policy . The forty @-@ one members of the Council were elected by the House of Commons ; the body was headed by Oliver Cromwell , de facto military dictator of the nation . In 1653 , however , Cromwell became Lord Protector , and the Council was reduced to between thirteen and twenty @-@ one members , all elected by the Commons . In 1657 , the Commons granted Cromwell even greater powers , some of which were reminiscent of those enjoyed by monarchs . The Council became known as the Protector 's Privy Council ; its members were appointed by the Lord Protector , subject to Parliament 's approval . 
 In 1659 , shortly before the restoration of the monarchy , the Protector 's Council was abolished . Charles II restored the Royal Privy Council , but he , like previous Stuart monarchs , chose to rely on a small group of advisers . Under George I even more power transferred to this committee . It now began to meet in the absence of the sovereign , communicating its decisions to him after the fact . 
 Thus , the British Privy Council , as a whole , ceased to be a body of important confidential advisers to the sovereign ; the role passed to a committee of the Council , now known as the Cabinet . 
 = = Origin of the term = = 
 According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the definition of the word privy in Privy Council is obsolete meaning " of or pertaining exclusively to a particular person or persons , one 's own " ; hence the Council is personal to the sovereign . It is closely related to the word private , and derives from the French word <unk> . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The sovereign , when acting on the Council 's advice , is known as the King @-@ in @-@ Council or Queen @-@ in @-@ Council . The members of the Council are collectively known as The Lords of Her Majesty 's Most Honourable Privy Council ( sometimes The Lords and others of ... ) . The chief officer of the body is the Lord President of the Council , who is the fourth highest Great Officer of State , a Cabinet member and normally , either the Leader of the House of Lords or of the House of Commons . Another important official is the Clerk , whose signature is appended to all orders made in the Council . 
 Both Privy Counsellor and Privy Councillor may be correctly used to refer to a member of the Council . The former , however , is preferred by the Privy Council Office , emphasising English usage of the term Counsellor as " one who gives counsel " , as opposed to " one who is a member of a council " . A Privy Counsellor is traditionally said to be " sworn of " the Council after being received by the sovereign . 
 The sovereign may appoint anyone a Privy Counsellor , but in practice appointments are made only on the advice of the Her Majesty 's Government , and generally consist only of senior members of Parliament , the Church of England and HM Judiciary . There is no statutory limit to its membership : at January 2012 , there were about 600 members ; they had risen in number to over 650 by June 2015 . 
 However , the members have no automatic right to attend all Privy Council meetings , and only some are summoned regularly to meetings ( in practice at the Prime Minister 's discretion ) . 
 The Church of England 's three senior bishops — the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of London — become Privy Counsellors upon appointment . Senior members of the Royal Family may also be appointed , but this is confined to the current consort and heir apparent and consort . Prince Philip is at present the most senior member by length of service , and he is the only current Privy Counsellor not appointed by the reigning monarch , having been sworn of the Council by her father . The Private Secretary to the Sovereign is always appointed a Privy Counsellor , as are the Lord Chamberlain , the Speaker of the House of Commons , and the Lord Speaker . Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom , judges of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , senior judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session ( Scotland 's highest law court ) and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland also join the Privy Council ex officio . 
 The balance of Privy Counsellors is largely made up of politicians . The Prime Minister , Cabinet ministers and the Leader of HM Opposition are traditionally sworn of the Privy Council upon appointment . Leaders of major parties in the House of Commons , First Ministers of the devolved assemblies , some senior Ministers outside Cabinet , and on occasion other respected senior parliamentarians are appointed Privy Counsellors . 
 Because Privy Counsellors are bound by oath to keep matters discussed at Council meetings secret , the appointment of the Leaders of Opposition Parties as Privy Counsellors allows the Government to share confidential information with them " on Privy Council terms " . This usually only happens in special circumstances , such as in matters of national security . For example , Tony Blair met Iain Duncan Smith ( then Leader of HM Opposition ) and Charles Kennedy ( then Leader of the Liberal Democrats ) , " on Privy Council terms " to discuss the evidence for Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction . 
 Although the Privy Council is primarily a British institution , officials from some other Commonwealth realms are also appointed . By 2000 , the most notable instance was New Zealand , whose Prime Minister , senior politicians , Chief Justice and Court of Appeal Justices were traditionally appointed Privy Counsellors . However , appointments of New Zealand members have since been discontinued . The Prime Minister , the Speaker , the Governor @-@ General and the Chief Justice of New Zealand are still accorded the style , Right Honourable , but without membership of the Council . Until the late 20th century , the Prime Ministers and Chief Justices of Canada and Australia were also appointed Privy Counsellors . Canada also has its own Privy Council , the Queen 's Privy Council for Canada ( see below ) . Prime Ministers of some other Commonwealth countries that retain the Queen as their sovereign continue to be sworn of the Council . 
 = = Privy Council oath and initiation rite = = 
 It was formerly regarded by the Privy Council as criminal , and possibly treasonous , to disclose the oath administered to Privy Counsellors as they take office . However , the oath was officially made public by the Blair Government in a written parliamentary answer in 1998 , as follows . It had also been read out in full in the House of Lords during debate by Lord <unk> on 21 December 1932 . 
 You do swear by Almighty God to be a true and faithful Servant unto the Queen 's Majesty , as one of Her Majesty 's Privy Council . You will not know or understand of any manner of thing to be attempted , done , or spoken against Her Majesty 's Person , Honour , Crown , or Dignity Royal , but you will let and withstand the same to the uttermost of your Power , and either cause it to be revealed to Her Majesty Herself , or to such of Her Privy Council as shall advertise Her Majesty of the same . You will , in all things to be moved , treated , and debated in Council , faithfully and truly declare your Mind and Opinion , according to your Heart and Conscience ; and will keep secret all Matters committed and revealed unto you , or that shall be treated of secretly in Council . And if any of the said Treaties or <unk> shall touch any of the Counsellors , you will not reveal it unto him , but will keep the same until such time as , by the Consent of Her Majesty , or of the Council , Publication shall be made thereof . You will to your uttermost bear Faith and Allegiance unto the Queen 's Majesty ; and will assist and defend all Jurisdictions , Pre @-@ eminences , and Authorities , granted to Her Majesty , and annexed to the Crown by Acts of Parliament , or otherwise , against all Foreign Princes , Persons , Prelates , States , or <unk> . And generally in all things you will do as a faithful and true Servant ought to do to Her Majesty . So help you God . 
 A form of this oath dates back to at least 1570 . 
 Privy counsellors can choose to affirm their allegiance in similar terms should they prefer not to take a religious oath . At the induction ceremony , the order of precedence places Anglicans ( being those of the established church ) before others . 
 The initiation ceremony for newly appointed privy counsellors is held in private and typically requires kneeling on a stool before the sovereign and then kissing hands . According to the The Royal Encyclopaedia : " The new privy counsellor or minister will extend his or her right hand , palm upwards , and , taking the Queen 's hand lightly , will kiss it with no more than a touch of the lips . " The ceremony has caused difficulties for privy counsellors who advocate republicanism ; Tony Benn said in his diaries that he kissed his own thumb , rather than the Queen 's hand , while Jeremy Corbyn reportedly did not kneel . Not all members of the privy council go through the initiation ceremony ; appointments are frequently made by an Order in Council , although it is " rare for a party leader to use such a course . " 
 = = Term of office = = 
 Membership is conferred for life . Formerly , the death of a monarch ( " demise of the Crown " ) brought an immediate dissolution of the Council , as all Crown appointments automatically lapsed . By the 18th century , it was enacted that the Council would not be dissolved until up to six months after the demise of the Crown . By convention , however , the sovereign would reappoint all members of the Council after its dissolution . In practice , therefore , membership continued without a break . In 1901 the law was changed to ensure that Crown Appointments became wholly unaffected by any succession of monarch . 
 The sovereign however may remove an individual from the Privy Council . On 8 June 2011 , the former MP Elliot Morley was expelled following his conviction on charges of false accounting in connection with the British parliamentary expenses scandal . Before this , the last individual to be expelled from the Council against his will was Sir Edgar Speyer Bt , who was removed on 13 December 1921 for collaborating with the enemy German Empire , during the First World War . Individuals can choose to resign , sometimes to avoid expulsion : three members voluntarily left the Privy Council in the 20th century : Jonathan Aitken , on 25 June 1997 following allegations of perjury , John Profumo , who resigned on 26 June 1963 , and John Stonehouse , who resigned on 17 August 1976 . On 4 February 2013 , Chris Huhne announced that he would voluntarily leave the Privy Council after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice . 
 The Lord Prescott stood down on 6 July 2013 as an act of protest against the delays in the introduction of press regulation , expecting others to follow , and Denis <unk> was forced to resign on 9 October 2013 prior to a High Court hearing at which he pleaded guilty of false accounting and was subsequently imprisoned . Both are former Labour MPs . 
 = = Meetings = = 
 Meetings of the Privy Council are normally held once each month wherever the sovereign may be in residence at the time . The quorum , according to the Privy Council Office , is three , though some statutes provide for other quorums ( for example , section 35 of the <unk> Act 1989 ( c . 44 ) provides for a lower quorum of two ) . 
 The sovereign attends the meeting , though his or her place may be taken by two or more Counsellors of State . Under the Regency Acts 1937 to 1953 , Counsellors of State may be chosen from among the sovereign 's spouse and the four individuals next in the line of succession who are over 21 years of age ( 18 for the heir to the throne ) . <unk> the sovereign remains standing at meetings of the Privy Council , so that no other members may sit down , thereby keeping meetings short . The Lord President reads out a list of Orders to be made , and the sovereign merely says " Approved " . 
 Few Privy Counsellors are required to attend regularly . The settled practice is that day @-@ to @-@ day meetings of the Council are attended by four Privy Counsellors , usually the relevant Minister to the matters pertaining . The Cabinet Minister holding the office of Lord President of the Council , currently the Rt Hon David <unk> MP , invariably presides . Under Britain 's modern conventions of parliamentary government and constitutional monarchy , every order made in Council is drafted by a Government Department and has already been approved by the Minister responsible — thus actions taken by the Queen @-@ in @-@ Council are formalities required for validation of each measure . 
 Full meetings of the Privy Council are held only when the reigning sovereign announces his or her own engagement ( which last happened on 23 November 1839 , in the reign of Queen Victoria ) ; or when there is a demise of the Crown , either by the death or abdication of the monarch . A full meeting of the Privy Council was also held on 6 February 1811 , when George , Prince of Wales was sworn in as Prince Regent by Act of Parliament . The current statutes regulating the establishment of a regency in the case of minority or incapacity of the sovereign also require any regents to swear their oaths before the Privy Council . 
 In the case of a demise of the Crown , the Privy Council — together with the Lords Spiritual , the Lords Temporal , the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London as well as representatives of Commonwealth realms — makes a proclamation declaring the accession of the new sovereign and receives an oath from the new monarch relating to the security of the Church of Scotland , as required by law . It is also customary for the new sovereign to make an <unk> to the Privy Council on that occasion , and this Sovereign 's Speech is formally published in The London Gazette . Any such Special Assembly of the Privy Council , convened to proclaim the accession of a new sovereign and witness the monarch 's statutory oath , is known as an Accession Council . The last such meetings were held on 6 and 8 February 1952 : as Elizabeth II was abroad when the last demise of the Crown took place , the Accession Council met twice , once to proclaim the sovereign ( meeting of 6 February 1952 ) , and then again after the new queen had returned to Britain , to receive from her the oath required by statute ( meeting of 8 February 1952 ) . 
 = = Functions = = 
 The sovereign exercises executive authority by making Orders in Council upon the advice of the Privy Council . Orders @-@ in @-@ Council , which are drafted by the government rather than by the sovereign , are secondary legislation and are used to make government regulations and to make government appointments . Furthermore , Orders @-@ in @-@ Council are used to grant Royal Assent for Measures of the National Assembly for Wales , and laws passed by the legislatures of British Crown dependencies . 
 Distinct from Orders @-@ in @-@ Council are Orders of Council : the former are issued by the sovereign upon the advice of the Privy Council , whereas the latter are made by members of the Privy Council without requiring the sovereign 's approval . They are issued under the specific authority of Acts of Parliament , and most commonly are used for the regulation of public institutions . 
 The sovereign also grants Royal Charters on the advice of the Privy Council . Charters bestow special status to incorporated bodies ; they are used to grant " chartered " status to certain professional , educational or charitable bodies , and sometimes also city and borough status to towns . The Privy Council therefore deals with a wide range of matters , including university and livery company statutes , churchyards , coinage and dates of bank holidays . 
 Members of the Privy Council are privileged to be given advance notice of any prime ministerial decision to commit HM Armed Forces in enemy action . 
 = = Committees of the Privy Council = = 
 The Privy Council comprises a number of Standing Committees : 
 Baronetage Committee 
 Cabinet of the United Kingdom 
 Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey 
 Committee for the Purposes of the Crown Office Act 1877 
 Judicial Committee of the Privy Council 
 Scottish Universities Committee 
 Universities Committee 
 The Baronetage Committee was established by a 1910 Order in Council , during Edward VII 's reign , to scrutinise all succession claims ( and thus reject doubtful ones ) to be placed on the Roll of Baronets . 
 The Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey recommends approval of Channel Islands legislation . 
 The Committee for the purposes of the Crown Office Act 1877 consists of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Privy Seal as well as a Secretary of State . The Committee which last met in 1988 is concerned with the design and usage of wafer seals . 
 The Scottish Universities Committee considers proposed amendments to the statutes of Scotland 's four ancient universities . The Universities Committee , which last met in 1995 , considers petitions against statutes made by Oxford and Cambridge Universities and their colleges . 
 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council , consists of senior judges who are Privy Counsellors . The decision of the Committee is presented in the form of " advice " to the monarch , but in practice it is always followed by the sovereign ( as Crown @-@ in @-@ Council ) , who formally approves the recommendation of the Judicial Committee . 
 Within the United Kingdom , the Judicial Committee hears appeals from ecclesiastical courts , the Court of Admiralty of the Cinque Ports , prize courts and the Disciplinary Committee of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons , appeals against schemes of the Church Commissioners and appeals under certain Acts of Parliament ( e.g. , the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 ) . The Crown @-@ in @-@ Council was formerly the Supreme Appeal Court for the entire British Empire , but a number of Commonwealth countries have now abolished the right to such appeals . The Judicial Committee continues to hear appeals from several Commonwealth countries , from British Overseas Territories , Sovereign Base Areas and Crown dependencies . The Judicial Committee had direct jurisdiction in cases relating to the Scotland Act 1998 , the Government of Wales Act 1998 and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 , but this was transferred to the new Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in 2009 . 
 In addition to the Standing Committees , ad hoc Committees are notionally set up to consider and report on Petitions for Royal Charters of Incorporation and to approve changes to the bye @-@ laws of bodies created by Royal Charter . 
 Committees of Privy Counsellors are occasionally established to examine specific issues . Such Committees are independent of the Privy Council Office and therefore do not report directly to the Lord President of the Council . Examples of such Committees include : 
 the Butler Committee — operation of the intelligence services in the runup to military intervention in Iraq 
 the Chilcot Committee — for the Chilcot Inquiry on the use of intercept materials 
 the Gibson Committee of enquiry set up in 2010 — to consider whether the UK security services were complicit in torture of detainees .

 The Civil Service is formally governed by Privy Council Orders , as an exercise of the Royal prerogative . One such order implemented HM Government 's ban of GCHQ staff from joining a Trade Union . Another , the Civil Service ( Amendment ) Order in Council 1997 , permitted the Prime Minister to grant up to three political advisers management authority over some Civil Servants . 
 In the 1960s , the Privy Council made an order to evict the 2 @,@ 000 inhabitants of the 65 @-@ island Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean , in preparation for the establishment of a joint United States – United Kingdom military base on the largest outlying island , Diego Garcia , some 60 miles ( 97 km ) distant . In 2000 the Court of Appeal ruled the 1971 Immigration Ordinance preventing resettlement unlawful . In 2004 , the Privy Council , under Jack Straw 's tenure , overturned the ruling . In 2006 the High Court of Justice found the Privy Council 's decision to be unlawful . Sir Sydney Kentridge described the treatment of the Chagossians as " outrageous , unlawful and a breach of accepted moral standards " : Justice Kentridge stated that there was no known precedent " for the lawful use of prerogative powers to remove or exclude an entire population of British subjects from their homes and place of birth " , and the Court of Appeal were persuaded by this argument , but the Law Lords ( at that time the UK 's highest law court ) found its decision to be flawed and overturned the ruling by a 3 – 2 decision thereby upholding the terms of the Ordinance . 
 = = Rights and privileges of members = = 
 The Privy Council as a whole is termed " The Most Honourable " whilst its members individually , the Privy Counsellors , are entitled to be styled " The Right Honourable " . The term is only used for addressing living people ; it is never used for dead people . 
 Peers below the rank of marquess who are not members of the Privy Council are nowadays customarily prefixed with " The " before their title , omitting " The Right Honourable " , although this used to be considered to be correct form when addressing them in writing ( prior to 1999 ) . All those sworn of the Privy Council , including barons , viscounts , and earls , are accorded the style " The Right Honourable " ; non @-@ royal dukes are styled " The Most Noble " and marquesses as " The Most Honourable " . 
 Modern custom as recommended by Debrett 's is to use the post @-@ nominal letters " PC " in a social style of address for peers who are Privy Counsellors . For commoners , " The Right Honourable " is sufficient identification of their status as a Privy Counsellor . The Ministry of Justice revises current practice of this convention from time to time . 
 Privy Counsellors are accorded a formal rank of precedence , if not already having a higher one . At the beginning of each new Parliament , and at the discretion of the Speaker , those members of the House of Commons who are Privy Counsellors usually take the oath of allegiance before all other members except the Speaker and the Father of the House , who is the most senior member of the House . Should a Privy Counsellor rise to speak in the House of Commons at the same time as another Honourable Member , the Speaker usually gives priority to the " Right Honourable " Member . This parliamentary custom , however , was discouraged under New Labour after 1998 , despite the Government not being supposed to exert influence over the Speaker . 
 Only Privy Counsellors can be signatories , by the monarch 's command i.e. Royal Assent , to the examination of a Bill affecting the rights of the Crown . 
 Privy Counsellors technically are allowed to sit on the steps of the Sovereign 's Throne in the Chamber of the House of Lords during debates , a privilege which was shared with heirs apparent of those peerage titles who were to become members of the House of Lords before Labour 's partial Reform of the Lords in 1999 , diocesan bishops of the Church of England yet to be Lords Spiritual , retired bishops who formerly sat in the House of Lords , the Dean of Westminster , Peers of Ireland , the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod . Nowadays this privilege is rarely exercised . 
 Each Privy Counsellor has the right of personal access to the sovereign . Peers were considered to enjoy this right individually ; members of the House of Commons possess the right collectively . In each case , personal access may only be used to tender advice on public affairs . 
 = = Other councils = = 
 The Privy Council is one of the four principal councils of the sovereign . The other three are the courts of law , the Commune Concilium ( Common Council , or Parliament ) and the Magnum Concilium ( Great Council , or the assembly of all the Peers of the Realm ) . All are still in existence , or at least have never been formally abolished , but the Magnum Concilium has not been summoned since 1640 and was considered defunct even then . 
 Several other Privy Councils have advised the sovereign . England and Scotland once had separate Privy Councils ( the Privy Council of England and Privy Council of Scotland ) . The Acts of Union 1707 , which united the two countries into the Kingdom of Great Britain , created a single body . Both Privy Councils were abolished in 1708 and a new joint <unk> Council created . Ireland , on the other hand , continued to have a separate Privy Council even after the Act of Union 1800 . The Privy Council of Ireland was abolished in 1922 , when the southern part of Ireland separated from the United Kingdom ; it was succeeded by the Privy Council of Northern Ireland , which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972 . No further appointments have been made since then , and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014 . 
 Canada has had its own Privy Council — the Queen 's Privy Council for Canada — since 1867 . While the Canadian Privy Council is specifically " for Canada " , the Privy Council discussed above is not " for the United Kingdom " ; in order to clarify the ambiguity where necessary , the latter was traditionally referred to as the Imperial Privy Council . Equivalent organs of state in other Commonwealth realms , such as Australia and New Zealand , are called Executive Councils . 
 = Ytterbium = 
 Ytterbium is a chemical element with symbol Yb and atomic number 70 . It is the fourteenth and penultimate element in the lanthanide series , which is the basis of the relative stability of its + 2 oxidation state . However , like the other lanthanides , its most common oxidation state is + 3 , seen in its oxide , halides and other compounds . In aqueous solution , like compounds of other late lanthanides , soluble ytterbium compounds form complexes with nine water molecules . Because of its closed @-@ shell electron configuration , its density and melting and boiling points differ from those of the other lanthanides . 
 In 1878 , the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac separated in the rare earth " erbia " another independent component , which he called " ytterbia " , for Ytterby , the village in Sweden near where he found the new component of erbium . He suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called " ytterbium " ( in total , four elements were named after the village , the others being yttrium , terbium and erbium ) . In 1907 , the new earth " lutecia " was separated from ytterbia , from which the element " lutecium " ( now lutetium ) was extracted by Georges Urbain , Carl Auer von Welsbach , and Charles James . After some discussion , Marignac 's name " ytterbium " was retained . A relatively pure sample of the metal was obtained only in 1953 . At present , ytterbium is mainly used as a dopant of stainless steel or active laser media , and less often as a gamma ray source . 
 Natural ytterbium is a mixture of seven stable isotopes , which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million . This element is mined in China , the United States , Brazil , and India in form of the minerals monazite , euxenite , and xenotime . The ytterbium concentration is low , because the element is found among many other rare earth elements ; moreover , it is among the least abundant ones . Once extracted and prepared , ytterbium is somewhat hazardous as an eye and skin irritant . The metal is a fire and explosion hazard .

 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Ytterbium is a soft , malleable and ductile chemical element that displays a bright silvery luster when in its pure form . It is a rare earth element , and it is readily attacked and dissolved by the strong mineral acids . It reacts slowly with cold water and it oxidizes slowly in air . 
 Ytterbium has three allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha , beta and gamma ; their transformation temperatures are − 13 ° C and 795 ° C , although the exact transformation temperature depends on the pressure and stress . The beta allotrope exists at room temperature , and it has a face @-@ centered cubic crystal structure . The high @-@ temperature gamma allotrope has a body @-@ centered cubic crystalline structure . The alpha allotrope has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures . Normally , the beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity , but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16 @,@ 000 atmospheres ( 1 @.@ 6 GPa ) . Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39 @,@ 000 atmospheres ( 3 @.@ 9 GPa ) , but then drops to about 10 % of its room @-@ temperature resistivity at about 40 @,@ 000 atm ( 4 @.@ 0 GPa ) . 
 In contrast with the other rare @-@ earth metals , which usually have antiferromagnetic and / or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures , ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1 @.@ 0 kelvin . However , the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic . With a melting point of 824 ° C and a boiling point of 1196 ° C , ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals . 
 Contrary to most other lanthanides , which have a close @-@ packed hexagonal lattice , ytterbium crystallizes in the face @-@ centered cubic structure . As a result , its density ( 6 @.@ 973 g / cm3 ) is significantly lower than , e.g. , those of the neighboring elements thulium ( 9 @.@ 32 g / cm3 ) and lutetium ( 9 @.@ 841 g / cm3 ) . The melting and boiling points of ytterbium are also significantly lower than those of thulium and lutetium . These properties stem from the closed @-@ shell electron configuration of ytterbium ( [ Xe ] <unk> <unk> ) , which causes only the two 6s electrons to be available for metallic bonding ( in contrast to the other lanthanides where three electrons are available ) . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Ytterbium metal tarnishes slowly in air . Finely dispersed ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen . Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with <unk> or <unk> burn with a luminous emerald @-@ green flame . Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non @-@ stoichiometric hydrides . Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water , but quickly in acids , liberating hydrogen gas . 
 Ytterbium is quite electropositive , and it reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form ytterbium ( III ) hydroxide : 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 6 H2O ( l ) → 2 Yb ( OH ) 3 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 Ytterbium reacts with all the halogens : 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 3 F2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) [ white ] 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 3 Cl2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) [ white ] 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 3 Br2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) [ white ] 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 3 I2 ( g ) → 2 <unk> ( s ) [ white ] 
 The ytterbium ( III ) ion absorbs light in the near infrared range of wavelengths , but not in visible light , so the mineral ytterbia , <unk> , is white in color and the salts of ytterbium are also colorless . Ytterbium dissolves readily in dilute sulfuric acid to form solutions that contain the colorless Yb ( III ) ions , which exist as <unk> complexes : 
 2 Yb ( s ) + 3 H2SO4 ( aq ) → 2 [ Yb ( H2O ) 9 ] 3 + ( aq ) + 3 SO2 − 
 4 ( aq ) + 3 H2 ( g ) 
 = = = Yb ( II ) vs. Yb ( III ) = = = 
 Although usually trivalent , ytterbium readily forms divalent compounds . This behavior is unusual to most lanthanides , which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of + 3 . The + 2 state has a valence electron configuration of <unk> because the fully filled f @-@ shell gives more stability . The yellow @-@ green ytterbium ( II ) ion is a very strong reducing agent and decomposes water , releasing hydrogen gas , and thus only the colorless ytterbium ( III ) ion occurs in aqueous solution . Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the + 2 state , but europium ( II ) is stable in aqueous solution . Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals , dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Natural ytterbium is composed of seven stable isotopes : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , 174Yb , and <unk> , with 174Yb being the most abundant isotope , at 31 @.@ 8 % of the natural abundance ) . 27 radioisotopes have been observed , with the most stable ones being 169Yb with a half @-@ life of 32 @.@ 0 days , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 4 @.@ 18 days , and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 56 @.@ 7 hours . All of its remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives that are less than two hours and most of these have half @-@ lives are less than 20 minutes . Ytterbium also has 12 meta states , with the most stable being <unk> ( t1 / 2 46 seconds ) . 
 The isotopes of ytterbium range in atomic weight from 147 @.@ <unk> atomic mass unit ( u ) for <unk> to 180 @.@ <unk> u for <unk> . The primary decay mode of ytterbium isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope , 174Yb , is electron capture , and the primary decay mode for those heavier than 174Yb is beta decay . The primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes lighter than 174Yb are thulium isotopes , and the primary decay products of ytterbium isotopes with heavier than 174Yb are lutetium isotopes . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 Ytterbium is found with other rare earth elements in several rare minerals . It is most often recovered commercially from monazite sand ( 0 @.@ 03 % ytterbium ) . The element is also found in euxenite and xenotime . The main mining areas are China , the United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka , and Australia ; and reserves of ytterbium are estimated as one million tonnes . Ytterbium is normally difficult to separate from other rare earths , but ion @-@ exchange and solvent extraction techniques developed in the mid- to late 20th century have simplified separation . Known compounds of ytterbium are rare and have not yet been well characterized . The abundance of ytterbium in the Earth 's crust is about 3 mg / kg . 
 As an even @-@ numbered lanthanide , in accordance with the Oddo @-@ Harkins rule , ytterbium is significantly more abundant than its immediate neighbors , thulium and lutetium , which occur in the same concentrate at levels of about 0 @.@ 5 % each . The world production of ytterbium is only about 50 tonnes per year , reflecting the fact that ytterbium has few commercial applications . Microscopic traces of ytterbium are used as a dopant in the Yb : YAG laser , a solid @-@ state laser in which ytterbium is the element that undergoes stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation . 
 = = Production = = 
 It is somewhat difficult to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties . As a result , the process is somewhat long . First , minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids , such as sulfuric acid . Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange , as can other lanthanides . The solution is then applied to a resin , which different lanthanides bond to in different matters . This is then dissolved using complexing agents , and due to the different types of bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides , it is possible to isolate the compounds . 
 Ytterbium is separated from other rare earths either by ion exchange or by reduction with sodium amalgam . In the latter method , a buffered acidic solution of trivalent rare earths is treated with molten sodium @-@ mercury alloy , which reduces and dissolves <unk> + . The alloy is treated with hydrochloric acid . The metal is extracted from the solution as oxalate and converted to oxide by heating . The oxide is reduced to metal by heating with lanthanum , aluminium , cerium or zirconium in high vacuum . The metal is purified by sublimation and collected over a condensed plate . 
 = = Compounds = = 
 The chemical behavior of ytterbium is similar to that of the rest of the lanthanides . Most ytterbium compounds are found in the + 3 oxidation state and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless . Like europium , samarium , and thulium , the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen , zinc dust , or by the addition of metallic ytterbium . The + 2 oxidation state only occurs in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the alkaline earth metal compounds ; for example , ytterbium ( II ) oxide ( <unk> ) shows the same structure as calcium oxide ( CaO ) . 
 = = = Halides = = = 
 Ytterbium forms both dihalides and trihalides with the halogens fluorine , chlorine , bromine , and iodine . The dihalides are susceptible to oxidation to the trihalides at room temperature and disproportionate to the trihalides and metallic ytterbium at high temperature : 
 3 <unk> → 2 <unk> + Yb ( X = F , Cl , Br , I ) 
 Some ytterbium halides are used as reagents in organic synthesis . For example , ytterbium ( III ) chloride ( <unk> ) is a Lewis acid and can be used as a catalyst in the <unk> and Diels – Alder reactions . Ytterbium ( II ) iodide ( <unk> ) may be used , like samarium ( II ) iodide , as a reducing agent for coupling reactions . Ytterbium ( III ) fluoride ( <unk> ) is used as an inert and non @-@ toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions , which are good for dental health , and is also a good X @-@ ray contrast agent . 
 = = = Oxides = = = 
 Ytterbium reacts with oxygen to form ytterbium ( III ) oxide ( <unk> ) , which crystallizes in the " rare @-@ earth C @-@ type sesquioxide " structure which is related to the fluorite structure with one quarter of the anions removed , leading to ytterbium atoms in two different six coordinate ( non @-@ octahedral ) environments . Ytterbium ( III ) oxide can be reduced to ytterbium ( II ) oxide ( <unk> ) with elemental ytterbium , which crystallizes in the same structure as sodium chloride . 
 = = History = = 
 Ytterbium was discovered by the Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in the year 1878 . While examining samples of gadolinite , Marignac found a new component in the earth then known as erbia , and he named it ytterbia , for Ytterby , the Swedish village near where he found the new component of erbium . Marignac suspected that ytterbia was a compound of a new element that he called " ytterbium " . 
 In 1907 , the French chemist Georges Urbain separated Marignac 's ytterbia into two components : <unk> and lutecia . <unk> would later become known as the element ytterbium , and lutecia would later be known as the element lutetium . The Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach independently isolated these elements from ytterbia at about the same time , but he called them aldebaranium and cassiopeium ; the American chemist Charles James also independently isolated these elements at about the same time . Urbain and Welsbach accused each other of publishing results based on the other party . The Commission on Atomic Mass , consisting of Frank Wigglesworth Clarke , Wilhelm Ostwald , and Georges Urbain , which was then responsible for the attribution of new element names , settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to Urbain and adopting his names as official ones , based on the fact that the separation of lutetium from Marignac 's ytterbium was first described by Urbain ; after Urbain 's names were recognized , neoytterbium was reverted to ytterbium . 
 The chemical and physical properties of ytterbium could not be determined with any precision until 1953 , when the first nearly pure ytterbium metal was produced by using ion @-@ exchange processes . The price of ytterbium was relatively stable between 1953 and 1998 at about US $ 1 @,@ 000 / kg .

 The 169Yb isotope ( with a half @-@ life of 32 days ) , which is created along with the short @-@ lived <unk> isotope ( half @-@ life 4 @.@ 2 days ) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors , has been used as a radiation source in portable X @-@ ray machines . Like X @-@ rays , the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body , but are blocked by bones and other dense materials . Thus , small 169Yb samples ( which emit gamma rays ) act like tiny X @-@ ray machines useful for radiography of small objects . Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X @-@ rays having energies between 250 and 350 keV . 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine .

 Ytterbium clocks hold the record for stability with ticks stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion ( 2 × 10 − 18 ) . The clocks developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) rely on about 10 @,@ 000 rare @-@ earth atoms cooled to 10 <unk> ( 10 millionths of a degree above absolute zero ) and trapped in an optical lattice — a series of pancake @-@ shaped wells made of laser light . Another laser that " ticks " 518 trillion times per second provokes a transition between two energy levels in the atoms . The large number of atoms is key to the clocks ' high stability .

 Ytterbium can also be used as a dopant to help improve the grain refinement , strength , and other mechanical properties of stainless steel . Some ytterbium alloys have rarely been used in dentistry . 
 = = = Ytterbium as dopant of active media = = = 
 The ytterbium + 3 ion is used as a doping material in active laser media , specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers . Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient , have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses ; ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser . Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1 @.@ 06 – 1 @.@ 12 µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900 nm – 1 µm , dependently on the host and application . The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling . 
 The kinetic of excitations in ytterbium @-@ doped materials is simple and can be described within the concept of effective cross @-@ sections ; for most ytterbium @-@ doped laser materials ( as for many other optically pumped gain media ) , the <unk> relation holds , although the application to the ytterbium @-@ doped composite materials was under discussion . 
 Usually , low concentrations of ytterbium are used . At high concentrations , the ytterbium @-@ doped materials show <unk> ( glass fibers ) or even a switch to broadband emission ( crystals and ceramics ) instead of efficient laser action . This effect may be related with not only overheating , but also with conditions of charge compensation at high concentrations of ytterbium ions . 
 Much progress has been made in the power scaling Lasers and Amplifiers produced with ytterbium ( Yb ) doped optical fibers . Power levels have increased from the 1 kW regimes due to the advancements in components as well as the Yb doped fibers themselves . Fabrication of Low NA , Large Mode Area ( LMA ) fibers enable achievement of near perfect beam qualities ( M2 < 1 @.@ 1 ) at power levels of 1 @.@ 5 kW to greater than 2 kW at ~ 1064 nm in a broadband configuration . Ytterbium @-@ doped LMA fibers also have the advantages of a larger mode field diameter ( MFD ) which negates the impacts of nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering ( SBS ) and stimulated Raman scattering ( SRS ) , which limit the achievement of higher power levels , and provides a distinct advantage over single mode ytterbium @-@ doped fibers . 
 In order to achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium @-@ based fiber systems all factors of the fiber must be considered . These can only be achieved via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters , ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties , in order to reduce the splice losses within the cavity . Power scaling also requires optimization of matching passive fibers within the optical cavity . The optimization of the ytterbium @-@ doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass , improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber and improved <unk> performance . All of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems .

 Ytterbium metal increases its electrical resistivity when subjected to high stresses . This property is used in stress gauges to monitor ground deformations from earthquakes and explosions . 
 Visible light waves oscillate faster than microwaves , and therefore optical clocks can be more precise than caesium atomic clocks . The Physikalisch @-@ Technische <unk> ( <unk> ) is working on several such optical clocks . The model with one single ytterbium ion caught in an ion trap is highly accurate . The optical clock based on it is exact to 17 digits after the decimal point . A pair of experimental atomic clocks based on ytterbium atoms at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) has set a new record for stability . NIST physicists report in the August 22 , 2013 issue of Science Express that the ytterbium clocks ' ticks are stable to within less than two parts in 1 quintillion ( 1 followed by 18 zeros ) , roughly 10 times better than the previous best published results for other atomic clocks . The clocks would be accurate within a second for a period comparable to the age of the universe . 
 Currently , ytterbium is being investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for kinematic infrared decoy flares . As ytterbium ( III ) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide , a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium @-@ based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium / Teflon / Viton ( MTV ) . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Although ytterbium is fairly stable chemically , it is stored in airtight containers and in an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen @-@ filled dry box to protect the metal from air and moisture . All compounds of ytterbium are treated as highly toxic , although initial studies appear to indicate that the danger is minimal . Ytterbium compounds are , however , known to cause irritation to the human skin and eyes , and some might be teratogenic . Metallic ytterbium dust can spontaneously combust , and the resulting fumes are hazardous . Ytterbium fires cannot be extinguished using water , and only dry chemical class D fire extinguishers can extinguish the fires .

 Philip Edward " Phil " Hartman ( September 24 , 1948 – May 28 , 1998 ; born Hartmann ) was a Canadian @-@ American actor , voice actor , comedian , screenwriter , and graphic artist . Born in Brantford , Ontario , Hartman and his family moved to the United States in 1958 . After graduating from California State University , Northridge , with a degree in graphic arts , he designed album covers for bands like Poco and America . Feeling the need for a more creative outlet , Hartman joined the comedy group The Groundlings in 1975 and there helped comedian Paul Reubens develop his character Pee @-@ wee Herman . Hartman co @-@ wrote the screenplay for the film Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure and made recurring appearances on Reubens ' show Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse . 
 Hartman garnered fame in 1986 when he joined the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live . He won fame for his impressions , particularly of President Bill Clinton , and he stayed on the show for eight seasons . Given the moniker " The Glue " for his ability to hold the show together and help other cast members , Hartman won a Primetime Emmy Award for his SNL work in 1989 . In 1995 , after scrapping plans for his own variety show , he starred as Bill McNeal in the NBC sitcom NewsRadio . He had voice roles on The Simpsons , from seasons 2 – 10 as Lionel Hutz , Troy McClure , and others , and appeared in the films <unk> , Sgt. Bilko , Jingle All the Way , Small Soldiers and the English dub of Kiki 's Delivery Service . 
 Hartman had been divorced twice before he married Brynn Omdahl in 1987 ; the couple had two children together . However , their marriage was fractured , due in part to Brynn 's drug use . On May 28 , 1998 , Brynn shot and killed Hartman while he slept in their Encino , Los Angeles , home , then committed suicide several hours later . In the weeks following his death , Hartman was celebrated in a wave of tributes . Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly opined that Hartman was " the last person you 'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper ... a decidedly regular guy , beloved by everyone he worked with " . Hartman was posthumously inducted into Canada 's Walk of Fame in 2012 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2014 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hartman was born Philip Edward Hartmann ( later dropping one " n " ) on September 24 , 1948 in Brantford , Ontario , Canada . He was the fourth of eight children of Doris Marguerite ( Wardell ) and Rupert <unk> Hartmann , a salesman specializing in building materials . His parents were Catholic and raised their children in that faith . As a middle child , Hartman found affection hard to earn and stated : " I suppose I didn 't get what I wanted out of my family life , so I started seeking love and attention elsewhere . " 
 He and his family moved to the United States in 1958 , gaining American citizenship in 1990 . The family first lived in Connecticut , and later moved to the West Coast . There , Hartman attended Westchester High School and frequently acted as the class clown . 
 After graduating , Hartman studied art at Santa Monica City College , dropping out in 1969 to become a roadie with a rock band . He returned to school in 1972 , this time studying graphic arts at California State University , Northridge . He developed his own graphic arts business , which he operated on his own , creating over 40 album covers for bands including Poco and America , as well as advertising and the logo for Crosby , Stills & Nash . In the late 1970s , Hartman made his first television appearance on an episode of The Dating Game ; he won but was stood up by his date .

While watching one of the troupe 's performances , Hartman impulsively decided to climb on stage and join the cast . After several years of training , paying his way by re @-@ designing the group 's logo and merchandise , Hartman formally joined the cast of The Groundlings ; by 1979 he had become one of the show 's stars . 
 Hartman met comedian Paul Reubens and the two became friends , often collaborating on writing and comedic material . Together they created the character Pee @-@ wee Herman and developed The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show , a stage performance which also aired on HBO in 1981 . Hartman played Captain Carl on The Pee @-@ wee Herman Show and returned in the role for the children 's show Pee @-@ wee 's Playhouse . Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong 's Next Movie . Hartman co @-@ wrote the script of the 1985 feature film Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure and had a cameo role as a reporter in the film . Although he had considered quitting acting at the age of 36 due to limited opportunities , the success of Pee @-@ wee 's Big Adventure brought new possibilities and changed his mind . After a creative falling @-@ out with Reubens , Hartman left the Pee @-@ Wee Herman project to pursue other roles . 
 In addition to his work with Reubens , Hartman recorded a number of voice @-@ over roles . These included appearances on The Smurfs , Challenge of the <unk> , The 13 Ghosts of Scooby @-@ Doo , and voicing characters Henry Mitchell and George Wilson on Dennis the Menace . Additionally Hartman developed a strong persona providing voice @-@ overs for advertisements .

 After appearing in the 1986 films Jumpin ' Jack Flash and ¡ Three Amigos ! , Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC 's variety show Saturday Night Live ( SNL ) and joined the cast and writing staff . He told the Los Angeles Times , " I wanted to do [ SNL ] because I wanted to get the exposure that would give me box @-@ office credibility so I can write movies for myself . " In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions , and performed as over 70 different characters . Hartman 's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene , the Anal <unk> Chef and <unk> Caveman Lawyer . His impressions included Frank Sinatra , Ronald Reagan , Ed McMahon , Barbara Bush , Charlton Heston , Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton ; the last was often considered his best @-@ known impression . 
 Hartman first performed his Clinton impression on an episode of The Tonight Show . When he met Clinton in 1993 Hartman remarked , " I guess I owe you a few apologies " , adding later that he " sometimes [ felt ] a twinge of guilt about [ his Clinton impression ] " . Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text : " You 're not the president , but you play one on TV . And you 're OK , mostly . " For his Clinton impression , Hartman copied the president 's " post @-@ nasal drip " and the " slight <unk> " in his voice , as well as his open , " less intimidating " hand gestures . Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton , as he felt it would be distracting . He instead wore a wig , dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose . One of Hartman 's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald 's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers ' food . The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – by the end of the live performance , Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak . 
 Backstage at SNL , Hartman was called " the Glue " , a name coined by Adam Sandler , according to Jay Mohr 's book <unk> for <unk> . However , according to a biography on Hartman 's life entitled You Might Remember Me : The Life and Times of Phil Hartman written by Mike Thomas , author and staff writer for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , the nickname was created by SNL cast member and Hartman 's frequent on @-@ screen collaborator Jan Hooks . Hartman often helped other cast members . For example , he aided Jan Hooks in overcoming her stage fright . SNL creator Lorne Michaels explained the reason for the name : " He kind of held the show together . He gave to everybody and demanded very little . He was very low @-@ maintenance . " Michaels also added that Hartman was " the least appreciated " cast member by commentators outside the show , and praised his ability " to do five or six parts in a show where you 're playing support or you 're doing remarkable character work " . Hartman won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety , Music or Comedy Program for SNL in 1989 , sharing the award with the show 's other writers . He was nominated in the same category in 1987 , and individually in 1994 for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program . 
 After his co @-@ stars Jon Lovitz , Dennis Miller , Jan Hooks and Dana Carvey had left , Hartman said he felt " like an athlete who 's watched all his World Series teammates get traded off into other directions ... It was hard to watch them leave because I sort of felt we were all part of the team that saved the show . " This cast turnover contributed to his leaving the show in 1994 . Hartman had originally planned to leave the show in 1991 , but Michaels convinced him to stay to raise his profile ; his portrayal of Clinton contributed to this goal . Jay Leno offered him the role of his sidekick on The Tonight Show but Hartman opted to stay on SNL . NBC persuaded him to stay on SNL by promising him his own comedy – variety show entitled The Phil Show . He planned to " reinvent the variety form " with " a hybrid , very fast @-@ paced , high energy [ show ] with sketches , impersonations , pet acts , and performers showcasing their talents " . Hartman was to be the show 's executive producer and head writer . Before production began , however , the network decided that variety shows were too unpopular and scrapped the series . In a 1996 interview , Hartman noted he was glad the show had been scrapped , as he " would 've been <unk> ' blood each week trying to make it work " . In 1998 , he admitted he missed working on SNL , but had enjoyed the move from New York City to Southern California .

 Hartman became one of the stars of the NBC sitcom NewsRadio in 1995 , portraying radio news anchor Bill McNeal . He signed up after being attracted by the show 's writing and use of an ensemble cast , and joked that he based McNeal on himself with " any ethics and character " removed . Hartman made roughly $ 50 @,@ 000 per episode of NewsRadio . Although the show was critically acclaimed , it was never a ratings hit and cancellation was a regular threat . After the completion of the fourth season , Hartman commented , " We seem to have limited appeal . We 're on the edge here , not sure we 're going to be picked up or not " , but added he was " 99 percent sure " the series would be renewed for a fifth season . Hartman had publicly lambasted NBC 's decision to repeatedly move NewsRadio into different timeslots , but later regretted his comments , saying , " this is a sitcom , for crying out loud , not brain surgery " . He also stated that if the sitcom were cancelled " it just will open up other opportunities for me " . Although the show was renewed for a fifth season , Hartman died before production began . Ken Tucker praised Hartman 's performance as McNeal : " A lesser performer ... would have played him as a variation on The Mary Tyler Moore Show 's Ted Baxter , because that 's what Bill was , on paper . But Hartman gave infinite variety to Bill 's self @-@ centeredness , turning him devious , cowardly , squeamish , and foolishly bold from week to week . " Hartman was posthumously nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1998 for his work on NewsRadio , but lost to David Hyde Pierce .

 Hartman provided the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series The Simpsons , appearing in 52 episodes . He made his first appearance in the second season episode " Bart Gets Hit by a Car " . Although he was originally brought in for a one @-@ time appearance , Hartman enjoyed working on The Simpsons and the staff wrote additional parts for him . He voiced the recurring characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure , as well as several one @-@ time and background characters . His favorite part was that of McClure , and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio . He remarked , " My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans . " He added " It 's the one thing that I do in my life that 's almost an avocation . I do it for the pure love of it . " 
 Hartman was popular among the staff of The Simpsons . Showrunners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein stated that they enjoyed his work , and used Hartman as much as possible when working on the show . To give Hartman a larger role , they developed the episode " A Fish Called Selma " , which focuses on Troy McClure and expands the character 's backstory . The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said that he " took [ Hartman ] for granted because he nailed the joke every time " , and that his voice acting could produce " the maximum amount of humor " with any line he was given . Before his death , Hartman had expressed an interest in making a live action film about Troy McClure . Many of The Simpsons production staff expressed enthusiasm for the project and offered to help . Hartman said he was " looking forward to [ McClure 's ] live @-@ action movie , publicizing his Betty Ford appearances " , and " would love nothing more " than making a film and was prepared to buy the film rights himself in order to make it happen .

His other television roles included appearances on episodes of Seinfeld , The John Larroquette Show , The Dana Carvey Show , and the HBO TV film The Second Civil War as the President of the United States . He appeared as the kidnapper Randy in the third season cliffhanger finale of 3rd Rock from the Sun — a role reportedly written especially for him , but he died before filming of the concluding episode could take place . Executive producer Terry Turner decided to recast the part , reshoot and air the finale again , noting : " I have far too much respect for [ Hartman ] to try to find some clever way of getting around this real tragedy . " Hartman made a considerable amount of money from television advertising , earning $ 300 @,@ 000 for a series of four commercials for the soft drink Slice . He also appeared in advertisements for McDonalds ( as Hugh <unk> ) and 1 @-@ 800 @-@ Collect ( as Max Jerome ) . 
 Hartman wrote a number of screenplays that were never produced . In 1986 he began writing a screenplay for a film titled Mr. Fix @-@ It , and completed the final draft in 1991 . Robert Zemeckis was signed to produce the film , with Gil Bettman hired to direct . Hartman called it " a sort of a merger of horror and comedy , like Beetlejuice and Throw Momma From the Train " , adding , " It 's an American nightmare about a family torn asunder . They live next to a toxic dump site , their water supply is poisoned , the mother and son go insane and try to murder each other , the father 's face is torn off in a terrible disfiguring accident in the first act . It 's heavy stuff , but it 's got a good message and a positive , upbeat ending . " Zemeckis could not secure studio backing , however , and the project collapsed . Another movie idea involving Hartman 's Groundlings character Chick Hazard , Private Eye also fell through .
