 Tropical Storm Beryl was an unusual Atlantic tropical cyclone that formed over southeastern Louisiana in August 1988 . The second tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season , Beryl developed from a slow @-@ moving trough of low pressure on August 8 . It tracked southeastward into the coastal waters of eastern Louisiana , and Beryl reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) while located about 75 miles ( 120 km ) southeast of New Orleans . The storm turned to the northwest over Louisiana and Texas , and slowly dissipated . The remnants of Beryl continued northward into the central United States , dropping some rainfall and providing relief to a severe heat wave . 
 Due to its slow motion , Beryl dropped heavy amounts of rainfall , peaking at 16 @.@ 09 inches ( 408 mm ) on Dauphin Island in Alabama . The rainfall caused some reports of flooding , while prolonged durations of rough waves resulted in severe beach erosion . The waves capsized a boat in Mobile Bay , killing one of its passengers . Overall damage was minor , totaling about $ 3 million ( 1988 USD , $ 5 @.@ 46 million 2009 USD ) .

 A weak surface trough of low pressure emerged into the northeast Gulf of Mexico on August 1 . Under weak steering currents , the trough drifted westward , and slowly became better defined with the formation of a circulation in the mid- through upper @-@ levels of the atmosphere . An upper @-@ level low developed over Texas , providing unfavorable amounts of vertical wind shear . A surface circulation was first evident on satellite imagery on August 4 just off the coast of Mississippi , and for several days it remained nearly stationary over the Mississippi Sound . As the upper @-@ level low over Texas drifted southwestward , an anticyclone developed over the system , with the circulation becoming better defined and more vertically aligned . On August 7 , the system drifted into southeastern Louisiana . It continued to become better organized , and on August 8 it developed into Tropical Depression Three while located near the northern coast of Lake Pontchartrain . This is unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form over land . 
 Upon becoming a tropical cyclone , the depression drifted southeastward , and within hours of its formation it emerged into the Gulf of Mexico . Based on ship reports and observations from oil rigs , it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl at 1000 UTC on August 8 while located just offshore coastal Louisiana . Conditions remained favorable for further intensification , with the circulation located over warm waters and maintaining well @-@ defined outflow ; early on August 9 Beryl attained its peak intensity of 50 mph while located about 75 miles ( 120 km ) southeast of New Orleans . Shortly thereafter , a trough from the northwest dissipated the anticyclone and resulted in a steady northwest motion very near where the cyclone originally moved offshore . Beryl maintained tropical storm status for about 18 hours before weakening to a tropical depression over central Louisiana . It turned to the northwest , and the surface circulation dissipated on August 10 while located a short distance south of Shreveport , Louisiana . The surface low pressure area crossed into north Texas before dissipating early on August 12 , while its upper @-@ level circulation turned northward into Oklahoma before being merged by an approaching trough .

 Upon becoming a tropical storm , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Pensacola , Florida . Six hours later , the warning was extended westward to Morgan City , Louisiana . The threat of Beryl prompted some voluntary evacuations in St. Bernard Parish in Louisiana , and also forced the evacuations of thousands from offshore oil rigs . Officials advised small craft to remain at port from Port O 'Connor , Texas to Pensacola , Florida . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Rainfall from the storm reached over 7 inches ( 175 mm ) a short distance east of Pensacola , Florida , though impact in the state was minor . Wind gusts peaked at 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) in Pensacola . In Alabama , Beryl produced sustained winds of 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) , with gusts to 54 mph ( 86 km / h ) , as well as above normal tides . The storm dropped heavy rainfall in coastal portions of Alabama , peaking at 16 @.@ 09 inches ( 408 mm ) on Dauphin Island . Rough waves overturned a shrimp boat in Mobile Bay . A 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy on the boat drowned , the only direct fatality from the storm . The boy 's father , also on the boat , spent 24 hours in the water before being rescued by the United States Coast Guard . The waves caused severe beach erosion along the coastline , with Dauphin Island losing 60 to 70 feet ( 18 to 21 m ) of beach . 
 In Mississippi , coastal areas reported heavy amounts of precipitation , reaching over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) in Jackson County . Sustained winds reached 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) at Gulfport , the strongest wind on a land station . Similar to Alabama , strong waves caused considerable beach erosion along portions of the coastline . 
 Beryl dropped rainfall across much of Louisiana , peaking at over 10 inches ( 250 mm ) near Morgan City . The rainfall caused significant river flooding along the Biloxi River . Wind gusts were fairly light across the state , reaching 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) in New Orleans . The winds caused light tree damage , which resulted in some power outages . A storm surge of about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) caused some coastal flooding . 
 The remnants of Beryl produced locally heavy precipitation peaking at about 12 inches ( 300 mm ) in east @-@ central Texas , resulting in some reports of flash flooding . The rainfall flooded some roads and also causes severe river flooding on the Angelina River . Remnant moisture dropped about 5 inches ( 125 mm ) of rain in southeast Oklahoma and 3 inches ( 75 mm ) in southwestern Arkansas . Further inland , the remnants of Beryl cooled temperatures and provided relief to the severe heat wave in the central United States . 
 Throughout its path , Beryl caused about $ 3 million in damage ( 1988 USD , $ 5 @.@ 46 million 2009 USD ) , primarily along the immediate coastline from erosion or flood damage .

 Clark Thomas Rogerson , ( 2 October 1918 – 7 September 2001 ) , was an American mycologist . He was known for his work in the Hypocreales ( Ascomycota ) , particularly Hypomyces , a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi . After receiving his doctorate from Cornell University in 1950 , he went on to join the faculty of Kansas State University . In 1958 , he became a curator at The New York Botanical Garden , and served as editor for various academic journals published by the Garden . Rogerson was involved with the Mycological Society of America , serving in various positions , including President in 1969 . He was Managing Editor ( 1958 – 89 ) and Editor @-@ in @-@ chief ( 1960 – 65 ) of the scientific journal Mycologia . 
 = = Biography = = 
 C.T. Rogerson was born on October 2 , 1918 , in Ogden , Utah , to parents Elijah Knapp Rogerson ( 1899 – 1956 ) and Mable <unk> Clarke Rogerson ( 1897 – 1987 ) . Upon graduating from high school in 1936 , he enrolled in Weber Junior College ( since renamed to Weber State University ) for the following two years . Rogerson then attended Utah State University , where he had hoped to work under the supervision of botanist Bassett Maguire , but settled instead for the only available studentship with plant pathologist B.L. Richards . Rogerson received his bachelor of science from Utah State University in 1940 . Soon after , he was drafted into the army , and spent three years ( 1942 – 1945 ) in the Pacific Theater of World War II . He served as a technical sergeant in laboratory and pharmacy at an army evacuation hospital , and cared for internees released in the Philippines near the war 's end . During his war years , Rogerson made collections of plants , fungi , slime molds , and butterflies that he sent to Cornell or to the Smithsonian Institution . 
 After the war finished , Rogerson continued studying fungal systematics and started a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University ; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick 's graduate students at the time . Under Fitzpatrick , Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their <unk> . Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950 , and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson 's advisor for the last few months of his doctoral program . Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950 . That year , he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor , but he would ultimately advance to associate professor . While at Kansas , he worked on the identification of fungi , and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties , aeromycology ( the fungal flora of air ) , and plant diseases caused by fungi . 
 In 1958 , the director of The New York Botanical Garden , William Jacob Robbins , recruited Rogerson for the position of Curator of Cryptogamic Botany . Rogerson became Senior Curator in 1967 and Senior Curator Emeritus at his retirement in 1990 . As curator of cryptogamic botany , Rogerson " was directly responsible for all accessions and loans of ferns and mosses , as well as of fungi and lichens , until about 1965 when , first a <unk> and later a <unk> were added to the cryptogamic staff . " At the Garden , he also continued his study on the taxonomy of the Ascomycetes , especially of Hypomyces , a genus of fungi that parasitize other fungi , and the fungal diversity of New York and Utah . Additionally , he served as editor of the Garden 's publications : Memoirs of the New York Botanical Garden ( 1963 – 88 ) , North American Flora ( 1963 – 88 ) , and Flora <unk> ( 1969 – 83 ) . While at the Garden , Rogerson was also an adjunct professor of biology at Columbia University and at the Herbert H. Lehman College of the City University of New York . 
 During his tenure at the Garden , Rogerson was also a deeply involved member of the Mycological Society of America ( MSA ) . He served as Managing editor ( 1958 – 89 ) and Editor @-@ in @-@ chief ( 1960 – 65 ) of the scientific journal Mycologia . He was Vice @-@ President ( 1967 ) , President Elect ( 1968 ) , and President of the MSA ( 1969 ) , and secretary @-@ treasurer of the society from 1973 to 1974 . He has served as historian of the Mycological Society of America from 1960 to 1990 . Rogerson was a generous donor to MSA student travel awards . He died in Ogden on September 7 , 2001 . 
 = = Mycological contributions = = 
 Rogerson added many thousands of records of fungi , mainly from Utah , to the Garden herbarium , where his specimens are available for study by systematists . Rogerson assisted in the formation of the three major amateur mushroom groups in the New York City area : the New York Mycological Association , the New Jersey Mycological Association , and the Connecticut @-@ Westchester Mycological Association ( COMA ) . He helped amateur mycologists correctly identify fungal specimens during his weekends . " In return , amateur mycologists provided him with many specimens of <unk> Hypomyces . " 
 In 1970 , Rogerson presented a detailed history of the Hypocreales and reviewed changes in the circumscription of the order up to that time . His publication included keys to the genera of both the Hypocreales and <unk> , followed by a list of genera , each with the literature citation of the original descriptions and type species . He included 115 genera in the Hypocreales .

 Clark T. Rogerson belongs to the Dudley mycological lineage , which can be traced back to Anton De Bary , a famous German mycologist . William Russell Dudley was Assistant Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at Cornell University from 1883 to 1892 , and received mycological training from De Bary in 1887 . Joseph Charles Arthur , George Francis Atkinson , and Mason B. Thomas studied under Dudley . Thomas went to Wabash College , where he would influence Harry Morton Fitzpatrick to study mycology . Fitzpatrick received his Ph.D. in 1913 at Cornell under tutelage of Atkinson . Rogerson studied under Fitzpatrick at Cornell from 1946 to 1950 . Contemporary to Rogerson was fellow student Richard P. Korf , another prominent mycologist . Students of Rogerson include Robert L. Shaffer ( Kansas State ; M.A. ) , Susan Carey Canham ( Columbia University ; Ph.D. ) , Anna F. Doyle ( Columbia University ; Ph.D. ) , Gary J. Samuels ( Columbia University ; Ph.D. ) , and Rosalind Lowen ( Lehman College ; Ph.D. ) . Katia F. Rodrigues and Priscila Chaverri ( Penn State ; Ph.D. ) studied under Samuels . The Rogerson sublineage continues to expand under Chaverri at the University of Maryland .

 = Felix Leiter = 
 Felix Leiter is a fictional character created by Ian Fleming in the James Bond series . The character is an operative for the CIA and Bond 's friend . After losing a leg and his hand to a shark attack , Leiter joined the Pinkerton Detective Agency . The name " Felix " comes from the middle name of Fleming 's friend Ivor Bryce , while the name " Leiter " was the surname of Fleming 's friend Marion Oates Leiter Charles , then wife of Thomas Leiter . 
 Leiter also appeared in novels by continuation authors , as well as ten films and one television programme , Casino Royale , where the character became a British agent , Clarence Leiter , played by Michael Pate . In the Eon Productions series of films , Leiter has been portrayed by Jack Lord , Cec Linder , Rik Van Nutter , Norman Burton , David Hedison , John Terry and Jeffrey Wright ; in the independent production Never Say Never Again , the part was played by Bernie Casey . Leiter has also appeared in the video game 007 Legends .

 Felix Leiter , James Bond 's CIA ally and friend , played a part in six of the Fleming novels ; he is introduced in Casino Royale as being thin , tall , about thirty @-@ five years old and a former member of the U.S. Marine Corps who was working with the Joint Intelligence Staff of NATO . Fleming named the character after two of his American friends : " Felix " was Ivar Bryce 's middle name , whilst Tommy Leiter was a mutual friend . Academic Kerstin <unk> describes Leiter as " a cool and quiet no @-@ nonsense character who knows 007 's strengths and weaknesses well " . Physically , Fleming describes Leiter in Casino Royale : " a mop of straw @-@ coloured hair lent his face a boyish look which closer examination contradicted " . 
 Leiter is Bond 's saviour in Casino Royale , providing him with 32 million francs when Bond has been cleaned out by SMERSH paymaster Le Chiffre , calling it " Marshall Aid " . Media historian James Chapman notes that Bond 's relationship with Leiter represented the Special Relationship between Britain and America , although the American Leiter is in the subordinate position to the British Bond . Academic Jeremy Black agrees , although points out that the Bond and Leiter relationship suggested " a far smoother working of the Anglo @-@ American alliance than was in fact the case . " Academic and writer Kingsley Amis , in his exploration of Bond in The James Bond Dossier , considered that this view of Leiter was partly because of Fleming 's writing , noting that " Leiter , such a nonentity as a piece of characterization ... he , the American , takes orders from Bond , the Britisher , and that Bond is constantly doing better than he " . Bond scholars Bennett and Woollacott note that although the two men share adventures , it is Bond who leads , not Leiter . Leiter 's role is to " <unk> [ y ] Bond with technical support and hardware , add ... muscle where needed and money " . 
 Fleming 's second novel , Live and Let Die shows that in his early twenties , Leiter wrote a few pieces on Dixieland jazz for the New York Amsterdam News . Bond scholar John Griswold notes that in the original draft of the story , Fleming killed Leiter off in the shark attack ; when Naomi Burton , Fleming 's US agent with Curtis Brown , protested about the death of the character , Fleming relented and Leiter lived , albeit missing an arm and half a leg . Espionage scholar Rupert <unk> , writing as Nigel West , noted that Leiter 's involvement in a domestic US matter was a breach of the CIA 's charter , as laid out in the National Security Act of 1947 . 
 After the shark attack , Leiter returned in Diamonds Are Forever with a hook for his missing hand and a prosthetic leg ; as he had lost his gun hand , he was no longer with the CIA , but employed as a private detective by Pinkerton Detective Agency , although he was on the reserve of the CIA and was recalled for Goldfinger , Thunderball and The Man with the Golden Gun . Fleming had flown to the US in August 1954 to research the background to Diamonds Are Forever ; his friend Ernest Cuneo introduced him to a rich socialite , William Woodward , Jr . , who drove a Studillac — a Studebaker with a powerful Cadillac engine . According to Bond scholar Henry Chancellor , " the speed and comfort of it impressed Ian , and he shamelessly appropriated this car " for Leiter to drive in the novel . 
 For the post @-@ Fleming continuation Bond authors , Leiter has also appeared on a periodic basis . After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series , Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For Special Services introduces his daughter , Cedar Leiter , who is also a CIA officer ( and briefly Bond 's romantic conquest ) . Raymond Benson also included Leiter 's character in some of his novels , including The Facts of Death and <unk> . Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels — the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver — both contained the character .

 The first screen interpretation of the Leiter character was in the 1954 CBS one @-@ hour television adventure Casino Royale , broadcast as part of the dramatic anthology series Climax Mystery Theater , which ran between October 1954 and June 1958 . For the American audience the Bond character from Casino Royale was re @-@ cast as an American agent — " Card Sense " Jimmy Bond , played by Barry Nelson — described as working for " Combined Intelligence " , supported by the British agent , Clarence Leiter ; " thus was the Anglo @-@ American relationship depicted in the book reversed for American consumption " , according to Jeremy Black . Leiter , who was an agent for Station S , was a combination of the novel 's Felix Leiter and René Mathis and was played by the Australian actor Michael Pate .

 Jack Lord was the first Felix Leiter , appointed into the role for the first Bond film , Dr. No . Eon Productions started filming the series out of the order written by Fleming ( Fleming had started with Casino Royale , with Dr. No being the sixth novel ) . Leiter was not present in the Fleming novel , but the writers added the character to the film . Bond scholars Smith and Lavington consider Leiter to offer negligible help to Bond , largely because there is no role for him in the novel , a point with which continuation Bond author Raymond Benson agrees , noting that he is " extraneous to the dramatic action " . Jeremy Black agrees , although points out that the inclusion of Leiter was a sign of American influence in the Caribbean . 
 Lord played Leiter in a " swaggering " fashion , according to Smith and Lavington , and they considered him " excellent , an effective American version of James Bond . " Bond scholars Pfeiffer and Worrall agree , stating that Lord 's was " one of the most satisfying portrayals of Leiter " .

 When the role of Leiter was brought back for the third Bond film , Goldfinger , in 1964 , Lord was again approached to play Leiter ; according to screenwriter Richard Maibaum , Lord demanded co @-@ star billing with Connery , a bigger role and more money to reprise the role . The producers instead decided to recast the role , initially with Austin Willis . At the last minute , Cec Linder switched roles with Willis , who played cards with Goldfinger . Linder was the only actor actually on location in Miami . Raymond Benson considers that Linder was " miscast " as Leiter because he looked too old : " he looks like Bond 's uncle rather than his best friend . "

 The fourth film in the Eon series , Thunderball , was the third to portray Leiter and the producers chose a third actor to play the role , Rik Van Nutter . Van Nutter was married to Swedish actress Anita Ekberg at the time and the couple had dined with Cubby and Dana Broccoli after Ekberg had appeared in the Eon @-@ produced Call Me Bwana . Van Nutter was subsequently offered the Leiter role without an audition , although he did have screen tests with some of the Bond girls . 
 According to Pfeiffer and Worrall , Leiter had a more proactive role in Thunderball and Van Nutter was " an inspired choice for the role " . Smith and Lavington agree and consider that Van Nutter 's " relaxed and charming performance works well . " Benson also concurs , but complains that although Van Nutter is a piece of successful casting , " the script ... does not give the character any real depth " .

 For the 1971 instalment , Diamonds Are Forever , Eon chose Norman Burton . Burton 's Leiter was more amusing and more exasperated than the previous incarnations of the role . 
 Raymond Benson again considers that the Leiter role was miscast and considered Burton to be " overweight and too old for the role " . Smith and Lavington describe him as " an elderly , portly man in a government @-@ issue suit ... anonymous , orthodox " . Pfeiffer and Worrall agree , thinking that Burton was " the least likely incarnation " of Leiter .

 In 1973 the Bond franchise introduced a new main lead , Roger Moore , who played Bond for the next twelve years in seven films . To play the part of Leiter in Live and Let Die , an old friend of Moore 's was chosen , David Hedison . Pfeiffer and Worrall consider that this friendship comes through , with " genuine chemistry " between the two . Hedison played the role with an understated charm , although the script did not give Leiter much to do . Raymond Benson thought him miscast , but acknowledged that " he 's the best Leiter next to Rik Van Nutter . " 
 Hedison returned to play Leiter sixteen years later in Licence to Kill and after another actor had also been in the role . Hedison did not expect to return to the role , saying " I was sure that ... [ Live and Let Die ] would be my first – and last " and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61 @-@ year @-@ old actor , since the role even had a scene parachuting . Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter twice until Jeffrey Wright appeared in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace . 
 Leiter is central to the plot of Licence to Kill . Now working with the DEA , Leiter and Bond work together to capture drug lord Franz Sanchez on the way to Leiter 's wedding , at which Bond serves as Best Man . A short time , Leiter and his wife Della are attacked by an escaped Sanchez , who kills Della and tortures Leiter by lowering him into a tank containing a great white shark . Bond finds Leiter maimed but alive , and seeks revenge on Sanchez , paving the way for the rest of the film 's plot . At the film 's end , Leiter is shown recovering in the hospital .

 Following Hedison 's first outing in 1973 in Live and Let Die , the Leiter role did not appear again until the 1987 film The Living Daylights , by which time Bond was being played by Timothy Dalton ; the role was taken up by John Terry . 
 Smith and Lavington consider that , although the scene between Bond and Leiter sees warmth in the relationship between them , " it is too fleeting to have any impact " . Pfeiffer and Worrall agree on the briefness of Leiter 's role in the film , although they consider that Terry has " virtually no chemistry with Dalton " .

 " Exposé " is the 14th episode of the 3rd season and 63rd episode overall of the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) ' s serial drama television series Lost . It aired on ABC in the United States and on CTV in Canada on March 28 , 2007 . The episode was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Stephen Williams . 
 The episode 's story focuses on couple Nikki Fernandez ( Kiele Sanchez ) and Paulo ( Rodrigo Santoro ) . The flashbacks reveal their lives before arriving on the island , and what they have been doing between day one and day eighty @-@ one . Boone Carlyle ( Ian Somerhalder ) returned for the fifth time since his death late in the first season . Furthermore , Ethan ( William Mapother ) and Dr. Arzt ( Daniel Roebuck ) reprised their guest roles in flashbacks . The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans , with positive reception considering it an entertaining send @-@ off to two unpopular characters , but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary .

 = = = Flashbacks = = = 
 The flashbacks begin with Nikki Fernandez ( Kiele Sanchez ) acting in a popular , Charlie 's Angels @-@ like TV show Exposé filmed in Sydney , in which she is a guest star . She is also having an affair with the septuagenarian executive producer , Howard L. Zuckerman , who is very wealthy , while Paulo ( Rodrigo Santoro ) works as his chef . Paulo kills Zuckerman by poisoning his food , and the couple steals his diamonds , which are worth $ 8 million . The couple plan on returning to the United States on Oceanic Flight 815 , encountering Boone Carlyle ( Ian Somerhalder ) and Shannon Rutherford ( Maggie Grace ) at the airport . Upon surviving the plane crash , Nikki and Paulo realize that they have lost the bag with the diamonds . Nikki consults Dr. Leslie Arzt ( Daniel Roebuck ) , who tells her of a spider with the ability to paralyze people . He also gives her a trajectory map which leads them to The Pearl and the Nigerian plane ; they explore neither . When Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) mentions that she found luggage from the plane in a lake , Paulo finds the diamonds , but does not tell Nikki . Instead , he hides them in the toilet at The Pearl and overhears a conversation between Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) and Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) . The two accidentally leave behind a walkie @-@ talkie that Paulo takes . Later , when Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) , John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) , Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) , Nikki and Paulo visit The Pearl , Paulo retrieves the diamonds by pretending to use the bathroom . Nikki figures out that Paulo has found the diamonds without telling her and decides to lure him into a trap . When he denies that he has the diamonds she unleashes one of the paralyzing spiders on him . She finds the diamonds and Paulo apologizes , claiming that he did it so that she would not end their relationship . As Nikki stands in a state of regret , the pheromones of the female spider attract a group of the male spiders of the same species and she is bitten on her leg . She buries the diamonds and sprints to the beach . 
 = = = On the beach = = = 
 Nikki then runs onto the beach , before collapsing where Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) and James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) are playing ping pong . As Hurley and Sawyer rush to her , she says something barely audible . She is soon pronounced dead . Hurley and Sawyer try to recount what Nikki said before she died and come to the conclusion that she said , " Paulo lies " , although she actually said " paralyzed " . Sawyer and Hurley begin an investigation and find Paulo lying lifeless in the jungle . Sawyer finds a walkie talkie in Nikki and Paulo 's tent , and concludes they were working with the Others , due to the similarity . Hurley does not think the Others are near their camp , but Sun @-@ Hwa Kwon ( Yunjin Kim ) reminds them that she was abducted nearby ( unaware that it was Charlie who grabbed her ) . Sawyer tries to calm them down and says he will do a perimeter sweep . Meanwhile , Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) , who feels guilty , confesses to Sun that it was he who attempted to kidnap her . Sawyer returns , having found the diamonds , and the other survivors accuse him of being the killer because Desmond saw him arguing with Nikki just that morning . He gives the diamonds to Sun , but she later confronts him about kidnapping her and returns the diamonds because " they 're worthless here . " The survivors then hold a funeral for Nikki and Paulo , where Sawyer pours the pouch of diamonds into the grave . Nikki 's eyelids open just as Hurley and Sawyer are filling the grave , burying her and Paulo alive .

 " Exposé " was the fourteenth episode of the series directed by Stephen Williams , and the ninth written by the screenwriting duo Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz . Kitsis and Horowitz intended to make the episode an homage to film noir , with two con artists who did the " perfect crime " , that eventually goes wrong due to them getting stranded on the island . A reference to the genre was added by having Sawyer read Agatha Christie 's Evil Under the Sun . A recurring theme is Nikki and Paulo 's selfishness , which eventually leads to their deaths due to them being greedy and " too focused on their own petty needs to really care about anyone else " . 
 The flashbacks of " Exposé " would show how Nikki and Paulo were always on the island by making them appear in important previous events . The scene set after the crash mixes actual scenes and unused footage of the pilot episode , along with new footage shot in the original location of <unk> beach . Since not all pieces of the wreckage were found , a few were added with greenscreen effects . The scene with Jack 's speech intersperses new scenes with footage from " White Rabbit " . Other continuity nods were considered , such as Paulo finding Shannon 's inhaler from " Confidence Man " , Nikki seeing Boone and Locke carrying shovels to excavate the hatch , and a filmed , but deleted scene where Nikki sees the sky turning purple . 
 During season one , the writers had the idea of introducing a character who was an actress and also created the outline of the fictional show where she would work Exposé . The " long , daunting hours " on the writer 's room would sometimes lead to creating episodes of the fictional show , with ten being done when the Nikki @-@ centered episode was written . Originally , there was going to be an entire flashback episode in which Nikki was going to be a crime @-@ fighting stripper , only to have it revealed that she was actually an actress . The idea was shortened to just one flashback spot . The role of Mr. <unk> was written with Billy Dee Williams in mind and , when he was cast , the color scheme of <unk> 's hat was chosen in reference to his costume worn in his famed role as Lando Calrissian . 
 Nikki and Paulo were killed off due to being disliked by much of Lost 's fan base . Show runner Damon Lindelof admitted that the couple were " universally despised " by fans . Lindelof explained that " back when we ( the producers ) had more good faith with the audience , we could have gotten away with these shenanigans . Given the backlash against them , we had to clean up the mess . " The decision to kill them off in one flashback episode was decided by the producers in December 2006 . It was also stated by Lindelof and fellow show runners Carlton Cuse that despite Nikki and Paulo 's bad reception , they felt the episode was necessary to explain their original plan of introducing former background characters to the main cast . Lindelof suggested having the characters be buried alive . Although actress Kiele Sanchez said that she wasn 't bothered by the general dislike of her character , she was very nervous during the burial scene , because she has claustrophobia . Speculation about the duo 's deaths began months before the actual episode aired . Santoro said in an interview with Brazilian Rolling Stone that his character was going to die in the middle of the third season . Another clue about the deaths came when it was announced that Sanchez was signed on to film a fall 2007 pilot for the ABC show , Football Wives . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Exposé " had 11 @.@ 25 million viewers upon its first US broadcast , being ABC 's third most watched show of the week – behind the performance show and results of Dancing with the Stars – and placing Lost at the eighteenth spot on the overall weekly ranking . It also attracted 1 @.@ 089 million viewers in Canada , being the fourth most watched show of the night , and 961 @,@ 000 viewers in the United Kingdom , being Sky One 's most watched show of the week . 
 " Exposé " received mixed reviews . Lindelof admitted that the episode " created a varying degree of fan reaction " , with some fans even describing it as " filler " . But Cuse defended " Exposé " , saying it was " a little bit more of an anthology episode for the show " , and that he felt that " it 's unrealistic , in a show that is now 72 episodes in , that every episode is gonna be , you know , chock full of plot momentum . I think it 's entirely reasonable , and we sort of by necessity have to have episodes that aren 't super @-@ narratively , you know , propelled . " Daniel of TMZ.com said that the episode " was a complete waste of time " , and that although he " wanted Nikki and Paulo to die " , he did not think their deaths warranted an entire episode . Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen wrote that although he liked the cameo appearance of Billy Dee Williams , he did not think " Exposé " " will do much to change anyone 's minds " about Nikki and Paulo , who were already unpopular characters . Brooke <unk> , a writer for UGO.com , wrote that she was " embarrassed " for Lost . New York Magazine put " Exposé " at the top of its list of " Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes " . However , TV Guide 's Matt Roush very much praised the episode for " weaving flashbacks that appeared to be posthumous but really weren 't while providing clever new angles on classic Lost moments from previous seasons " , Roush went on to say that " Exposé " was " a welcome reminder that sometimes these producers really do seem to know what they 're doing after all . " Chris Carabott of IGN also gave a positive review , stating that while Nikki and Paulo had no real impact on the overall storyline , " their ultimate end made for an entertaining hour of television " . The IGN staff later ranked " Exposé " 58th out of the 113 Lost episodes , describing it as " one of the series ' darkest and most fun episodes " . 
 = Bombing of Banski dvori = 
 The bombing of Banski dvori ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was a Yugoslav Air Force strike on the Banski dvori in Zagreb — the official residence of the President of Croatia at the time of the Croatian War of Independence . The bombing occurred on 7 October 1991 , as a part of a Yugoslav Air Force attack on a number of targets in the Croatian capital city . One civilian was reported killed by strafing of the Tuškanac city district and four were injured . 
 At the time of the attack , Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was in the building , meeting Stjepan Mesić , then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Ante Marković , then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia , but none of them were injured in the attack . In immediate aftermath , Tuđman remarked that the attack was apparently meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia . Marković blamed Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević , who denied the accusation and suggested the event was staged by Croatia . The attack prompted international condemnation and consideration of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia . The presidential residence was immediately moved to the Presidential palace , which was formerly known as Villa Zagorje . The Banski dvori sustained significant damage , but repairs started only in 1995 . The building later became the seat of the Croatian Government . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1991 , the first multi @-@ party elections were held in Croatia , with Franjo Tuđman 's win raising nationalist tensions further in an already tense SFR Yugoslavia . The Serb politicians left the Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become part of the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina , which had the intention on achieving independence from Croatia . As tensions rose , Croatia declared independence in June 1991 . However , the declaration was suspended for three months , until 8 October 1991 . The suspension came about as the European Economic Community and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe urged Croatia that it would not be recognized as an independent state because of the possibility of a civil war in Yugoslavia . The tensions escalated into the Croatian War of Independence when the Yugoslav People 's Army and various Serb paramilitaries mobilized inside Croatia . On 3 October , the Yugoslav Navy renewed its blockade of the main ports of Croatia . This move followed months of standoff and the capture of Yugoslav military installations in Dalmatia and elsewhere . These events are now known as the Battle of the barracks . That resulted in the capture of significant quantities of weapons , ammunition and other equipment by the Croatian Army , including 150 armoured personnel carriers , 220 tanks and 400 artillery pieces of 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) caliber or larger , 39 barracks and 26 other facilities including two signals centres and a missile base . It also coincided with the end of Operation Coast @-@ 91 , in which the Yugoslav forces failed to occupy the coastline in an attempt to cut off Dalmatia 's access to the rest of Croatia . 
 = = Warning of the attack = = 
 According to Martin Špegelj , the Defence Minister of Croatia between August 1990 and July 1991 , the Croatian Army was informed by a Yugoslav Air Force Željava Air Base @-@ based source about a top secret mission prepared for the next day , but Špegelj claims that the information was not taken seriously due to lack of details . Other sources assert that a warning was conveyed by Croatian security and intelligence system services , indicating the Soviet Union and its then @-@ president Mikhail Gorbachev as the source of the information . At midnight during the night of the 6 – 7 October , the Soviet ambassador to Belgrade was reported to have received government instructions to warn the Yugoslav military against attacking Zagreb . 
 Tuđman spent the night in a Croatian Air Force and Air Defence command post — a tunnel running under the Gornji Grad — where information on the movement of Yugoslav aircraft was relayed . In the morning , Yugoslav General Andrija Rašeta informed the press that his superiors may decide to attack Zagreb as a form of pressure on Tuđman . Three air raid alarms were sounded during the morning of 7 October because the Yugoslav Air Force deployed as many as 30 to 40 combat jets in the Zagreb area , and numerous tip @-@ offs of imminent air raids were received from Yugoslav military bases . During the morning , Yugoslav Air Force jets were observed taking off from bases near Pula and Udbina in Croatia and Banja Luka in Bosnia and Herzegovina . No flights were recorded taking off from Željava Air Base , presumably because of low cloud cover in the area . At 1 : 30 pm , the Croatian Army captured a Yugoslav military communications centre and radar post near Velika Buna , south of Zagreb , hindering Yugoslav Air Force control of aircraft in the area . It is believed that the event affected the timing of the raid on the Banski dvori , the official residence of the President of Croatia at the time . 
 = = Bombing = = 
 Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991 , Tuđman met with Stjepan Mesić , then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Ante Marković , then Prime Minister of Yugoslavia , both ethnic Croats , in the Banski dvori . The purpose of the meeting was to persuade Marković to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government , which he appeared reluctant to do , and to discuss the need for Croatia 's independence . The meeting was adjourned for lunch that was to be attended by presidential aides . Tuđman made another effort at persuading Marković , trying to appeal to his Croatian origin . The three left the lunch as dessert was being served and moved into the president 's office to continue their discussion . After Tuđman left the room , everyone else followed . 
 Just after 3 pm , minutes after the lunch had ended , the Yugoslav Air Force attacked the Banski dvori and other targets in the Gornji Grad area of Zagreb and elsewhere in the Croatian capital city , two or three minutes after everyone had left the hall where the lunch was hosted . Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets , however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 21s carrying eight Munja 128 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) unguided missiles each and two Soko G @-@ 4 Super <unk> carrying two Mark 82 bombs each . The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by proximity fuzes 5 metres ( 16 feet ) above the target , scoring two direct hits . 
 One civilian was reported killed by the aircraft strafing of the Tuškanac area of Gornji Grad . None of the three leaders was injured , but four people were wounded in the attack . The facade of the Banski dvori and nearly all its rooms were damaged , and a part of its roof structure was destroyed . The first estimates of the damage inflicted on the building and its contents ranged between 2 and 3 million US dollars . Apart from the Banski dvori , other buildings in the area sustained damage . Those included the Croatian Parliament building , the Old City Hall , St. Mark 's Church , the Museum of History , the Institute for the protection of cultural monuments as well as residences and offices in the vicinity , including the residence of Swiss consul Werner <unk> . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In a television report taped and broadcast shortly after the bombing , Tuđman said that the attack appears to have been meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia , and as a decapitation strike . He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation . Marković telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević for the attack . He demanded his resignation , threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijević was out of office . The Yugoslav Defence Ministry brushed away the accusation , claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command and suggesting that the event might have been stage @-@ managed by the Croatian authorities . The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted plastic explosives in the Banski dvori . 
 In response to the situation , the United States consulate advised American nationals , including journalists , to leave Croatia . The US State Department announced that it would consider introducing economic sanctions against Yugoslavia . Germany condemned the attack , calling it barbarous , and blamed it on the Yugoslav military . 
 On 8 October 1991 , as the independence declaration moratorium expired , the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia . That particular session of the parliament was held in the INA building on Pavao Šubić Avenue in Zagreb due to security concerns provoked by the recent air raid ; Specifically , it was feared that the Yugoslav Air Force might attack the parliament building . 
 After the bombing , the residence of the President of Croatia was moved from the Banski dvori to the Presidential palace — formerly known as Villa Zagorje — in the Pantovčak area of Zagreb . Funds to repair the Banski dvori were approved in 1995 , and the site became the official residence of the Croatian Government . A plaque commemorating the bombing was placed at the Banski dvori facade 20 years after the attack , in 2011 . The bombing is also commemorated by the Zagreb City Museum as the event is featured in the Zagreb in Independent Croatia collection of its permanent display .

 The second season of the Canadian science fiction – fantasy television series Sanctuary premiered on Space in Canada and on Syfy in the United States on October 9 , 2009 , and concluded on the same channel on January 15 , 2010 after 13 episodes . It continues to follow the actions of a secret organization known as the Sanctuary Network , who track down a series of creatures known as abnormals and then bring them to the Sanctuary base for refuge . Amanda Tapping , Robin Dunne , Emilie Ullerup , Ryan Robbins , Agam Darshi and Christopher Heyerdahl are billed in the opening credits as the main cast . 
 The season starts six weeks after the conclusion of the first season , where the protagonists work to defeat the antagonistic Cabal from destroying the Sanctuary Network , but in the process Ashley Magnus ( Ullerup ) , daughter of Sanctuary leader Helen Magnus ( Tapping ) , dies . Later episodes involve a story arc on Big Bertha , the most dangerous abnormal on Earth . 
 The second season included a writing team , where as in the first there were only two writers ; series creator Damian Kindler , and Sam Egan ; however Egan left the series after the end of the first season . The producers wanted to expand on the Sanctuary Network by including episodes where the team visit some of their international sites as opposed to only mentioning them . The season was filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia from late March to July 2009 , with some scenes of the finale filmed on location in Tokyo , Japan . Anthem Visual Effects continues to produce the series ' visual effects . Anthem found an exponential growth in their work , with some episodes including as many as 500 visual effects shots . 
 The first ten episodes were seen by an average of 1 @.@ 55 million viewers in the United States , increasing to 2 @.@ 2 million when time @-@ shifted viewings were taken into account . It received generally positive reviews from critics ; however , some reviewers criticized the abrupt end to the Cabal arc within the first few episodes . The introduction of the new character Kate Freelander ( Darshi ) was also met with mixed reactions , while there was an outpouring of fans against Ashley 's demise . Season two won seven Leo Awards after its release . The season was released on a four @-@ disc set on DVD and Blu @-@ ray Disc on June 9 , 2010 in Region 4 , June 15 in Region 1 , and October 4 in Region 2 .

 The second season began with the original cast from the first season . Amanda Tapping returns as series protagonist Helen Magnus , a 158 @-@ year @-@ old English scientist who runs the Sanctuary Network . The producers intended for Magnus to be more angry and vulnerable following Ashley 's death after the first three episodes . Robin Dunne returns as Will Zimmerman , a former forensic psychiatrist who has been Magnus ' protégé since the pilot . After the first season , the producers made Will more confrontational towards Magnus after feeling more comfortable working with her . Christopher Heyerdahl portrays two characters : Bigfoot , an abnormal who works in the Sanctuary , and John Druitt , Magnus ' former fiancé and father to Ashley . Ryan Robbins returns as Henry Foss . A recurring actor in the first season , Robbins was upgraded to a series regular in the second . 
 Emilie Ullerup returns as Ashley , Magnus ' daughter who was written out of the series after " Eulogy " . The decision to kill off the character came from an agreement between series creator Damian Kindler and the commissioning networks , as they felt this development would " have the deepest , most dramatic impact on the series and the characters . " Director Martin Wood also believed that her death would add a sense of jeopardy on the show . When Ullerup first heard Ashley would be killed off , she was under the impression that her character was not well received by the fans . After the second season aired however , Ullerup noticed an outpouring from fans against Ashley 's death . Following her death , the producers were willing to develop an Ashley story for the third season . 
 Agam Darshi joined the cast as Kate Freelander , described by Syfy as " a swindler , con artist and thief who finds herself in an uneasy alliance with Dr. Magnus after her business relationship with the Cabal goes sour . " The producers intended for Kate to be an unlikeable character at first , but by the end of the season have " 99 percent of the people who don 't like Kate , [ ... ] like Kate . " The producers also noted that Kate would begin to prove herself by the third episode " Eulogy " , and the ninth episode " Penance " would become important to Kate 's evolution from " first class bitch " to a more open character when her father 's death is revisited . 
 = = = Recurring cast and guest appearances = = = 
 Jonathon Young returns as half @-@ vampire Nikola Tesla . In the tenth episode , the character was " de @-@ vamped " . Kindler felt this development was a bold choice , but also believed his vampirism was the least interesting character trait against being a genius and having electricity @-@ based powers . The producers wanted to make Tesla somewhat heroic by sacrificing that part of him . Like the first season , there were instances where Young was unavailable to shoot some of his scenes due to theatre commitments , so he was replaced by a body double . Christine Chatelain returns as Will 's girlfriend Clara Griffin . Clara was killed off in the second episode ; Tapping viewed the death as an " important casualty " that has resonance to the main characters . Robert Lawrenson made a recurring appearance as Declan McRae , the head of the London Sanctuary following the death of James Watson in the season one finale . The character was originally going to be introduced in " Hero " , but Kindler decided it would be better for the character to be introduced earlier in the season . 
 The season also introduced numerous guest appearances . <unk> Chula appeared as a Cabal scientist in the season premiere , a character that was originally a German male ; Chula accepted Tapping 's offer to appear on the show after they met at an awards ceremony . Christopher Gauthier appears as Walter and his alter @-@ ego , " the Adjuster " , in " Hero " . Gauthier modeled the Adjuster 's voice from Christian Bale 's Batman . The scenes where Walter was worn out from the suit that is killing him mirrored Gauthier 's performance because of the suit he had to wear constantly , which consisted of two sets of jogging outfits , cotton padding , and a wetsuit . Because the producers were impressed with Walter , they wanted him to return in the next season . Mandy May , the wife of director Steven A. Adelson , appears in full prosthetics as the abnormal Jack in " Fragments " ; May previously appeared on the series as the face of Sally the mermaid . In the same episode , Colin Cunningham played the antagonist Gerald . Cunningham was offered a role because he was long @-@ time friends with some of the crew members , as is the same case when it came to casting Anne Marie Loder , wife of director Peter DeLuise , as Rachel . Eureka actress Erica Cerra makes a guest appearance as the telepath Emma in " Veritas " . Cerra 's casting by the producers was " really easy " as it was based on her work in other science fiction productions , especially Eureka . 
 Tapping 's former Stargate SG @-@ 1 co @-@ star Michael Shanks guest starred as Jimmy in " Penance " . Shanks had an interest in playing Jimmy because of the <unk> of the character . Shanks also suggested Aleks Paunovic , actor and part @-@ time boxer , for the part as the <unk> Duke ; being a boxer fit into the character 's violent nature . Paul McGillion returns as Wexford in the season finale . McGillion first appeared as Wexford in the original webisodes , and since then the producers wanted him to return . Tapping believed that placing him in the finale was " the perfect place for him . " Callum Blue was cast as the finale 's antagonist , Edward Forsythe , as the producers believed Blue could portray somebody who is both charming and evil . In the same episode , Sahar <unk> was cast as Kali ; <unk> was chosen as the producers believed her physical appearance was goddess @-@ like . <unk> Johal played a cult member ; she was the first person to audition for the part , and the producers cast her as she was spiritual , calm , and soft in her appearance . Johal taught the cast how to speak Hindi in parts of the dialogue . The producers were hoping to cast David Hewlett , another Stargate alum , in a guest spot ; however , this was met by scheduling issues , as he was shooting a film at the time . Despite this the producers were confident they would cast Hewlett " eventually . "

 Syfy officially announced the commissioning of a second season of Sanctuary in November 2008 due to the ratings success of the pilot episode , which totalled over three million viewers . Writer and executive producer Sam Egan left the series after the first season . Andrea <unk> , Carrie Mudd and Keith <unk> join creator Damian Kindler , director Martin Wood , and actress Amanda Tapping as the show 's executive producers . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The second season saw the introduction of a writing team ; Sara Cooper , Alan McCullough and James Thorpe were hired as additional writers to Kindler . Because of the writing team , it allowed Kindler and the team had to hold meetings , where as in the first season it was just him discussing with Egan . One of the goals in writing the second season is to further explore the global Sanctuary Network , because in the Sanctuary universe abnormals can be found all around the world . Some international Sanctuary bases were mentioned in the first season , but in the second season , the producers wished to visit some of those bases . Introducing new Sanctuaries and its characters would widen the breadth of the show . They also wished to start introducing abnormals that cannot walk , including an oil @-@ like abnormal in " End of Nights " and the fire elemental " Penance " . Kindler wrote both parts of " End of Nights " , " Pavor Nocturnus " , " Next Tuesday " , " Haunted " and the second part of " Kali " . McCullough wrote " Hero " , " Veritas " , " Penance " and the first part of " Kali " . Cooper wrote " Eulogy " and " Fragments " , while Thorpe wrote " Sleepers " , and co @-@ wrote " Pavor Nocturnus " and " Haunted " with Kindler . 
 Following the cliffhanger of the first season finale , Kindler worked to figure out how to conclude the story and managed to write the outlines of the first two episodes in two days . He also consulted with the writing team to look at all the problems on how to conclude the story . " Eulogy " was conceived as an important episode in the lives of the main characters following the aftermath of " End of Nights " , as well as dealing with the loss of Ashley . Kindler said of the episode " it 's one thing to end on a terrible tragic cliffhanger , it 's another in a satisfactory manner lay all things to rest appropriately . " In writing the episode Cooper was knowledgeable on " medical jargon , " as she once wrote for the medical drama series House . In writing his first script " Hero " , McCullough was initially concerned that it would be met by resistance from the producers because of the special effects that would be involved , but was " floored " to find out it was entirely possible because of Anthem Visual Effects . The producers were originally hesitant in including " Hero " as the fourth episode , as it was considered lighter in tone as Magnus was trying to get over Ashley 's death from " Eulogy " . " Pavor Nocturnus " came early in the development of the season , as Kindler wanted to show an episode about Magnus ' work going " horribly wrong , " and explore the opportunity to have the heroes warned that their work has consequences . Described as the " darkest , scariest , creepiest episode ever " by Tapping , it also featured scenes Kindler was never comfortable with , and did not want to show again , including the assault of naked women , and child killings . 
 " Fragments " was written to be in real time format . Kindler described the episode as a " nice procedural , with heart , " that follows the same style as episodes of the medical drama ER , where " stuff goes down and you have to kind of follow the team in different aspects and see how they 're handling the situation . " The idea behind " Next Tuesday " came when Kindler and Wood noticed a rescue helicopter that was available for rent , prompting the two to come up with a " helicopter story . " The episode also introduces a next level in Will and Magnus ' friendship ; arguments , which would create a " far more realistic thread of tension " between the two characters who " obviously love each other , " and " obviously get along , " which Kindler felt made a " cool character layer . " This was also based on the producers themselves , who despite being good friends , often argue while producing the series . 
 " Sleepers " was developed because the producers wanted to do a Tesla @-@ centric episode , as they view him as one of their favorite characters . " Haunted " rounds Druitt to " something unexpected . " The producers were aware that Druitt became more insane the more he teleports , and they wanted to find an explanation why , hence the creation of the energy creature . " Kali " was designed as a somewhat " faith versus science " episode , with faith as the winning party , because any host to the macri would need a spiritual understanding to it ; the cult of Kali are religious , so they would make suitable hosts , but Edward Forsythe is a believer of science , and would not make a suitable host as he does not share the cult 's understanding . In the original draft , Magnus would fall ill , but that later changed to Will before the episode was filmed . Some episodes in the season originally followed a different order . " Pavor Nocturnus " was originally going to be the fourth episode , while " Hero " would become the tenth . " Sleepers " would also be in an earlier slot . However , the order changed , partially due to availability issues with Jonathon Young for " Sleepers " . The writers were also working on a Bigfoot @-@ centric episode , where he returns to his home . However , before it could be written , the networks were unhappy with the idea . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began in late March 2009 , and finished on the end of July the same year . Director Martin Wood wanted to film the season in a more graphic novel style . Wood directed both parts of " End of Nights " , " Hero " , " Next Tuesday " and both parts of " Kali " . Brenton Spencer directed " Eulogy " , " Pavor Nocturnus " and " Penance " . The producers felt that Spencer did " a great job " in making sense on a lot of moves he had to make , as well as understanding that the stories are important in getting things back on track in " Eulogy " . The episode ended up being 17 minutes longer than usual , so much of it had to be cut . Steven A. Adelson directed " Fragments " and " Sleepers " . Amanda Tapping directed " Veritas " , her first directorial credit since the Stargate SG @-@ 1 episode " Resurrection " in 2004 . To direct the scenes featuring Magnus , Tapping rehearsed them to decide how it would be shot , then appointed somebody to handle the cameras . Peter DeLuise directed " Haunted " . Lee Wilson from Anthem Visual Effects directed a scene in " Hero " , while Robbins directed a scene from " Fragments " when his character recorded Rachel 's documentary . 
 Like the first season , much of the second was filmed on green screen sets in a studio in Burnaby , British Columbia , though also like the first season , there are more instances it was shot on practical sets and on location , most of which taking place just outside the studio . The first part of " End of Nights " had scenes filmed at a large empty warehouse . At some point , Dunne , Kindler , Tapping and Wood were sent to Tokyo to promote the series for Syfy Asia . The four decided to use the opportunity to film some scenes for the finale there , one of which was filmed in the Shibuya crossing . Filming took place just as a monsoon season was kicking in . In addition , they noticed a concert hall and took pictures of one of its angles as they deem the architecture suitable for a Tokyo Sanctuary base . 
 During the shoot of the first part of " End of Nights " , Kindler loaned his car for a car chase sequence . A later scene involved having the car shot at by snipers . To prevent damage to the car , the bullet holes were made from visual effects . In " Pavor Nocturnus " , the crew had to make the Sanctuary set ruined in a post @-@ apocalyptic state . Set designer Bridget McGuire made the set look " horrible " overnight , but then had to clean it up for the last scene . They also " completely trashed " the street sets in the studio . " Next Tuesday " was considered a bottle episode as it was largely filmed in one set , a water tank some 14 feet deep and 70 feet long , in a studio . The episode was filmed over five 13 @-@ hour days , not including a two @-@ day break midway through , becoming the fastest time filming a Sanctuary episode . Wood directed the episode from the water rather than dry land . The following episode " Penance " was largely filmed at a constructed city set some three and a half blocks in size , which was previously used in the superhero film Watchmen . 
 The Mumbai slum set in the season finale was constructed on the parking lot of the studio , which took two to three weeks to complete . The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia ; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai . Three main cameras were used , one of which was crane @-@ operated . 60 extras were used , the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode . For the extras to be used in more than one scene , they wore many different costumes . The <unk> area was also limited in size , so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene . The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Andrew Lockington was appointed the series composer in the season . The producers liked Lockington 's contribution to the score as it was more heightened than it was in the first season . Lockington would also capture the emotional temper when it comes to scoring for the emotional scenes . The composer sampled several instruments from around the world to give the score a more <unk> , international feel . Some episodes feature the score taking different styles . For instance " Fragments " features a " cool Michael Mann soundtrack . " In " Kali " , the score adopted a more Bollywood @-@ style theme , particularly during Will 's dance sequence . In addition to the score , there were occasional instances where popular music was featured . " End of Nights " featured a track from the Toronto @-@ based hip hop group Down with Webster .

 Anthem Visual Effects resumed their duties of producing the visual effects for the second season . The company 's Lee Wilson noted that their workload for the second season " increased exponentially " over the first , with some episodes containing as many as 500 visual effects shots . The produce decided to " re @-@ jig " the opening title sequence , which they wanted to do each year . The photograph where Magnus meets Albert Einstein changed to aviation pilot Amelia Earhart . The producers noticed that the visual effects have been made " more wonderous than we did the season before , " as they were able to produce certain actions that they never tried before . The <unk> in " Eulogy " was designed to look adorable , harmless and bunny @-@ like in its infancy , but more menacing when it grows up . In making the Adjuster fly in " Hero " , both visual and practical effects were used ; some of the simpler sequences involved Gauthier hooked up to a velocity rig , but in order to make him fly over the city skyline , a computer @-@ generated avatar was created . The design of the <unk> in the same episode was based on a mix of insect and dinosaur . 
 The second season introduces " moving zorts , " an upgraded technique the film crew used to complete the effect where Druitt teleports . The zorts were used specifically to make the sequences where the cast around Heyerdahl freeze until he leaves the screen . The producers wanted to have the camera move during those shots , as they believed it would be " way cooler to have those zorts on the move . " One of the more difficult moving zorts included a " triple <unk> " with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in " End of Nights " . The sequence was difficult for Tapping , as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 pounds . A three @-@ dimensional hologram of Rachel 's office was included in " Fragments " ; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode , but because doing so would be costly , the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram , so Henry could use it as a blueprint to make an identical office with boxes . For the finale , Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look like the same creature , though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature . Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects , including clothing . To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket , Wilson used fishing wire to move a sleeve slightly . Big Bertha 's actions meanwhile , were largely made underwater . Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement . Additionally , Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches depth charges from his ship . The producers were looking for stock footage of the dropping depth charges , but they could not find one in high @-@ definition . 
 In addition to visual effects , other forms of physical effects were produced . In " Hero " , there was a scene where the camera appeared to be shot from inside a water tank . Instead , a water tank was placed between the camera and the actors , where Alka @-@ Seltzer was placed at the bottom to simulate bubbles . Wood previously used this technique in the first season episode " Requiem " as well as in Stargate Atlantis . The Adjuster comic books at the end of the episode were designed by artists who occasionally work for DC Comics . Dunne wore a mullet and a white eye contact lens in " Pavor Nocturnus " for Will 's alternate self in a dystopian future . The vampire squid @-@ related effects for " Next Tuesday " were made possible by visual aids . For the shots where the squid swims on the water surface , the production crew used a radio @-@ controlled boat to mimic a wake . When the squid erupts from the water , they placed a beach ball underwater and released it to mimic the splash . To make the helicopter sway during the battles between the squid and sea scorpion , an air pump was placed below it . However , doing so added the side effect of strong currents , proving difficult for the cast to swim towards the helicopter . 
 The season also includes stunt work . Weeks before filming " End of Nights " , Heyerdahl practiced sword fighting to be done against the hybrids in the second part . Jonathon Young performed his own stunts for " Sleepers " , including being run over by a car and falling from a car . Both stunts involved harnesses and other safety measures . Young also participated in a fight scene with the other vampire characters , but he ended up injuring two of the actors . In one instance Young hit Chad Rook in the face , which caused a fang insert to puncture his lip .

 The season was met with generally positive reviews . Mark Wilson of About.com believed that after the series was " finding its feet , " and " looks like a harbinger of the new , more confident Sanctuary , " but added " there 's still work to be done . " He also stated " because of the talents involved , the wide @-@ open concept , and the way it 's created , Sanctuary has huge potential . The season 2 premiere is good to great , with a fantastic performance from Tapping and a real escalation of the Cabal threat . Let 's hope that the show continues to develop and evolves , like its characters , into the show it 's capable of becoming . " In a DVD review of the season , Monsters and Critics rated it five out of five , stating that fans " will be very happy " with the season set . 
 John Sinnott of DVD Talk said that while " the show still has a lot of charm , " he felt it did not live up to the standards of the first season . Sinnott criticised the season for wrapping up the Cabal story line in the first two episodes , expecting it to continue throughout the season , as well as accusing the writers of throwing out " a lot of aspects that made the end of the first season so great . " However , he felt there were good episodes , naming " Sleepers " as his favourite , and also saying he liked " Hero " . He summed up that the season was " still worth watching and enjoyable , just not as gripping as the first season , " believing it comes " recommended " to those who wish to purchase the season box set . David Blackwell of Enterline Media stated that the second season " continues to amaze as a show I first wrote off as bad . I 'm glad I 'm still giving this show a second chance as it continues to deliver great character arcs and stories . " Blackwell named " Pavor Nocturnus " , " Veritas " and " Haunted " as the standout episodes . CliqueClack TV believed the season was a " mixed bag " ; " End of Nights " was considered " the most thrilling hours of television Sanctuary has ever produced , " but the season later " suffered mostly from failure to follow through with the Cabal / Ashley story arc . " 
 Critical reactions towards the introduction of Kate Freelander was also mixed . Mark Wilson stated " the growling sass @-@ mouth feels out of place . Darshi 's performance is good , at least , so we 'll just have to see if the writers are capable of integrating her into the cast . " John <unk> meanwhile , started " I always found [ Ashley ] a bit irritating , so it was no big loss . For some reason however , they 've replaced her with another annoying young woman , Kate Freelander . She 's basically the same character as Ashley , tough as nails on the outside but still a vulnerable young woman on the inside , but this time in an Indian shell . "

 = History of Liverpool F.C. ( 1985 – present ) = 
 The history of Liverpool Football Club from 1985 to the 2015 – 16 Liverpool F.C. season covers the period from the appointment of Kenny Dalglish as manager , the Hillsborough disaster , the club 's return to European competition in 1991 , and the club 's performance in the Premier League . 
 Dalglish was appointed as manager after Joe Fagan resigned following the Heysel Stadium disaster , which resulted in Liverpool being banned from European competition for an indefinite period . Dalglish had the dual role of player and manager and in his first season the club won the league championship and FA Cup . They failed to retain the title the following season finishing second to neighbours Everton F.C. The club regained the league championship , but lost the final of the FA Cup to Wimbledon F.C. , to prevent a repeat of the double . The following season saw the club involved in one of the worst disasters to occur at an English football stadium . 96 of the club 's supports lost their lives on 15 April 1989 , as a consequence of being crushed against perimeter fencing due to overcrowding at the Leppings Lane End of Hillsborough stadium , during an FA Cup semi @-@ final against Nottingham Forest . Liverpool subsequently won the FA Cup , defeating Everton in the final . They again missed out on the double , as they were beaten to the league championship by Arsenal by goals scored , after the two teams finished the season tied on 76 points . Liverpool regained the league championship in the 1989 – 90 season to win their 18th title . Dalglish resigned the following season , as Liverpool finished second to Arsenal . 
 Former player Graeme Souness was appointed as manager and he won the FA Cup in his first full season in charge . Despite this , the club finished in sixth position , the first time they had finished outside the top two since 1981 . Liverpool fared no better in the 1992 – 93 season , again finishing sixth . A poor start to the 1993 – 94 season resulted in Souness being replaced by Roy Evans midway through the season . Liverpool improved to fourth the following season and won the Football League Cup . The team improved under Evans ' stewardship finishing fourth , third and fourth in the following season under his reign . They also reached the final of the FA Cup in 1996 but lost to Manchester United . After finishing third during the 1997 – 98 season , Gérard Houllier was appointed co @-@ manager alongside Evans . The arrangement lasted until November when Evans resigned . The team improved under Houllier and after finishing fourth during the 1999 – 2000 season , they won a unique treble of trophies the following season . They finished second to Arsenal during the 2001 – 02 season , their highest league finish since 1991 . The following seasons were disappointing as Liverpool were unable to improve on the previous season 's exploits finishing fifth and fourth respectively . Houllier was sacked at the end of the 2003 – 04 season . 
 Houllier 's replacement was Rafael Benítez . Liverpool won the UEFA Champions League for the fifth time in Benítez 's first season beating Milan in the final . This was followed by success in the FA Cup the following season . Midway through the following season , Liverpool were bought by Americans Tom Hicks and George Gillett . The club again reached the final of the UEFA Champions League against Milan , but this time , they were defeated by 2 – 1 . The 2008 – 09 season saw Liverpool finish second in the league to Manchester United . Despite this , the following season was a disappointment , as the club finished in seventh place . Benítez left at the end of the season and was replaced by Roy Hodgson . At the start of the 2010 – 11 season , Liverpool were on the verge of bankruptcy . The club were sold to New England Sports Ventures following a high court ruling after the club 's creditors requested the club be sold . Hodgson was replaced by former manager Dalglish midway through the season . He won the Football League Cup in his second spell , but was replaced by Brendan Rodgers after finishing eighth in the 2011 – 12 season . 
 = = 1985 – 90 : Success at a cost = = 
 Dalglish became manager following the resignation of Fagan after the Heysel Stadium disaster . He started by replacing long @-@ serving full @-@ backs Phil Neal and Alan Kennedy with Steve Nicol and Jim <unk> . Liverpool began the 1985 – 86 season poorly and were ten points behind Manchester United at the end of September . The club continued to struggle until the end of the season when they won eleven of their last twelve matches , as their rivals were dropping points . Liverpool needed to beat Chelsea in the last game of the season to win the league championship . A goal from Dalglish secured the championship . The club also progressed to the final of the FA Cup , where they faced Everton . Liverpool went behind to a first @-@ half goal from Gary Lineker , but two goals from Ian Rush and a Craig Johnston goal in the second half secured a 3 – 1 victory . Thus , the club had achieved a double of league championship and FA Cup in the same season for the first time . 
 At the start of the 1986 – 87 season , Rush announced his intention to leave Liverpool for Italian team Juventus when the season was finished . Rush did not want to leave , but the club decided to sell him , due to the expulsion from European competition affecting the club 's cash @-@ flow . Midway through the season , Dalglish signed John Aldridge , who would replace Rush when he left . Despite his impending departure , Rush scored 40 goals . It was not enough to help Liverpool retain the trophies they won the previous season , as they finished second in the league behind Everton , and were knocked out of the FA Cup in the third round by Luton Town . The club did reach the final of the Football League Cup , but they were beaten 2 – 1 by Arsenal . At the end of the season , Dalglish signed Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to improve their attacking options . The signings had the desired effect as Liverpool regained the league championship . They did not suffer defeat until their 29th match against Everton , one of two losses during the season .

Although favourites against a club who had only become a member of The Football League eleven years previously , they lost the match 1 – 0 . 
 Rush returned to Liverpool for the start of the 1988 – 89 season , due to homesickness . Liverpool struggled at the start of the season and by January they were nine points behind leaders Arsenal . However , by April the teams were level on points , with Arsenal leading on goal difference . By this time , Liverpool had reached the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989 . Within six minutes the match was abandoned ; overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end of the ground resulted in the death of ninety @-@ six people , as they were crushed against perimeter fencing . Ninety @-@ four fans died , in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster , that day ; the 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later and the 96th died nearly four years later , without regaining consciousness .

Stuart McCall scored in the 89th minute to take the game into extra @-@ time . Substitute Rush scored in the 95th minute , but McCall scored again in the 102nd minute to level the match . Another goal from Rush two minutes later , secured a 3 – 2 victory for Liverpool . Once again , Liverpool had a chance to complete the double . Their final match of the season was against second @-@ placed Arsenal , who were three points behind . The game had originally been scheduled for 23 April , but Liverpool 's FA Cup commitments meant it was postponed and rearranged for 26 May . Arsenal needed to win the match by two clear goals to win the league championship . They took the lead in the 52nd minute when striker Alan Smith scored . With the match in injury time , Michael Thomas scored to give Arsenal a 2 – 0 victory . The result meant Arsenal won the championship on goals scored . 
 Following the end of the season , an inquiry , headed by Lord Taylor was set up to establish the causes of the Hillsborough disaster . The subsequent Taylor Report , published in 1990 , found that failure of police control was the main reason for the disaster and recommended that major stadia remove terracing and become all @-@ seater stadia . Liverpool started the 1989 – 90 season in good form , exemplified by a 9 – 0 victory over newly promoted Crystal Palace . Eight different players scored for the club , the only time this has occurred in English football . The club endured a blip in October and November when they lost four games , but they recovered to go unbeaten until a 1 – 0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur in March . Following the match , Liverpool signed forward Ronny Rosenthal on loan from Standard Liège to boost their attacking options . His impact was immediate , he scored seven goals in eight appearances , including a hat @-@ trick against Charlton Athletic to help Liverpool to their eighteenth league championship . The club progressed to the semi @-@ finals of the FA Cup , but they were unable to defend the trophy , losing 4 – 3 to Crystal Palace after extra @-@ time .

 Anfield was redeveloped at the start of the 1992 – 93 season following the recommendations of the Taylor report . A second tier was added to the Kemlyn Road stand , which included executive boxes and function suites as well as 11 @,@ 000 seats . Renamed the Centenary Stand , it was officially opened on 1 September 1992 by Union of European Football Associations ( UEFA ) president Lennart Johansson . In the inaugural season of the Premier League , Liverpool performed poorly ; they again finished in sixth place , losing fifteen of their forty @-@ two matches . They did not fare better in cup competitions , exiting early in the FA Cup , League Cup and UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup . The 1993 – 94 season started well for Liverpool as they won their first three games . However , their form dipped in the league as they lost four consecutive games . One positive was the emergence of striker Robbie Fowler from the club 's youth team . He scored on his first @-@ team debut against Fulham in the first leg of the League Cup and scored all five goals in the return leg as Liverpool won 5 – 0 . Liverpool continued to struggle during the season , culminating in a defeat to Bristol City in an FA Cup replay . Souness was sacked after the match and replaced by coach Roy Evans .

The arrangement did not last long , poor results put pressure on the partnership and after a 3 – 1 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup , Evans resigned . Houllier 's first game as sole manager was a 3 – 1 defeat to Leeds United . Liverpool 's form did not improve under Houllier and early exits in the UEFA and FA Cup , were followed with the club finishing the season in seventh place outside of the qualification spots for European competition .

He subsequently had an eleven @-@ hour operation to fix an acute dissection of the aorta and did not return until February . His assistant Phil Thompson took charge of the team in the interim . 
 <unk> signed a number of players at the start of the 2002 – 03 season , including Bruno Cheyrou , Salif <unk> and El @-@ Hadji Diouf . The former was preferred to Nicolas Anelka , despite the latter performing well during his loan from Paris Saint @-@ Germain the previous season .

However , three goals in six minutes meant Liverpool drew level at 3 – 3 . No goals in extra time meant the match went to a penalty shoot @-@ out , which they won 3 – 2 . A fifth @-@ place finish in the Premier League meant Liverpool were not guaranteed entry into the Champions League and faced the prospect of not being able to defend their European title .

 In the semi @-@ finals , Boro faced Arsenal , the leaders and eventual unbeaten champions of the Premier League season . In the first leg at Highbury on 20 January 2004 , Queudrue exploited a mistake by Arsenal defender Martin Keown and passed to Mendieta , who then assisted Juninho for the only goal of the game . On 3 February , Boro hosted Arsenal in the second leg ; Keown was sent off at the end of the first half for a professional foul on <unk> . In the second half , Boudewijn Zenden put Middlesbrough ahead and Edu equalised .

 Bolton manager Sam Allardyce , who was building a reputation for signing unwanted foreign veterans such as N 'Gotty , Djorkaeff and Iván Campo , predicted that a win would help him sign more players in the summer .

 Middlesbrough manager Steve McClaren had not even sat down when his team took the lead .

It was the fastest goal scored in a final , a record broken the following year by Liverpool 's John Arne Riise . 
 After Job 's early goal , Bolton went on the attack , with Djorkaeff forcing Schwarzer to make a near @-@ post save . In the seventh minute however , Middlesbrough won a penalty when Job was tripped in the Bolton box by Emerson Thome , under " minimal contact " . Zenden stepped up to take the spot kick and beat Bolton goalkeeper Jussi Jääskeläinen , despite slipping and the goalkeeper 's foot touching the ball . Later , Thome nearly scored an own goal from Juninho 's cross . 
 Davies scored for Bolton on 21 minutes when an error by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Schwarzer allowed his shot to go inside his near post . Bolton continued to attack , and Schwarzer made a double save from winger Per Frandsen and Djorkaeff . The latter had two more chances soon after , missing the target with the first . Boro pleaded for a second penalty when Nicky Hunt pulled Job , but referee Riley did not give it . 
 The second half had fewer incidents . Schwarzer saved a header from Nolan , while Juninho had two opportunities for Middlesbrough . In the final few minutes , Thome made a crucial block against Mendieta , and at the other side of the pitch Ugo Ehiogu did the same to thwart Stelios .

 Winning manager McClaren called the victory a " great reward " for Middlesbrough 's players , managers and chairman Steve Gibson . Captain Gareth Southgate also dedicated the win to the fans and Gibson , calling the chairman " the biggest fan we 've got " . Gibson himself called the win " 128 years in the making " and predicted the team would " kick on " from it . 
 McClaren praised his goalkeeper Schwarzer for recovering from his error that allowed Bolton 's goal , in order to make saves that won the match . He also said that the team should not become carried away by their qualification for Europe , and instead concentrate on the upcoming game against Birmingham City . 
 By winning the final , Middlesbrough qualified for the following season 's UEFA Cup , their first European competition . They beat Baník Ostrava in the first round and came first in their group featuring Villarreal , Partizan , Lazio and <unk> . They then defeated Grazer AK in the third round before being eliminated by Sporting . 
 Columnist Henry Winter The Daily Telegraph wrote that it was the best League Cup Final since Luton Town beat Arsenal in 1988 . He praised all four of Middlesbrough 's back line for their " alert defending " , and noted the hard work in midfield by Boateng that allowed Zenden , Juninho and Mendieta to create chances . He also lauded Bolton 's fans and the efforts of Okocha , Djorkaeff and Davies , while noting how Bolton 's Campo was effective despite " the odd pantomime dive " . Alan Smith of the same newspaper opined that 33 @-@ year @-@ old Southgate was the most deserving winner , as reward for his consistency since arriving in an " average " Boro side in 2001 . Southgate 's only other medal had come in the same competition for Aston Villa eight years prior . 
 In June 2013 , Juninho said that winning the League Cup with Middlesbrough was better than when he won the FIFA World Cup with Brazil in 2002 . 
 = Action of 26 July 1806 = 
 The Action of 26 July 1806 was a minor naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars fought off the southern coast of the island of Celebes in the Dutch East Indies . During the battle , a small British squadron attacked and defeated a Dutch force defending a valuable convoy , which was also captured . The British force — consisting of the frigate HMS Greyhound and brig @-@ sloop HMS Harrier under the command of Captain Edward Elphinstone — was initially wary of the Dutch , mistaking the Dutch East Indiaman merchant ship Victoria for a ship of the line . Closer observation revealed the identity of the Dutch vessels the following day and Elphinstone led his frigate against the leading Dutch warship Pallas while Harrier engaged the merchant vessels and forced them to surrender . Only the corvette William escaped , taking no part in the engagement . 
 The battle was the first in a series of actions by the Royal Navy squadron based at Madras with the intention of eliminating the Dutch squadron maintained at Java . Greyhound had been sent to the Java Sea and the Molucca Islands to reconnoitre the Dutch ports in preparation for a raid on Java by a larger force under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Edward Pellew later in the year . Elphinstone 's success was followed by a second frigate action by Captain Peter Rainier in which the Dutch ship Maria Riggersbergen was captured . In November 1806 , Admiral Pellew led the main body of his squadron against the capital of the Dutch East Indies at Batavia and a year later eliminated the last vessels of the Dutch East Indies squadron at Griessie .

 The Dutch squadron in the Dutch East Indies was a constant threat to the British system of trade routes during the Napoleonic Wars . The Dutch — under the guise of the Kingdom of Holland and ruled by the French Emperor Napoleon 's brother Louis Bonaparte — had joined the war against Britain following the end of the Peace of Amiens in 1803 . Although the primary function of the Dutch East Indies squadron was the suppression of piracy , their presence threatened British shipping in the Malacca Straits , in particular the lucrative trade with China . At the start of every year , the " China Fleet " — a large convoy of British East Indiamen merchant ships — sailed from Canton and passed through the South China Sea and the Malacca Strait on their journey to the Indian Ocean and eventually to Britain . Worth millions of pounds , these convoys were vital to the British economy , but they faced considerable danger in passing though waters that were within easy reach of the Dutch ports in Java . 
 In 1804 , a French squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Charles Linois used Batavia on Java as a base to attack the China Fleet , although the attempt ended in failure at the Battle of Pulo Aura . Java presented a clear threat to British maritime interests in the South China Sea , but the British squadron based in the Indian Ocean was too weak in 1805 to consider operations so far from its main base at Madras while Linois remained active . By the start of 1806 , Linois had sailed into the Atlantic and an expeditionary force had seized the Dutch base at the Cape of Good Hope , securing the western Indian Ocean and providing reinforcements that allowed Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Edward Pellew to begin operations against the Dutch forces in the East Indies . 
 Pellew 's first action , during the spring of 1806 , was to deploy several frigates to the Java Sea with instructions to reconnoitre the Dutch squadron and its main port at Batavia . The first British ship to reach the Java Sea was the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Greyhound under Captain Edward Elphinstone , which arrived in July 1806 . In company with the brig @-@ sloop HMS Harrier under Commander Edward Troubridge , the two vessels cruised in search of Dutch activity in the area . On 4 June they successfully destroyed the armed brig Christian Elizabeth at Manado and two days later captured the Belgica at Tidore . 
 During the evening of 25 July , lookouts spotted four sails passing through the Selayar Strait that separates Selayar Island from the southern tip of Celebes . These four vessels were a Dutch convoy from the Molucca Islands , consisting of : The Dutch national frigate Pallas , of 36 guns , under Captain N. S. Aalbers ; Dutch East India Company corvette William , of twenty 24 @-@ pounder guns and 110 men , under Captain P. <unk> ; Dutch East Indiaman Victoria ( or in some sources Vittoria ) , of about 800 tons burthen ( bm ) , under Captain Klaas <unk> and Dutch East Indiaman Batavier , of some 500 tons ( bm ) under Captain William De Val . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On observing the Dutch ships , Elphinstone immediately gave chase . Aalbers responded by forming his ships in a line of battle and retaining close formation as the convoy passed the Celebes coast close to the small Dutch trading posts at <unk> and <unk> . At 21 : 00 , Aalbers ordered his force to anchor 7 nmi ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ; 13 km ) offshore and prepare for the British attack . Elphinstone was cautious however as Victoria was a particularly large ship , with two decks and the appearance of a ship of the line . Aware that such a large vessel could easily destroy his frigate Elphinstone halted his advance and Greyhound and Harrier stopped to observe the Dutch convoy during the night , maintaining a position 2 nmi ( 2 @.@ 3 mi ; 3 @.@ 7 km ) to windward of Aalbers ' force . 
 At dawn , lookouts on Greyhound were able to establish that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack . Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards , his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance . In doing so , Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line , creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed . At 05 : 00 , Elphinstone raised French colours in an effort to confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander . Aalbers was not fooled , and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05 : 30 , the Dutch frigate replied immediately . With the frigates engaged , Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria , Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas . In response , Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier , which continued its fire against Pallas , while William , bringing up the rear of the Dutch line , pulled out completely and sailed for the coast . 
 Elphinstone rapidly took advantage of the confusion Harrier 's attack had created , passing Aalbers ' bow and raking his ship . Elphinstone then threw his sails back , halting his ship and allowing Greyhound to maintain a position across Pallas ' bow from which he could inflict severe damage on the Dutch frigate without coming under fire himself . As the damage and casualties mounted on Pallas , Harrier joined the attack . Gunfire from the Dutch ship gradually slackened , and finally stopped at 06 : 10 , the Dutch flag was struck from the mast and Pallas surrendered with over 40 casualties from a crew of 250 ( including 50 local recruits ) . Throughout the engagement , Victoria and Batavier had kept up a constant but inefficient fire on Harrier , Troubridge waiting until the Dutch flagship surrendered before counterattacking . 
 With Troubridge in pursuit , the Dutch merchant ships were unable to escape Harrier , and at 06 : 30 Victoria surrendered . Sending a boat to take possession , Troubridge immediately turned away towards Batavier . Elphinstone too was sailing towards the isolated merchant vessel and at 06 : 40 Captain De Val surrendered rather than fight the superior British force . William successfully escaped in the aftermath of the battle , rapidly outdistancing a weak chase from the battered Harrier . All three captured ships were taken over by prize crews and brought to Port Cornwallis on South Andaman Island . Casualties on Pallas were heavy , with eight men killed outright and 32 wounded , including Aalbers and three of his lieutenants . Six of the wounded later died , including the Dutch captain . There were also four men killed on the East Indiamen and seven wounded , one of whom died later . British losses by contrast were light , with one man killed and eight wounded on Greyhound and just three wounded on Harrier . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In India , the prizes were sold , Pallas being purchased by the Royal Navy and recommissioned as HMS Celebes . Elphinstone did not long survive his victory : he was ordered back to Britain in early 1807 and took passage on Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Thomas Troubridge 's flagship HMS Blenheim . He was presumed drowned in February 1807 along with the entire crew , when Blenheim disappeared during a hurricane in the western Indian Ocean . 
 For Pellew , the victory was an encouraging sign of the weakness of the Dutch squadron . In October , Captain Peter Rainier seized another Dutch frigate from Batavia harbour itself and the following month Admiral Pellew led a large scale raid on the port that eliminated most of the Dutch East Indies squadron . Two ships of the line escaped Pellew 's attack , but they were old and in a poor state of repair , and so were unable to defend themselves when Pellew discovered and destroyed them at Griessie in 1807 . 
 = The Boat Race 1840 = 
 The 4th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 15 April 1840 . It was the third of the University Boat Races to be held on the Thames , between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge . Oxford University Boat Club was formed to assist in the selection of the Oxford crew . Nevertheless , Cambridge won the race by three @-@ quarters of a length to lead the overall record at 3 – 1 .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and takes place on the River Thames in southwest London . 
 Following heavy defeats in the 1836 and 1839 races , and in order to improve the selection of the crew , Oxford University Boat Club was formed on 23 April 1839 , to which anyone at the university could subscribe and which was governed by the various college boat club captains . The initial letter of challenge was delivered to Cambridge from Oxford in February . After considerable discussion , mainly about the restriction of crew selection to undergraduates only , the date of the race , 15 April 1840 , was agreed sixteen days prior to the race itself . The umpires for the race were Calverley <unk> ( for Oxford ) and Charles Jasper Selwyn ( for Cambridge ) , while W. H. Harrison , the Commodore of the Royal Thames Yacht Club , was the referee . The race was to take place on a five @-@ and @-@ three @-@ quarter @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 2 km ) stretch of the Thames between Westminster Bridge and Putney Bridge .

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11 st 10 @.@ 5 lb ( 74 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower , 2 @.@ 5 pounds ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) more per man than their opponents .

 = = Race = = 
 Oxford won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex side of the river , handing the Surrey side to Cambridge . The race commenced from below Westminster Bridge at <unk> , with Edward Searle acting as the starter . With a number of steamers blocking the route , Oxford made a good start and took an early lead . The wake of the steamers caused rough water in which both crews struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm . The lead had extended by the time the crews passed below Vauxhall Bridge and was nearly three lengths by the Spread Eagle pub . At this point Cambridge began to reduce the deficit , but following a warning from Robert Coombes who was steering the umpire 's boat Dolphin , Oxford 's cox Garnett steered across the path of Cambridge . The Light Blues maintained their course and Oxford were forced back again . By the Red House , Cambridge had restored parity and started to pull away . Despite suffering further rough water from the wake of another steamer at Battersea Bridge , Cambridge maintained their lead and passed through the centre arch of Putney Bridge three @-@ quarters of a length ahead of Oxford . The winning time was 29 minutes 3 seconds , and the victory took the overall lead to 3 – 1 in favour of Cambridge . 
 = Theodor Weissenberger = 
 Theodor Weissenberger ( 21 December 1914 – 11 June 1950 ) was a German Luftwaffe military aviator during World War II and a fighter ace credited with 208 enemy aircraft shot down in 375 combat missions . The majority of his victories were claimed near the Arctic Ocean in the northern sector of the Eastern Front , but he also claimed 33 victories over the Western Front . He claimed eight of these victories over the Western Allies while flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter . 
 Born in <unk> am Main in the German Empire , Weissenberger , who had been a glider pilot in his youth , volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1936 . Following flight training , he was posted to the heavy fighter squadron of Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 — 77th Fighter Wing ) in 1941 . He claimed his first aerial victory over Norway on 24 October 1941 . After 23 aerial victories as heavy fighter pilot , he received the German Cross in Gold and was then posted to Jagdgeschwader 5 ( JG 5 — 5th Fighter Wing ) in September 1942 . There he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 13 November 1942 after 38 aerial victories . 
 In June 1943 , Weissenberger was appointed Staffelkapitän of 7 . Staffel of JG 5 . Following his 112th aerial victory , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 2 August 1943 . He was appointed Staffelkapitän of 6 . Staffel in September 1943 and in March 1944 he was given command of II . Gruppe of JG 5 which was operating in Defense of the Reich missions . In June 1944 he took command of I. Gruppe of JG 5 which defended against the Invasion of Normandy . Weissenberger claimed 25 aerial victories in this theater , which included his 200th victory on 25 July 1944 . After conversion training to the Me 262 jet fighter , he was appointed commander of I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 7 " Nowotny " ( JG 7 — 7th Fighter Wing ) , the first operational jet fighter wing in the world , in November 1944 . Promoted to Major ( major ) , he took command of JG 7 " Nowotny " as a Geschwaderkommodore in January 1945 , a position he held until the end of hostilities . He was killed in a car racing accident on 11 June 1950 at the Nürburgring . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Weissenberger , the son of a plant nursery owner , was born on 21 December 1914 in <unk> am Main in the Grand Duchy of Hesse of the German Empire . He had a brother Otto who also served as a pilot in Luftwaffe . As a glider pilot with the German Air Sports Association ( Deutscher <unk> ) , he made his maiden flight on 16 November 1935 . On 20 July 1941 he logged his <unk> flight as a glider pilot , in total 196 hours and 46 minutes of powerless flight . Most of these flights were made as an instructor over the <unk> Mountains , Silesia and Bavaria . 
 He joined the military service of the Luftwaffe with 2 . / Flieger @-@ Ersatz @-@ Abteilung 14 ( 2nd Company of Flier Replacement Unit 14 ) in <unk> on 19 October 1936 . There he was promoted to Feldwebel of the Reserves on 1 December 1940 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Weissenberger was posted to a front @-@ line unit on 27 August 1941 , almost two years after the start of World War II . His unit , 1 . ( Z ) / Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 — 77th Fighter Wing ) was a Zerstörer ( Z — heavy fighter or destroyer ) Staffel ( squadron ) flying the twin @-@ engine , up to three @-@ seat , Messerschmitt Bf 110 . The unit was stationed in Norway , operating in the Murmansk area in support of Finnish operations against the Soviet Union during the Continuation War . Germany regarded its operations in the region as part of its overall war efforts on the Eastern Front , and it provided Finland with critical material support and military cooperation . There he flew his first combat mission of the war on 13 September 1941 . 
 = = = War on the Arctic Front = = = 
 Weissenberger claimed his first aerial victory , a Polikarpov I @-@ 153 biplane fighter , on 24 October 1941 and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse ) on 6 November 1941 . He was promoted to Oberfeldwebel of the Reserves on 1 February 1942 . During this phase of his military career , he often got into trouble with his superiors regarding his lack of discipline . A few times his comrades had to intervene to save him from punishment . On 24 January 1942 , Weissenberger and Oberleutnant Max Franzisket flew on a ground attack mission against the Kirov Railway line . Weissenberger claimed a Polikarpov I @-@ 18 shot down at 13 : 35 , roughly 4 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 5 miles ) northwest of the railway station of <unk> . At 13 : 40 , he claimed a Hawker Hurricane shot down , his third aerial victory . 
 In February 1942 he mostly flew escort fighter missions for Junkers Ju 87 and Ju 88 bombers attacking the harbors at <unk> , <unk> , present @-@ day Polyarny , and Murmansk . Weissenberger received the Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse ) on 17 February 1942 . On 25 February he claimed two more Hurricanes shot down at 11 : 15 and 11 : 22 , his fourth and fifth victories . His Staffel was redesignated as 10 . ( Z ) of Jagdgeschwader 5 ( JG 5 — 5th Fighter Wing ) on 16 March 1942 and subordinated to JG 5 . In April 1942 he claimed eight victories , three of which were shot down on 15 April during two combat missions west of Murmansk . On 25 April at 7 : 20 Weissenberger took off at Kirkenes for an emergency intercept mission against 20 Soviet Petlyakov Pe @-@ 2 bombers . He shot down two bombers before his aircraft was hit by the defensive fire . The right engine started burning and he was forced to disengage from the enemy . Returning to the German lines , he made a safe belly landing . 
 Weissenberger became an " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " for the first time on 10 May 1942 when he shot down five enemy aircraft , aerial victories 14 – 18 , between 16 : 45 and 16 : 57 while on a Ju 87 escort mission . These victories were claimed over aircraft of 2 <unk> <unk> <unk> Polk ( 2 <unk> — 2nd Soviet Guards Composite Aviation Division ) , which lost ten Hurricanes destroyed and three damaged . He claimed his 20th victory on 15 May when he shot down a Hurricane 4 km ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) west of Murmansk . In June 1942 , JG 5 was augmented by another group , VI . Gruppe ( 4th Group ) under the command of Hauptmann Hans Kriegel . This led to a number of Staffel redesignations . Weissenberger 's 10 . ( Z ) Staffel was renamed as 13 . ( Z ) Staffel and remained subordinated to JG 5 . He transferred from the reserve force to active service and was promoted to Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) on 1 July 1942 . In early September he was transferred to 6 . Staffel of JG 5 , now flying the single @-@ engine , single @-@ seat , Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter . By this date , Weissenberger , as a Zerstörer pilot , had claimed 23 aerial victories in addition to 15 locomotives , 2 FLAK installations , a radio station , a railway station and other ground targets destroyed and was awarded the German Cross in Gold ( Deutsches Kreuz in Gold ) on 8 September 1942 .

 At the time , 6 . Staffel at the time was based in Petsamo , present @-@ day Pechenga in Murmansk Oblast , Russia . Weissenberger took off on his first Bf 109 combat mission at 14 : 00 on 15 September 1942 after he had spent a few days familiarizing himself with the single @-@ engine fighter aircraft . The mission , flown by 10 Bf 109 fighters from 6 . Staffel , was a combat air patrol in the vicinity of <unk> . The flight encountered enemy aircraft and Weissenberger filed claims over two Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawk Lend @-@ Lease fighters shot down at 14 : 31 and 14 : 33 . These were his first victories claimed on the Bf 109 , taking his total to 25 victories . A week later , on 22 September , Weissenberger and 6 . Staffel were again patrolling the airspace near the Soviet airfield at <unk> . During this mission , he claimed three more aerial victories , over Hurricanes shot down between 14 : 59 and 15 : 05 . 
 On 27 September 1942 , Weissenberger claimed five victories during the course of two combat missions . During the first mission , he shot down a Bell P @-@ 39 Airacobra at 11 : 36 . On his second mission , which began at 15 : 00 , he encountered a formation of roughly 30 aircraft , claiming four Hurricanes shot down from 15 : 49 to 15 : 56 , a time space of seven minutes . This " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " achievement took his total to 33 aerial victories . On 22 October 1942 , Weissenberger was tasked with fighter protection for a reconnaissance aircraft . The engine of his Focke Wulf Fw 190 F @-@ 4 seized up just west of Murmansk . He managed to nurse his aircraft back to the German lines before bailing out . He was picked up eight hours later by a Gebirgsjäger ( mountain infantry ) patrol and brought back to his Staffel . Following this event he was given one week of rest . He returned to combat on 30 October 1942 , and during two combat missions again achieved " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " status . He claimed three victories on his first mission and two P @-@ 40s at 15 : 00 and 15 : 06 on his second mission of the day . This took his total to 38 aerial victories and he was honored with the presentation of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) on 13 November 1942 . 
 Following the winter break , Weissenberger claimed 33 further victories between 6 – 28 March 1943 . Often he achieved multiple victories per day ; six claims on 10 March , victories 43 to 48 on 10 March , victories 49 to 53 on 12 March , and numbers 54 to 57 on 13 March . A ground attack mission against the airfield at <unk> on 28 March was his last action of the month . Weissenberger claimed three P @-@ 39s shot down during this mission , but was himself hit by anti @-@ aircraft fire and had to make a forced landing . He was picked up and returned by a <unk> Fi 156 " Storch " . On 13 April 1943 , a flight of five aircraft from 6 . Staffel claimed 18 Soviet aircraft destroyed without loss . Six of the enemy aircraft were credited to Weissenberger , shot down between 17 : 05 and 17 : 16 . This took his score to 77 aerial victories . On 13 May , he claimed four P @-@ 39s destroyed , representing victories 83 to 86 , and he was promoted to Oberleutnant on 1 June 1943 .

 Weissenberger claimed another five victories on 8 June 1943 north of Murmansk between 17 : 15 and 17 : 23 . This brought his score to 91 aerial victories and on 15 June he was appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of 7 . Staffel of JG 5 . In the period 15 June to 4 July , 7 . Staffel claimed 122 aerial victories under his leadership . The heaviest fighting occurred on 22 June over the Karelia Front , during which his Staffel claimed 13 victories , of which three were Hurricanes shot down by Weissenberger . A day later , he again claimed three aircraft shot down , comprising victories 95 to 97 . 
 On 4 July 1943 , Weissenberger led 7 . Staffel to 16 aerial victories , while providing fighter cover for a departing German naval task force . First , Weissenberger claimed a Pe @-@ 2 reconnaissance aircraft shot down at 21 : 07 . A flight of 25 to 30 enemy bombers and torpedo bombers was then spotted at 21 : 50 . Weissenberger claimed an Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 " Sturmovik " at 21 : 54 , his 100th aerial victory . He was the 43rd Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . The Staffel returned to its airfield at 22 : 19 without having sustained any losses during the encounter . Weissenberger alone had claimed seven victories during this mission , taking his total to 104 victories . On 10 July 1943 , this achievement earned him his first mention in the Wehrmachtbericht , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht . 
 He achieved " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " status for the fourth time on 25 July 1943 , claiming aerial victories numbers 108 to 112 . Following his 112th victory , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) on 2 August 1943 , the 266th member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored . The presentation was made by Adolf Hitler at the Wolf 's Lair , Hitler 's headquarters in Rastenburg , present @-@ day Kętrzyn in Poland . Five other Luftwaffe officers were presented with awards that day by Hitler , Hauptmann Egmont Prinz zur Lippe @-@ Weißenfeld , Hauptmann Manfred Meurer , Hauptmann Heinrich Ehrler , Oberleutnant Joachim Kirschner , Hauptmann Werner Schröer were also awarded the Oak Leaves , and Major Helmut Lent received the Swords to his Knight 's Cross with Oak Leaves . 
 Weissenberger was placed in command of 6 . Staffel on 14 September 1943 and in October and November added five more victories to his score , four of which were achieved on 3 November over the <unk> Peninsula . At the end of 1943 , II . Gruppe ( 2nd Group ) was ordered to relocate further south to the front near Nevel , Leningrad and Lake Ilmen . Relocating from Pskov , 6 . Staffel arrived at their new airfield at <unk> on 11 November 1943 and was in action again on 17 November . In January 1944 , II . Gruppe was subordinated to Luftflotte 2 ( 2nd Air Fleet ) in the middle sector of the Eastern Front in support of the defensive battles at Vitebsk . The Staffel flew combat missions from Orsha and Polotsk . Between 10 : 50 to 10 : 58 on 1 February 1944 , Weissenberger achieved his fifth " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " , taking his total to 124 . On 28 February , he claimed his 140th aerial victory . 
 At the end of February 1944 , II . Gruppe relocated again to Polotsk and then to <unk> , present @-@ day <unk> in Latvia , and on 16 March Weissenberger claimed his 141st victory . Among his four victories claimed on 20 March were three Il @-@ 2 ground attack aircraft . On 25 March 1944 , another " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " achievement saw his total increase to 153 aerial victories . In late March 1944 , II . Gruppe was transferred to the far north again , and was based at <unk> . Here they defended against the Vyborg – Petrozavodsk Offensive . 
 Weissenberger was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of II . Gruppe of JG 5 on 26 March 1944 . He claimed three aircraft shot down on 4 April , and four more on 9 April , taking his victories from 159 to 162 . At the end of April 1944 , II . Gruppe relocated to <unk> , withdrawing from the Arctic Front for the last time . On 17 May he claimed victories 169 to 172 , and the next day shot down three Yakovlev Yak @-@ 9s , taking his total to 175 . These were his last victories on the Eastern Front . At the end of May 1944 , II . Gruppe was transferred to Defense of the Reich duties and was relocated to <unk> Airfield in Germany .

 Weissenberger was promoted to Hauptmann on 1 June 1944 . On 3 June he arrived in <unk> to take over command of I. Gruppe ( 1st Group ) of JG 5 . The former Gruppenkommandeur Major Horst <unk> had been killed in a flying accident on 27 May 1944 . Three days after Weissenberger took command , the Allied invasion of Normandy began . To counter the invasion , elements of I. / JG 5 were transported to France by train that afternoon . The ground personnel were flown on Junkers Ju 52s to their airfield at Montdidier , 35 km ( 22 mi ) south of Amiens . The following day , Weissenberger took I. Gruppe into combat , achieving " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " status once again on his first day of combat on the Western Front . His 176th victory was over a Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt shot down at 09 : 05 . He claimed two further P @-@ 47s shot down 20 minutes later . I. Gruppe was scrambled again in the afternoon which resulted in aerial combat with roughly 12 P @-@ 47s near Beauvais . During the course of this encounter , which ended at 17 : 39 , Weissenberger claimed two P @-@ 47s shot down . 
 On 8 June the final elements of I. Gruppe arrived in Montdidier , making the unit complete . In the evening Weissenberger again claimed two P @-@ 47s shot down , his 181st and 182nd aerial victories . The airfield at Montdidier came under heavy fighter bomber attack on 11 June followed by another attack on 12 June resulting in significant damage to the airfield . On 12 June Weissenberger filed a claim for three aerial victories . Together with his wingman , Unteroffizier ( Sergeant ) Alfred Tichy , he took off at 06 : 00 and during the course of 12 minutes shot down three P @-@ 47s . After his first victory , Tichy was killed in action , crashing near Évreux . At 07 : 02 Weissenberger shot down his third P @-@ 47 of the day but his Bf 109 G @-@ 5 was hit in the engine forcing him to bail out near Saint André . The airfield in Montdidier was rendered unserviceable and I. Gruppe was forced to relocate . It was first moved to Péronne , then to <unk> , a makeshift airfield between Noyon and <unk> . The constant attacks against German airfields forced another move in July 1944 , this time to <unk> in the vicinity of Laon . 
 II . Gruppe flew a combat air patrol on 6 July 1944 , resulting in the claim of three Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightnings destroyed . Weissenberger was credited with two of these victories , the first at 08 : 48 and the second at 08 : 49 , both shot down south of Cambrai . The next day , the Gruppe took off heading for the airspace south of Rosières where they engaged a formation of 15 to 20 P @-@ 47s . During this encounter , Weissenberger claimed three victories , numbers 188 to 190 . The Gruppe was given a few days of rest and on 13 July were ordered to operate against enemy fighter bombers attacking German positions in the area Rouen – Bernay – Évreux . During this mission , he shot down a Hawker Typhoon at 18 : 24 near <unk> and another one two minutes later . They were then tasked with a fighter bomber mission on 14 July , attacking enemy positions near Caen . After a number of ground strafing attacks they themselves came under attack of numerous Supermarine Spitfires and P @-@ 47s . Flying at a height of 10 meters ( 33 feet ) , Weissenberger managed to shoot down one Spitfire 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) south of Bayeux . 
 The commanding general of II . Jagdkorps ( 2nd Fighter Corps ) , Generalleutnant Alfred <unk> , accompanied by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld inspected II . Gruppe at their airfield in <unk> on 15 July 1944 . On 17 July , Weissenberger led his Gruppe on a number of missions in the combat area near Caen without encountering any enemy aircraft . On their last mission of the day , having taken off at 19 : 00 , they encountered enemy fighter bombers near Caen – Le Mesnil . During aerial combat , the Gruppe lost three pilots without any success for themselves . On 19 July 1944 , I. Gruppe was tasked with flying top cover for Jagdgeschwader 2 " Richthofen " and Jagdgeschwader 26 " Schlageter " . During this mission , Weissenberger claimed four aerial victories . At 20 : 22 he shot down his first Typhoon of the mission north of Lisieux , another Typhoon one minute later and his third at 20 : 25 northwest of Cormeilles . His fourth victory was over a North American P @-@ 51 Mustang , shot down at 20 : 35 near <unk> . 
 On 25 July 1944 , the Gruppe was again tasked with a combat air patrol mission in the greater Caen area . Weissenberger received the order to take off at 10 : 30 and at 11 : 00 they spotted Spitfires in the vicinity of Rouen . In the ensuing aerial encounter at an altitude of 3 @,@ 800 m ( 12 @,@ 500 ft ) , Weissenberger shot down a Spitfire 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) south of Rouen . This was his 199th aerial victory . Two minutes later , at 11 : 02 , he shot down his 200th opponent . This achievement earned him his second mention in the Wehrmachtbericht on 26 July 1944 . Weissenberger left the Gruppe on 30 July 1944 and went on vacation to Bad Wiessee . 
 His I. Gruppe was withdrawn from combat and moved to Wunstorf for a period of rest and conversion training to the Bf 109 G @-@ 14 . The ground personnel were transferred to II . Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 6 ( JG 6 — 6th Fighter Wing ) . Conversion training ended in October 1944 and I. Gruppe was disbanded shortly after and became III . Gruppe ( 3rd Group ) of JG 6 on 14 October . On 24 October 1944 Weissenberger was ordered to Königsberg in der Neumark , present @-@ day <unk> in Poland . At Königsberg , he was given command of the newly forming I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 7 " Nowotny " ( JG 7 — 7th Fighter Wing ) . 
 = = = Flying the Messerschmitt Me 262 = = = 
 JG 7 " Nowotny " was the first operational jet fighter wing in the world and was named after Walter Nowotny , who was killed in action on 8 November 1944 . Nowotny , a fighter pilot credited with 258 aerial victories and recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ) , had been assessing the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet aircraft under operational conditions . JG 7 " Nowotny " was equipped with the Me 262 , an aircraft which was heavily armed and faster than any Allied fighter . General der Jagdflieger ( General of the Fighter Force ) Adolf Galland hoped that the Me 262 would compensate for the Allies ' numerical superiority . On 12 November 1944 , the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( OKL — Air Force High Command ) ordered JG 7 " Nowotny " to be equipped with the Me 262 . Galland appointed Oberst Johannes Steinhoff as its first Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) . 
 JG 7 " Nowotny " was initially formed with the Stab ( headquarters unit ) and III . Gruppe at Brandenburg @-@ Briest from the remnants of Kommando Nowotny . I. Gruppe was created on 27 November from pilots and personnel from II . Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 3 " Udet " ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) and placed under the command of Weissenberger . Weissenberger ’ s appointed Staffelkapitäne in I. Gruppe were Oberleutnant Hans Grünberg , Oberleutnant Fritz Stehle , and Oberleutnant Hans Waldmann , commanding 1 . – 3 . Staffel respectively . 
 On New Year 's Day 1945 , Weissenberger married his teenage @-@ love <unk> Vogel in <unk> near Hanau . Best man at his wedding was his former JG 5 comrade and friend Walter Schuck . Schuck succeeded Waldmann as Staffelkapitän of the 3 . Staffel following the latter 's death in a flying accident on 18 March 1945 . 
 Weissenberger was promoted to Major on 1 January 1945 and replaced Steinhoff as Geschwaderkommodore of JG 7 " Nowotny " shortly after . Both Galland and Steinhoff , among others , were relieved of their commands in the aftermath of the Fighter Pilots ' Revolt in early 1945 . 
 Under his command , JG 7 " Nowotny " achieved some success before the end of World War II in Europe on 8 May 1945 . On 18 March 1945 , JG 7 " Nowotny " claimed 25 aerial victories over Berlin , among them three Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses shot down by Weissenberger . Over all , he achieved eight confirmed victories , seven B @-@ 17 bombers and a P @-@ 51 fighter , while flying the Me 262 . Weissenberger survived the war and was credited with a total of 208 aerial victories , including 33 over the Western Front , claimed in 375 combat missions .

 = Capitulation of Saldanha Bay = 
 The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay saw the surrender to the British Royal Navy of a Dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture the Dutch Cape Colony in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars . In 1794 the army of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic which then became a French client state , the Batavian Republic . Concerned by the threat posed to the trade routes between Great Britain and British India by the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa , a British expeditionary force had landed at Simon 's Town in June 1795 and forced the surrender of the colony in a short campaign . The British commander , Vice @-@ Admiral Sir George Elphinstone , then reinforced the garrison and stationed a naval squadron at the Cape to protect the British conquest . 
 The Batavian government immediately ordered an expeditionary force to sail to the Cape and recapture the colony . This force comprised two ships of the line and five smaller vessels , all under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Engelbertus Lucas . Security regarding the plans was weak and the British knew of the operation before Lucas had sailed . The British warned Elphinstone , who further reinforced the Cape . Lucas 's journey took nearly six months , suffering shortages of drinking water leading to a near @-@ mutinous state among his crews . On arrival , the Batavian fleet anchored in Saldanha Bay to take on fresh water before deciding to abandon the operation and sail to the French base at Île de France in the Western Indian Ocean . 
 On 15 August 1796 Elphinstone 's larger fleet discovered Lucas 's force and trapped it in the bay . Aware that resistance would be futile and with his crews in open revolt , Lucas surrendered unconditionally . The ships of the captured Batavian force were taken into the Royal Navy , joining the squadron at the Cape ; Elphinstone was later made Baron Keith in recognition of his achievements . The Batavian operation did however force the cancellation of a planned British invasion of Île de France . Lucas faced a court martial on his return to the Netherlands , but died before it concluded by exonerating him for the defeat . The Cape Colony was not attacked again before the end of the war in 1802 , when the Treaty of Amiens returned it to the Batavian Republic . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the winter of 1794 the army of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic . The French National Convention reformed the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the Batavian Republic . This event alarmed the government of Great Britain , erstwhile allies of the Dutch , as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies . The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa ; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies , in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India . 
 To ensure that the Cape Colony did not become a French naval base , the Secretary of State for War , Henry Dundas , ordered a large expeditionary force to sail for the Cape in March 1795 . The force comprised two squadrons and 500 troops , all under the overall control of Vice @-@ Admiral Sir George Elphinstone ; more substantial reinforcements followed . Arriving on 10 June in False Bay , Elphinstone then conducted two months of fruitless negotiations with the government at the Cape , led by Abraham Josias Sluysken . On 7 August , with negotiations stalled , Elphinstone ordered an attack on Dutch positions at Muizenberg . The Dutch defenders withdrew , but Elphinstone 's forces were low on food and ammunition and not numerous enough to launch a major attack on Cape Town . On 14 September the arrival of British reinforcements under General Alured Clarke convinced Sluysken to surrender the colony . 
 Elphinstone turned his attention to planning operations against the Dutch East Indies and the French island base of Île de France . He sailed for Madras in his flagship HMS Monarch to take command of the East Indies Station , but maintained a strong garrison and naval presence at the Cape under Sir James Henry Craig and Commodore John Blankett . Much of his squadron was subsequently dispersed on operations across the Indian Ocean . While Elphinstone was consolidating his position , the Batavian government determined to recapture the Cape . A squadron was prepared under the command of Rear @-@ Admiral Engelbertus Lucas , who had sailed to the East Indies once in 1786 , but otherwise had no experience of long expeditionary campaigns . His force comprised two small 66 @-@ gun ships of the line , <unk> and Revolutie , and five smaller warships . After taking the Cape , Lucas was to continue his expedition in order to reinforce the Dutch East Indies . 
 = = Lucas 's voyage = = 
 Lucas 's expeditionary force sailed from the Texel on 23 February 1796 , intending to pass through the North Sea and around Scotland before entering the Atlantic and turning south . Unspecified French support for the operation had been promised by the National Convention , but did not materialise . The British North Sea Fleet was actively blockading the Texel and the 16 @-@ gun brig HMS Espiegle sighted the Batavian force putting to sea . Espiegle shadowed Lucas throughout the day , sending a message to Admiral Adam Duncan at Great Yarmouth . On 26 February a small British squadron led by Captain Henry Trollope in HMS Glatton detached from the cruising division of Rear @-@ Admiral Thomas Pringle and encountered the Batavians , the weaker British making off as Lucas formed a line of battle . 
 Having successfully evaded pursuit , Lucas followed his planned route , arriving at Las Palmas on Gran Canaria on 13 April . The journey had not been unobserved : a small British warship , the 20 @-@ gun HMS Mozelle under Captain Charles Brisbane , had sighted the Batavian force near Madeira while Mozelle was escorting two merchant ships to Barbados . Leaving the merchant ships to make their way unescorted , Mozelle followed Lucas for several days and then sailed south with all haste to bring a warning to the Cape . Despite noticing Mozelle , Lucas decided not to attack her . 
 After taking on supplies at Las Palmas , Lucas sailed to Praia on Cape Verde , before continuing south on 29 May in the direction of the Brazilian coast , hoping to profit from favourable winds and currents . In fact , due to persistent calms , a position off the Brazilian shore was only reached on 27 June . Because of the delay , Lucas decided not to supply himself but to sail directly to the Cape . Because Lucas made no stops on his journey between Cape Verde and the Cape , the fact that his voyage took far longer than a journey of this distance should have taken has surprised several authors . Historian C. Northcote Parkinson ascribed the delay , at least partially , to the poor quality of seamanship among Lucas 's crews . The Batavian expeditionary force did not speak to another vessel during this time and thus had no information regarding British dispositions when it eventually reached the Cape on 26 July . They first reconnoitred Saldanha Bay , then Table Bay to the south , and eventually on 6 August they anchored in Saldanha Bay . 
 British agents had observed Lucas 's preparations in the Netherlands and reported them in January , more than a month before the expedition sailed . The British Admiralty sent the frigate HMS Carysfort to the Cape with a warning . Carysfort arrived at the Cape in April , but vague accounts of Lucas 's mission had reached Elphinstone even earlier , appearing at Madras in March , less than a month after Lucas 's departure from the Texel . Sailing from Madras on 23 March , Elphinstone reached the Cape on 23 May where he received detailed reports of the size and status of the Batavian force heading for the Cape . The Admiralty had already responded to the threat by diverting substantial resources to the Cape : in addition to Elphinstone and Blankett 's forces a convoy of transports led by Captain William Essington arrived on 28 May and a small squadron under Pringle followed on 28 July , joined that day by Mozelle with the most detailed reports to date of Lucas 's movements . Subsequent reinforcements arrived from the squadron based in India , so that by August there were seven ships of the line and seven smaller vessels under Elphinstone 's command and the garrison of the Cape stood at 9 @,@ 400 British troops . 
 = = Saldanha Bay = = 
 Elphinstone was concerned that the Batavian force might not be sailing for the Cape at all . In May a powerful French frigate squadron under Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey had sailed past the Cape without stopping , observed by HMS Sphynx , which it chased back to Simon 's Town . If the Batavian force was sailing for the East Indies , it might bypass the Cape altogether . Elphinstone therefore decided to take his fleet out to sea to search for the Batavians . On 6 August Elphinstone sailed southwest from False Bay in search of Lucas , but a fierce storm caught the British , inflicting damage on the ships , including the loss of the mainmast on Monarch and flooding on HMS Ruby . The fleet returned to Simon 's Bay in a battered state on 12 August , to learn on arrival that Lucas 's force lay at anchor to the north . The following day a storm swept the bay . Most of Elphinstone 's ships were damaged : both HMS Crescent and HMS Trident grounded , and HMS Tremendous dragged anchors and was almost wrecked . 
 Lucas had arrived off the Cape on 26 July with no knowledge of Elphinstone 's dispositions . He had more pressing concerns : it had been several months since his ships had sighted land and his supplies of drinking water were running dangerously low . A significant proportion of his crews were suffering from disease and he had decided to send these men to an encampment ashore to allow for better treatment . Lucas even ordered that the sails on his ships be removed for repairs , rendering his ships temporarily immobile . On 9 August , Lucas was warned by a servant of a Dutch inhabitant of the Cape that a superior English force was present . He was informed that the Dutch population would not assist an attack on the British and strongly advised to sail away . Lucas however , on hearing this sailed deeper into the bay . Sir James Craig sent cavalry to Saldanha Bay to harry Batavian shore parties and organised the withdrawal of the local population and livestock to prevent their capture , following with a larger force under his own command . Lucas held a council with his senior officers , debating whether an attack on Cape Town was practical or whether they should abandon the operation . By 16 August the decision had been made to sail for Île de France , but Lucas delayed , unwilling to leave his sick men ashore . 
 As the Batavian force prepared to sail , on 16 August Elphinstone 's fleet appeared off the bay , led by the scouting frigate Crescent . He sent a letter to Lucas demanding his surrender but this was refused . <unk> the strength of the Batavian force , on 17 August Elphinstone led his fleet into the bay in line of battle and brought the line to anchor at close gunshot range from Lucas 's ships . Trapped between the coast and the British , Lucas immediately raised a flag of truce . He then sent an officer to negotiate terms with Elphinstone . By 17 : 00 , hopelessly outnumbered and his crews in open rebellion , Lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost unconditional surrender of the Batavian force . Elphinstone furthermore refused Lucas 's request for cartels to immediately send his crews back to the Netherlands .

 = = Aftermath = = 
 The warships of the Batavian squadron were all commissioned into the Royal Navy and attached to the squadron at the Cape , an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty . Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796 . There he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony . Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service , either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company . Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel <unk> . One of the captured ships , HMS <unk> became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain . Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane , who threw a noose around the ringleader 's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated , succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen . In the Batavian Republic Lucas 's surrender caused popular outrage . On the admiral 's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus <unk> . Lucas did not survive to see the conclusion of the trial , dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797 , but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797 . 
 Historians have held Lucas <unk> for refusing to fight Elphinstone 's force , which was far superior in both ships and men . Elphinstone 's ships carried more than twice as many men as the Batavian expedition , even before the British troops ashore are taken into account . Lucas could only muster 1 @,@ 972 men compared with the 4 @,@ 291 under Elphinstone 's command . The expedition has however been criticised for its lack of preparedness ; while it is true that promised French support failed to appear , the Batavian troops were insufficient in number to seriously threaten the British garrison . As Parkinson noted : " what could be the point of landing a few hundred men on a shore bristling with English bayonets ? " An unintended site @-@ effect of the campaign however was to forestall a British invasion of Île de France , which Elphinstone had postponed to prepare for Lucas 's arrival and which was ultimately cancelled entirely . 
 There were no further attacks on the Cape Colony during the war . The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 returned all captured Dutch colonies except Ceylon to the Batavian Republic , including the Cape Colony . The peace was short @-@ lived , and early in the Napoleonic Wars a second British expeditionary force was prepared . In 1806 the British seized the Cape Colony a second time following the Battle of Blaauwberg . Cape Colony remained part of the British Empire until its independence as part of a unified South Africa in 1910 .

A third remake , Adventures of Mana , was released for iOS , Android , and PlayStation Vita on February 4 , 2016 . 
 The story follows the hero and the young heroine as they attempt to thwart the Dark Lord of Glaive and his sorcerer assistant , Julius , from destroying the Tree of Mana and dooming their world . The game was released with many familiar elements of the Final Fantasy series , such as Chocobos , but these were later changed to feature common enemies and the gameplay style of the Mana series . 
 Final Fantasy Adventure was met with generally positive reviews at the time of its release . Over the course of time , reviewers have considered it one of the best action adventure games on the Game Boy . The game also spawned an entirely new game series , called the Mana series , which became a successful video game RPG franchise .

 In standard role @-@ playing game fare , the main character possesses several statistics , including hit points , power , and stamina , which can all increase upon gaining an experience level . Magic spells , which expend the character 's MP , can be used to heal oneself or damage enemies . These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals . In addition , the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength — the higher the gauge , the stronger his attack will be .

When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon , he will perform a special attack . 
 One additional , non @-@ controllable character may occasionally accompany the main character in the story and can perform different activities to aid the main character in his quest . The game also introduced the ability to kill townspeople , something that many role @-@ playing video games lack .

 Square trademarked Seiken Densetsu in 1989 , intending to use it for a game project subtitled The Emergence of Excalibur , and led by Kazuhiko Aoki for the Famicom Disk System . According to early advertisements , the game would consist of an unprecedented five floppy disks , making it one of the largest titles developed for the Famicom up until that point . Although Square solicited pre @-@ orders for the game , Kaoru Moriyama , a former Square employee , affirms that management canceled the ambitious project before it advanced beyond the early planning stages . In October 1987 , customers who had placed orders were sent a letter informing them of the cancellation and had their purchases refunded . The letter also suggested to consider placing an order on another upcoming Square role @-@ playing game in a similar vein : Final Fantasy . 
 After the release of the third Final Fantasy title in 1990 , Square offered designer Koichi Ishii to direct a spin @-@ off series game . It began development for the Game Boy under the working title Gemma Knights ; eventually , Square revived the trademarked name and released the game as Seiken Densetsu : Final Fantasy Gaiden . It was later released in Europe as Mystic Quest . Ishii suggested the basis of the game 's story , while scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase helped write the game 's script . Ishii designed all of the characters himself , while Goro Ohashi was responsible for the development of the game system . 
 The Mana series , of which Final Fantasy Adventure was the first game of , was the result of Koichi Ishii 's desire to create a fictional world . In Ishii 's opinion , Mana is not a series of video games , but rather a world which is illustrated by and can be explored through video games . When working on the series , Koichi Ishii drew inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood , as well as movies and fantasy books that captivated him as a child . Ishii took care to avoid set conventions , and his influences are correspondingly very wide and non @-@ specific . Nonetheless , among his literary influences , he acknowledges Tove Jansson 's <unk> , Lewis Carroll 's Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , and J. R. R. Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings .

After undergoing several membership changes in its initial years , the band has consisted of the same six members since 1989 : Marty Roe ( lead vocals , rhythm guitar ) , Gene Johnson ( mandolin , guitar , fiddle , tenor vocals ) , Jimmy Olander ( lead guitar , Dobro , banjo ) , Brian Prout ( drums ) , Dan Truman ( keyboards , organ , synthesizer ) , and Dana Williams ( bass guitar , baritone vocals ) . 
 After assuming the name Diamond Rio , the band was signed to Arista Nashville and debuted in 1991 with the single " Meet in the Middle " , which made them the first band ever to send a debut single to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts . The band charted 32 more singles between then and 2006 , including four more that reached No. 1 : " How Your Love Makes Me Feel " ( 1997 ) , " One More Day " ( 2001 ) , " Beautiful Mess " ( 2002 ) , and " I Believe " ( 2003 ) . 
 Diamond Rio has recorded nine studio albums , four Greatest Hits compilations , and an album of Christmas music . Three of the band 's albums have achieved RIAA platinum certification in the United States . In addition , Diamond Rio has received four Group of the Year awards from the Country Music Association , two Top Vocal Group awards from the Academy of Country Music , and one Grammy Award out of thirteen nominations . The band is known for its vocal harmonies , varied instrumentation , and near @-@ exclusive use of only its own membership on recordings instead of session musicians . Their sound was originally defined by mainstream country , bluegrass , and rock influences , but later albums drew more influence from Christian country music and country pop . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 In 1982 , Matt Davenport and Danny Gregg founded a band at Opryland USA , a former country music @-@ based amusement park in Nashville , Tennessee . The band was first named the Grizzly River Boys , after a new river rafting ride at the park , but quickly changed names to the Tennessee River Boys due to its members disliking the original name . Originally intended to promote the park through a one @-@ time television special , the band proved popular enough that it became one of many regular performers there . Davenport , Gregg , and Ty Herndon alternated as lead vocalists , with Davenport also playing bass guitar and Gregg on rhythm guitar ; completing the lineup were Larry Beard ( lead guitar , fiddle , banjo ) , Mel Deal ( steel guitar ) , Al <unk> ( piano ) , and Ed <unk> ( drums ) . The group " swapped lead voices , told jokes , and balanced old @-@ school country concert shtick with a contemporary sound . " Herndon left the group in 1983 to compete on the talent show Star Search , and became a solo artist for Epic Records between 1995 and the early 2000s . Herndon was temporarily replaced by Anthony Crawford and then Virgil True before his role was taken over by Marty Roe , who had originally toured nationally with the Christian band <unk> , and worked in the park by doing impersonations of Larry Gatlin . Following Herndon 's departure , <unk> and <unk> quit as well , with Dan Truman ( who had previously played in Brigham Young University 's Young Ambassadors ) and Jimmy " J. J. " Whiteside taking their places . Beard quit shortly afterward and ultimately became a session musician , and former Mel McDaniel sideman Jimmy Olander took his place . The band , through the assistance of Bill Anderson 's drummer Len " Snuffy " Miller , submitted demos to various Nashville record labels with no success . 
 By 1985 , the Tennessee River Boys had quit working at Opryland . According to Roe , while the band enjoyed playing at the park , they also felt that their status as a theme park attraction discredited them as " real musicians " to those in the Nashville community . For the next few years , they played at small venues such as high school auditoriums , and usually worked no more than four concerts a month . They also competed on Star Search , but were eliminated in the first round . Frustrated by the sporadic touring schedules , Whiteside quit the group and was replaced by Brian Prout , who previously performed in Hot Walker Band and Heartbreak Mountain . Around 1986 , Deal and Gregg both left the group , the latter due to health complications from a serious illness he had developed as a teenager . They initially chose to operate as a quintet , with Davenport as the sole lead vocalist and Roe and Prout singing harmony ; when this arrangement proved unsuccessful , they found <unk> Gene Johnson , a former member of the bluegrass group Eddie Adcock 's IInd Generation , which Olander was a fan of as a child . Johnson debuted at a concert in Clewiston , Florida in May 1987 . Also at this point , the band members supplemented their incomes with outside jobs : Johnson continued to work in carpentry , as he had done before joining the band , while Olander and Roe mowed lawns , and Prout drove tour buses . 
 In 1988 , the band caught the attention of Keith Stegall , a singer @-@ songwriter who would later become known primarily for his work as Alan Jackson 's record producer . Stegall produced demos for the Tennessee River Boys , but noted that Davenport could not record the lead vocal and bass parts at the same time , as they would be difficult to separate in the control room . As a result , Stegall had Roe sing a " scratch " vocal track live with the other musicians , which would then be replaced by Davenport 's voice in post @-@ production . Upon hearing Roe sing the " scratch " track , Stegall successfully convinced the other members that Roe should be the lead vocalist instead . Due to his discomfort outside the lead role and his wife 's dissatisfaction with his career , Davenport quit in late 1988 , becoming the last founding member to leave . The group quickly had to find a replacement , as they were scheduled to appear on the talk show Nashville Now on January 23 , 1989 . Alan <unk> , who had just left Baillie & the Boys , expressed interest in replacing Davenport , but ultimately declined due to other commitments . They finally chose Dana Williams , a nephew of the bluegrass group Osborne Brothers and former sideman for Jimmy C. Newman , who had been a fan of the Tennessee River Boys since Herndon was a member . 
 = = = 1990 : Signing with Arista Nashville = = = 
 Williams officially joined before the Nashville Now appearance , but the band still did not have a record deal at this point . They continued to record demos in Prout 's garage with assistance from Monty Powell , who had previously hired Roe and Olander for recording jingles , but wanted to produce commercial music . Powell was a friend of audio engineer Mike Clute , who would later become one of the band 's producers , and songwriters Tim DuBois and Van Stephenson . DuBois was talking with record executive Clive Davis about creating a country music branch of Arista Records called Arista Nashville ; Stephenson would later sign to the label in 1993 as a member of Blackhawk . Initially , DuBois was hesitant about signing the Tennessee River Boys , as he felt that there were too many popular bands in country music , and he was about to sign both Asleep at the Wheel and Exile . He expressed interest in signing Roe as a solo artist , but at Powell 's insistence , he agreed to see the band open for George Jones at a May 1989 concert , and officially signed them to Arista Nashville in 1990 . The band members also decided to choose a new name , as they thought that Tennessee River Boys sounded more suitable for a bluegrass or gospel group than a country one . Among the names they had chosen were Kilroy and T @-@ Town Mavericks , the latter of which was rejected by Arista executives . Prout suggested Diamond Rio , after the truck manufacturing company Diamond Reo Trucks . The name had been previously rejected by another country band , Shenandoah , whose lead singer Marty Raybon ( also a former member of Heartbreak Mountain ) gave Prout permission to use the name even though Shenandoah " conducted business " under that name . 
 Shortly after the band received its record deal , the band underwent a series of misfortunes when Olander , Johnson , and Williams came down with health problems . On August 9 , 1990 , Johnson was injured in a carpentry accident in Arkansas a day before his 41st birthday , severely cutting his left thumb . Robert Bolin substituted for Johnson during the band 's tour in Brazil with Kevin Welch and Jann Browne . On September 6 , four weeks after Johnson 's accident , Williams was water skiing with his family in <unk> , Tennessee as his boat came forward at high speed when his wife was picking him up . The propellor slashed Williams ' legs and he was rushed to a hospital for his injuries . Brian <unk> and Paul Gregg ( Danny Gregg 's brother , and a member of Restless Heart ) substituted for Williams . Meanwhile , Olander discovered that he had a lemon @-@ sized tumor that was pressing against his esophagus . The tumor was never successfully diagnosed , although it ultimately vanished . 
 = = Musical career = = 
 = = = 1991 – 1992 : Diamond Rio = = = 
 After Olander , Williams , and Johnson had recovered , the six musicians set to work on their debut album . In doing so , Johnson soon discovered that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin , and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them . The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys , to the point that they occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day . 
 Arista Nashville released Diamond Rio 's debut single , " Meet in the Middle " , on February 6 , 1991 . As the lead single to their self @-@ titled debut album , " Meet in the Middle " went on to spend two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts , making Diamond Rio the first country music group ever to send its debut single to the top of that chart . Following its release , the band performed its first official concert as Diamond Rio on May 4 , 1991 . They shared the bill with Wild Rose , whose membership included Prout 's then @-@ wife , Nancy Given Prout . Released three weeks later with DuBois and Powell as producers , Diamond Rio was met with positive critical reception from critics such as Allmusic , Chicago Tribune , and Entertainment Weekly , which praised the band 's vocal harmonies , instrumentation , and song choices . 
 Four more singles were released from Diamond Rio , all reaching top 10 on the Billboard country singles charts : " Mirror , Mirror " , " Mama Don 't Forget to Pray for Me " , " Norma Jean Riley " ( which was previously the B @-@ side of " Mama Don 't Forget to Pray for Me " ) , and " Nowhere Bound " , the latter two of which were co @-@ written by Powell . Roe and Prout had found both " Mama Don 't Forget to Pray for Me " and " Mirror , Mirror " by attending shows at the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville , a popular spot for performances by aspiring songwriters . Truman and an employee of Arista had found " Norma Jean Riley " , which was originally titled " Pretty Little Lady " until DuBois remarked that the lady in the song should have a name : " It could be ' Norma Jean Riley ' , anything ! " Johnson spoke positively about " Mama Don 't Forget to Pray for Me " , which was written and originally recorded by Larry Cordle , and the impact that it had on fans . He recalled a letter sent to him by a female fan who had run away from home and chose to return after hearing that song , and said that " We already didn 't wanna do the <unk> ' songs and stuff ... if you 're gonna touch someone , touch them with something that 's positive . " 
 Diamond Rio was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipping one million copies in the United States . In addition , the band won the Academy of Country Music 's Top Vocal Group for 1992 , an award they would receive again in 1993 , 1994 , and 1997 . They were also nominated for Top New Vocal Duet or Group by the same association in 1992 . A cut from the album , the instrumental " Poultry Promenade " , gave the band its first Grammy Award nomination . 
 = = = 1992 – 1995 : Close to the Edge and Love a Little Stronger = = = 
 Close to the Edge , the group 's second album , was released in 1992 . Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500 @,@ 000 copies , the album produced the Top 5 country hits " In a Week or Two " and " Oh Me , Oh My , Sweet Baby " , the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album Beyond the Blue Neon . The next singles , " This Romeo Ain 't Got Julie Yet " and " Sawmill Road " , both failed to reach top 10 . Roe considered Close to the Edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it ; in a 1994 interview with New Country magazine , he stated : " There aren 't ten great songs out there for everybody , certainly not that you could find in a 30 @-@ day period of time . " Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of " This Romeo Ain 't Got Julie Yet " , which he co @-@ wrote , saying that it was " by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that 's at the time when I 'm <unk> ' , ' Oh , this is easy , let 's write this . It 's kinda cute . " Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song , but described the rest of the album with favor , saying that its " strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God , family and honest living – traditional stuff , no doubt influenced by the members ' bluegrass background " , while Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune thought that " In a Week or Two " and " Sawmill Road " , " which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood " , were the strongest tracks . 
 In 1994 , the band released its third album , Love a Little Stronger . The album was recorded on a more relaxed schedule than the previous album ; as a result , they did not have a single on the charts for three months after " Sawmill Road " fell off the charts . For this album , Clute joined DuBois and Powell as co @-@ producer , a role that he has held on all of the band 's subsequent releases . The title track ( co @-@ written by Billy Crittenden , later a member of the vocal group 4 Runner ) , reached a peak of No. 2 on the Billboard country singles charts , and No. 1 on the country singles chart published by Radio & Records . It was followed by the No. 9 hit " Night Is Fallin ' in My Heart " and the Top 20 hits " Bubba Hyde " and " Finish What We Started " . Because the band had taken a longer period of time to choose songs for Love a Little Stronger , they considered it a superior album to its predecessor ; Mansfield shared a similar opinion in his review of the album , stating that " Spurred by the relatively lackluster performance of Close to the Edge ... Diamond Rio explored the musical possibilities of its talents rather than digging for easy commercial success . " This album also earned the band its second platinum certification . 
 = = = 1996 – 1999 : IV , Greatest Hits , and Unbelievable = = = 
 IV , Diamond Rio 's fourth album , was released in 1996 . It was the " first country release recorded entirely on a digital console " ; specifically , a Fairlight console which recorded the album directly to a hard drive . Produced by DuBois , Clute , and the band itself , it was also their first album not to have Powell as a co @-@ producer . According to DuBois , Powell left this role on good terms , as he " saw a need to go in a certain direction , and the guys saw a need to go in a different direction . " Roe thought that the album benefited from a new label policy that allowed label personnel to respond more quickly to pitches from songwriters , specifically recalling to Billboard that the label 's head of artists and repertoire ( A & R ) recommended the lead single " Walkin ' Away " while co @-@ writer Craig Wiseman ( who co @-@ wrote " Bubba Hyde " ) was still recording its demo , and the band was able to record the song in the same day that the demo was completed . " Walkin ' Away " peaked at No. 2 on the country charts in early 1996 . Three more singles were released from the album : the top 10 hits " That 's What I Get for Lovin ' You " and " Holdin ' " ( also written by Wiseman ) , with the top 20 " It 's All in Your Head " , co @-@ written by Van Stephenson , in between . The music video for " It 's All in Your Head " featured Martin Sheen and Ramon Estevez , the former playing the part of a snake handling preacher . 
 A year after IV , Diamond Rio released its first Greatest Hits package , which included eleven of the singles from their first four albums , plus the album cut " She Misses Him on Sunday the Most " from IV and two new songs : " How Your Love Makes Me Feel " and " Imagine That " . " How Your Love Makes Me Feel " became the band 's second No 1 on Hot Country Songs , as well as their longest @-@ lasting at three weeks , making it the biggest chart hit for any country group that year . " Imagine That " , co @-@ written by Bryan White , reached Top 5 by early 1998 . Greatest Hits became the band 's third platinum album . 
 Diamond Rio was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in April 1998 , becoming the first band in fourteen years to be inducted . Later in the year , the band released its fifth studio album , Unbelievable . Contributing songwriters to the album included Paul Williams , former NRBQ member Al Anderson , Robert John " Mutt " Lange , and Huey Lewis . The lead single was the ballad " You 're Gone " , which reached top 5 on the country charts . After it was the title track , which peaked at No. 2 on the country charts and became the band 's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 , where it reached No. 36 . The third and final single was " I Know How the River Feels " , originally recorded on Herndon 's 1996 album Living in a Moment and later released as a single by <unk> in 2000 . Diamond Rio 's rendition peaked at 33 on the country charts , their lowest chart peak at the time . 
 In 1998 , Prout began dating Mary Bono , the widow of singer and politician Sonny Bono . The two became engaged but later ended their relationship in 2001 . On December 28 of the same year , Prout married singer @-@ songwriter Stephanie Bentley , best known for co @-@ writing Faith Hill 's 1999 single " Breathe " . 
 = = = 2000 – 2002 : One More Day = = = 
 Diamond Rio released its twenty @-@ third official chart single , " Stuff " , in May 2000 . The song was originally intended to be the title track to their sixth studio album , which would have been released on August 22 of the same year , but according to Truman , " Certain radio stations , for some reason , didn 't want to play ' Stuff ' . " As a result , " Stuff " was withdrawn after peaking at number 36 on the country charts , and the album was delayed until February 2001 . Following this song 's failure , the band released " One More Day " later in 2000 . The song was written by Steven Dale Jones and Bobby <unk> , the same two writers who wrote " She Misses Him on Sunday the Most " . " One More Day " went on to spend two non @-@ consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the country charts , with the album , by this point re @-@ titled One More Day , having its release date moved up to February 6 , 2001 . The song also peaked at No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 , in addition to reaching top 10 on the Adult Contemporary charts ( the band 's first appearance on that chart ) . Regarding the song 's popularity among fans who have used the song to cope with personal losses , Prout said , " Actually , ' One More Day ' was recorded as a love song . Then one of Oklahoma State 's basketball team 's plane went down , then in early 2001 we lost Dale [ Earnhardt ] in Daytona , and then of course , 9 / 11 came after that . And every event of that year , the song took on a different meaning to different people ... We hear quite often in e @-@ mails and people talking to us in shows . If you 're asking how it makes us feel ? Pretty darn special ... to know that you had that impact on someone 's life and helped in a tough time of healing and hope . " 
 The third and fourth singles from One More Day were less successful : " Sweet Summer " made Top 20 , while " That 's Just That " failed to make Top 40 . The album featured a guest vocal from Chely Wright on " I 'm Trying " , making for the band 's first ever duet with another artist on one of their own albums . It also included a cover of " Hearts Against the Wind " , originally recorded by J. D. Souther and Linda Ronstadt for the Urban Cowboy soundtrack . Chris Neal of Country Weekly ( now Nash Country Weekly ) thought that the album showed a greater musical variety than its predecessors , specifically noting the " spoken @-@ word verses " of " Here I Go Fallin ' " , the " Hearts Against the Wind " cover , and the Wright duet as standout tracks . 
 Starting in 2001 , the other members had noticed that Roe was having difficulty maintaining proper pitch in concert , but they did not want to confront him about it for fear of " <unk> [ ing ] his ego " , although they eventually convinced Roe of his problems by recording each concert and listening to it together . He also consulted unsuccessfully with vocal coaches and throat doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center . The band attempted to cover up Roe 's problems by removing certain songs from concert set lists , lowering the key on others , having Truman sometimes take the lead vocal , and using pitch correction software , but even these did not fully correct the issues . Finally , they consulted vocal coach Diane Sheets , a friend of Johnson 's son @-@ in @-@ law . She determined that Roe was over @-@ compensating for a small degree of hearing loss typical of musicians who have performed live for long periods of time , thus tightening muscles in his throat and diaphragm and causing him to lose pitch . Although Roe was initially " cynical " toward Sheets 's coaching , she was ultimately successful in restoring his voice . 
 = = = 2002 – 2007 : Completely , Can 't You Tell , and Greatest Hits , Volume 2 = = = 
 In 2002 , Diamond Rio released its seventh studio album , Completely . The band originally conceived it as a double album , featuring traditional country on one disc and more pop @-@ oriented country on the other , but according to Prout , this concept did not fully materialize because " country music has blinders on as far as what 's acceptable – and what isn 't " , although Olander and Williams noted that the idea allowed them " more leeway in choosing songs " . In addition to earning a gold certification , it produced two consecutive No. 1 singles in " Beautiful Mess " and " I Believe " , the latter being the band 's last single to top Hot Country Songs . Third single " <unk> " made Top 20 , while the last single , " We All Fall Down " ( also written by Steven Dale Jones ) , failed to reach top 40 . Two of the album 's tracks were previously recorded by other artists : " Make Sure You 've Got It All " , written by Bill Anderson and Steve Wariner , was originally recorded on Collin Raye 's 1998 album The Walls Came Down , and " If You 'd Like Some Lovin ' " by its co @-@ writer , David Ball , on his 1996 album Starlite Lounge . 
 Rick <unk> of Allmusic praised the album for its musical variety , saying , " With artists as well anchored in the business as Diamond Rio , the musical quality is a given . The real challenge is outdoing yourself and coming up with fresh concepts . The selections on this album seem to be the fruition of that search for musical renewal " . He cited " Beautiful Mess " and " I Believe " as standout tracks . Ray Waddell of Billboard also thought that the singles were among the best tracks on the album , while highlighting the instrumental track " Rural Philharmonic " ( which Olander had originally intended to record for a solo album ) as an example of the band 's strong musicianship . Chrissie Dickinson of The Chicago Tribune was less favorable , commending the " masterful musicianship " and Roe 's " light vocal timbre " , while criticizing the song selections as " mostly a paint @-@ by @-@ numbers trip around the musical block , from the predictable power balladry of ' I Believe ' to the saccharine sentiments of ' We All Fall Down . ' " 
 A seventh album , tentatively titled Can 't You Tell , was recorded in 2003 , but it was cancelled after its first two singles – the title track and " One Believer " – both failed to make Top 40 upon their releases in late 2004 and early 2005 respectively . Diamond Rio 's second Greatest Hits package , Greatest Hits , Volume 2 , was released in 2006 . Like their first Greatest Hits album , this compilation included several new songs as well as the band 's greatest hits ; one of these new songs , " God Only Cries " , was released as a single , peaking at No. 30 . Shortly after the album 's release , Diamond Rio parted ways with Arista Nashville . 
 = = = 2007 – present : New record label , The Reason , and I Made It = = = 
 On August 31 , 2007 , Diamond Rio signed with Word Records , a Christian music label based in Nashville . Their first album for Word was a Christmas album entitled A Diamond Rio Christmas : The Star Still Shines , which they recorded in Olander 's basement studio . Roe said in an interview with CMT that " we just didn 't try to copy anybody else . We tried to make up our own arrangements . " The group released its first contemporary Christian album , The Reason , on September 22 , 2009 . It earned the band three Dove Award nominations : Song of the Year for " God Is There " , Country Song of the Year for the title track , and Country Album of the Year . 
 In 2014 , Olander told The Arizona Republic that the group was no longer signed to Word Records and planned to release new material independently . " I will say that I was proud of the material , but maybe it 's not the best version of Diamond Rio , " Olander told the publication . " We were kind of in a no @-@ man 's land . We didn 't fit in with country radio and we didn 't fit with Christian radio . It was something that wasn 't fully realized . " The band began releasing records independently , starting with a live album in 2014 and following in 2015 with the studio album I Made It .

 Diamond Rio has been featured on several projects featuring multiple country artists , including three tribute albums released between 1993 and 1994 . The first was a cover of the Eagles ' 1975 hit " Lyin ' Eyes " for Common Thread : The Songs of the Eagles , an album released in late 1993 via Giant Records which featured various country musicians covering that band 's songs . Diamond Rio had originally wanted to record the song for Love a Little Stronger , but DuBois rejected the idea because he felt that they were not yet well @-@ established enough to record a cover song on one of their own albums . The second was Keith Whitley : A Tribute Album , to which they contributed a cover of Keith Whitley 's 1986 hit " Ten Feet Away " , and the third was a cover of Merle Haggard 's " Workin ' Man Blues " for a tribute album entitled Mama 's Hungry Eyes : A Tribute to Merle Haggard . This rendition , which featured guest appearances from Lee Roy Parnell and Steve Wariner ( both of whom were also signed to Arista Nashville at the time ) , was credited to " Jed Zeppelin " . This rendition peaked at No. 48 on the Billboard country charts from unsolicited airplay , and was made into a music video . In 1996 , the band covered " Beauty and the Beast " for the multi @-@ artist compilation The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney and contributed the original song " Christmas Spirit " ( which Powell and Roe co @-@ wrote ) to Star of Wonder : Country Christmas Collection , a Christmas album featuring various artists on Arista Nashville 's roster . A year later , Diamond Rio contributed a recording of the gospel standard " Walkin ' in Jerusalem " to a compilation entitled Peace in the Valley : A Country Music Journey Through Gospel Music . Diamond Rio and Collin Raye also sang backing vocals on Kenny Rogers ' 2000 single " He Will , She Knows " . Finally , in 2002 , they were featured on country parodist Cledus T. Judd 's " Man of Constant Borrow " , a parody of " Man of Constant Sorrow " on his album Cledus Envy . 
 Some of the individual members have also contributed to songs by other artists . Roe sang duet vocals with then @-@ labelmate Pam Tillis on " Love Is Only Human " , a cut from her 1992 album Homeward Looking Angel . Olander was featured along with bluegrass musicians Carl Jackson and Mark O 'Connor on the track " Hap Towne <unk> " from Steve Wariner 's 1996 instrumental album No More Mr. Nice Guy . He also co @-@ wrote Kenny Chesney 's 2001 single " I Lost It " , Marshall <unk> 's 2001 single " You " , and the track " The Night Before ( Life Goes On ) " from Carrie Underwood 's 2005 debut album Some Hearts . Truman co @-@ wrote Shane Minor 's 1999 single " Ordinary Love " ; Minor would later co @-@ write the band 's hit " Beautiful Mess " . In 2003 , Truman and songwriter Jason Deere co @-@ founded the Nashville Tribute Band , which has recorded three albums for missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints , of which Truman is a member . Roe , Johnson , and Williams sang backing vocals on Josh Turner 's 2006 single " Me and God " ( from the album Your Man ) , which also featured a guest vocal from bluegrass musician Ralph Stanley . 
 = = Musical stylings = = 
 In the country music industry particularly , record producers hire mostly session musicians to record tracks for an album for both solo artists and bands , as opposed to rock bands who record their own instrumental and vocal tracks on their albums . Diamond Rio has been one of few self @-@ contained country bands to have followed the practice of each member playing their own instruments and singing their own vocals on all their albums themselves , without any additional input from outside musicians . The sole exception has been the inclusion of string sections on some of their later work , starting with " I Know How the River Feels " and continuing through certain tracks on One More Day and Completely . 
 Their early music blended neotraditionalist country with occasional traces of country rock , primarily in the song 's prominent rhythm sections . A bluegrass influence has also been shown , primarily in the three @-@ part harmonies among Roe ( lead ) , Williams ( baritone ) , and Johnson ( tenor ) . Bluegrass influences are also shown in the band 's prominent use of the mandolin , as well as in the instrumentals featured on many of their earlier albums . The band 's later material has tended towards pop @-@ oriented ballads , such as " I Believe " and " One More Day " – songs which received critical acclaim for their often religious @-@ themed messages , but were considered departures from the more traditional material of their first four albums . 
 Another trademark of Diamond Rio 's sound is the custom @-@ built B @-@ Bender guitar played by Olander . He refers to this instrument as the " <unk> " because of its yellow body and black @-@ and @-@ white checkered pickguard , which give it the coloration of a taxicab .

 Diamond Rio received the Academy of Country Music 's award for Top Vocal Group in 1991 and 1992 . In 1992 , 1993 , 1994 , and 1997 , they also received the Country Music Association 's award for Vocal Group of the Year ( an award for which they received fifteen total nominations , more than any other country music group ) . In addition , Diamond Rio has received thirteen Grammy Award nominations . In 2010 they received three nominations for the GMA Dove Awards , and on April 22 won the award for Country Album of the Year . In 2011 , they received their first Grammy Award in the Grammy Award for Best Southern , Country or Bluegrass Gospel Album category for The Reason .

 " Love Is Blindness " is a song by the rock band U2 , and the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Achtung Baby . The song was written on piano by lead singer Bono during the recording sessions for U2 's 1988 album Rattle and Hum . Originally intending to give the song to singer Nina Simone , the band decided to keep it for Achtung Baby after playing it together . Thematically , the song describes a failing romance , mixing personal themes with imagery of metaphorical acts of terrorism . During the recording sessions for Achtung Baby , guitarist the Edge separated from his wife , Aislinn O 'Sullivan . The separation had a major effect on the development of the song ; the ending guitar solo was a cathartic experience for the Edge , as he snapped several guitar strings during the recording . 
 " Love Is Blindness " made its live debut on the group 's 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour and was performed regularly during the tour , appearing in 154 of its 157 concerts . It was commonly played as either the penultimate or closing song ; as the penultimate song , it was usually followed by a rendition of the Elvis Presley song " Can 't Help Falling in Love " . Following the tour , " Love Is Blindness " has been played live only two other times . The track was favourably received by critics and has been covered by multiple artists .

 " Love Is Blindness " was developed by lead singer Bono during the recording sessions for U2 's 1988 album Rattle and Hum . He wrote the song on a piano , which guitarist the Edge said is " not an instrument he is noted for playing . " The torch songs of Jacques Brel influenced Bono 's songwriting . His initial plan was to send it to Nina Simone , one of his favourite singers , although after playing the song together , the band decided to keep it for themselves . They did not include the song on Rattle and Hum because they believed it was not " U2 enough " . 
 During the recording sessions for Achtung Baby , the Edge separated from his wife , Aislinn O 'Sullivan . Reflecting on the impact it had on U2 , Bono said , " We 're a really tight community . This is not like somebody 's , you know , girlfriend 's left . We 've grown up with these people , this our family , our community . This was really hard for us ... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community , starting to go ' crack ' . " The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage : " I was disappearing into the music for a different reason . It was a refuge in a way . That approach didn 't completely work . You know , I wasn 't really ... in a good positive headspace . I was running away , I suppose . " While recording the guitar solo that concludes the song , the Edge " put everything into it , all the feeling , all the hurt , all the angst , everything went into that solo . " Bono said , " his whole life came out of him when he played ... when we went for the take , one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder . Another string broke . And he has such a light touch , ordinarily , he 's so gentle . All that left him for a kind of rage . And yet there 's not one bum note in there . " Audio engineer Flood said the " bold , unadulterated , naked [ guitar solo ] sound was a combination of the part , the moment , a good guitar , a small amp , a simple mic . Edge just got an idea , tried it , and it worked straightaway . " 
 = = Composition and theme = = 
 " Love Is Blindness " runs for 4 : 23 ( 4 minutes , 23 seconds ) . According to Hal Leonard Corporation 's sheet music published at Musicnotes.com , it is played in a 6 / 4 time signature at a tempo of 48 beats per minute in a key of B @-@ flat minor . 
 The production team gave bassist Adam Clayton 's bass a " low end bass throbbing effect " , which the Edge described as " a real stroke of genius from the production team . " Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr . ' s drum pattern was taken from U2 's 1987 single " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " and slowed down . The lyrics " [ mix ] up the personal and the political . " Bono noted that " There was some reference to the little death , which can be taken to mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism . " Quoting the lyric " A little death without mourning / No call and no warning / Baby , a dangerous idea / That almost makes sense " , he said , " There 's nothing more deadly than an idea – or a person – that 's almost right . You know , it took the 20th century a hundred years to get over communism . There 's another dangerous idea that almost made sense . " 
 U2 biographer Bill Flanagan credits Bono 's habit of keeping his lyrics " in flux until the last minute " with providing a narrative coherence to the album . Flanagan interpreted Achtung Baby as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love , the sun ; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home . For Flanagan , the final three songs on Achtung Baby — " Ultraviolet ( Light My Way ) " , " Acrobat " , and " Love Is Blindness " — are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other . Uncut contributor Gavin Martin believed the song contained " images of love , debased or abandoned . " He wrote , " With its stark , <unk> organ intro , pulsating bass synth and guitar reverb stretched into a hallucinatory squall , it brilliantly describes the discord and dread that provide a constant undertow to Achtung Baby . And yet , through its alluring sonic palette and wounded but sensual vocal , ' Love Is Blindness ' also maps out a search for harmony and salvation " . 
 Author Atara Stein wrote that the song " suggests that love can operate only through a willful self @-@ deception , a voluntary surrender to what one knows is an illusion . The singer begs his lover to ' wrap the night ' around him because , as he proclaims , ' I don 't want to see . ' The singer knows that the image he creates of his loved one is false , but it is the only image that can satisfy him . He must perceive his beloved in idealized terms , so she can reflect back to him the image of himself that he desires to see . " Journalist Bill Graham believed the song was a bleak account of a failing romance . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes wrote that the song " takes us back – again – to the shadowy world of deceit , infidelity , and betrayal . It depicts love at the end , the very end , of its tether . It is as bleak and as despairing a view of the world as you 're likely to get , reflecting the emotional climate in which the entire album had been made . " He noted , " In terms of its mood , ' Love Is Blindness ' had the dark , sensual and decadent feel of pre @-@ war Berlin " , adding that the lyric " Love is blindness / I don 't want to see " was " a desolate acknowledgement of the terrible reality that it is sometimes better not to know . "

 " Love Is Blindness " was favourably received by critics . Uncut contributor Gavin Martin rated the song five stars , calling it " rapturous and unsettling . " Hot Press editor Niall Stokes said , " its sentiments made it the perfect conclusion to Achtung Baby , describing the Edge 's playing as " a mournful , ejaculatory guitar solo , stabbing out thick emotional blues notes that linger and then fall away like tears . " Third Way reviewer Roland Howard described it as " haunting and melodic " , believing it to be about the loss of virginity . Music journalist Bill Wyman said the Edge 's guitar playing on the song sounded like a " dentist 's drill " . Jon Pareles of the New York Times described it as " a kind of summation " , calling it " an elegy that compares love to ' drowning in a deep well ' and wishes for it anyway . " Geoffrey Himes of The Washington Post wrote that it has " a gospel quality , as swooning synth parts are set against block piano chords , and Bono acknowledges that mismatched lovers will suffer their inevitable fate . " 
 Greg Potter of The Vancouver Sun believed it to be a " dour closer " that was " riddled with images of self @-@ doubt and uncertainty " . A critic for the Waterloo Region Record said it was " hardly great U2 , but U2 closers have always been anti- climactic . " Writing for the Boston Herald , <unk> called it a " broken @-@ hearted [ lament ] " that was " gentle " and " subdued " . George Varga of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said it was one of the most interesting tracks on the albums , calling it a " spare , David Bowie @-@ like [ ode ] to tormented love " . Michael Ross of The Sunday Times and James Healy of The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune lamented that U2 did not include it on the compilation album The Best of 1990 – 2000 . The Edge called it " a great end to the album and probably one of Bono 's finest lyrics . " Bono said , " The bass sounds like liquid at the centre of the earth , a kind of molten lava bass sound . " Describing the Edge 's guitar playing , he said , " It 's incredible . "

 " Love Is Blindness " debuted on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland , Florida , on the opening night of the Zoo TV Tour , where it closed the concert . It remained in this position throughout the first and second leg of the tour , with only two concerts concluding with an alternate song – " With or Without You " . " Love Is Blindness " was not performed on either of those two occasions . Beginning on the third leg of the tour it was followed by a cover of the Elvis Presley song " Can 't Help Falling in Love " and , on one occasion , " Are You Lonesome Tonight ? " . The song was performed at 154 of 157 concerts on the tour , closing 67 of them . On multiple occasions Bono brought a girl from the audience on to the stage to dance with during the song . Following the conclusion of the Zoo TV Tour , " Love Is Blindness " has appeared in concert only twice . The first occasion was on the Elevation Tour ; while performing in Calgary , Alberta , on 10 April 2001 , Bono sang a few lines from the song at the conclusion of " One " . The final appearance was during a Vertigo Tour concert in Buenos Aires , Argentina , on 1 March 2006 , when U2 performed the song spontaneously to conclude the concert . 
 U2 concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra called the live rendition " sultry , as the screens show a constellation map , giving the crowd a feeling of floating across the universe by the way it moves , transmitting a mood of distance and loneliness that corresponds with the nature of the song . " Mark Lepage of The Gazette described the dance at the conclusion as " an appropriate moment of human contact after almost two hours of uproar . " Julie <unk> of the Boston Herald believed it to be an anticlimatic finish to the concert , calling the song " low @-@ key " and saying " U2 soared for more than 90 minutes , but left with a whimper , instead of a bang . " Gary Graff of the Houston Chronicle believed it to be a " moody show @-@ closer " . Writing for The Arizona Daily Star , Gene Armstrong called it an " achingly romantic closing tune " , describing the Edge 's solo as " especially tender " . 
 A live performance of the song appears on Zoo TV : Live from Sydney ( 1994 ) , and Zoo TV Live ( 2006 ) . The Zoo TV Live performance is an audio rip of the performance from Zoo TV : Live from Sydney . One performance , recorded on 30 August 1992 in New York City , was included as a B @-@ side on some versions of U2 's 1994 single " Stay ( Faraway , So Close ! ) " . A video for the song , directed by Matt Mahurin , was included on the 1994 VHS single " Numb " . It featured the studio recording set to footage of the Zoo TV Tour . An acoustic performance by the Edge appears in the 2011 documentary From the Sky Down .

 = War of the Fifth Coalition = 
 The War of the Fifth Coalition was fought in the year 1809 by a coalition of the Austrian Empire and the United Kingdom against Napoleon 's French Empire and Bavaria . Major engagements between France and Austria , the main participants , unfolded over much of Central Europe from April to July , with very high casualty rates for both sides . Britain , already involved on the European continent in the ongoing Peninsular War , sent another expedition , the Walcheren Campaign , to the Netherlands in order to relieve the Austrians , although this effort had little impact on the outcome of the conflict . After much campaigning in Bavaria and across the Danube valley , the war ended favourably for the French after the bloody struggle at Wagram in early July . 
 The resulting Treaty of Schönbrunn was the harshest that France had imposed on Austria in recent memory . Metternich and Archduke Charles had the preservation of the Habsburg Empire as their fundamental goal , and to this end the former succeeded in making Napoleon seek more modest goals in return for promises of Franco @-@ Austrian peace and friendship . Nevertheless , while most of the hereditary lands remained part of Habsburg territories , France received Carinthia , Carniola , and the Adriatic ports , while Galicia was given to the Poles and the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians . Austria lost over three million subjects , about one @-@ fifth of her total population , as a result of these territorial changes . Although the Peninsular War continued , the War of the Fifth Coalition was the last major conflict on the European continent until the French invasion of Russia in 1812 sparked the Sixth Coalition . 
 = = Background = = 
 Europe had been embroiled in warfare , pitting revolutionary France against a series of coalitions , nearly continuously since 1792 . After five years of war , the French Republic subdued the First Coalition in 1797 . A Second Coalition was formed in 1798 , only to be defeated . In March 1802 , France ( now under Napoleon , as First Consul ) and Great Britain , its one remaining enemy , agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens . For the first time in ten years , all of Europe was at peace . However , many disagreements between the two sides remained unresolved , and implementing the agreements they had reached at Amiens seemed to be a growing challenge . Britain resented having to turn over all of its colonial conquests since 1793 when France was permitted to retain most of its conquered territory in Europe . France , meanwhile , was upset that British troops had not evacuated the island of Malta . In May 1803 , Britain declared war on France . 
 = = = Third Coalition ( 1804 – 1805 ) = = = 
 With the resumption of hostilities , Napoleon ( proclaimed Emperor in 1804 ) planned an invasion of England , spending the better part of the next two years ( 1803 – 05 ) on this objective . In December 1804 , an Anglo @-@ Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition . British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion . Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes , and by April 1805 , the two had signed a treaty of alliance . Alarmed by Napoleon 's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule , and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France , Austria would join the coalition a few months later . 
 In August 1805 , the French Grande Armée invaded the German states in hopes of knocking Austria out of the war before Russian forces could intervene . On 25 September , after great secrecy and feverish marching , 200 @,@ 000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of 160 miles ( 260 km ) . Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Bavaria . Napoleon hoped to swing his forces northward and perform a wheeling movement that would find the French at the Austrian rear . The Ulm Maneuver was well executed , and on 20 October Mack and 23 @,@ 000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm , bringing the total number of Austrian prisoners in the campaign to 60 @,@ 000 . The French captured Vienna in November and went on to inflict a decisive defeat on a Russo @-@ Austrian army at Austerlitz in early December . Austerlitz led to the expulsion of Russian troops from Central Europe and the humiliation of Austria , which signed the Treaty of Pressburg on 26 December . 
 = = = Fourth Coalition ( 1806 – 1807 ) = = = 
 Austerlitz incited a major shift in the European balance of power . Prussia felt threatened about her security in the region and , alongside Russia , went to war against France as part of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 . One hundred and eighty thousand French troops invaded Prussia in the fall of 1806 through the Thuringian Forest , unaware of where the Prussians were , and hugged the right bank of the Saale river and the left of the Elster . The decisive actions took place on 14 October : with an army of 90 @,@ 000 , Napoleon crushed Hohenlohe at Jena , but Davout , commander of the III Corps , outdid everyone when his 27 @,@ 000 troops held off and defeated the 63 @,@ 000 Prussians under Brunswick and King Frederick William III at the Battle of Auerstadt . A vigorous French pursuit through Northern Germany finished off the remnants of the Prussian army . The French then invaded Poland , which had been partitioned among Prussia , Austria , and Russia in 1795 , to meet the Russian forces that had not been able to save Prussia . 
 The Russian and French armies met in February 1807 at the savage and indecisive Battle of Eylau , which left behind between 30 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 casualties . Napoleon regrouped his forces after the battle and continued to pursue the Russians in upcoming months . The action in Poland finally culminated on 14 June 1807 , when the French mauled their Russian opponents at the Battle of Friedland . The resulting Treaty of Tilsit in July ended two years of bloodshed and left France as the dominant power on the European continent . It also severely weakened Prussia and formed a Franco @-@ Russian axis designed to resolve disputes among European nations .

 After the War of the Oranges , Portugal adopted a double policy . On the one hand John , Prince of Brazil , as regent of Portugal , signed the Treaty of Badajoz with France and Spain by which he assumed the duty to close the ports to British trade . On the other hand , not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor ( 1386 ) with Portugal 's oldest ally , Britain , he allowed for such trade to continue and maintained secret diplomatic relations with them . However , after the Franco @-@ Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar , John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain . 
 Unhappy with this change of policy of the Portuguese government , Napoleon sent an army to invade Portugal . On 17 October 1807 , 24 @,@ 000 French troops under General Junot crossed the Pyrenees with Spanish cooperation and headed towards Portugal to enforce Napoleon 's Continental System . This was the first step in what would become the six @-@ year @-@ long Peninsular War , a struggle that sapped much of the French Empire 's strength . Throughout the winter of 1808 , French agents became increasingly involved in Spanish internal affairs , attempting to incite discord between members of the Spanish royal family . On 16 February 1808 , secret French machinations finally materialised when Napoleon announced that he would intervene to mediate between the rival political factions in the Spanish royal family . Marshal Murat led 120 @,@ 000 troops into Spain and the French arrived in Madrid on 24 March , where wild riots against the occupation erupted a few weeks later . The resistance to French aggression soon spread throughout the country . The shocking French defeat at the Battle of Bailén in July gave hope to Napoleon 's enemies and partly persuaded the French emperor to intervene in person . A new French army commanded by Napoleon crossed the Ebro in autumn and dealt blow after blow to the opposing Spanish forces . Napoleon entered Madrid on 4 December with 80 @,@ 000 troops . He then unleashed his troops against Moore 's British forces . The British were swiftly driven to the coast , and , after a last stand at the Battle of Corunna in January 1809 , withdrew from Spain entirely . 
 = = = Austria stands alone = = = 
 Austria sought another confrontation with France to avenge the recent defeats , and the developments in Spain only encouraged its attitudes . Austria could not count on Russian support because the latter was at war with Britain , Sweden ( which meant Austria could not count on Swedish support either ) , and the Ottoman Empire in 1809 . Some in the government of Frederick William III of Prussia initially wanted to help Austria , but their hopes were dashed when Stein 's correspondence with Austria , planning such a move , was intercepted by the French and resulted in Prussia being compelled to sign the crushing Convention of September 1808 . The British had been at war with the French Empire for six years . A report from the Austrian finance minister suggested that the treasury would run out of money by mid @-@ 1809 if the large army that the Austrians had formed since the Third Coalition remained mobilised . Although Charles warned that the Austrians were not ready for another showdown with Napoleon , a stance that landed him amidst the so @-@ called " peace party " , he did not want to see the army demobilised . On 8 February 1809 , the advocates for war finally succeeded when the Imperial Government secretly decided to make war against France . 
 = = = Austrian reforms = = = 
 Austerlitz and the subsequent Treaty of Pressburg in 1805 indicated that the Austrian army needed reform . Napoleon had offered Charles the Austrian throne after Austerlitz , an act that aroused deep suspicion from Charles ' brother , Austrian emperor Francis II . Even though Charles was allowed to spearhead the reforms of the Austrian army , Francis kept the Hofkriegsrat ( Aulic Council ) , a military advisory board , to oversee the activities of Charles as supreme commander . 
 In 1806 , Charles issued a new guide for army and unit tactics . The main tactical innovation was the concept of the " mass " , an anti @-@ cavalry formation created by closing up the spacing between ranks . However , Austrian commanders disliked the innovation and rarely used it unless directly supervised by Charles . Following the failures at Ulm and Austerlitz , the Austrians went back to using the six @-@ companies @-@ per @-@ battalion model , abandoning the four @-@ company @-@ per @-@ battalion that had been introduced by Mack on the eve of war in 1805 . Problems persisted despite the reforms . The Austrians lacked sufficient skirmishers to successfully contend with their French counterparts , the cavalry was often sprinkled into individual units throughout the army , preventing the shock and hitting power evident in the French system , and even though Charles imitated the French corps command structure , leaders in the Austrian military establishment were often wary of taking the initiative , relying heavily on written orders and drawn @-@ out planning before they came to a decision . 
 Another reform was that Austria , having lost many officers , veteran and elite troops , and regulars , and unable to call on allies , embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French . By this time , the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle @-@ hardened and elite veterans . In a strange reversal of the earlier Napoleonic Wars , where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army , a massive amount of Austrian conscripts , with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained , campaign @-@ hardened , and well @-@ equipped French Grande Armée . 
 = = = Austrian preparations = = = 
 Charles and the Aulic Council were divided about the strategy with which to attack the French . Charles wanted a major thrust from Bohemia designed to isolate the French forces in northern Germany and lead to a rapid decision . The greater part of the Austrian army was already concentrated there , so it seemed like a natural operation . The Aulic Council disagreed on account of the Danube River splitting the forces of Charles and his brother John . They instead suggested that the main attack should be launched south of the Danube so as to maintain safer communications with Vienna . In the end , they had their way , but not before precious time had been lost . The Austrian plan called for the Bohemian corps , the I under Bellegarde , consisting of 38 @,@ 000 troops , and the II of 20 @,@ 000 troops under Kollowrat , to attack Regensburg ( Ratisbon ) from the Bohemian mountains by way of Cham , the Austrian center and reserve , comprising 66 @,@ 000 men of Hohenzollern 's III , Rosenberg 's IV , and Lichtenstein 's I Reserve Corps , to advance on the same objective through <unk> , and the left wing , made up of the V of Archduke Louis , Hiller 's VI , and Kienmayer 's II Reserve Corps , a total of 61 @,@ 000 men , to move forward toward Landshut and guard the flank . 
 = = = Congress of Erfurt ( 1808 ) = = = 
 At Tilsit Napoleon had made Tsar Alexander of Russia an admirer , but by the time of the Erfurt Congress from September to October 1808 anti @-@ French sentiment at the Russian court was beginning to threaten the newly forged alliance . Napoleon and his foreign minister Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> de <unk> sought to reaffirm the alliance once more in order to allow Napoleon to settle affairs in Spain , as well as prepare for the looming war with Austria . Working at cross @-@ purposes to Napoleon was his former foreign minister Charles Maurice de Talleyrand @-@ Périgord who had by this time come to the conclusion that Napoleon and his war policies were leading France to destruction , and who secretly advised Alexander to resist Napoleon 's demands . 
 Out of the meetings came an agreement , the Erfurt Convention ( in 14 articles , ) calling upon Britain to cease its war against France , recognizing the Russian conquest of Finland from Sweden , and stating that in case of war with Austria , Russia should aid France " to the best of its ability . " The two emperors departed for their homelands on October 14 . Six months later , the expected war with Austria began , and Alexander barely lived up to his agreement , aiding France as little as possible ( though in the resulting Treaty of Schönbrunn Russia did receive a portion of Austrian Polish territory , namely the district of Tarnopol , for at least maintaining neutrality ) . By 1810 , due mainly to the economic pressures of enforcing the Continental System , both emperors were considering war with one another . Erfurt was the last meeting between the two leaders . 
 = = = French preparations = = = 
 Napoleon was not entirely certain about Austrian planning and intentions . He had just returned to Paris at the time ( from his campaigns in Spain in winter 1808 – 09 ) and was instructing the main French field commander in southern Germany , Berthier , on planned deployments and concentrations for this likely new second front . His rough ideas about the possible upcoming campaign included the decision to make the Danube valley the main theatre of operations , as he had done in 1805 , and to tie down any Austrian forces that might invade northern Italy by positioning some of his own forces that would be commanded by Eugène and Marmont . Faulty intelligence gave Napoleon the impression that the main Austrian attack would come north of the Danube . On 30 March , he wrote a letter to Berthier explaining his intention to mass around 140 @,@ 000 troops in the vicinity of Regensburg ( Ratisbon ) , far to the north of where the Austrians were planning to make their attack . Napoleon also expected the Austrian offensive to commence no earlier than 15 April ( it would in fact begin on 9 April ) and his two contingency orders relayed to Berthier were based heavily on this supposition . These misconceptions about Austrian thinking left the French army poorly deployed when hostilities commenced . 
 = = Course of War = = 
 The war pitted a reformed Austrian army against a collection of French veterans and conscripts . With major engagements of the war lasting from April to July 1809 , Napoleon achieved the quick victory that characterised his previous campaigns . However , the War of the Fifth Coalition would also mark the last time in which Napoleon and the French Empire would emerge as decisive victors . 
 = = = Austria strikes first = = = 
 In the early morning of 10 April , leading elements of the Austrian army crossed the Inn River and invaded Bavaria . Bad roads and freezing rain slowed the Austrian advance in the first week , but the opposing Bavarian forces gradually retreated . The Austrian attack occurred about a week before Napoleon 's anticipations , and in his absence Berthier 's role became all the more critical . Berthier ( whose <unk> was staff work ) proved to be an insufficient field commander , a characteristic made worse by the fact that several messages from Paris were being delayed and misinterpreted when they finally arrived at headquarters . Whereas Napoleon had written to Berthier that an Austrian attack before 15 April should be met by a general French concentration around Donauwörth and Augsburg , Berthier focused on a sentence that called for Davout to station his III Corps around Regensburg and ordered the Iron Marshal to move back to the city despite massive Austrian pressure . 
 The Grande Armée d 'Allemagne was now in a perilous position of two wings separated by 75 miles ( 121 km ) and joined together by a thin cordon of Bavarian troops . Berthier , the French marshals , and the rank @-@ and @-@ file were all evidently frustrated at the seemingly pointless marches and counter marches . On the 16th , the Austrian advance guard had beaten back the Bavarians near Landshut and had secured a good crossing place over the Isar by evening . Napoleon finally arrived in Donauwörth on the 17th after a furious trip from Paris . Charles congratulated himself on a successful opening to the campaign and planned to destroy Davout 's and Lefebvre 's isolated corps in a double @-@ pincer manoeuvre . When Napoleon realised that significant Austrian forces were already over the Isar and were marching towards the Danube , he insisted that the entire French army deploy behind the Ilm River in a bataillon carré within 48 hours , all in hopes of undoing Berthier 's mistakes and achieving a successful concentration . His orders were unrealistic because he underestimated the number of Austrian troops that were heading for Davout ; Napoleon believed Charles only had a single corps over the Isar , but in fact , the Austrians had five corps lumbering towards Regensburg , a grand total of 80 @,@ 000 men . Napoleon needed to do something quickly to save his left flank from collapsing . 
 = = = Landshut Maneuver = = = 
 Davout anticipated the problems and withdrew his corps from Regensburg , leaving a garrison of only 2 @,@ 000 for defence . The northbound Austrian columns in the <unk> – <unk> zone ran into the four French columns heading west towards Neustadt in the early hours of the 19th . The Austrian attacks were slow , uncoordinated , and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps . Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout 's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians : while the Austrians attacked to the north , Masséna 's corps , later augmented by Oudinot 's forces , would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout . Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear . 
 The attack began well as the central Austrian V Corps guarding <unk> gave way to the French advance . Napoleon , however , was working under false assumptions that made his goals difficult to achieve . Massena 's advance towards Landshut required too much time , permitting Hiller to escape south over the Isar . The Danube bridge that provided easy access to Regensburg and the east bank had not been demolished , allowing the Austrians to transfer themselves across the river and rendering futile French hopes for the complete destruction of the enemy . On the 20th , the Austrians had suffered 10 @,@ 000 casualties , lost 30 guns , 600 caissons , and 7 @,@ 000 other vehicles , but were still a potent fighting force . Later in the evening , Napoleon realised that the day 's fighting had only involved two Austrian corps . Charles still had a good chance of escaping east over Straubing if he wished . 
 On the 21st , Napoleon received a dispatch from Davout that spoke of major engagements near Teugen @-@ Hausen . Davout held his ground , and although Napoleon sent reinforcements , about 36 @,@ 000 French troops had to face off against 75 @,@ 000 Austrians . When Napoleon finally learned that Charles was not withdrawing to the east , he realigned the Grande Armée 's axis in an operation that became known as the Landshut Maneuver . All available French forces , except 20 @,@ 000 troops under <unk> that were chasing Hiller , now hurled themselves against Eckmühl in another bid to trap the Austrians and relieve their beleaguered comrades . For 22 April , Charles left 40 @,@ 000 troops under Rosenburg and Hohenzollern to attack Davout and Lefebvre while detaching two corps under Kollowrat and Lichtenstein to march for <unk> and gain undisputed control of the river bank . At 1 : 30 pm , however , the sound of gunfire from the south could be heard — Napoleon had arrived . Davout immediately ordered an attack along the entire line despite numerical inferiority ; the 10th Light Infantry Regiment successfully stormed the village of <unk> and went on to capture the woods of Unter @-@ <unk> with horrific casualties . Napoleon 's reinforcements were soon crippling the Austrian left . The Battle of Eckmühl ended in a convincing French victory , and Charles decided to withdraw over the Danube towards Regensburg . Napoleon then launched Massena to capture Straubing to the east while the rest of the army pursued the escaping Austrians . The French managed to capture Regensburg after a heroic charge led by Marshal Lannes , but the vast majority of the Austrian army fled successfully to Bohemia . Napoleon then turned his attention south towards Vienna , fighting a series of actions against Hiller 's forces , most famously , at the Battle of <unk> on 3 May . Ten days later , the Austrian capital fell for the second time in four years . 
 = = = Aspern @-@ Essling = = = 
 On 16 May and 17 , the main Austrian army under Charles arrived in the Marchfeld , a plain northeast of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces . Charles kept the bulk of his forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross . On the 20th , Charles learned from his observers on the <unk> hill that the French were building a bridge at Kaiser @-@ <unk> , just southwest of the Lobau island , that led to the Marchfeld . On the 21st , Charles concluded that the French were crossing at Kaiser @-@ <unk> in strength and ordered a general advance for 98 @,@ 000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns , which were organised into five columns . The French bridgehead rested on two villages : Aspern to the west and Essling to the east . Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition , and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern @-@ Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades , making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been lighted on fire . 
 The Battle of Aspern @-@ Essling started at 2 : 30 pm on 21 May . The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods to the south failed completely , but Charles persisted . Eventually , the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half . The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6 pm because the fourth and fifth columns had longer marching routes . The French successfully repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st . Fighting commenced by 3 am on the 22nd , and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again . Napoleon now had 71 @,@ 000 men and 152 guns on the other side of the river , but the French were still dangerously outnumbered . Napoleon then launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and clinch the victory . Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians , inspired by the personal heroics of Charles with his rally of the Zach Infantry Regiment ( No. 15 ) , unleashed a hail of fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back . At 9 am , the French bridge broke again . Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for good , but still could not lay claim to Essling . A few hours later , however , the Austrians returned and took all of Essling except the staunchly defended granary . Napoleon replied by sending a part of the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp , who audaciously disobeyed Napoleon 's orders by attacking Essling and expelling all Austrian forces . Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims . Fighting diminished shortly afterwards , and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau . Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon 's military career .

 After the defeat at Aspern @-@ Essling , Napoleon took more than six weeks in planning and preparing for contingencies before he made another attempt at crossing the Danube . The French brought in more troops , more guns , and instituted better defensive measures to ensure the success of the next crossing . From 30 June to the early days of July , the French recrossed the Danube in strength , no less than 188 @,@ 000 troops marching across the Marchfeld towards the Austrians . Immediate resistance to the French advance was restricted to the outpost divisions of Nordmann and Johann von Klenau ; the main Habsburg army was stationed five miles ( 8 km ) away , centred on the village of Wagram . After a successful crossing , Napoleon ordered an attack along the entire line so as to prevent the Austrians from escaping during the night . Furious assaults by the " Terrible 57th " Infantry Regiment and the elite 10th Light Infantry Regiment against the village of <unk> led to an almost immediate French victory , but ultimately , the Austrians did not budge and kept the French from pressing further . <unk> attacks by the heroic Austrian Vincent <unk> ' cavalry forced the 10th and the 57th to retreat , leaving the French with no gains . Further attacks to the left of the line by Eugène and MacDonald also produced nothing . Bernadotte 's troops attacked later with equally disappointing results , and on the right Davout decided to disengage in the darkness of the night . The first day ended with the French on the Marchfeld but with little results to show for their efforts . 
 For 6 July , Charles planned a double @-@ envelopment that would require a quick march from the forces of his brother John , then a few kilometres to the east of the battlefield . Napoleon 's plan envisaged an envelopment of the Austrian left with Davout 's III Corps while the rest of the army pinned the Austrian forces . Klenau 's VI Corps , supported by Kollowrat 's III , opened the fighting in the second day at 4 am with a crushing assault against the French left , forcing the latter to abandon both Aspern and Essling . Meanwhile , a shocking development had occurred overnight . Bernadotte had unilaterally ordered his troops out of the key and central village of Aderklaa , citing heavy artillery shelling , an act that seriously compromised the entire French position . Napoleon was livid and sent two divisions of Massena 's corps supported by some cavalry to regain the critical village . After difficult fighting in the first phase , Massena sent in Molitor 's reserve division , which slowly but surely grabbed all of Aderklaa back for the French , only to lose it again following fierce Austrian bombardments and counterattacks . To buy time for Davout 's materialising assault , Napoleon sent 4 @,@ 000 cuirassiers under Nansouty against the Austrian lines , but their efforts led to nothing . To secure his center and his left , Napoleon formed a massive artillery battery of 112 guns that began pounding at the Austrians and tearing gaping holes through their lines . As Davout 's men were progressing against the Austrian left , Napoleon formed the three small divisions of MacDonald into a hollow , oblong shape that marched against the Austrian center . The lumbering phalanx was devastated by Austrian artillery but managed to break through the center , although the victory could not be exploited because there was no cavalry in the immediate area . Nevertheless , when Charles sized up the situation , he realised it was only a matter of time before the Austrian position broke completely and ordered a retreat toward Bohemia a few hours after noon . His brother John arrived on the battlefield at 4 pm , too late to have any impact , and accordingly ordered a retreat to Bohemia as well . 
 The French did not pursue the Austrians immediately because they were exhausted from two straight days of vicious fighting . After recuperating , they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid @-@ July . Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting . Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended , although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official .

 In Italy , Archduke John went up against Napoleon 's stepson Eugène . The Austrians beat back several bungled French assaults at the Battle of <unk> in April , causing Eugène to fall back on Verona and the Adige River , but Eugène regrouped and launched a more mature offensive that expelled the Austrians from Northern Italy again . By the time of Wagram , Eugène 's forces had joined Napoleon 's main army . In Dalmatia , Marmont , under the nominal command of Eugène , was fighting against General <unk> . Marmont launched a mountain offensive on 30 April , but this was repulsed by the Grenzer troops . Like Eugène , however , Marmont did not let an initial setback dictate the tempo of the conflict . He went back on the offensive and joined Napoleon at Wagram . 
 = = = = Poland = = = = 
 In the Duchy of Warsaw , Poniatowski defeated the Austrians at Raszyn on 19 April , prevented Austrian forces from crossing the Vistula river , and forced the Austrians to retreat from occupied Warsaw . Afterward , the Poles went on to invade Galicia , with some success , but the offensive quickly stalled with heavy casualties . The Austrians also won a few battles but were hampered by the presence of Russian troops whose intentions were unclear and that did not allow them to advance . Eventually , the defeat of the main Austrian army at Wagram decided of the fate of the war . 
 After the Austrian invasion of the Duchy of Warsaw , Russia , bound by the treaty of alliance with France , reluctantly entered the war against Austria . The Russian army under the command of General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809 . <unk> advanced as slowly as possible , with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians . There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops , with minimal losses . The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and , in fact , shared some operational intelligence . A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander , General Andrey Gorchakov , to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles , who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander . As a result , Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command . Furthermore , there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski , with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia . As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn , Russia received the Galician district of Tarnopol .

 In Tyrol , Andreas Hofer led a rebellion against Bavarian rule and French domination that resulted in early isolated victories , but the uprising was suppressed after the French won at Wagram . Hofer was executed in 1810 by a firing squad . 
 In Saxony , a joint force of Austrians and Brunswickers under the command of General Kienmayer was far more successful , defeating a corps under the command of General Junot at the Battle of <unk> . After taking the capital , Dresden , and pushing back an army under the command of Napoleon 's brother , Jérôme Bonaparte , the Austrians were effectively in control of all of Saxony . But by this time , the main Austrian force had already been defeated at Wagram and the armistice of Znaim had been agreed . The Duke of Brunswick however , refused to be bound by the armistice and led his corps on a fighting march right across Germany to the mouth of the River Weser , from where they sailed to England and entered British service .

 In the Kingdom of Holland , the British launched the Walcheren Campaign to relieve the pressure on the Austrians . The British force of over 39 @,@ 000 , a larger army than that serving in the Iberian Peninsula , landed at Walcheren on 30 July . However , by this time the Austrians had already lost the war . The Walcheren Campaign was characterised by little fighting but many casualties nevertheless , thanks to the popularly @-@ dubbed " Walcheren Fever " . Over 4 @,@ 000 British troops were lost , and the rest withdrew in December 1809 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Although France had not completely defeated Austria , the Treaty of Schönbrunn , signed on 14 October 1809 , nevertheless imposed a heavy political toll on the Austrians . As a result of the treaty , France received Carinthia , Carniola , and the Adriatic ports , while Galicia was given to the Poles , the Salzburg area of the Tyrol went to the Bavarians , and Russia was ceded the district of Tarnopol . Austria lost over three million subjects , about 20 % of her total population . Emperor Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs , gave recognition to Napoleon 's brother Joseph as the King of Spain , and reaffirmed the exclusion of British trade from his remaining dominions . The Austrian army would never field more than 150 @,@ 000 men at a time for the duration of the Napoleonic Wars . The Austrian defeat paved the way for the marriage of Napoleon to the daughter of Emperor Francis , Marie Louise . Dangerously , Napoleon assumed that his marriage to Marie Louise would eliminate Austria as a future threat , but the Habsburgs were not as driven by familial ties as Napoleon thought . 
 The impact of the conflict was not all positive from the French perspective . The revolts in Tyrol and the Kingdom of Westphalia during the conflict were an indication that there was much discontent over French rule among the German population . Just a few days before the conclusion of the Treaty of Schönbrunn , an 18 @-@ year @-@ old German named Friedrich <unk> approached Napoleon during an army review and attempted to stab the emperor , but he was intercepted in the nick of time by General Rapp . The emerging forces of German nationalism were too strongly rooted by this time , and the War of the Fifth Coalition played an important role in nurturing their development . By 1813 , when the Sixth Coalition was fighting the French for control of Central Europe , the German population was fiercely opposed to French rule and largely supported the Allies . 
 The war also undermined French military superiority and the Napoleonic image . The Battle of Aspern @-@ Essling was the first major defeat in Napoleon 's career and was warmly greeted by much of Europe . The Austrians had also shown that strategic insight and tactical ability were no longer a French monopoly . The French themselves were actually suffering from tactical shortcomings ; the decline in tactical skill of the French infantry led to increasingly heavy columns of foot soldiers eschewing all manoeuvre and relying on sheer weight of numbers to break through , a development best emphasised by MacDonald 's attack at Wagram . The Grande Armée lost its qualitative edge partly because raw conscripts replaced many of the veterans of Austerlitz and Jena , eroding tactical flexibility . Additionally , Napoleon 's armies were more and more composed of non @-@ French contingents , undermining morale . Although Napoleon manoeuvred with customary brilliance , as evidenced by overturning the awful initial French position , the growing size of his armies stretched even his impressive mental faculties . The scale of warfare grew too large for even Napoleon to fully cope with , a lesson that would be brutally repeated during the invasion of Russia in 1812 .

 Bridge No. 1860 , also known as the Samson Occom Bridge , is a fieldstone arch bridge in Montville , Connecticut , United States . Constructed by the Connecticut State Highway Department in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration project , it is located on Mohegan tribal land in an area that was once a part of Fort Shantok State Park . The bridge carries traffic from <unk> Side Road ( Special Service Road 433 ) over the Shantok Brook , a tributary of the Thames River . Spanning 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) across the brook , the bridge 's arch rises about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) above the water . According to a 2011 Connecticut Department of Transportation report , it carries 1 @,@ 100 vehicles per day . Samson Occom Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 .

 Officially referred to as Bridge Number 1860 in state records , the bridge is commonly known as the " Samson Occom Bridge " . On the south end of the bridge is a wooden sign that commemorates the Christian missionary and educator Samson Occom , a colonial @-@ period Mohegan from Montville , Connecticut . The sign does not actually declare it the " Samson Occom Bridge " , but states without further explanation that it is the " Site of the Samson <unk> Bridge " . The stone @-@ arch bridge spans 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) across the Shantok Brook , with its arch about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) over the water . Built in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration , the bridge is constructed of medium @-@ sized fieldstone and laid in cement mortar . The semi @-@ circular arch is constructed with a ring of stones , each about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) deep . Built up by " rubble construction " , the structure is made of fieldstone , including the wing walls . Rising above the 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) roadway are the spandrels of the bridge , which form low parapets with ramped ends . The total length of the bridge , including the railings , is about 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) long .

 In May 1991 , the Connecticut Historic Bridge Inventory plan outlined a plan for the preservation of the Samson Occom Bridge . It is unlikely that traffic would require replacement or modification of the bridge in the foreseeable future . According to a 2011 Connecticut Department of Transportation report , the bridge carries 1 @,@ 100 vehicles per day . The biggest threat to the bridge is moisture control and the repair of eroded surfaces . Stone arch bridges rarely require structural rehabilitation , but an alternative solution to structural rehabilitation would be to use concrete slab imbedded above the arch , only requiring raising the roadway . The report stated that the " rustic quality " of the bridge is not compatible with roadways larger than two lanes , but that additional width could be facilitated without compromising its historical significance . 
 = = Importance = = 
 The National Register of Historic Places nomination states that the Samson <unk> Bridge is significant as an example of the 1930s public works programs and as an example of " the picturesque park architecture of the early 20th century . " It was constructed at a time when cobblestone masonry was a popular choice for state park structures , but also after masonry was considered an obsolete building material . The bridge has added significance as an example of the work conducted by the federal Works Progress Administration . 
 = New York State Route 402 = 
 New York State Route 402 ( NY 402 ) was a state highway located within the village of Tivoli in Dutchess County , New York , in the United States . It was assigned in the early 1930s and served as a connector between NY 9G and what was once a ferry landing on the Hudson River west of the village . Although the ferry service linking Tivoli and the village of Saugerties was shut down in the 1940s , NY 402 continued to exist until 1980 . On April 1 of that year , ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York . The highway became part of an extended County Route 78 ( CR 78 ) , which had begun at the junction of NY 9G and NY 402 prior to the swap . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 402 began at what was once a ferry landing on the Hudson River west of the Tivoli village center , but within the village limits , in northwestern Dutchess County . The highway went southward from the ferry landing , paralleling the Hudson River for a short distance before it turned eastward and traversed a pair of hills as it approached the center of the village . In this area , NY 402 connected to Sycamore Point , a plateau overlooking the Hudson River . East of the highway leading to Sycamore Point , NY 402 intersected with Woods Road , a north – south highway marking the western edge of the village 's central district . 
 The route proceeded eastward through the village center , an area comprising homes , businesses , and St. Sylvia 's Church . It exited the area upon intersecting Clay Hill Road , at which point NY 402 changed names from Broadway to Mill Street . The route continued for another 0 @.@ 3 miles ( 0 @.@ 48 km ) to an intersection with NY 9G , where NY 402 ended and the roadway continued east as CR 78 .

 NY 402 was assigned in the early 1930s as a connector between NY 9G east of the village of Tivoli and a ferry landing on the Hudson River west of the village . At the landing , NY 402 connected to a ferry linking Tivoli to U.S. Route 9W ( US 9W ) in the village of Saugerties . The ferry service was shut down in the 1940s ; however , NY 402 remained in place until 1980 . On April 1 of that year , ownership and maintenance of NY 402 was transferred from the state of New York to Dutchess County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . Following the swap , the former routing of NY 402 became a westward extension of CR 78 , which began at the junction of NY 9G and NY 402 prior to the swap . 
 When NY 402 was assigned , it was one of two routes that served solely as a connector between a through highway and a ferry landing . The other route was NY 373 , a highway linking US 9 to a ferry across Lake Champlain at Port Kent . NY 347 , a short route connecting NY 22 to another ferry across Lake Champlain at Ticonderoga , was assigned later in the decade .

 = Battle of Machias = 
 The Battle of Machias ( also known as the Battle of the Margaretta ) was the second naval engagement of the American Revolutionary War , the Battle off Fairhaven being the first . It took place on June 11 – 12 , 1775 , in and around the port of Machias in what is now eastern Maine , and resulted in the capture by Patriot militia of a British schooner . 
 Following the outbreak of the war and the start of the Siege of Boston , British authorities enlisted the assistance of Loyalist merchant Ichabod Jones to assist in the acquisition of needed supplies . Two of Jones ' merchant ships arrived in Machias on June 2 , accompanied by the British armed sloop Margaretta , commanded by midshipman James Moore . The townspeople , unhappy with Jones ' business practices , decided to arrest him , and in the attempt , decided to go after Moore and his ship . Moore was able to escape out of the harbor , but the townspeople seized one of Jones ' ships , armed it and a second local ship , and sailed out to meet him . In a short confrontation , they captured Moore 's vessel and crew , fatally wounding him in the process . 
 The people of Machias went on to capture additional British ships , and fought off the landing of a large force intended to take control of the town in 1777 . Privateers and others operating out of Machias continued to be a thorn in the British Navy 's side throughout the war .

 On April 19 , 1775 , the American Revolutionary War began with the Battles of Lexington and Concord in the British Province of Massachusetts Bay . Following the battle , the militia that had mustered to oppose the British besieged the city of Boston where the British troops were located . 
 Boston 's British military leaders , Admiral Samuel Graves and General Thomas Gage , both had reason to do business with the people of Machias , a small coastal logging community located in what is now eastern Maine , but was then part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Gage required lumber to build barracks for additional troops arriving in the besieged city . Graves wanted to recover the guns from the wreck of HMS Halifax , which had apparently been intentionally run aground in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775 . The ship 's guns were reported to be of interest to the Patriots of Machias . Graves authorized Ichabod Jones , a Tory Machias merchant who had ships in the port of Boston , to take flour and other food supplies to the town of Machias aboard his two ships Unity and Polly in exchange for Gage 's needed lumber . To guarantee that this would happen , Graves sent the armed schooner Margaretta ( sometimes also spelled <unk> or Marguerite in historical accounts ) , under the command of James Moore , a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston , to accompany the two merchant vessels . Moore also carried orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck of the Halifax , which they would pass on the way . 
 = = Arrival at Machias = = 
 On June 2 , 1775 , Jones ' ships arrived in the port at Machias , while the Margaretta was delayed retrieving the guns from the Halifax wreck . Jones met resistance from the community by refusing to sell his pork and flour unless he was allowed to also load lumber for Boston . In a meeting on June 6 , the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones . The hostile climate led Jones to ask Moore to bring the Margaretta within firing distance of the town . This prompted the town to meet a second time ; this time they voted to permit the trade , and the Unity was docked at the wharf to begin unloading . 
 Following the vote , Jones announced that he would only do business with those who had voted in favor of trade . This angered those who had voted against , and Colonel Benjamin Foster , a local militia leader , conspired with militia from neighboring towns to capture Jones following the example of Brunswick militiamen a month earlier . Their plan to seize him at church on June 11 failed when he noticed the group of men approaching the building . Jones ran into the woods , from which he eventually emerged two days later . Moore and his second @-@ in @-@ command , who were also attending the services , also managed to get back to their ship .
