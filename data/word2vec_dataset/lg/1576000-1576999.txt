 Saadiq 's studio integrated modern equipment such as a Pro Tools digital workstation and an SSL 9000 mixing console , and featured various vintage gear , including Saadiq 's 1960s Ludwig drum kit and a kick @-@ drum mic purchased from Abbey Road Studios . In the studio , Saadiq and Brungardt experimented with techniques and equipment . They wanted the songs to have slower attacks like older recordings , as producers in the past did not have advanced compressors , audio tools that manipulate the dynamic content of signals and affect certain sounds in a recording 's mix . Their production applied tube <unk> and tube compressors , with the former used as a front end for Pro Tools . For Saadiq 's vocals , he used a Shure SM57 dynamic microphone to thicken and distort his voice and embellish his characteristically clean delivery , while Brungardt employed a compressor and a Pro Tools plug @-@ in during the mix . Saadiq sought a certain " edge " for his vocals and an unpolished sonic element for the album . They also tried to record tracks onto cassette tapes in order to produce a grittier , older sound . Brungardt used a FilterBank plug @-@ in when mixing the album to <unk> vocals and roll off high @-@ end sound from tracks . 
 Although they wanted to reproduce an older sound , Saadiq and <unk> also wanted to capture more of the bass and drum parts to add a louder , modern element to the mix . They applied a more basic approach to miking the instruments and utilizing the outboard gear , using a Neumann U 47 for guitars , alternating overhead microphones for Saadiq 's drum kit , a combination of dynamic and condenser mics for the kit 's bass drum , and <unk> tape machines for extra warmth to the kit . Brungardt used various standard mics for the snare drum to achieve a more solid cracking sound , rather than capturing the drum 's overall tone . Their miking of the guitars ' amps was adapted from The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions , and as Brungardt recounted , " It really gave us warmth and character . It allowed the amp to breathe and we got the tones of the amp along with the room . For me , that really opened things up so that I could play with the live room , using different reverbs to get a sound . " For Saadiq 's bass , they used a DI unit to connect a microphone preamplifier , increased the gain on a plug @-@ in for less compression , and adjusted the low @-@ end tones with an equalizer plug @-@ in . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The Way I See It has a traditional soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul . It is a departure from Saadiq 's previous work with neo soul , which bears a hip hop influence . J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond his work as a producer for other recording artists , for whom he encouraged a " classic aesthetic , heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic , deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas " . BBC Music 's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq 's use of 1960s soul as the album 's source material to be a reflection of " America 's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post @-@ Obama expression of hope in record form . " Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction as a response to the state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics : " You force so many terrible things on people , they get tired of it . We have a black president now . " 
 The album 's songs draw on Motown 's grooves , driving rhythms , tight drumming , tambourines in the rhythm section , guitar melodies , layered vocal arrangements , and two- to four @-@ minute durations . They also feature bright melodies , swinging bass , sweeping strings , and snare drums that emit reverb . Cameron <unk> of The <unk> said that the most hook @-@ oriented riffs are played on the bass and guitar , which blend " the low with the high " , and cited " Keep Marchin ' " , " Love That Girl " , and " Staying in Love " as examples . Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed that Saadiq follows the example of 1960s Motown artists such as Marvin Gaye , Smokey Robinson , Stevie Wonder , and Holland – Dozier – Holland , the label 's songwriting and production team . Robert Christgau wrote that the album shares Holland – Dozier – Holland 's " bright , swift , clearly hooked aesthetic " . Saadiq sings in a tenor voice , which is slightly distorted as a result of the album 's post @-@ production . 
 Saadiq 's songwriting is characterized by straightforward romanticism , positive exhortations , pining ballads , and message songs . Christgau interpreted Saadiq 's persona on the album to be " a romantic who stays true to the deliberate simplicity " of the song titles , but " never threatens to assume the fetal position if he doesn 't get the extreme cuddling he craves . " Patrick Varine of the Observer @-@ Dispatch asserted that Saadiq deviates significantly from contemporary R & B lyrics : " there are no thinly @-@ veiled food @-@ sex metaphors or pimp fantasies " . His songwriting also paraphrases classic soul lyrics and , on the album 's slower songs , expresses tightly coiled emotions . Saadiq said that some songs were written about his life experiences . He described the album as " basically a series of love songs about music , how falling in love can be easy , but staying true to it can be tricky . " He elaborated on this interpretation in an interview for the Chicago Tribune : " You have to watch out for those curves . <unk> music comes out , and how do you stay true to what you love ? I ’ m not saying everything has to sound like a ' 60s record to stay true , but you should never take the relationship lightly . " 
 The opening track , " Sure Hope You Mean It " , features slightly off @-@ beat percussion , tambourine shakes , and lyrics about a man who awaits a sign of approval from the woman he admires . " Keep Marchin ' " , which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments , was composed in the vein of the Civil Rights @-@ era soul music by artists such as Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers . Gail Mitchell from Billboard compared the song to Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions ' 1968 song " We 're a Winner " . Saadiq said " Keep Marchin ' " was also inspired by his journey in the music industry . " Big Easy " , featuring New Orleans @-@ style brass playing , was sung from the point of view of a man in New Orleans who reacts to Hurricane Katrina and looks for his lost lover . J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer remarked that the song " manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance , tearing lovers apart . " Its composition — mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics — is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland – Dozier – Holland . Saadiq was inspired to write " Big Easy " after watching the 2006 documentary film When the Levees Broke . He explained its upbeat composition in an interview for All Things Considered : " In New Orleans , when they mourn , they really celebrate and have a great time . I wanted to give it that same spirit . " 
 According to Saadiq , " Just One Kiss " can be interpreted as a song devoted to a female love interest , " but I 'm really talking about music and what it did for me . That one guitar line , that certain drum beat , how it turned my life into a ball of gold . " The song incorporates cinematic strings , xylophone , and a rolling crescendo . The ballad " Calling " , featuring Mexican balladeer Rocio Mendoza , draws on Motown 's late 1950s R & B roots and doo @-@ wop music , and incorporates Latin style guitar , and Spanish language lyrics . " Staying in Love " , an uptempo rhythm and blues song , was written by Saadiq after he thought of an ex @-@ girlfriend . <unk> with its 1960s @-@ inspired sound , " Let 's Take a Walk " has sexually forward lyrics and come @-@ ons , which the narrator uses to bluntly proposition his love interest . The midtempo " Never Give You Up " is fashioned in Motown 's early 1970 sound and , unlike other songs on the album , also incorporates elements from more modern soul music . " Sometimes " , which was inspired by Saadiq 's upbringing in a tough neighborhood in Oakland , is about dealing with the fatigue of universal hardships when they are worsened by the burden of racism . The line " now I know what they meant by ' keep your head to the sky ' " makes reference to Earth , Wind & Fire , whose music Saadiq immersed himself in while growing up . Saadiq said of the song 's message , " That 's just giving <unk> to my moms and grandmother and the people who raised me in the neighborhood to let them know its easy but not as easy as it seems all the time and sometimes we have to back up and cry but I 'm just giving thanks to the people that helped me along the way . "

 Before completing The Way I See It , Saadiq previewed its songs in May 2008 to music industry associates and journalists at the Sony Club in New York City . He also planned a grassroots marketing strategy for the record , which evolved from his difficulty with Columbia executives to promote the album and their idea of issuing its songs as vinyl records . He felt that " nobody at the label knew " him in an interview with The Dallas Morning News : " They had this record that I turned in that sounded like a ' 60s record . ' What the hell do we do with this record ? ' It was quality . There was not a lot of marketing and promotion , but they knew I had the credibility so you don 't just throw it in the garbage ... I don 't mind being a slow burn because that 's actually a better road to take . I have to go in one more time and prove myself again because I am starting over again . " In the week leading up to its release , Saadiq made promotional appearances at V @-@ 103 's For Sisters Only , the International Soul Music Summit , and the Uptown Restaurant & Lounge in Atlanta . He also performed songs from the album on VH1 <unk> . Columbia released the album both on CD and as a collector 's edition box set with 7 @-@ inch vinyl singles . In the United Kingdom , it was issued with two bonus tracks — a " Euro version " of " Big Easy " and the song " Come On Home " . 
 The Way I See It was largely overlooked by consumers upon its release . The album debuted at number 19 on the US Billboard 200 chart , selling 23 @,@ 000 copies in the week of October 4 . Nonetheless , it was Saadiq 's highest @-@ charting album in the United States at the time , and by November , had steadily sold 76 @,@ 919 copies . Five singles were released from the album — " Love That Girl " on August 5 , 2008 , " 100 Yard Dash " on March 30 , 2009 , " Never Give You Up " on May 27 , " Let 's Take a Walk " on August 7 , and " Staying in Love " on October 5 . " Love That Girl " , " Never Give You Up " , and " Staying in Love " all charted on the US Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs , peaking at number 45 , number 26 , and number 74 , respectively . During 2009 , Saadiq travelled for promotional television appearances and press in Europe , where The Way I See It had charted in several countries . In France , the record spent 51 weeks on the country 's albums chart , peaking at number 13 in the week of February 24 . In August , it re @-@ entered the American chart at number 101 and had sold 215 @,@ 000 copies . The album charted for 41 weeks on the Billboard 200 , serving as the longest chart @-@ run of Saadiq 's career . By May 2011 , it had sold 282 @,@ 000 copies , according to Nielsen SoundScan . 
 The Way I See It received generally positive reviews from critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications , the album received an average score of 79 , based on 20 reviews . Caroline Sullivan from The Guardian called it flawlessly produced and performed by Saadiq , and Rolling Stone magazine 's Will Hermes said the record showcased an original take on classic Northern soul . Andy Gill of The Independent wrote that it was one of 2008 's most captivating albums because " few have managed to retro @-@ fabricate that classic sound so accurately , nor in as many subtle variations " like Saadiq . AllMusic 's Andy Kellman stated , " Here 's where a modern master , backed by living and breathing session musicians ... masters the masters with startling accuracy . " In The Observer , Kitty Empire found the album " both feather @-@ light and substantial " because of how , " unlike most modern records , Saadiq 's tunes gather weight the deeper in you go " . Writing for MSN Music , Christgau said Saadiq sang with Smokey Robinson 's detailed sentimentality and Dennis Edwards ' amenable personality . Q was more critical , finding the record devoid of a " fresh approach " to elevate it from a simple homage . According to PopMatters writer Christian John Wikane , " one 's total enjoyment of the album depends on their appreciation of classic soul and R & B and whether such appreciation is contingent on absolute authenticity . " 
 At the end of 2008 , The Way I See It was included in a number of critics ' best albums lists . It was named one of the year 's 10 @-@ best records by the Los Angeles Times , The Wall Street Journal , and the Houston Chronicle , which cited it as ninth best . It was also ranked at number five by Exclaim ! , number seven by The Irish Times , number one by NPR , number five by The Observer , number three by Time Out , and number two by USA Today . The Way I See It was voted the 18th best album of 2008 in the Pazz & Jop , an annual poll of American critics nationwide , published in The Village Voice ; the poll 's singles list had six of the album 's songs voted in , including " 100 Yard Dash " at number 114 and both " Love That Girl " and " Big Easy " at number 250 . Nate Chinen of The New York Times included " 100 Yard Dash " in his top @-@ five singles list for 2008 . The Way I See It also nominated for the 2009 Grammy Award for Best R & B Album . " Love That Girl " was nominated for Best Traditional R & B Vocal Performance , while " Never Give You Up " was nominated for Best R & B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals .

 Saadiq toured for about two years to promote The Way I See It , performing in venues throughout the United States , Europe , and Asia . He was originally apprehensive at the prospect of touring extensively , having toured minimally as a solo act . He reconsidered at the advice of his rhythm guitarist Rob Bacon , which he recounted in an interview for the Los Angeles Times : " The money was just OK , so I was like , ' I don 't know – I could probably stay home and find something better , ' But then Rob reminded me , ' You know , all those cats you love , that 's exactly what they did . Little Richard ? He played 10 shows a day at the Apollo . ' I said , ' OK , let 's go . ' " To complement his songs ' style , Saadiq adopted a vintage soul image and , having studied footage of classic soul groups and album sleeves , donned old @-@ fashioned attire and performed R & B dance moves at shows . He wore a yellow tailored suit , while his nine @-@ piece backing band wore black suits . The band included a horn section and backup singer Erika Jerry . 
 Before the album 's release , Saadiq had toured Europe during the summer in 2008 . In November and December , he served as a supporting act for John Legend . He also opened for Seal and the Dave Matthews Band . Throughout his touring in the US and Europe , Saadiq played various music festivals , including Austin City Limits , Bonnaroo , Lollapalooza , South by Southwest , Voodoo Experience , Bumbershoot , Outside Lands , and Pori Jazz . In February 2009 , he performed at the Harvard Club of Boston as part of the music television series Live from the Artists Den . On June 25 , he played the Blue Note Tokyo in Japan . His performance at the Bataclan in Paris on July 11 was filmed and released as a DVD , entitled Live in Paris , in 2010 . After a stretch of summer festival performances in 2009 , Saadiq embarked on another leg of concerts during November and December , with Melanie Fiona , Janelle Monáe , and <unk> as supporting acts . The tour featured dates in North America , but Saadiq also performed at the Paradiso in Amsterdam on November 13 . He continued touring for the album into 2010 , including performances at the <unk> Festival in May , the Essence Music Festival in July , and a headlining performance at Central Park <unk> in August . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Way I See It was an exemplary release of the classic soul revival during its peak in 2008 . The music scene was marked by similarly retro @-@ minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele , independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap @-@ Kings and Mayer Hawthorne , and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette . Oliver Wang cited Saadiq 's album , along with Solange Knowles ' 2008 record Sol @-@ Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams , as one of the " retro @-@ soul " efforts that were released by contemporary R & B artists as the music scene peaked in popularity . Wang wrote that The Way I See It " showcased a mastery of any number of past R & B styles , including those out of Memphis , Muscle Shoals , Philadelphia , New Orleans , and of course , Detroit . " Estelle said in 2008 , " Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day . Not to take away from Amy , but this is the real shit . " It was described by David Nathan as the " contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late ' 60s and early ' 70s . " Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music : " You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm , but without an emotional commitment , it 's all tedious pandering to baby boomers . For Raphael Saadiq , there 's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas . " 
 The Way I See It also earned Saadiq the highest international profile of his career . In promoting the album , he broadened his audience demographic and expanded his repertoire as a touring artist . His extensive touring in the US and Europe garnered the attention of younger , white audiences who were not exposed to his previous solo albums and work with Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! . The Press of Atlantic City wrote that the album " brought in a whole new generation of Saadiq fans , with songs such as ' 100 Yard Dash ' striking a chord with even ironic teenagers . " According to Gail Mitchell of Billboard , The Way I See It helped Saadiq reach " the major @-@ market hipster crowd , music supervisors and festival bookers . " He also attained a following among Japanese audiences . Saadiq 's touring for the album influenced his approach for recording his next album , Stone Rollin ' , in 2011 , as he noted the louder , raw sound and general feeling of performing live . It also continued his partnership with Charles <unk> , who assisted Saadiq in recording Stone Rollin ' . 
 Saadiq called The Way I See It " the culmination of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on . " Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he " hit his artistic maturity " with the album . Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career , " In 1996 , Saadiq turned the climactic Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! album into a virtuoso history lesson . Six years later , he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory . Six years later yet again , he <unk> [ id ] himself with a fearless return to retro . " Elton John , a fan of Saadiq 's music since his beginnings with Tony ! Toni ! Toné ! , said that he was " blown away " by The Way I See It , citing it as " my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality . " He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009 . In an interview for Blues & Soul , Saadiq elaborated on the album 's impact on his career : " before that record – after I 'd been in Tony Toni Tone ! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought ' Oh well , he 's a producer now . He ’ s never gonna be an artist , he 's not gonna put the time in ' ... The Way I See It showed them that yes , I could put the time in still and be an artist ! "

 In 2008 , international fashion and fragrance company Puig announced that it had formed a partnership with Shakira and had signed an agreement " to develop a line of signature products produced with and inspired by the artist " . The agreement included the production and creation of several beauty and personal care products and it was stated that " Shakira will develop , with a dedicated team , the creation of the product line from inception to completion " . The distribution of the products and the creation of " strategic alliances " were chosen to be solely the responsibility of the company . Shakira expressed her views about the partnership , saying " I am very excited to be able to express myself through another creative medium . “ My feeling is that personal care and beauty should be effortless and accessible for everyone . " Interested in perfumery and conveying " emotions through aromas " , the singer decided to take the idea further and began exploring various scents . The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song , opining that " It 's similar to the process you go through when writing a melody : certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener . I wanted to find a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance " . José Manuel Albesa , chief brand officer of Puig , commented that Shakira was completely involved in the process of developing the fragrance and was " extremely hands @-@ on " . Didier Maine de Biran , general manager of Puig USA , opined that S by Shakira was different from other celebrity @-@ branded fragrances , saying " What makes this stand out is how involved she [ Shakira ] was .

 The fragrance of S by Shakira is categorized as a " transparent oriental " , and according to Shakira 's official website , it is inspired by " what is unique and exceptional about her , her light " . The perfume is made of a variety of exotic oils and substances derived from Middle Eastern and Indian regions . The top notes include citrus , peach , and passion fruit chord ; the heart notes give a " spicy freshness " through the use of various flowers like gardenia and sambac jasmine , and cinnamon ; the base notes consist of amber , musk , sandalwood and vanilla chord . The fragrance is meant to be used by women , and Shakira claimed that " The type of women who feel a connection with this fragrance would be independent and strong , but also a woman with a great capacity to love and a strong sense of who they are . It ’ s for a woman who believes in herself . " 
 The packaging of S by Shakira is designed to reflect light and features gold accents , which Puig felt would help it stand out . The bottle of the perfume is " soft and feminine " in design and is made of glass , which is surface finished and has six star @-@ shaped cuts carved in its bottom so that it is able to reflect light from different angles . India Today website <unk> likened the bottle to the shape of an " oriental dancer " . The bottle does not have any cap and instead utilises a key @-@ like structure to stop the flow of the perfume . The absence of the cap aims to represent " Shakira 's bare feet " . She explained her idea behind the design of the bottle : 
 I wanted the bottle to be something that could contain a dream . Solid like the bottles of yesteryear , but with a light feeling . And it comes with something special . The pendant containing the " S " symbolizes a charm for happiness that I wanted to share .

While attempting to cross the border , German officers find out that Mort is Jewish ( while doing a poor impersonation of a Catholic priest ) , resulting in their being chased by the Nazis . Mort , Stewie and Brian make a getaway on a motorbike , followed by an elaborate undersea pursuit in a hijacked U @-@ boat . The chase scene on the motorbike re @-@ enacts the skateboard chase scene in Back To The Future . Like Biff , the Nazi officers ' car ends up slamming into a manure truck ( " Das Poop ! " ) . The three make it to England safely , and see Churchill . Stewie examines the return pad and discovers it has run out uranium fuel . Brian states that the only place they can find the needed uranium in this time is at a " secret " nuclear testing facility in Berlin , Nazi Germany . The three join the Royal Air Force and fly a Lancaster bomber as they participate in a dogfight against a squadron of Luftwaffe Me @-@ 109 fighters , eventually reaching Berlin . After finding the nuclear research lab , Stewie disguises himself as Hitler , while the other two disguise themselves as Nazi Officers , and obtains the needed uranium . They then run into the real Hitler , who orders their execution , but they escape on the return pad back to their time ( Hitler offered to spare them if they performed a charming musical number , but Mort cuts the eager Stewie and Brian off at the first line ) . 
 The group arrives back in Stewie 's room 30 seconds before Mort originally entered the time machine . To keep these events from repeating themselves , Stewie kills the Mort that traveled with them by shoving him into the time machine and then blowing it up . The original Mort then enters the room and , now lacking the time machine " toilet " and seeing Stewie and Brian in Nazi uniform , soils himself instead .

 The episode begins with a swing band version of the orchestral theme from the 1980s miniseries The Winds of War and War and Remembrance . When Brian , Stewie , and Mort are chased by Nazis , a recreation of the chase scene , including music , from Back to the Future occurs where Stewie rides a makeshift skateboard , escapes and has the Nazis crash into a truck of manure . Also , the entrance into Warsaw mirrors Marty 's arrival in 1955 Hill Valley . When Stewie picks up a Nazi uniform there is a McCain @-@ Palin button attached . Stewie and Hitler re @-@ enact the famous " mirror " scene from the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup . The U @-@ Boat sequence is an adaptation of U @-@ 571 when Stewie decides to throw trash out of the submarine in order to stop the U @-@ Boat that was chasing them . Furthermore , the U @-@ boat crashing scene is a reference to the multiple police car chases ( and subsequent crashes ) from The Blues Brothers . The submarine scene also features a melody of ' Wishing Well ' by Terrence Trent D 'Arby . The scene where the Hawk Men defeat the Nazi air force is a parody of the film Flash Gordon , with its original soundtrack by Queen . Stewie , Brian and Mort 's escape from their crashing plane is a recreation of the raft scene from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom . The Hebrew wedding scene plays a song titled " Through Poland to a Jewish Village " .

 = Grumman XTSF = 
 The Grumman XTSF was a proposed twin @-@ engine torpedo scout aircraft , designed by Grumman for the United States Navy towards the end of World War II . Based on the design of the Grumman F7F Tigercat fighter , enlarged and with the addition of a bomb bay , the XTSF was deemed too large for carrier operations , and the project was cancelled before any aircraft were built . Instead , the Navy chose to order the single @-@ engine <unk> , which became the successful AF Guardian . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 In 1944 , it was determined that the Grumman XTB2F , then under development for the Navy , would be too large to practically and safely operate from aircraft carriers . Even the new Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers , known as " battle carriers " ( <unk> ) and the largest aircraft carriers built by any nation to that point , would have difficulty operating the massive aircraft , which was the size of a U.S. Army Air Force medium bomber . As a result , in late June 1944 , Grumman submitted its G @-@ 66 design to the Bureau of Aeronautics ( BuAer ) . After a review of the design by BuAer during the following month , a revised design was submitted , and on August 17 the existing contract for the XTB2F was modified to instead order two XTSF @-@ 1 aircraft , to be based on Grumman 's F7F @-@ 2 Tigercat two @-@ seat , twin @-@ engined fighter @-@ bomber , the first prototype intended to be a conversion of a F7F airframe . 
 A mid @-@ wing , all @-@ metal , cantilever monoplane with two Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing , the XTSF @-@ 1 was intended to carry two crew members in tandem seats , and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR @-@ 720 radar set , the radar later being replaced in the design by an AN / APS @-@ 3 or AN / APS @-@ 4 set . A second seat was added for the radar operator . 
 The outer wing of the XTSF was lengthened by 7 @.@ 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) compared to that of the F7F @-@ 2 , while the size of the horizontal stabilizer was increased by 28 inches ( 71 cm ) ) . The vertical stabilizer was also enlarged , while the aircraft 's weight increased by almost two thousand pounds ( 900 kg ) over that of the Tigercat . 
 The wings folded upwards for stowage aboard aircraft carriers , while the undercarriage and arrestor hook were hydraulically operated . Gun armament was planned to be four .50 caliber ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) Browning M2 machine guns , or , alternatively , two 20 mm Hispano cannon , while a bomb bay based on that of the Grumman TBF Avenger was installed in a fuselage stretched by 5 @.@ 5 inches ( 14 cm ) . 
 = = = Cancellation = = = 
 A mockup of the cockpit , center fuselage and wing center section was built and was inspected by the BuAer in the fall 1944 . However , the contract for the prototype XTSF @-@ 1s was terminated in January 1945 . This was due to a variety of factors , including the Navy 's belief that the Grumman engineers and factory were already at capacity producing the F6F Hellcat , the F7F , and the F8F Bearcat , that the XTSF @-@ 1 would be too large for practical operations from escort carriers , and because it was believed the Grumman G @-@ 70 , to be built as the <unk> , was a better prospect . In addition , the F7F was proving difficult to certify for operations from aircraft carriers , further prejudicing the Navy against the design . 
 Some sources erroneously state that the XTSF @-@ 1 became the XTB2F , however this is not the case . The XTSF @-@ 1 was the only aircraft ever designated by the U.S. Navy in the ' TS for Torpedo Scout ' category , the designation being superseded and incorporated , along with ' BT for Bomber @-@ Torpedo ' , ' SB for Scout @-@ Bomber ' and ' TB for Torpedo @-@ Bomber ' , into the new ' A for Attack ' series .

 = Flag of Italy = 
 The flag of Italy ( <unk> d 'Italia , often referred to in Italian as il Tricolore [ il <unk> ] ) is a tricolour featuring three equally sized vertical pales of green , white and red , with the green at the hoist side . Its current form has been in use since 18 June 1946 and was formally adopted on 1 January 1948 . 
 The first entity to use the Italian tricolour was the Cisalpine Republic in 1797 , which supplanted Milan after Napoleon 's victorious army crossed Italy in 1796 . The colours chosen by the Cispadane Republic were red and white , which were the colours of the recently conquered flag of Milan ; and green , which was the colour of the uniform of the Milanese civic guard . During this time , many small French @-@ proxy republics of Jacobin inspiration supplanted the ancient absolute Italian states and almost all , with variants of colour , used flags characterised by three bands of equal size , clearly inspired by the French model of 1790 . 
 Some have attributed particular values to the colours , and a common interpretation is that the green represents the country 's plains and the hills ; white , the snow @-@ capped Alps ; and red , blood spilt in the Wars of Italian Independence . A more religious interpretation is that the green represents hope , the white represents faith , and the red represents charity ; this references the three theological virtues . 
 = = Napoleonic era = = 
 The tricolour was reportedly used for the first time on November 13 @-@ 14 . 1794 on a cockade worn by a group of students of the University of Bologna , lead by Luigi Zamboni and Giovanni Battista De <unk> , who attempted to plot a popular riot to topple the Catholic government of Bologna , a city which was part of the Papal States at the time . The law students defined themselves as " patriots " and wore tricolour cockades to signal they were <unk> by Jacobin revolutionary ideals , but modified them to distinguish themselves from the French . The chosen colours were white and red since those are the colours of the flag of Bologna , some scholars contend green was added only for the event to give it a more <unk> effect ; not all agree that the cockades used by the Bologna plotters actually had three colours , since a myth about that may have been created a year later . On May 18 . 1796 a cockade with those colours commemorating the Bologna riots was reportedly presented to Napoleone Bonaparte in Milan , who decided banners with same colours would be carried by the Milan Civic Guard , of the Lombard Legion and the National Guard . 
 The first official tricolore italiano , or Italian tricolour , was adopted on 7 January 1797 , when the <unk> Parliament of the Cispadane Republic , on the proposal of deputy Giuseppe <unk> of Lugo , decreed " to make universal the ... standard or flag of three colours , green , white , and red ... " This was probably because the Legione <unk> had carried banners of red , white ( from the flag of Milan ) , and green ( from the uniform of the civic guard ) , and the same colours were later adopted in the banners of the Legione Italiana , which was formed by soldiers coming from Emilia and Romagna . The flag was a horizontal square with red uppermost and , at the heart of the white fess , an emblem composed of a garland of laurel decorated with a trophy of arms and four arrows , representing the four provinces that formed the Republic 
 The Cispadane Republic and the <unk> Republic , which had itself been using a vertical Italian tricolour from 1796 , merged into the Cisalpine Republic and adopted the vertical square tricolour without badge in 1798 . The flag was maintained until 1802 , when it was renamed the Napoleonic Italian Republic , and a new flag was adopted , this time with a red field carrying a green square within a white lozenge . 
 In 1799 , the independent Republic of Lucca came under French influence and adopted as its flag a horizontal tricolour with green uppermost ; this lasted until 1801 . In 1805 Napoleon installed his sister , Elisa Bonaparte <unk> , as Princess of Lucca and Piombino . This affair is commemorated in the opening of Leo Tolstoy 's War and Peace . 
 In the same year , after Napoleon had crowned himself first French Emperor , the Italian Republic was transformed into the first Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy , or Italico , under his direct rule . The flag of the Kingdom of Italy was that of the Republic in rectangular form , charged with the golden Napoleonic eagle . This remained in use until the abdication of Napoleon in 1814 . 
 = = Kingdom of Italy = = 
 Between 1848 and 1861 , a sequence of events led to the independence and unification of Italy ( except for Venetia , Rome , Trento and Trieste , known as Italia irredenta , which were united with the rest of Italy in 1866 , 1870 , and 1918 respectively ) ; this period of Italian history is known as the Risorgimento , or resurgence . During this period , the tricolore became the symbol which united all the efforts of the Italian people towards freedom and independence . 
 The Italian tricolour , defaced with the <unk> coat of arms , was first adopted as war flag by the Kingdom of Sardinia – Piedmont army on 1848 . In his Proclamation to the Lombard @-@ Venetian people , Charles Albert said " ... in order to show more clearly with exterior signs the commitment to Italian unification , We want that Our troops ... have the Savoy shield placed on the Italian tricolour flag . " As the arms , blazoned gules a cross argent , mixed with the white of the flag , it was fimbriated azure , blue being the dynastic colour , although this does not conform to the heraldic rule of tincture . The rectangular civil and state variants were adopted in 1851 . 
 In the same year , the Grand Duchy of Tuscany became constitutional and dropped the Austrian flag , with Austria – Lorraine great coat of arms , in favour of the defaced Italian tricolour with simplified arms . It is worthy of note , however , that the arms bear the red @-@ white @-@ red flag of Austria , the opponent of Italian unification . In 1859 , the <unk> officially ceased to exist , being joined to the Duchies of Modena and Parma to form the United Provinces of Central Italy , which used the <unk> tricolour until it was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia the following year . 
 The flag of the Constitutional Kingdom of the Two Sicilies , a white field charged with the coats of arms of Castile , Leon , Aragon , Two Sicilies , and Granada , was modified by Ferdinand II through the addition of a red and green border . This flag lasted from 3 April 1848 until 19 May 1849 . The Provisional Government of Sicily , which lasted from 12 January 1848 to 15 May 1849 , adopted the Italian tricolour , defaced with the <unk> , or triskelion . 
 In the same year , the Kingdom of Lombardy – Venetia revolted against the Austrian Empire in the Five Days of Milan , forming the Provisional Government of Lombardy on 22 March 1848 and Provisional Government of Venice , the so @-@ called " Republic of San Marco " , a day later . The flags that they adopted , marked the link to Italian independence and unification efforts ; the former , the Italian tricolour <unk> , and the latter , charged with the winged lion of St. Mark , from the flag of the Most Serene Republic , on a white canton . These lasted until 6 and 24 August 1849 respectively . 
 In 1849 , the new Roman Republic adopted an Italian tricolour , sent from Venice , bearing the legend DIO E <unk> in red capital letters . This lasted for four months , while the Papal States of the Church was in abeyance . 
 In 1860 , the flag of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was again modified to the defaced Italian tricolour with the House of Bourbon @-@ Two Sicilies coat of arms . Adopted on 21 June 1860 , this lasted until 17 March 1861 , when the Two Sicilies was incorporated into the Kingdom of Italy , after its defeat in the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi . 
 On 15 April 1861 , the flag of the Kingdom of Sardinia was declared the flag of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy . This Italian tricolour , with the armorial bearings of the former Royal House of Savoy was the first national flag and lasted in that form for 85 years until the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946 . 
 = = Fascist regime = = 
 In 1926 , the Fascist government attempted to have the Italian national flag redesigned by having the fasces , the symbol used by the Fascist movement , included in the flag . However , this attempt by the Fascist government to change the Italian flag to incorporate the fasces was stopped by strong opposition to the proposal by Italian monarchists . Afterwards , the Fascist government raised the national tricolour flag along with a Fascist black flag in public ceremonies . 
 = = = Italian Social Republic = = = 
 The civil and state flag of the short @-@ lived Fascist state in northern Italy , the Italian Social Republic ( 1943 – 1945 ) , or " Republic of Salò " as it was commonly known , was identical to the flag of the modern Italian Republic . This was rarely seen , while the war flag , charged with a silver / black eagle clutching horizontally placed <unk> <unk> ( literally , bundles of the lictors ) , was very common in propaganda . Italian fascism derived its name from the fasces , which symbolised imperium , or power and authority , in ancient Rome . Roman legions had carried the aquila , or eagle , as <unk> militaria . 
 On 25 April 1945 , known as festa della <unk> , the government of Benito Mussolini fell . The Italian Social Republic had existed for slightly more than one and a half years . 
 = = Italian Republic = = 
 The Italian tricolour was adopted in its current form on 1 January 1948 , with the promulgation of the republican constitution and the end of the reign of the House of Savoy . Article 12 of the Italian Constitution , approved by the Constituent Assembly on the 22 December 1947 , states : 
 The flag of the Republic is the Italian tricolour : green , white , and red , in three vertical bands of equal dimensions . 
 The universally adopted ratio is 2 : 3 , while the war flag is squared ( 1 : 1 ) . Each comune also has a <unk> bearing its coat of arms . 
 The Italian naval ensign comprises the national flag defaced with the arms of the Marina Militare ; the Marina Mercantile ( and private citizens at sea ) use the civil ensign , differenced by the absence of the mural crown and the lion holding open the gospel , bearing the inscription PAX <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , instead of a sword . The shield is quartered , symbolic of the four great thalassocracies of Italy , the <unk> <unk> of Venice ( represented by the lion passant , top left ) , Genoa ( top right ) , Amalfi ( bottom left ) , and Pisa ( represented by their respective crosses ) ; the rostrata crown was proposed by Admiral Cavagnari in 1939 to acknowledge the Navy 's origins in ancient Rome . 
 In 2003 , a state ensign was created specifically for non @-@ military vessels engaged in non @-@ commercial government service ; this defaces the Italian tricolour with the national coat of arms . Since 1914 , the Italian Air Force have also used a roundel of concentric rings in the colours of the tricolor as aircraft marking ; substituted , from 1923 to 1943 , by encircled fasces . The <unk> <unk> , officially known as the <unk> Gruppo <unk> <unk> , is its aerobatic demonstration team . 
 = = = Presidential standard = = = 
 The President of the Italian Republic has an official standard . The current version is based on the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic , on a field of blue , charged with the coat of arms in gold . Prior to this the field was solid blue . The current coat of arms , more accurately called an emblem as it was not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules , was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948 . 
 After the Republic was proclaimed , the national flag was provisionally adopted as distinguishing flag of the head of state in place of the royal standard . On the initiative of the Ministry of Defence , a project was prepared in 1965 to adopt a distinct flag . Opportunity suggested the most natural solution was the Italian tricolour defaced with the coat of arms ; however , under conditions of poor visibility , this could easily be mistaken for the standard of the President of the United States of Mexico , which is also that country 's national flag . The standard is kept in the custody of the Commander of the <unk> <unk> of the Arma dei Carabinieri , along with the war flag ( assigned to Regiment in 1878 ) 
 The Italian Constitution does not make provision for a Vice @-@ President . However , separate insignia for the President of the Senate , in exercise of duties as acting head of state under Article 86 , was created in 1986 . This has a white square on the blue field , charged with the arms of the Republic in silver . Distinguishing insignia for former Presidents of the Republic was created in 2001 ; a tricolour in the style of the Presidential standard , it is emblazoned with the Cypher of Honour of the President of the Republic . 
 In 1927 , Mussolini adopted a personal standard consisting of fasces on a Savoy blue field with a yellow border ; this was abolished in 1943 . Firstly in 2001 , and then again from 2008 , Silvio Berlusconi adopted a similar standard of the office of Prime Minister , this time the coat of arms proper on a darker blue field with double yellow border . 
 In 1997 , on its bicentenary , 7 January was declared festa del tricolore ; it is intended as a celebration , though not a public holiday . 
 = = Protocol = = 
 The law , implementing Article 12 of the Constitution and following of Italy 's membership of the European Union , lays down the general provisions governing the use and display of the flag of the Italian Republic and the flag of the European Union ( in its territory ) . 
 There are no international conventions on flying the flag , but protocol adopted by a large number of countries have such similarities as to suggest lines of commonly accepted practice . In general two areas of exposure are identified : national and international events . In both cases it is generally followed practice that national flags displayed in a group should be of equal size and each hoisted on its own flagstaff , of equal height , or on separate ropes if fixed on yardarm . The flag is flown from sunrise to sunset , except in case of bad weather ; exhibition at night is permitted provided it is adequately illuminated . The flag is raised and lowered vividly and with solemnity ; it is always treated with dignity and should never be allowed to touch the ground or water . Vertical hoist is <unk> identical to horizontal hoist ( i.e. the flag is rotated 90 degrees ) . 
 When displayed alongside other flags , the national flag takes the position of honour ; it is raised first and lowered last . Other national flags should be arranged in alphabetical order . Where two ( or more than three ) flags appear together , the national flag should be placed to the right ( left of the observer ) ; in a display of three flags in line , the national flag occupies the central position . The European flag is also flown from government buildings on a daily basis . In the presence of a foreign visitor belonging to a member state , this takes precedence over the Italian flag . As a sign of mourning , flags flown externally shall be lowered to half @-@ mast ; two black ribbons may be attached to those otherwise displayed . Traditionally , the flag may be decorated with a golden fringe surrounding the perimeter . 
 = = = Pantone matching system = = = 
 In 2003 , after 206 years of service , the authentic colours of the Italian tricolour were specified by the government , but later amended after hot debate on the chosen shades . As of 2006 , the official Pantone textile colours defined by law ( and their rendered values in other colour spaces ) are : 
 This approach has been criticised by the Centro Italiano Studi <unk> as a " fundamental error . " However , it applies only to flags produced on polyester fabric bunting . Other materials should produce the same chromatic results obtained on the sample kept in the State Ceremonial Department of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers , as well as in every Prefecture and Italian diplomatic mission abroad . 
 = = Resemblances = = 
 Given the superficial similarities between the two flags , the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time . However , the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and , more importantly , the two have different aspect ratios ; the Italian flag 's aspect ratio is 2 : 3 , while the Mexican flag 's aspect ratio of 4 : 7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape . When Italy became a republic in 1946 , the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour ; for this reason , on demand of the international naval authorities , Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished . 
 Given its possible derivation from the French tricolour , the flag of Italy is similar to many flags of putatively similar origins . The Italian tricolour is particularly similar to the flag of Ireland , which is green , white , and orange ( a tone very similar to the red used in the Italian flag ) , but with different proportions ( 1 : 2 against 2 : 3 ) and the flag of Côte d 'Ivoire , in which the colours , orange , white , and green are reversed , while the proportions are the same . Confusion may also exist between the Italian tricolour ( particularly when hoist vertically ) and the flag of Hungary , which has the same colours positioned horizontally , although with red uppermost . 
 = 1989 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1989 Atlantic hurricane season featured the costliest tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin at the time , Hurricane Hugo . The season officially began on June 1 , and ended on November 30 . It was a near average season with 11 named storms . The first storm , Tropical Depression One , developed on June 15 , and dissipated two days later without effects on land . Later that month , Tropical Storm Allison caused severe flooding , especially in Texas and Louisiana . Tropical Storm Barry , Tropical Depressions Six , Nine , and Thirteen , and Hurricanes Erin and Felix caused negligible impact . Hurricane Gabrielle and Tropical Storm Iris caused light effects on land , with the former resulting in nine fatalities from rip currents offshore the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada , while the latter produced minor flooding in the United States Virgin Islands . 
 The most notable storm of the season was Hurricane Hugo , a Category 5 hurricane that caused at least $ 10 billion ( 1989 USD ) in damage and 88 fatalities as it ravaged the Lesser Antilles and the United States , especially the state of South Carolina . Hugo ranked as the costliest Atlantic hurricane until Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , and has since fallen further due to destructive storms in the 2000s and early 2010s . Few other storms in 1989 caused significant damage ; hurricanes Chantal and Jerry both resulted in flooding and wind impacts in Texas . Hurricane Dean also caused light damage in Bermuda and the Canadian province of Newfoundland . Tropical Storm Karen , the final storm of the season , brought heavy rainfall and a tornado to Cuba , before dissipating on December 4 . Overall , the storms of the season collectively caused 124 fatalities and at least $ 10 @.@ 54 billion in damage .

The season was above average most likely because of relatively small amounts of dust within the Saharan Air Layer . Four hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season and caused 124 deaths and at least $ 10 @.@ 54 billion in damage . The last storm of the season , Tropical Storm Karen , dissipated on December 4 , four days after the official end of the season on November 30 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season began with a tropical depression developing on June 16 . Later that month , another tropical depression developed , and intensified , eventually becoming Tropical Storm Allison . After June , the month of July was slightly more active with three tropical depressions developing ; however , the latter two ( Hurricane Chantal and Hurricane Dean ) did not form until extremely late in the month . August was the most active month of the season , with a total of seven tropical cyclones either existing or developing in that period . Although September is the climatological peak of hurricane season , only two tropical cyclones developed in that month , which later become Hurricane Hugo and Tropical Storm Iris . Two tropical cyclones also developed in October , and the latter one in that month eventually became Hurricane Jerry . Finally , one tropical cyclone developed in November ; it eventually became Tropical Storm Karen and lasted until December 4 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 135 , which is classified as " above normal " . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm intensity .

 = = = Tropical Depression One = = = 
 A frontal system developed into Tropical Depression One at 1800 UTC on June 15 , while located about 160 miles ( 260 km ) northeast of Veracruz , Veracruz . The depression initially headed northeastward , before curving southward on June 16 . It peaked with winds of 30 mph ( 45 km / h ) . Early on June 17 , the depression dissipated about 85 miles ( 140 km ) northeast of Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Allison = = = 
 The second tropical depression developed on June 24 in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico , from the interaction of a tropical wave and the remnants of eastern Pacific Hurricane Cosme . Heading northward , it slowly intensified , becoming Tropical Storm Allison early on June 26 . Allison continued to slowly intensify , and made landfall near Freeport with winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) on the following day . Moving inland , Allison rapidly weakened over eastern Texas , and transitioned into an extratropical storm on June 28 . Although it rapidly became extratropical over land , the remnants of Allison meandered over the Southern United States and reached as far north as Indiana . The remnants turned south and then west @-@ northwest after reaching Mississippi , before finally dissipating over Arkansas on July 7 . 
 Allison caused significant flooding in several states , especially Louisiana and Texas . Precipitation from the storm peaked at 25 @.@ 27 inches ( 642 mm ) in <unk> , Louisiana . As a result , more than 1 @,@ 200 structures in Louisiana were flooded and over 430 @,@ 000 acres of crops were ruined , mostly soybeans and cotton . Three drowning fatalities were also reported . Several tornadoes were spawned in the state , the worst occurred in Ouachita Parish . It destroyed 5 homes , severely damaged 10 others , and inflicted minor impact on 100 houses . In Texas , flooding was more severe . More than 6 @,@ 200 homes received water damage , forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate and stranding thousands of other people . Three deaths occurred in Texas , all of which were teenage boys that drowned . In Mississippi , the storm caused $ 60 million in losses and five drowning deaths . Widespread , but mostly minor flooding was reported elsewhere in the Eastern United States . Overall , damage was estimated to have reached $ 360 – 560 million and there 11 fatalities . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Barry = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on July 7 . The wave quickly developed a low @-@ level circulation by July 9 and was designated Tropical Depression Three at 1800 UTC , while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles . The depression moved northwestward in response to an area of high pressure located north of the Azores . The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Barry on July 11 . It slowly intensified and reached its peak intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) the next day . By July 13 , Barry weakened back to a depression and dissipated shortly after while located 545 miles ( 880 km ) northeast of the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = = Hurricane Chantal = = = 
 In late July , a tropical disturbance within the intertropical convergence zone ( ITCZ ) was first observed near Trinidad and Tobago . The disturbance later reached the Gulf of Mexico and developed into a tropical depression on July 30 . While heading north @-@ northwestward , the depression intensified and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Chantal on the following day . Thereafter , Chantal quickly strengthen and became a hurricane on August 1 . After intensifying slightly further , it made landfall near High Island , Texas later that day . The storm quickly weakened upon moving inland and fell to tropical storm intensity a few hours after landfall . Early on August 2 , Chantal weakened to a tropical depression and dissipated over Oklahoma by August 4 . 
 While making landfall in Texas , the storm produced relatively small tides , with most locations reporting waves less than 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in height . However , some locations experienced extensive beach erosion . In addition , there were numerous rescues made by the U.S. Coast Guard . Due to both rainfall and high winds at least 3 @,@ 000 homes were damaged , and numerous trees and sign were knocked down . Two tornadoes were reported , with one wrecking a shed in Crystal Beach , Texas , and the other knocking over several trees and mobile homes in Iota , Louisiana . Elsewhere , Chantal and its remnants brought light to moderate rainfall to several other states , although affects were minor in other states . Overall , 13 fatalities occurred , all of which due to drowning , and at least $ 100 million in damage was reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Dean = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Five on July 31 , while situated about half way between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles . The following day , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Dean . Heading generally west @-@ northwestward , Dean intensified into a hurricane on August 2 . The storm remained a Category 1 hurricane as it curved northward , bypassing the Lesser Antilles . Tracking northward , Dean accelerated and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane while bypassing Bermuda late on August 6 . Thereafter , Dean turned northeastward and weakened to a tropical storm , before making landfall in southern Newfoundland on August 8 . The storm continued in the northeast direction and lost tropical characteristics south of Greenland on the following day . 
 As Dean approached the Lesser Antilles , heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported in Antigua and Barbuda . However , no damage was reported . In Bermuda , winds gusted up to 113 mph ( 182 km / h ) and 3 – 5 inches ( 76 @.@ 2 – 127 mm ) of precipitation fell . Although Dean caused no fatalities , 16 people were injured . According to insurance claims , the storm damaged 648 buildings , 72 boats , 36 vehicles , and one pier . Additionally , strong winds downed power lines , leaving 65 @,@ 000 people without electricity . Overall , damage on the island was approximately $ 8 @.@ 9 million , with $ 3 @.@ 9 million incurred at the Naval Air Station Bermuda <unk> surge up to 1 @.@ 7 feet ( 0 @.@ 52 m ) occurred in North Carolina , though no significant erosion was reported . In Atlantic Canada , light to moderate rainfall was reported , and tropical storm force winds were observed in some areas . Furthermore , waves at 26 ft ( 7 @.@ 92 m ) were reported on Sable Island . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Six = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six on August 8 , while located about 125 miles ( 200 km ) east of easternmost islands of Cape Verde . While approaching the Lesser Antilles , a tropical storm watch was issued . However , an upper @-@ level low increased wind shear on the system . As a result , the depression degenerated into a tropical wave on August 17 . The wave eventually split in two , with the southern part eventually becoming Hurricane Lorena in the eastern Pacific Ocean . 
 = = = Hurricane Erin = = = 
 An organized tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on August 16 . Convection diminished due to cooler sea surface temperatures , but a small , well @-@ defined low @-@ level circulation remained . The convection later redeveloped , and the system became a tropical depression early on August 18 , while located just southeast of Cape Verde . Thereafter , the interaction between the tropical depression , a tropical wave , and a subtropical system caused it to move north @-@ northwestward . The depression strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Erin at 1800 UTC on August 19 . 
 Erin continued to move north @-@ northwestward , until curving northward on August 21 . The storm intensified into a hurricane on August 22 , after being in the northeastern quadrant of an upper @-@ level low , which caused the flow aloft to become more divergent . It slowed and began to move northwestward while northeast of the upper @-@ level low . However , shortly thereafter , a wave moving westward forced Erin to move north and eventually north @-@ northeastward . Early on August 24 , the storm strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane . Later that day , Erin peaked with sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . The storm then began to weaken and degenerated into a tropical storm on August 27 . Shortly thereafter , Erin transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over the far northern Atlantic . 
 = = = Hurricane Felix = = = 
 A tropical wave was observed over northwestern Africa on August 24 . By the following day , the system moved into the Atlantic Ocean near Dakar , Senegal . It immediately began organized and became Tropical Depression Eight at 0000 UTC on August 26 . The depression initially headed west @-@ northwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day . Shortly thereafter , the storm grazed Cape Verde , with some islands reporting sustained winds near 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Between August 27 and August 29 , Felix drifted north @-@ northwestward in response to a persistent upper @-@ level trough . Southwesterly winds sheared away much of the deep convection , causing Felix to weaken back to a tropical depression on August 29 . 
 The storm then headed northwestward , until a weak frontal trough turned Felix northward on September 1 . Wind shear decreased , allowing Felix to become a tropical storm again on September 3 . The storm continued to strengthen while moving west @-@ northwestward and by early on September 5 , it became a hurricane . Later that day , Felix peaked with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Drifting north @-@ northeastward , the storm eventually began to accelerate , after weakening back to a tropical storm on September 7 , due to colder sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear . At 1200 UTC on September 9 , Felix became extratropical while located well east of Cape Race , Newfoundland . The remnants later curved east @-@ southeastward and then dissipated on September 10 . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Nine = = = 
 Tropical Depression Nine developed from a tropical wave 490 mi ( 790 km ) east of Barbados on August 27 . However , on the following day , a reconnaissance aircraft did not indicate a low @-@ level circulation . Thus , the depression degenerated back into a tropical wave . Tropical Depression Nine did not re @-@ develop in the Atlantic or the Caribbean Sea , although the remnants entered the Pacific and regenerated into Hurricane Octave on September 8 . 
 = = = Hurricane Gabrielle = = = 
 The tenth tropical depression of the season developed from a tropical wave on August 30 . The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle on the following day . Gabrielle moved generally westward , but curved slightly west @-@ northwestward after intensifying into a hurricane on September 1 . Further intensification continued , and Gabrielle eventually peaked as a moderately strong Category 4 hurricane on September 5 . After peaking with sustained winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) , Gabrielle slowly curved nearly due north . Gabrielle significantly weakened while heading northward , with sustained winds dropping from a low @-@ end Category 4 hurricane to a strong Category 2 hurricane within 12 hours on September 7 . While weakening as it headed northward , Gabrielle bypassed the island of Bermuda early on September 8 . 
 Gabrielle further weakened to a Category 1 hurricane late on September 8 , and became nearly stationary roughly almost halfway between Bermuda and Cape Race , Newfoundland . Gabrielle then weakened to a tropical storm and headed due westward on September 10 . Thereafter , the storm made a sharp turn to the northeast on September 11 and weakened to a tropical depression on the following day . By September 13 , the depression merged with a storm developing off Newfoundland . Although it never approached land , Gabrielle was an extremely large and powerful storm that generated swells up to 20 ft ( 6 m ) all the way from the Lesser Antilles to Canada . On Dominica , severe erosion occurred on the east and north coasts . Large waves responsible for eight deaths on the East Coast of the United States ; almost all of the fatalities occurred in New England . In Nova Scotia , waves reached a height of 30 ft ( 9 m ) . In addition , one fatality was reported in Canada , when a man drowned near Ketch Harbor , Nova Scotia . 
 = = = Hurricane Hugo = = = 
 A westward moving tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Eleven on September 10 , while located southeast of Cape Verde . It headed generally westward and intensified into Tropical Storm Hugo on September 11 . Hugo became a hurricane by September 13 . After becoming a major hurricane early on September 15 , rapid intensification commenced , and less than 24 hours later , Hugo peaked as a Category 5 hurricane as winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 918 mbar ( 27 @.@ 1 inHg ) . Six hours later , Hugo weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane . After weakening on September 17 , Hugo entered the Caribbean Sea after passing between Guadeloupe and Montserrat with winds near 140 mph ( 230 km / h ) and later made landfall on St. Croix at the same intensity . Hugo was further downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane , before landfall on eastern Puerto Rico . The storm weakened to a Category 2 hurricane on September 18 , after re @-@ emerging into the Atlantic . As Hugo accelerated to the northwest , re @-@ intensification occurred , and it eventually reached a secondary peak intensity as a low @-@ end Category 4 hurricane . Early on September 22 , Hugo made landfall near Charleston , South Carolina with winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . After landfall , Hugo rapidly weakened as it turned to the northeast , and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone in northwestern Pennsylvania on September 23 . The remnants continued rapidly northeastward , and dissipated on September 25 near Greenland . 
 The storm caused significant damage in Guadeloupe due to winds of 140 mph ( 230 km / h ) . Eleven fatalities and 107 injuries were reported , while 10 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , leaving 35 @,@ 000 people homeless . Crop losses were extreme , with the storm wiping out 100 % of the banana crop , 50 % of the sugar cane crop , and nearly all coconut crops . Ten people were killed on Montserrat , while 89 others were injured . Damage on the island topped $ 260 million . In Antigua , one person was killed and 30 % of the homes damaged . Dominica suffered the loss of 80 % of its banana crop , and landslides cut off many towns for days . Two people were killed , 80 were injured , and 90 % of the buildings were damaged or destroyed on Saint Croix . About 3 @,@ 500 people were left homeless . Damage estimates for Saint Croix exceeded $ 1 billion . Damage from erosion and crop losses in St. Kitts reached $ 43 million and one fatality was reported . In Puerto Rico , the storm downed thousands of trees in the El Yunque National Forest and caused near complete destruction of coffee and damage crops . Extreme damage also occurred at Ceiba , Culebra , Fajardo , and Luquillo . Additionally , 28 @,@ 000 people were left homeless , 12 deaths were reported , and losses exceeded $ 1 billion . In South Carolina alone , the Red Cross estimates that 3 @,@ 307 single family homes were destroyed , 18 @,@ 171 were inflicted major damage , and 56 @,@ 580 sustained minor impact . Additionally , more than 12 @,@ 600 mobile homes and 18 @,@ 000 multi @-@ family houses were either damaged or destroyed . There were 35 deaths and about $ 5 @.@ 9 billion in damage in the state . The most significant impact elsewhere in the United States occurred in North Carolina , where 205 structure were destroyed , 1 @,@ 149 suffered major damage , and 2 @,@ 638 were inflicted minor impacts . There was one fatality and damaged reached $ 1 billion . Overall , Hugo caused at least 88 fatalities and $ 10 billion in losses , making it the costliest hurricane in the Atlantic basin , at the time . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Iris = = = 
 A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean on September 12 . After undergoing tropical cyclogenesis , a tropical depression developed around 18 : 00 UTC on September 16 , while located about halfway between the Windward Islands and the Cape Verde islands . It slowly strengthened and intensified into Tropical Storm Iris early on September 18 . Thereafter , the storm turned north @-@ northwestward and paralleled the Leeward Islands . Initially , there was uncertainty in its path due to potential for a Fujiwhara interaction with Hugo . 
 While passing east of the Lesser Antilles , Iris produced 7 @.@ 53 in ( 191 mm ) of rainfall on Saint John in the U.S. Virgin Islands , resulting in flooding . There were few reports of winds or precipitation on other islands , as Hugo destroyed observation stations a few days prior . On September 19 , Iris attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . Thereafter , the storm weakened due to increased wind shear from Hugo . On September 21 , the winds decreased below tropical storm force , after the center became exposed from the convection . The next day , Iris dissipated while approaching the Bahamas , though a remnant circulation persisted and tracked toward southern Florida . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Thirteen = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 2 , while located a few hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles . Although the depression was predicted to intensify to near hurricane status by October 5 , a mid @-@ latitude trough increased wind shear , inducing weakening . Later on October 3 , the National Hurricane Center began to forecast weakening of the depression . The depression continued weakening and dissipated on October 5 . 
 = = = Hurricane Jerry = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 23 . Only minimal development occurred as the wave crossed the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea . However , after crossing the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche on October 12 , it developed into a tropical depression . The system quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Jerry on the following day . Jerry tracked generally northward while intensifying and reached hurricane status on October 15 . After intensifying slightly more , Jerry made landfall near Jamaica Beach , Texas with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Jerry rapidly weakened after moving inland , and dissipated by October 16 . The remnants moved through the Tennessee Valley ahead of a frontal zone and eventually offshore the coast of the Mid @-@ Atlantic states . 
 Storm surge and rough surf along the coast of Texas destroyed a 20 mile ( 32 km ) section of Texas State Highway 87 , which was never repaired . Due to strong winds , about 52 @,@ 000 homes and businesses were left without electricity , most of them in the Galveston area . Many homes , businesses , and buildings were inflicted damage because of strong winds and three tornadoes spawned by the storm . Despite the issuance of a hurricane warning just eight hours prior to landfall , Jerry caused only three fatalities in Texas , possibly due to the storm 's small size ; a car fell over the Galveston Seawall , killing its three occupants . Minor wind and coastal flood damage was reported in Louisiana . Jerry and its remnants brought flash flooding to portions of the Upland South , particularly in the states of Kentucky , Virginia , and West Virginia . In eastern Kentucky , hundreds of homes were flooded and many bridges , culverts , and roads were washed out ; this left hundreds of residents stranded . Damage in Kentucky reached at least $ 5 million . Similar impact occurred in Virginia , with $ 3 @.@ 4 million in damage in Buchanan County . In West Virginia , overflowing rivers in the western portions of the state forced hundreds to evacuate . Throughout the United States , Jerry resulted in about $ 70 million in damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Karen = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on November 13 and failed to organize until reaching the western Caribbean Sea . Favorable conditions allowed convection to concentrate around a developing low @-@ level circulation . On November 28 , satellite imagery and reconnaissance aircraft indicated the development of a tropical depression just north of Honduras . The depression moved northwestward then northeastward , intensifying into Tropical Storm Karen on November 30 , while located southwest of Isla de la Juventud , Cuba . Within 12 hours of reaching tropical storm intensity , Karen peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Around that time , a building ridge in the Gulf of Mexico forced the storm southeastward . 
 While Karen was threatening landmasses in the northwestern Caribbean Sea , tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Cozumel on the Yucatán Peninsula , Isle de la Juventud , and western Cuba . The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Cuba , reaching over 15 in ( 380 mm ) on Isle de la Juventud . Wind gusts reached 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) , and there were reports of a tornado , but no damage or fatalities were reported . After affecting Cuba , Karen turned to the southwest while steadily weakening . It briefly threatened Belize , prompting a tropical storm watch , but the storm turned to the southeast and dissipated on December 4 ; its remnants later moved over Nicaragua . Karen was the last tropical cyclone to exist in December until Hurricane Nicole in 1998 .

 = Partition Sejm = 
 The Partition Sejm ( Polish : Sejm <unk> ) was a Sejm lasting from 1773 to 1775 in the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth , convened by its three neighbours ( the Russian Empire , Prussia and Austria ) in order to legalize their First Partition of Poland . During its first days in session , that Sejm was the site of Tadeusz Rejtan 's famous gesture of protest against Partition . The Sejm also passed other legislation , notably establishing the Permanent Council and the Commission of National Education . Cardinal Laws were confirmed . 
 The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire , giving it another excuse to interfere in the Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed . Russia was the party most determined to form the Permanent Council , which it saw as further means to control the Commonwealth . 
 The creation of the Commission of National Education , the Commonwealth 's and Europe 's first ministry of education , is seen as the proudest and most constructive achievement of the otherwise often @-@ deplored Partition Sejm . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the late 17th and early 18th centuries the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth was reduced from the status of a major European power to that of a Russian protectorate ( or vassal or satellite state ) . Russian tsars effectively chose Polish @-@ Lithuanian monarchs utilizing the " free elections " and decided the outcome of much of Poland 's internal politics . The Repnin Sejm , for example , was named after the Russian ambassador who unofficially presided over the proceedings . 
 The Partition Sejm and the First Partition occurred after the balance of power in Europe shifted , with Russian victories against the Ottomans in the Russo @-@ Turkish War ( 1768 – 1774 ) strengthening Russia and endangering Habsburg interests in that region ( particularly in Moldavia and Wallachia ) . At that point Habsburg Austria considered waging a war against Russia . 
 France , friendly towards both Russia and Austria , suggested a series of territorial adjustments , in which Austria would be compensated by parts of Prussian Silesia , and Prussia in turn would receive Polish Ermland ( Warmia ) and parts of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia , a Polish fief already under Baltic German hegemony . King Frederick II of Prussia had no intention of giving up Silesia , gained recently in the Silesian Wars . He was , however , also interested in finding a peaceful solution – his alliance with Russia would draw him into a potential war with Austria , and the Seven Years ' War had left Prussia 's treasury and army weakened . He was also interested in protecting the weakening Ottoman Empire , which could be advantageously utilized in the event of a Prussian war either with Russia or Austria . Frederick 's brother , Prince Henry , spent the winter of 1770 – 71 as a representative of the Prussian court at Saint Petersburg . As Austria had annexed 13 towns in the Hungarian Szepes region in 1769 ( violating the Treaty of Lubowla ) , Catherine II of Russia and her advisor General Ivan Chernyshyov suggested to Henry that Prussia claim some Polish land , such as Ermland . After Henry informed Frederick of the proposal , the Prussian monarch suggested a partition of the Polish borderlands by Austria , Prussia , and Russia , with the largest share going to the party most weakened by the recent changes in balance of power , Austria . Thus Frederick attempted to encourage Russia to direct its expansion towards weak and dysfunctional Poland instead of the Ottomans . Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz counter @-@ proposed that Prussia take lands from Poland in return for relinquishing Silesia to Austria , but this plan was rejected by Frederick . 
 Although for a few decades ( since the times of the Silent Sejm ) Russia had seen a weak Poland as its own protectorate , Poland had also been devastated by a civil war in which the forces of the Bar Confederation attempted to disrupt Russian control over Poland . The recent <unk> peasant and Cossack uprising in Ukraine also weakened Poland 's position . Further , the Russian @-@ supported Polish king , Stanisław August Poniatowski , was seen as both weak and too independent @-@ minded ; eventually the Russian court decided that the usefulness of Poland as a protectorate had diminished . The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order in Poland through military intervention ( the Bar Confederation provided a convenient excuse ) ; in fact all three were interested in territorial gains . 
 After Russia occupied the Danubian Principalities , Henry convinced Frederick and Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria that the balance of power would be maintained by a tripartite division of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth instead of Russia taking land from the Ottomans . Under pressure from Prussia , which for a long time wanted to annex the northern Polish province of Royal Prussia , the three powers agreed on the First Partition of Poland . This was proposed under the threat of the possible Austrian @-@ Ottoman alliance . Only token objections were however raised by Austria , which would have instead preferred to receive more Ottoman territories in the Balkans , a region which for a long time had been coveted by the Habsburgs . The Russians also withdrew from Moldavia away from the Austrian border . An attempt of Bar Confederates to kidnap King Poniatowski on 3 November 1771 gave the three courts a pretext to showcase the " Polish anarchy " and the need for its neighbors to step in and " save " the country and its citizens . 
 Already by 1769 – 71 , both Austria and Prussia had annexed some border territories belonging to the Commonwealth . On 19 February 1772 , the agreement of partition was signed in Vienna . A previous agreement between Prussia and Russia had been made in Saint Petersburg on 6 February 1772 . Early in August Russian , Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously entered the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves . On 5 August , the three parties signed the treaty on their respective territorial gains at the Commonwealth 's expense . The partition treaty was ratified by its signatories on 22 September 1772 . 
 After having occupied their respective territories , the three partitioning powers demanded that King Poniatowski and the Sejm approve their action . The King appealed to the nations of Western Europe for help and tarried with the convocation of the Sejm . The European powers reacted to the partition with indifference ; only a few voices – like that of Edmund Burke – were raised in protest . 
 While the Polish king and the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action , the patience of foreign powers was running out . Eventually , one of the most prominent opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands , bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński , was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw , where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm ( the entire Polish parliament ) to ratify the partition . In another sign of their influence , the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation ( those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty , the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk ) . When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly , no alternative was available save passive submission to their will . Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the foreign powers , with their forces commanded by the Austrian ( or Russian , sources vary ) general Abram <unk> ( Abraham ) . On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Preparations for the Sejm were not easy . Bishops Krasiński and <unk> Sołtyk argued vocally against it . At least 32 sejmiks ( regional parliaments ) that were to elect deputies to it were disrupted . Eventually less than half of the regular number of representatives – only about 102 – 111 ( sources vary ) deputies , the lowest number in the history of the Commonwealth – arrived in Warsaw , where they were joined by about 36 senators and ministers . Most of the deputies from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania did not attend this Sejm . 
 Russia was represented by Otto von Stackelberg , Prussia by Gedeon Benoit and Austria by Karl <unk> . 
 = = Partition Treaty = = 
 The Sejm began on 19 April ( although some preliminary discussions took place days before ) . It took place in Warsaw and the deputies and senators in service of foreign powers declared it a confederated sejm ( with decisions decided by the majority ) to prevent liberum veto ( the right of any deputy to force an immediate end to the current session and nullify any legislation that had already been passed ) being used to stop it . The marshals of the Sejm were Adam Poniński , one of the nobles in Russian service , for the Crown of Poland , and Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . At least half of the deputies were bribed by the foreign powers , and others were threatened . Some deputies ( Tadeusz Rejtan , Samuel Korsak Stanisław Bohuszewicz , Franciszek <unk> , Stanisław <unk> , Rupert Dunin , Jan <unk> , J. Zaremba , Michał <unk> , Ignacy Suchecki , Tadeusz Wołodkowicz ) tried to protest , which caused delays . Out of those , Rejtan 's gesture – in which he was said to have barred the doors , torn his shirt , and asked other deputies to murder him rather than Poland – became widely known , and was immortalized in a painting by Jan Matejko . By 24 April the few vocal opponents , such as Rejtan , had lost , the confederation was joined by the King and the Sejm elected a committee of thirty to deal with the various matters presented ( primarily the partitioners ' demands , but also some reforms to the government ) . The committee was to deliberate until September , and the rest of the Sejm was adjourned in the meantime . 
 Despite some protests , on 18 September 1773 , the Committee formally signed the treaty of cession , renouncing all claims of the Commonwealth to the occupied territories . The Sejm on 30 September 1773 accepted the partition treaty . By the first partition the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth lost about 211 @,@ 000 km ² ( 30 % of its territory , amounting at that time to about 733 @,@ 000 km ² ) , with a population of over four to five million people ( about a third of its population of 14 million before the partitions ) . The treaty was a major success for Frederick II of Prussia : Prussia 's share might have been the smallest , but it was also significantly developed and strategically important . Russia received the largest , but economically least @-@ important area , in the northeast . 
 Notable supporters of the partition , in addition to Poniński , included Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł and the bishops Andrzej <unk> , Ignacy Jakub Massalski , and Primate of Poland Antoni Kazimierz Ostrowski , who occupied high positions in the Senate of Poland . 
 The senators who protested were threatened by the Russians ( represented by Ambassador Otto von Stackelberg ) , who declared that in the face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed . Other threats included executions , confiscation of estates , and increase of territory subjected to partition . Some senators were arrested and exiled to Siberia .

 The partitioning powers ( in particular , Russia ) demanded that the Sejm pass further reforms , with the intent of strengthening their power over the Commonwealth . The original commission was allowed to work till January 1774 , extending the Sejm , which was adjourned again . The commission was unable to carry out its changes in that period , and thus it was allowed to extend its deliberations once more ; there were ultimately seven such extensions . 
 The Cardinal Laws , a quasi @-@ constitution endorsing most of the conservative laws responsible for the inefficient functioning of the Commonwealth , were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers . The Sejm also continued enacting laws reducing religious tolerance in the Commonwealth . The passive electoral rights of the Orthodox and Protestants were diminished , with a restriction limiting the number of non @-@ Roman Catholic Sejm deputies to three ( one from Greater Poland , one from Lesser Poland , and one from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania ) . They were also banned from election to the Senate or ministerial positions . 
 Royal power was restricted , as the king lost the power to give titles and positions of military officers , ministers and senators , and the starostwo territories for Crown lands , most of which would be awarded through an auction . In return , the king received four <unk> for personal possession . The royal ( free ) election was confirmed , with stipulations that future kings had to come from the Polish nobility , and sons and grandsons of any king could not succeed him to the throne till two others had held it in the interim . 
 A trade treaty was signed between the Commonwealth and Prussia , unfavorable to the Commonwealth . The Partition cut off the Commonwealth 's access to the Baltic Sea , and the state had no choice but to accept the high tariffs imposed by Prussia . 
 The Sejm also created two notable institutions : the Permanent Council , a main governmental body in continuous operation , and the Commission of National Education . The Council was intended by the partitioners to be an institution easier to control than the unruly Sejms , and indeed it remained under the influence of the Russian Empire . It was nonetheless a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance . The Council , with committees ( ministries ) on Foreign Affairs , Treasury , Defense , Justice and the Interior ( Police ) , was able to interpret existing laws in the sphere of administration , and provided the Commonwealth with a continuous governing body that operated between the Sejms and was not affected by the liberum veto . The Permanent Council was led by the king , had 36 members elected , half from each chamber of the Sejm , and ruled by majority vote ( the king decided in case of a tie ) . The previously powerful ministers were placed under the control of the new council and supervised by the five parallel departments of the Council . The Council , in addition to its administrative duties , would present to the king three candidates for each nomination to the Senate and other main offices . 
 The Commission of National Education , another type of a newly created ministry ( a central state institution of a collegial structure ) , was one of the three Great Commissions ( the other two were for the Treasury and the Army ) . It took over many of the possessions of the recently disbanded Jesuit order , and became the first ministry of education in Europe . As such , its creation is universally seen as the proudest and most constructive achievement of the otherwise deplored Partition Sejm . The fiscal policy was also reformed , with one tax being introduced and tariffs being reintroduced . Military was reformed , with hetmans being held more accountable to the Sejm . The size of the army was ordered to be increased to 30 @,@ 000 ( this goal would not be met ) . Szlachta ( a Polish noble class ) were officially allowed to deal in trade and crafts ( previously , engaging in " urban " professions risked losing one 's noble status ) . The severity of serfdom was discussed , but no significant reforms were passed in that field . 
 The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire , giving it another pretext to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation was changed . 
 Corruption was rampant . Deputies awarded themselves various <unk> and other privileges . Various fraudulent deals were made that channeled funds intended for government institutions , such as the Commission of National Education , to the pockets of the deputies and their allies . 
 The commission ended its deliberations on 27 March 1775 . The Sejm resumed , accepting the various new acts , and was finally ended on 11 April 1775 . 
 = Romeo Void = 
 Romeo Void was an American new wave / post punk band from San Francisco , California , formed in 1979 . The band primarily consisted of saxophonist Benjamin Bossi , vocalist Debora Iyall , guitarist Peter Woods , and bassist Frank Zincavage . The band went through four drummers , starting with Jay Derrah and ending with Aaron Smith . The band released three albums , It 's a Condition , Benefactor and Instincts , along with one EP . They are best known for the songs " Never Say Never " and " A Girl in Trouble ( Is a Temporary Thing ) " ; the latter became a Top 40 pop single . 
 The band was started at the San Francisco Art Institute by Iyall and Zincavage . They released a single on the recently formed 415 Records before recording their debut album , which has been deemed a " masterpiece of American post @-@ punk " . The success of their second release , a 4 @-@ song EP , Never Say Never resulted in a distribution deal with Columbia Records . The band continued to release music and tour until they broke up in 1985 . The members have reunited briefly over the years . Iyall has continued to pursue music as a side project . Iyall garnered acclaim as a skilled lyricist who explored themes like sexuality and alienation from a female perspective with " searing imagery " . 
 = = 1979 : Formation = = 
 Romeo Void formed at the San Francisco Art Institute in February 1979 . Vocalist Debora Iyall occasionally visited the Bay Area to see Patti Smith perform . She decided to pursue an art education after reading a fortune cookie . " It was in the late ' 70s at the Indochina Friendship Booth at the annual Fourth of July <unk> in Eureka , California , " she said . " I got a fortune cookie that said ' Art is your fate , don 't debate . ' That next January , I was enrolled in an art school in San Francisco . " She began frequenting the Mabuhay Gardens , a popular nightclub , to see local alternative rock groups like The Nuns , the Mutants , Crime , and the Avengers . She also formed the Mummers and Poppers , a punk parody band that covered 1960s tunes with guitarist Peter Woods , an English Major at SF State and drummer Jay Derrah , . Iyall was originally hesitant to perform because she was overweight : " After seeing Patti Smith , I still had it in my mind that you had to be skinny to be up there [ on stage ] , but after going to the Mabuhay [ ... ] you just do whatever you want , be whoever you want , just make it happen . " 
 Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute ; the two hit it off and discussed putting a band together . They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later , drawing inspiration from the " burgeoning local punk and post @-@ punk scenes " . Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing with him in the <unk> and Poppers . " [ It ] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [ ... He ] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar . " Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine 's Day in 1979 . According to Iyall , the name Romeo Void referred to " a lack of romance " and came to mind after they saw a local magazine with the headline " Why single women can 't get laid in San Francisco . " The band practiced in Iyall 's flat in Mission District . It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement . " Even though I was going to the [ Mabuhay Gardens ] so much , I also had criticisms : Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black , " Iyall said . " I guess we were considered new wave , but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached blond and everything being about despair and no future , when I thought the do @-@ it @-@ yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions , and all the different colors . [ ... ] I was proud of being American Indian , so I purposely never bleached my hair blond . " 
 = = 1980 – 1982 : It 's a Condition , Benefactor , and mainstream success = = 
 The band became busy playing shows at clubs and warehouses around San Francisco , and quickly became popular . Saxophonist Benjamin Bossi was added to the lineup as an " accident " when Iyall met him while he worked in a deli . The group released their first single , " White Sweater " , which consisted of the title track and a cover of Danish musician Jørgen <unk> 's popular instrumental composition " Apache " , in February 1981 on a recently founded local label called 415 Records . They worked on the recording of their debut album , It 's a Condition , with producer David Kahne . Before recording began , Derrah left the band and was replaced by John " <unk> " Hanes , who had previously played with Pearl Harbor and the Explosions . Romeo Void 's debut was critically acclaimed upon its release through 415 in July 1981 , and introduced Romeo Void 's " unique blend of jazz , funk , rock and confrontational poetry " . Allmusic writer Stewart Mason later heralded it as one of the " masterpieces of American post @-@ punk " . Indie labels were enthusiastic with promotions and the band embarked on several nationwide tours . Eventually Haines left the band , leaving Larry Carter to fill the drummer position . 
 The sudden surge in popularity was disorienting to Iyall . " It was frightening : we played a college in Santa Barbara , and there were all these blond people crowding the stage , and I thought ' These are the people who hated me in high school ! ' When you grow up being ' outside ' – because I wasn 't white , and I was fat , and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange . It was like , ' uh @-@ oh , I must be doing something wrong – they like me ! ' " Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band . Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston . The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982 . The title track became ( arguably ) their best @-@ known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since . The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless , which was the debut film of Jennifer Grey starring Aidan Quinn and Daryl Hannah . Additionally , the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records , which elevated the indie label 's roster to major @-@ label status . Romeo Void released their second album , entitled Benefactor , in November 1982 . The album appeared at No. 119 on the Billboard 200 . Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors ; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song " Never Say Never " . The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie , which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia . Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor : " I do like to be provocative , and I definitely have access to my sexuality , and as a topic I find it ripe , but I wasn 't ever going to be a sex @-@ pot diva , so that was kind of odd . " She also said there was pressure to produce more singles . 
 = = 1983 – present : Instincts , break @-@ up , and post @-@ band endeavors = = 
 A third and final album was again helmed by David Kahne , which Allmusic writer Stewart Mason speculated was a " reaction against the more commercial sound of Benefactor . By this time , Carter had been replaced by veteran session drummer Aaron Smith . Instincts was released in October 1984 , debuted at No. 68 on the Billboard 200 , and proved to be the band 's best @-@ selling album . It also launched their most successful single , " A Girl in Trouble ( Is a Temporary Thing ) , " which broke the Billboard Top 40 and peaked at No. 35 . Critical reactions were positive . Despite being the band 's most successful effort to date , Columbia pulled the band 's promotional support while on a nationwide tour . " The very next town we got to after they made that decision , there wasn 't an A & R person there , " said Iyall . " [ There ] was no local person there , there were no interviews and in @-@ stores arranged as they had been . All that just ground to a halt . " The band returned to San Francisco and soon broke up . Constant touring has been cited by Iyall as the primary reason for the break @-@ up . " You get tired of each other , and you get intolerant of being uncomfortable and away from your family and your friends . " According to a VH1 reunion episode , the issue of Iyall 's weight was the reason for the label dropping them . In 2003 , Iyall agreed with this claim : " Howie sold us from 415 to Columbia Records , and they were like ' Who 's this fat chick ? ' They decided that was as far as it was going to get , and pulled their support . " Crawdaddy ! writer Denise Sullivan stated that the label spoke to Iyall about losing weight , but she subsequently refused . In 2010 , Iyall declined to discuss the issue , but added that she may not be taking full responsibility in the matter . 
 Iyall released a solo album entitled Strange Language with former band members Bossi and Smith in 1986 . Afterward she pursued a career as an art teacher . The band reunited briefly for a live performance in 1993 . In 2004 , Romeo Void was featured on an episode of VH1 's Bands Reunited . Bossi had sustained too much hearing damage over the years and was unable to perform , although he did meet up with the band again and observed the reunion performance in an adjacent room . Iyall has continued to dabble in music related projects and events . " I still like to sing and I still like to perform , " she said . In 2003 she was involved in a musical project called Knife in Water . She began collaborating with Peter Dunne , who was known as Peter <unk> when he played guitar for Pearl Harbor and the Explosions . Iyall and Dunne performed at a support benefit for Crawdaddy ! founder Paul Williams in June 2009 , and performed at a concert honoring 415 Records later that September . They released an album entitled Stay Strong in 2010 . 
 = = Music = = 
 Romeo Void has generally been classified as a new wave or post @-@ punk band . Some critics have noted dance elements in the music . According to Stewart Mason , writing for Allmusic , " [ The ] band 's muscular blend of Joy Division 's atmospherics and the Gang of Four 's rattling momentum , with Benjamin Bossi 's splattering free jazz saxophone coloring everything , made Romeo Void one of the strongest of the American post @-@ punk bands . The St. Petersburg Times wrote that they " had no trouble creating a signature sound for [ themselves with a ] scratchy guitar , soulful sax , [ and ] tight , precise drums . " The New York Times stated that they sounded like " an art @-@ school band , with its textural complexity [ and ] touches of jazz and funk " Saxophone player Benjamin Bossi has been observed as the ingredient that " set the band apart " and showed a " talent for both improvisation and arrangement . " Alan <unk> , writing for The Globe and Mail , said that he weaved " in and out [ ... ] like a snake charmer " and reminded him of Andy Mackay , a saxophonist that played with Roxy Music . 
 Liam Lacey , also writing for The Globe and Mail , described Iyall 's voice as " sultry [ and ] sexy " , while Mason called it " powerful " . Her style has sometimes been compared to Chrissie Hynde , vocalist for the Pretenders . Richard Harrington of The Washington Post acknowledged the similarity , but also noted the influence of other singers in " Never Say Never " where Iyall mixed the " aggressive bitchiness of [ Hynde ] , the coy confrontational tactics of Patty Donahue of the Waitresses and the slack sensuality of Debbie Harry of the earliest Blondie . " Iyall used to find the comparison annoying , but eventually warmed to it : " When people said I sounded like her , I 'd say , ' Oh yeah , thanks a lot . ' But this year , I 've fallen in love with Learning To Crawl so now I don 't care if people want to make comparisons . " After a live show in 1982 , <unk> contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the " vocal range of an automobile horn " . Billboard writer Kathy Gillis wrote after a concert two years later that Iyall exhibited a " dramatic range that , while not extreme in either direction , was touching . " 
 Patti Smith had a great influence on Iyall . " [ She was ] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet , " she said . " She combined things I was interested in . Plus , she wasn 't a trumped @-@ up sex symbol . She was herself on stage . That appealed to me . It looked like something I could do . You didn 't have to look like all the other singers . " Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums . " I hate rock and roll right now . It 's turned into some new kind of stupid religion ... I 'd rather listen to Billie Holiday , maybe Tom Waits . Actually , I 'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound . But I 'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music . I love language – plain speech , used in an enigmatic , subliminal way ; I 'm not much tied to the literal . " 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Iyall was observed by Mother Jones to be among a new group of female fronted rock bands that displayed a " tough , wry , street @-@ wise , [ and ] cynical " attitude and sought to redefine the role of women in rock music . She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like " frustrated desire [ and ] sexually motivated rage " from a female perspective . Critics praised her lyrics for their " searing imagery " , " seething poetics " , and " [ dark intelligence ] " " My approach was always that I had something to say , I had a point of view , " Iyall said , commenting on her <unk> . " I remember seeing Penelope from the Avengers at the Mabuhay Gardens and thinking , I can do that . I have something to say . " 
 Romeo Void 's best known song is " Never Say Never " , which contains the famous line " I might like you better if we slept together . " Allmusic writer Heather Phares has argued that Iyall 's " teasing , existential musings [ ... ] predated and predicted the aloof yet frank sexuality of early- and mid- ' 90s artists such as Elastica and Liz Phair " . Phares concluded that the song was " a subversive , influential classic " and " one of new wave 's most distinctive and innovative moments . " The song has been covered by many artists , among them are Queens of the Stone Age and Amanda Blank . The song " A Girl in Trouble ( Is a Temporary Thing ) " , their highest @-@ charting single , was reportedly written as a response to Michael Jackson 's hit song " Billie Jean " , but can also be seen as a tribute to women who have experienced traumatizing events . Iyall also wrote songs that touched on themes like social alienation ( " Undercover Kept " ) and generation gaps ( " Chinatown " ) .

 = Slavonia = 
 Slavonia ( / <unk> / ; Croatian : <unk> ) is , alongside Dalmatia , Croatia proper , and Istria , one of the four historical regions of Croatia . Taking up the east of the country , it roughly corresponds with five Croatian counties : Brod @-@ Posavina , Osijek @-@ Baranja , Požega @-@ Slavonia , Virovitica @-@ Podravina and Vukovar @-@ Srijem , although the territory of the counties includes Baranya , and the definition of the western extent of Slavonia as a region varies . The counties cover 12 @,@ 556 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 848 square miles ) or 22 @.@ 2 % of Croatia , inhabited by 806 @,@ 192 — 18 @.@ 8 % of Croatia 's population . The largest city in the region is Osijek , followed by Slavonski Brod and Vinkovci . It is located in the Pannonian Basin , largely bordered by the Danube , Drava and Sava rivers . In the west , the region consists of the Sava and Drava valleys , and the mountains surrounding the Požega Valley , and plains in the east . Slavonia enjoys a moderate continental climate , with relatively low precipitation . 
 After the fall of Rome , which ruled the area of modern @-@ day Slavonia until the 5th century , Ostrogoths and Lombards controlled the area before the arrival of Avars and Croats , when the Principality of Pannonian Croatia was established in the 7th century . It was later incorporated into the Kingdom of Croatia and , after its decline , the kingdom was ruled through a personal union with Hungary . 
 The Ottoman conquest of Slavonia took place in 1536 to 1552 . In 1699 , after the Great Turkish War , Slavonia was transferred to the Habsburgs . Reform of the empire through the Compromise of 1867 assigned it to the Hungarian part of the realm , and a year later to the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia . In 1918 , when Austria @-@ Hungary dissolved , Slavonia was a part of the short @-@ lived State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs which in turn became a part of the kingdom later renamed Yugoslavia . During the Croatian War of Independence , Slavonia saw fierce fighting , including the Battle of Vukovar . 
 The economy of Slavonia is largely based on processing industry , trade , transport and civil engineering . Agriculture is a significant component of its economy : Slavonia contains 45 % of Croatia 's agricultural land and accounts for a significant proportion of Croatia 's livestock farming and production of permanent crops . The gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the five counties of Slavonia is worth 6 @,@ 454 million euro or 8 @,@ 005 euro per capita , 27 @.@ 5 % below national average . The GDP of the five counties represents 13 @.@ 6 % of Croatia 's GDP . 
 The cultural heritage of Slavonia is a blend of historical influences , especially those since the end of the 17th century , when Slavonia started recovering from the Ottoman wars , and its traditional culture . Slavonia contributed to the culture of Croatia , through art , writers , poets and art patronage . In traditional music , Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia , and the traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals , with prominence given to tamburica music and <unk> , a form of traditional song , recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO . The cuisine of Slavonia reflects diverse influences — a blend of traditional and foreign elements . Slavonia is one of Croatia 's winemaking areas , with Ilok and Kutjevo recognized as centres of wine production . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Slavonia originated in the Early Middle Ages . The area was named after the Slavs who settled there and called themselves * <unk> . The root * <unk> appeared in various dialects of languages spoken by people inhabiting the area west of the Sutla river , as well as between the Sava and Drava rivers — South Slavs living in the area of the former Illyricum . The area bounded by those rivers was called * <unk> in the Proto @-@ Slavic language . The word subsequently evolved to its various present forms in the Slavic languages , and other languages adopted the term . 
 = = = Prehistory and antiquity = = = 
 Remnants of several Neolithic and Chalcolithic cultures were found in all regions of Croatia , but most of the sites are found in the river valleys of northern Croatia , including Slavonia . The most significant cultures whose presence was found include the Starčevo culture whose finds were discovered near Slavonski Brod and dated to 6100 – 5200 BC , Vučedol and Baden cultures . Most finds attributed to the Baden and Vučedol cultures are discovered in the area around Vukovar , extending to Osijek and Vinkovci . The Baden culture sites in Slavonia are dated to 3600 – 3300 BC , and Vučedol culture finds are dated to 3000 – 2500 BC . The Iron Age left traces of the early Illyrian Hallstatt culture and the Celtic La Tène culture . Much later , the region was settled by Illyrians and other tribes , including the Pannonians , who controlled much of present @-@ day Slavonia . Even though archaeological finds of Illyrian settlements are much sparser than in areas closer to the Adriatic Sea , significant discoveries , for instance in <unk> near Požega have been made . The Pannonians first came into contact with the Roman Republic in 35 BC , when the Romans conquered <unk> , or modern @-@ day Sisak . The conquest was completed in 11 BC , when the Roman province of Illyricum was established , encompassing modern @-@ day Slavonia as well as a vast territory on the right bank of Danube . The province was renamed Pannonia and divided within two decades . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire , which included the territory occupied by modern @-@ day Slavonia , the area became a part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom by the end of the 5th century . However , control of the area proved a significant task , and Lombards were given increasing control of Pannonia in the 6th century , which ended in their withdrawal in 568 and the arrival of Pannonian Avars and Slavs , who established control of Pannonia by year 582 . According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII , the Croats had arrived in the early 7th century in what is now Croatia , although this is disputed and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries . Eventually two dukedoms were formed — Duchy of Pannonia and Duchy of Dalmatia , ruled by Ljudevit Posavski and Borna , as attested to by the chronicles of Einhard , starting in the year 818 . This record represents the first document of the Croatian realms , vassal states of Francia at the time . The Frankish overlordship ended during the reign of Mislav two decades later . 
 Tomislav was the first ruler of Croatia to be styled a king . That occurred in a letter from Pope John X , dating the kingdom of Croatia to 925 . Tomislav defeated Hungarian and Bulgarian invasions , spreading the influence of Croatian kings northward to Slavonia . The medieval Croatian kingdom reached its peak in the 11th century during the reigns of Petar Krešimir IV ( 1058 – 1074 ) and Dmitar Zvonimir ( 1075 – 1089 ) . When Stjepan II died in 1091 , ending the Trpimirović dynasty , Ladislaus I of Hungary claimed the Croatian crown . Opposition to the claim led to a war and personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102 , ruled by Coloman . For the next four centuries , Slavonia was ruled as a part of the Kingdom of Croatia by the Sabor ( parliament ) , and a ban ( viceroy ) appointed by the king . The period saw increasing territorial losses to Ottoman conquest . The Ottoman conquests led to the 1493 Battle of Krbava field and 1526 Battle of Mohács , both ending in decisive Ottoman victories . King Louis II of Hungary died at Mohács , and Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg was elected in 1527 as the new ruler of Croatia , under the condition that he provide protection to Croatia against the Ottoman Empire , while respecting its political rights . The period saw the rise to prominence of a native nobility such as the Frankopans and the <unk> , and ultimately to numerous bans from the two families . The present coat of arms of Slavonia , used in an official capacity as a part of the coat of arms of Croatia , dates from this period — it was granted to Slavonia by king Vladislaus II Jagiellon on 8 December 1496 . 
 = = = Ottoman conquest = = = 
 Following the Battle of Mohács , the Ottomans expanded their possessions in Slavonia seizing Đakovo in 1536 and Požega in 1537 , defeating a Habsburg army led by Johann <unk> , who was attempting to retake Slavonia , at Gorjani in September 1537 . By 1540 , Osijek was also under firm control of the Ottomans , and regular administration in Slavonia was introduced by establishing the Sanjak of <unk> . The Ottoman control in Slavonia expanded as Novska surrendered the same year . Turkish conquest continued — Našice were seized in 1541 , Orahovica and Slatina in 1542 , and in 1543 , Voćin , <unk> and , after a 40 @-@ day siege , Valpovo . In 1544 , Ottoman forces conquered Pakrac . <unk> hostilities brought about a five @-@ year truce in 1547 and temporary stabilization of the border between Habsburg and Ottoman empires , with Virovitica becoming the most significant defensive Habsburg fortress and Požega the most significant Ottoman centre in Slavonia , as Ottoman advances to Sisak and Čazma were made , including a brief occupation of the cities . Further westward efforts of the Turkish forces presented a significant threat to Zagreb and the rest of Croatia and the Hungarian kingdom , prompting a greater defensive commitment by the Habsburg Empire . One year after the 1547 truce ended , Ivan Lenković devised a system of fortifications and troops in the border areas , a forerunner of the Croatian Military Frontier . Nonetheless , in 1552 , the Ottoman conquest of Slavonia was completed when Virovitica was captured . Ottoman advances in the Croatian territory continued until the 1593 Battle of Sisak , the first decisive Ottoman defeat , and a more lasting stabilisation of the frontier . During the Great Turkish War ( 1683 – 1698 ) , Slavonia was regained in 1687 when the Ottomans abandoned the region — unlike western Bosnia , which had been part of Croatia before the Ottoman conquest . The present @-@ day southern border of Slavonia and the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina is a remnant of this outcome . 
 The Ottoman wars instigated great demographic changes . Croats migrated towards Austria and the present @-@ day Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers . To replace the fleeing Croats , the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier . Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737 – 39 . 
 = = = Habsburg Monarchy and Austria @-@ Hungary = = = 
 The areas acquired through the Treaty of Karlowitz were assigned to Croatia , itself in the union with Hungary and the union ruled by the Habsburgs . The border area along the Una , Sava and Danube rivers became the Slavonian Military Frontier . At this time , Osijek took over the role of the administrative and military centre of the newly formed Kingdom of Slavonia from Požega . The 1830s and 1840s saw romantic nationalism inspire the Croatian National Revival , a political and cultural campaign advocating unity of all South Slavs in the empire . Its primary focus was the establishment of a standard language as a counterweight to Hungarian , along with the promotion of Croatian literature and culture . During the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Croatia sided with the Austrians , Ban Josip Jelačić helping to defeat the Hungarian forces in 1849 , and ushering in a period of Germanization policy . By the 1860s , failure of the policy became apparent , leading to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and creation of a personal union between the crowns of the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary . The treaty left the issue of Croatia 's status to Hungary as a part of <unk> — and the status was resolved by the Croatian – Hungarian Settlement of 1868 , when the kingdoms of Croatia and Slavonia were united as the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia . After Austria @-@ Hungary occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina following the 1878 Treaty of Berlin , the Military Frontiers were abolished and the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontier territory returned to Croatia @-@ Slavonia in 1881 , pursuant to provisions of the Croatian @-@ Hungarian Settlement . At that time , the easternmost point of Croatia @-@ Slavonia became Zemun , as all of Syrmia was encompassed by the kingdom .

 On 29 October 1918 , the Croatian Sabor declared independence and decided to join the newly formed State of Slovenes , Croats and Serbs , which in turn entered into union with the Kingdom of Serbia on 4 December 1918 to form the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes . The Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920 , at the end of World War I , between the Allies of World War I and Hungary as one of the successor states to Austria @-@ Hungary . The treaty established the southern border of Hungary along the Drava and Mura rivers , except in Baranya , where only the northern part of the county was kept by Hungary . The territorial acquisition in Baranya was not made a part of Slavonia , even though adjacent to Osijek , because pre @-@ 1918 administrative divisions were disestablished by the new kingdom . The political situation in the new kingdom deteriorated , leading to the dictatorship of King Alexander in January 1929 . The dictatorship formally ended in 1931 when the king imposed a more unitarian constitution transferring executive power to the king , and changed the name of the country to Yugoslavia . The Cvetković – Maček Agreement of August 1939 created the autonomous Banovina of Croatia incorporating Slavonia . Pursuant to the agreement , the Yugoslav government retained control of defence , internal security , foreign affairs , trade , and transport while other matters were left to the Croatian Sabor and a crown @-@ appointed ' Ban ' . 
 In April 1941 , Yugoslavia was occupied by Germany and Italy . Following the invasion the territory of Slavonia was incorporated into the Independent State of Croatia , a Nazi @-@ backed puppet state and assigned as a zone under German occupation for the duration of the World War II . The regime introduced anti @-@ semitic laws and conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Serb and Roma populations , exemplified by the Jasenovac and Stara Gradiška concentration camps . Armed resistance soon developed in the region , and by 1942 , it controlled substantial territories , especially in mountainous parts of Slavonia . Yugoslav Partisans led by Josip Broz Tito took full control of Slavonia in April 1945 . 
 = = = Federal Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia = = = 
 After World War II , Croatia — including Slavonia — became a single @-@ party Socialist federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , ruled by the Communists , but enjoying a degree of autonomy within the federation . The autonomy effectively increased after the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution , basically fulfilling a goal of the Croatian Spring movement , and providing a legal basis for independence of the federative constituents . In 1947 , when all borders of the former Yugoslav constituent republics had been defined by demarcation commissions , pursuant to decisions of the AVNOJ of 1943 and 1945 , the federal organization of Yugoslav Baranya was defined as Croatian territory allowing its integration with Slavonia . The commissions also set up the present @-@ day 317 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 197 @.@ 3 mi ) border between Serbia and Croatia in Syrmia , and along the Danube River between Ilok and mouth of the Drava and further north to the Hungarian border , the section south of confluence of the Drava matching the border between the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia and the Bács @-@ Bodrog County that existed until 1918 and the end of World War I. 
 In the 1980s the political situation in Yugoslavia deteriorated with national tension fanned by the 1986 Serbian SANU Memorandum and the 1989 coups in Vojvodina , Kosovo and Montenegro . In January 1990 , the Communist Party fragmented along national lines , with the Croatian faction demanding a looser federation . In the same year , the first multi @-@ party elections were held in Croatia , with Franjo Tuđman 's win raising nationalist tensions further . The Serbs in Croatia , intent on achieving independence from Croatia , left the Sabor and declared the autonomy of areas that would soon become the unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . As tensions rose , Croatia declared independence in June 1991 ; however the declaration came into effect on 8 October 1991 . Tensions escalated into the Croatian War of Independence when the Yugoslav National Army and various Serb paramilitaries attacked Croatia . By the end of 1991 , a high intensity war fought along a wide front reduced Croatia to controlling about two @-@ thirds of its territory . 
 In Slavonia , the first armed conflicts were clashes in Pakrac , and Borovo Selo near Vukovar . Western Slavonia was occupied in August 1991 , following an advance by the Yugoslav forces north from Banja Luka across the Sava River . This was partially pushed back by the Croatian Army in operations named Otkos 10 , and Orkan 91 , which established a front line around Okučani and south of Pakrac that would hold virtually unchanged for more than three years until Operation Flash in May 1995 . Armed conflict in the eastern Slavonia , culminating in the Battle of Vukovar and a subsequent massacre , also included heavy fighting and the successful defence of Osijek and Vinkovci . The front line stabilized and a ceasefire was agreed to on 2 January 1992 , coming into force the next day . After the ceasefire , United Nations Protection Force was deployed to the occupied areas , but intermittent artillery and rocket attacks , launched from Serb @-@ held areas of Bosnia , continued in several areas of Slavonia , especially in Slavonski Brod and Županja . The war effectively ended in 1995 with Croatia achieving a decisive victory over the RSK in August 1995 . The remaining occupied areas — eastern Slavonia — were restored to Croatia pursuant to the Erdut Agreement of November 1995 , with the process concluded in January 1998 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 = = = Political geography = = = 
 The Croatian counties were re @-@ established in 1992 , but their borders changed in some instances , with the latest revision taking place in 2006 . Slavonia consists of five counties — Brod @-@ Posavina , Osijek @-@ Baranja , Požega @-@ Slavonia , Virovitica @-@ Podravina and Vukovar @-@ Srijem counties — which largely cover the territory historically associated with Slavonia . The western borders of the five @-@ county territory lie in the area where the western boundary of Slavonia generally has been located since the Ottoman conquest , with the remaining borders being at the international borders of Croatia . This places the Croatian part of Baranya into the Slavonian counties , constituting the Eastern Croatia macroregion . Terms Eastern Croatia and Slavonia are increasingly used as synonyms . The Brod @-@ Posavina County comprises two cities — Slavonski Brod and Nova Gradiška — and 26 Municipalities of Croatia . The Osijek @-@ Baranja County consists of seven cities — Beli Manastir , Belišće , Donji <unk> , Đakovo , Našice , Osijek and Valpovo — and 35 municipalities . The Požega @-@ Slavonia County comprises five cities — Kutjevo , Lipik , Pakrac , <unk> and Požega — and five municipalities . The Virovitica @-@ Podravina County covers three cities — Orahovica , Slatina and Virovitica — and 13 municipalities . The Vukovar @-@ Srijem County encompasses five cities — Ilok , Otok , Vinkovci , Vukovar and Županja — and 26 municipalities . The whole of Slavonia is the eastern half of Central and Eastern ( Pannonian ) Croatia NUTS @-@ 2 statistical unit of Croatia , together with further areas of Central Croatia . Other statistical units correspond to the counties , cities and municipalities . The five counties combined cover area size of 12 @,@ 556 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 848 square miles ) , representing 22 @.@ 2 % of territory of Croatia . 
 = = = Physical geography = = = 
 The boundaries of Slavonia , as a geographical region , do not necessarily coincide with the borders of the five counties , except in the south and east where the Sava and Danube rivers define them . The international borders of Croatia are boundaries common to both definitions of the region . In the north , the boundaries largely coincide because the Drava River is considered to be the northern border of Slavonia as a geographic region , but this excludes Baranya from the geographic region 's definition even though this territory is part of a county otherwise associated with Slavonia . The western boundary of the geographic region is not specifically defined and it was variously defined through history depending on the political divisions of Croatia . The eastern Croatia , as a geographic term , largely overlaps most definitions of Slavonia . It is defined as the territory of the Brod @-@ Posavina , Osijek @-@ Baranja , Požega @-@ Slavonia , Virovitica @-@ Podravina and Vukovar @-@ Syrmia counties , including Baranya .

 Slavonia is entirely located in the Pannonian Basin , one of three major geomorphological parts of Croatia . The Pannonian Basin took shape through Miocenian thinning and subsidence of crust structures formed during Late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny . The Paleozoic and Mesozoic structures are visible in Papuk and other Slavonian mountains . The processes also led to the formation of a stratovolcanic chain in the basin 17 – 12 Mya ( million years ago ) and intensified subsidence observed until 5 Mya as well as flood basalts about 7 @.@ 5 Mya . Contemporary uplift of the Carpathian Mountains prevented water flowing to the Black Sea , and the Pannonian Sea formed in the basin . Sediments were transported to the basin from uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains , with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in the Pleistocene during the uplift of the Transdanubian Mountains . Ultimately , up to 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 feet ) of the sediment was deposited in the basin , and the Pannonian sea eventually drained through the Iron Gate gorge . In the southern Pannonian Basin , the Neogene to Quaternary sediment depth is normally lower , averaging 500 to 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 to 4 @,@ 900 feet ) , except in central parts of depressions formed by subduction — around 4 @,@ 000 metres ( 13 @,@ 000 feet ) in the Slavonia @-@ Syrmia depression , 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 feet ) in the Sava depression and nearly 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 23 @,@ 000 feet ) in the Drava depression , with the deepest sediment found between Virovitica and Slatina . 
 The results of those processes are large plains in eastern Slavonia , Baranya and Syrmia , as well as in river valleys , especially along the Sava , Drava and Kupa . The plains are interspersed by the horst and graben structures , believed to have broken the Pannonian Sea surface as islands . The tallest among such landforms in Slavonia are 984 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 228 ft ) Psunj , and 953 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 127 ft ) Papuk — flanking the Požega Valley from the west and the north . These two and Krndija , adjacent to Papuk , consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks which are 350 – 300 million years old . Požeška Gora and Dilj , to the east of Psunj and enveloping the valley from the south , consist of much more recent Neogene rocks , but Požeška Gora also contains Upper Cretaceous sediments and igneous rocks forming the main , 30 @-@ kilometre ( 19 mi ) ridge of the hill and representing the largest igneous landform in Croatia . A smaller igneous landform is also present on Papuk , near Voćin . The two mountains , as well as Moslavačka gora , west of Pakrac , are possible remnants of a volcanic arc related to Alpine orogeny — uplifting of the Dinaric Alps . The Đakovo – Vukovar loess plain , extending eastward from Dilj and representing the watershed between the Vuka and Bosut rivers , gradually rises to the Fruška Gora south of Ilok .

 The largest rivers in Slavonia are found along or near its borders — the Danube , Sava and Drava . The length of the Danube , flowing along the eastern border of Slavonia and through the cities of Vukovar and Ilok , is 188 kilometres ( 117 miles ) , and its main tributaries are the Drava 112 @-@ kilometre ( 70 mi ) and the Vuka . The Drava discharges into the Danube near Aljmaš , east of Osijek , while mouth of the Vuka is located in Vukovar . Major tributaries of the Sava , flowing along the southern border of Slavonia and through cities of Slavonski Brod and Županja are 89 @-@ kilometre ( 55 mi ) the <unk> flowing through Požega , and the Bosut — whose 151 @-@ kilometre ( 94 mi ) course in Slavonia takes it through Vinkovci . There are no large lakes in Slavonia . The largest ones are Lake Kopačevo whose surface area varies between 1 @.@ 5 and 3 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 58 and 1 @.@ 35 square miles ) , and <unk> Reservoir covering 2 @.@ 5 square kilometres ( 0 @.@ 97 square miles ) . The Lake Kopačevo is connected to the Danube via <unk> canal , situated within the <unk> Rit wetland , while the Lake <unk> is an artificial lake created in 1978 in the upper course of the Vuka River . 
 The entire Slavonia belongs to the Danube basin and the Black Sea catchment area , but it is divided in two sub @-@ basins . One of those drains into the Sava — itself a Danube tributary — and the other into the Drava or directly into the Danube . The drainage divide between the two sub @-@ basins runs along Papuk and Krndija mountains , in effect tracing the southern boundary of the Virovitica @-@ Podravina County and the northern boundary of Požega @-@ Slavonia County , cuts through the Osijek @-@ Podravina County north of Đakovo and finally bisects the Vukovar @-@ Syrmia County running between Vukovar and Vinkovci to reach Fruška Gora southwest of Ilok . The Entire Brod @-@ Posavina County is located in the Sava sub @-@ basin . 
 Most of Croatia , including Slavonia , has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification . Mean annual temperature averages 10 to 12 ° C ( 50 to 54 ° F ) , with the warmest month , July , averaging just below 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) . Temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas — the lowest temperature of − 27 @.@ 8 ° C ( − 18 @.@ 0 ° F ) was recorded on 24 January 1963 in Slavonski Brod , and the highest temperature of 40 @.@ 5 ° C ( 104 @.@ 9 ° F ) was recorded on 5 July 1950 in Đakovo . The least precipitation is recorded in the eastern parts of Slavonia at less than 700 millimetres ( 28 inches ) per year , however in the latter case , it mostly occurs during the growing season . The western parts of Slavonia receive 900 to 1 @,@ 000 millimetres ( 35 to 39 inches ) precipitation . Low winter temperatures and the distribution of precipitation throughout the year normally result in snow cover , and freezing rivers — requiring use of icebreakers , and in extreme cases explosives , to maintain the flow of water and navigation . Slavonia receives more than 2 @,@ 000 hours of sunshine per year on average . Prevailing winds are light to moderate , northeasterly and southwesterly . 
 = = = Demographics = = = 
 According to the 2011 census , the total population of the five counties of Slavonia was 806 @,@ 192 , accounting for 19 % of population of Croatia . The largest portion of the total population lives in Osijek @-@ Baranja county , followed by Vukovar @-@ Syrmia county . Požega @-@ Slavonia county is the least populous county of Slavonia . Overall the population density stands at 64 @.@ 2 persons per square kilometre . The population density ranges from 77 @.@ 6 to 40 @.@ 9 persons per square kilometre , with the highest density recorded in Brod @-@ Posavina county and the lowest in Virovitica @-@ Podravina county . Osijek is the largest city in Slavonia , followed by Slavonski Brod , Vinkovci and Vukovar . Other cities in Slavonia have populations below 20 @,@ 000 . According to the 2001 census , Croats account for 85 @.@ 6 percent of population of Slavonia , and the most significant ethnic minorities are Serbs and Hungarians , comprising 8 @.@ 8 percent and 1 @.@ 4 percent of the population respectively . The largest portion of the Serb minority was recorded in Vukovar @-@ Syrmia county ( 15 percent ) , while the largest Hungarian minority , in both relative and absolute terms , was observed in Osijek @-@ Baranja county . The census recorded 85 @.@ 4 % of the population declaring themselves as Catholic , with further 4 @.@ 4 % belonging to Serbian Orthodox Church and 0 @.@ 7 % Muslims . 3 @.@ 1 % declared themselves as non @-@ religious , agnostics or declined to declare their religion . The most widely used language in the region is Croatian , declared as the first language by 93 @.@ 6 % of the total population , followed by Serbian ( 2 @.@ 6 % ) and Hungarian language ( 1 @.@ 0 % ) . 
 The demographic history of Slavonia is characterised by significant migrations , as is that of Croatia as a whole , starting with the arrival of the Croats , between the 6th and 9th centuries . Following the establishment of the personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102 , and the joining of the Habsburg Empire in 1527 , the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number . The processes of Magyarization and Germanization varied in intensity but persisted until the beginning of the 20th century . The Ottoman conquests initiated a westward migration of parts of the Croatian population ; the Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of some of those settlers . To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier . Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737 – 39 . Following the collapse of Austria @-@ Hungary in 1918 , the Hungarian population declined , due to emigration and ethnic bias . The changes were especially significant in the areas north of the Drava river , and Baranja County where they represented the majority before World War I. 
 Since the end of the 19th century there was substantial economic emigration abroad from Croatia in general . After World War I , the Yugoslav regime confiscated up to 50 percent of properties and encouraged settlement of the land by Serb volunteers and war veterans in Slavonia , only to have them evicted and replaced by up to 70 @,@ 000 new settlers by the regime during the World War II . During World War II and in the period immediately following the war , there were further significant demographic changes , as the German @-@ speaking population , the Volksdeutsche , were either forced or otherwise compelled to leave — reducing their number from the prewar German population of Yugoslavia of 500 @,@ 000 , living in Slavonia and other parts of present @-@ day Croatia and Serbia , to the figure of 62 @,@ 000 recorded in the 1953 census . The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by colonisation of settlements where the displaced Germans used to live , by people from the mountainous parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina , Serbia and Montenegro , and migrations to larger cities spurred on by the development of industry . In the 1960s and 1970s , another wave of economic migrants left — largely moving to Canada , Australia , New Zealand and Western Europe . 
 The most recent changes to the ethnic composition of Slavonian counties occurred between censuses conducted in 1991 and 2001 . The 1991 census recorded a heterogenous population consisting mostly of Croats and Serbs — at 72 percent and 17 percent of the total population respectively . The Croatian War of Independence , and the ethnic fracturing of Yugoslavia that preceded it , caused an exodus of the Croat population followed by an exodus of Serbs . The return of refugees since the end of hostilities is not complete — a majority of Croat refugees returned , while fewer Serbs did . In addition , ethnic Croats moved to Slavonia from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Serbia . 
 = = Economy and transport = = 
 The economy of Slavonia is largely based on wholesale and retail trade and processing industry . Food processing is one of the most significant types of the processing industries in the region , supporting agricultural production in the area and encompassing meat packing , fruit and vegetable processing , sugar refining , confectionery and dairy industry . In addition , there are wineries in the region that are significant to economy of Croatia . Other types of the processing industry significant to Slavonia are wood processing , including production of furniture , cellulose , paper and cardboard ; metalworking , textile industry and glass production . Transport and civil engineering are two further significant economic activities in Slavonia . The largest industrial centre of Slavonia is Osijek , followed by other county seats — Slavonski Brod , Virovitica , Požega and Vukovar , as well as several other cities , especially Vinkovci . 
 The gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the five counties in Slavonia combined ( in year 2008 ) amounted to 6 @,@ 454 million euro , or 8 @,@ 005 euro per capita — 27 @.@ 5 % below Croatia 's national average . The GDP of the five counties represented 13 @.@ 6 % of Croatia 's GDP . Several Pan @-@ European transport corridors run through Slavonia : corridor Vc as the A5 motorway , corridor X as the A3 motorway and a double @-@ track railway spanning Slavonia from west to east , and corridor VII — the Danube River waterway . The waterway is accessed through the Port of Vukovar , the largest Croatian river port , situated on the Danube itself , and the Port of Osijek on the Drava River , 14 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 0 miles ) away from confluence of the rivers . 
 Another major sector of the economy of Slavonia is agriculture , which also provides part of the raw materials for the processing industry . Out of 1 @,@ 077 @,@ 403 hectares ( 2 @,@ 662 @,@ 320 acres ) of utilized agricultural land in Croatia , 493 @,@ 878 hectares ( 1 @,@ 220 @,@ 400 acres ) , or more than 45 % , are found in Slavonia , with the largest portion of the land situated in the Osijek @-@ Baranja and Vukovar @-@ Syrmia counties . The largest areas are used for production of cereals and oilseeds , covering 574 @,@ 916 hectares ( 1 @,@ 420 @,@ 650 acres ) and 89 @,@ 348 hectares ( 220 @,@ 780 acres ) respectively . Slavonia 's share in Croatia 's agriculturally productive land is greatest in the production of cereals ( 53 @.@ 5 % ) , legumes ( 46 @.@ 8 % ) , oilseeds ( 88 @.@ 8 % ) , sugar beet ( 90 % ) , tobacco ( 97 @.@ 9 % ) , plants used in pharmaceutical or perfume industry ( 80 @.@ 9 % ) , flowers , seedlings and seeds ( 80 @.@ 3 % ) and plants used in the textile industry ( 69 % ) . Slavonia also contributes 25 @.@ 7 % of cattle , 42 @.@ 7 % of pigs and 20 % of the poultry stock of Croatia . There are 5 @,@ 138 hectares ( 12 @,@ 700 acres ) of vineyards in Slavonia , representing 18 @.@ 6 % of total vineyards area in Croatia . Production of fruit and nuts also takes up a significant agricultural area . Apple orchards cover 1 @,@ 261 hectares ( 3 @,@ 120 acres ) , representing 42 @.@ 3 % of Croatia 's apple plantations , plums are produced in orchards encompassing 450 hectares ( 1 @,@ 100 acres ) or 59 @.@ 7 % of Croatia 's plum plantations and hazelnut orchards cover 319 hectares ( 790 acres ) , which account for 72 @.@ 4 % of hazelnut plantations in Croatia . Other significant permanent crops are cherries , pears , peaches and walnuts . 
 In 2010 , only two companies headquartered in Slavonia ranked among top 100 Croatian companies — <unk> , agricultural industry owned by <unk> , and Belišće , paper mill and paper packaging material factory , headquartered in Darda and Belišće respectively , both in Osijek @-@ Baranja County . <unk> ranks as the 44th and Belišće as the 99th largest Croatian company by income .

 = = Culture = = 
 The cultural heritage of Slavonia represents a blend of social influences through its history , especially since the end of the 17th century , and the traditional culture . A particular impact was made by Baroque art and architecture of the 18th century , when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area . The period saw great prominence of the nobility , who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court in return for their service during the wars . They included Prince Eugene of Savoy , the House of Esterházy , the House of Odescalchi , Philipp Karl von Eltz @-@ <unk> , the House of Prandau @-@ Normann , the House of Pejačević and the House of Janković . That in turn encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region . Subsequent development of the cities and society saw the influence of Neoclassicism , Historicism and especially of Art Nouveau . 
 The heritage of the region includes numerous landmarks , especially manor houses built by the nobility in largely in the 18th and the 19th centuries . Those include Prandau @-@ Normann and Prandau @-@ <unk> manor houses in Valpovo and Donji <unk> respectively , manor houses in Baranja — in <unk> , at a former Esterházy estate in Darda , in Tikveš , and in <unk> . <unk> built several residences , the most representative ones among them being manor house in Virovitica and the Pejačević manor house in Našice . Further east , along the Danube , there are Odescalchi manor house in Ilok , and Eltz manor house in Vukovar — the latter sustained extensive damage during the Battle of Vukovar in 1991 , but it was reconstructed by 2011 . In the southeast of the region , the most prominent are Kutjevo Jesuit manor house , and <unk> manor house , located in Kutjevo and <unk> respectively . The period also saw construction of Tvrđa and Brod fortifications in Osijek and Slavonski Brod . Older , medieval fortifications are preserved only as ruins — the largest among those being <unk> Castle near Orahovica . Another landmark dating to the 19th century is the Đakovo Cathedral — hailed by the Pope John XXIII as the most beautiful church situated between Venice and Istanbul . 
 Slavonia significantly contributed to the culture of Croatia as a whole , both through works of artists and through patrons of the arts — most notable among them being Josip Juraj Strossmayer . Strossmayer was instrumental in the establishment of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts , later renamed the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts , and the reestablishment of the University of Zagreb . A number of Slavonia 's artists , especially writers , made considerable contributions to Croatian culture . Nineteenth @-@ century writers who are most significant in Croatian literature include Josip Eugen Tomić , Josip Kozarac , and Miroslav Kraljević — author of the first Croatian novel . Significant twentieth @-@ century poets and writers in Slavonia were <unk> <unk> , Dragutin <unk> , Ivana <unk> @-@ Mažuranić and Antun Gustav <unk> . Painters associated with Slavonia , who contributed greatly to Croatian art , were Miroslav Kraljević and Bela Čikoš <unk> . 
 Slavonia is a distinct region of Croatia in terms of ethnological factors in traditional music . It is a region where traditional culture is preserved through folklore festivals . Typical traditional music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family . The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia 's traditional culture . It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia , becoming an integral part of the traditional music , its use surpassing or even replacing the use of bagpipes and gusle . A distinct form of traditional song , originating in Slavonia , the <unk> , is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO . 
 Out of 122 Croatia 's universities and other institutions of higher education , Slavonia is home to one university — Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek — as well as three polytechnics in Požega , Slavonski Brod and Vukovar , as well as a college in Virovitica — all set up and run by the government . The University of Osijek , has been established in 1975 , but the first institution of higher education in the city was Studium <unk> <unk> founded in 1707 , and active until 1780 . Another historical institution of higher education was Academia <unk> operating in Požega between 1761 and 1776 , as an extension of a gymnasium operating in the city continuously , since it opened in 1699 as the first secondary education school in Slavonia . 
 = = = Cuisine and wines = = = 
 The cuisine of Slavonia reflects cultural influences on the region through the diversity of its culinary influences . The most significant among those were from Hungarian , Viennese , Central European , as well as Turkish and Arab cuisines brought by series of conquests and accompanying social influences . The ingredients of traditional dishes are pickled vegetables , dairy products and smoked meats . The most famous traditional preserved meat product is <unk> , one of a handful Croatian products protected by the EU as indigenous products . 
 Slavonia is one of Croatia 's winemaking sub @-@ regions , a part of its continental winegrowing region . The best known winegrowing areas of Slavonia are centered on Đakovo , Ilok and Kutjevo , where <unk> grapes are predominant , but other cultivars are increasingly present . In past decades , an increasing quantity of wine production in Slavonia was accompanied by increasing quality and growing recognition at home and abroad . Grape vines were first grown in the region of Ilok , as early as the 3rd century AD . The oldest Slavonian wine cellar still in continuous use for winemaking is located in Kutjevo — built in 1232 by Cistercians . 
 = Magnus II of Norway = 
 Magnus Haraldsson ( Old Norse : Magnús Haraldsson ; c . 1048 – 28 April 1069 ) was King of Norway from 1066 to 1069 , jointly with his brother Olaf Kyrre from 1067 . He was not included in official Norwegian regnal lists until modern times , but has since been counted as Magnus II . 
 A son of King Harald Hardrada , Magnus was in 1058 appointed nominal leader of an expedition into the Irish Sea while still only a child . He appears to have assisted Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn and Ælfgar , Earl of Mercia in their struggles against the English , although his primary objective may have been to assert control over Orkney . He later accompanied his father in Harald 's campaign against Denmark in 1062 , and was appointed regent and made king before Harald 's fatal invasion of England in 1066 . Magnus briefly ruled Norway alone thereafter , until his younger brother Olaf returned from England in 1067 . 
 Magnus co @-@ ruled with Olaf following his brother 's return to Norway , but less than three years into his reign , Magnus became ill and died . His kingship has been downplayed in later history in part due to this . Magnus had only one child , Haakon <unk> who was king briefly after Olaf , but who also died young , and without issue . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 Magnus was born in 1048 or 1049 . He was the first of two sons of King Harald Hardrada , by his consort Tora Torbergsdatter . There are no known skaldic poems written about Magnus , and he appears only briefly in the Norse sagas . The author of Ágrip af Nóregskonungasögum describes him in passing as " a most handsome man . " While not mentioned anywhere in the sagas , Magnus appears in contemporary British sources around the year 1058 as the leader of a Norwegian expedition in the Irish Sea . 
 = = = Expedition to the West = = = 
 In 1058 , Magnus headed an expedition into the Irish Sea that sought to extend Norwegian authority in the region , the Norwegians siding with a faction that opposed the Norse @-@ Gaelic king Echmarcach mac Ragnaill . The expedition also appears to have supported a branch of the Norse @-@ Gaelic dynasty of Ivar that opposed Irish king Diarmait mac Maíl na mBó . Magnus commanded a fleet that , in addition to Norway , recruited men from Orkney , the Hebrides , and Dublin . His forces were later active in Wales and perhaps in England , and English chronicler John of Worcester associates the Norwegian fleet ( along with the Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn ) , with returning the exiled Ælfgar , Earl of Mercia to power . The Irish Annals of Tigernach goes further in claiming that Magnus 's goal was to seize power in England , but this is not supported by Welsh and English sources which also includes the Annales Cambriae and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . 
 Magnus 's campaign may have been part of his father 's plans for an invasion of England , as control over the Kingdom of the Isles would have provided him with more troops . Historian Kelly DeVries has moreover proposed that Harald may have wanted to test the situation in England before a possible invasion , only to find that he could not be at war with Denmark and England at the same time . The expedition of Magnus never made significant landfall in England , but for English king Edward the Confessor it probably signalled renewed Norwegian ambitions from Harald Hardrada , who considered himself Edward 's rightful heir . At the same time , the rise in power of Godwin , Earl of Wessex and his sons , in particular Harold Godwinson , had also started representing a threat to Harald 's claim . 
 On the other hand , historian Alex Woolf has suggested that the expedition originally may only have been intended for Orkney , and that in search for plunder it was followed by an expedition into the Irish Sea that by mere luck presented Magnus with the opportunity of raiding with Earl Ælfgar . The exact year that Thorfinn Sigurdsson , Earl of Orkney died is not recorded anywhere , other than that it is stated in the Orkneyinga saga that it was in the later days of Harald Hardrada . Thus , it may be that his death provoked Magnus 's expedition , and that the expedition was the occasion on which Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson , Thorfinn 's successors as earls , submitted to Harald . Woolf has also proposed that Magnus may have played some part in the war in Scotland in 1057 – 1058 , perhaps supporting Máel Coluim mac Donnchada against Lulach . 
 = = Kingship and death = = 
 Magnus accompanied his father in Harald 's campaign against Denmark in 1062 . On his way to Denmark , Harald 's fleet clashed with the fleet of Danish king Sweyn Estridsson in a major naval battle at Niså that resulted in Norwegian victory . In 1066 , after concluding peace with Sweyn Estridsson , Harald set out on his campaign of conquering England from Harold Godwinson . Before departing , he appointed Magnus as regent and king of Norway in his absence , and had his younger son Olaf accompany him on the expedition . After initial success in the Battle of Fulford , Harald was defeated and killed by Harold Godwinson in the Battle of Stamford Bridge . Olaf survived and returned to Norway with the remaining troops in early 1067 , and was proclaimed king and co @-@ ruler with his brother Magnus . 
 Although it was intended for Magnus and Olaf to rule the kingdom jointly without division , in practice Olaf ruled over Viken ( the south @-@ eastern part of Norway ) , while Magnus controlled the Uplands and Trøndelag ( the middle parts of Norway ) along with Western Norway and Northern Norway . Despite of this division , there are no signs of hostility between the brothers , and their relationship appears to have been peaceful . 
 Having reigned for less than three years , Magnus became ill and died in Nidaros ( Trondheim ) on 28 April 1069 . The sagas posit that Magnus died of ringworm , but modern scholars have proposed that he instead may have died of ergotism ( poisoning by the Claviceps purpurea fungus ) . Snorri Sturluson writes briefly in the Saga of Harald <unk> that Magnus was " an amiable king and <unk> by the people . " 
 Magnus 's kingship has been downplayed in later history partly due to his short tenure , and because most of it was together with his brother . The subsequently long reign of Olaf also contributed to overshadow Magnus 's reign , combined with the fact that the later Norwegian royal dynasties only descended ( or claimed descent ) from Olaf . 
 The king known today as Magnus VI of Norway ( the first Norwegian king known to use regnal numbers ) originally used the regnal number IV for himself in contemporary Latin letters , leaving out Magnus Haraldsson . As the numbering system has seen changes in modern times , Magnus Haraldsson is today included as Magnus II . 
 = = Family = = 
 Magnus had a son , Haakon <unk> , who was probably born the same year that Magnus died . Haakon went on to claim what he considered his part of the kingdom ( after his father ) in 1093 when his uncle Olaf Kyrre died , and shared the kingdom with his cousin Magnus Barefoot ( son of Olaf Kyrre ) . Similar to the reign of his father , Haakon 's reign also ended abruptly after a short time as he died young in 1095 .

 = Ditton , Kent = 
 Ditton is a large village and civil parish in the Tonbridge and Malling district of Kent , England . The village is 4 @.@ 6 miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) WNW of Maidstone and 1 @.@ 8 miles ( 2 @.@ 9 km ) east of West Malling . The parish , which is long and narrow , straddles the A20 ( the old Dover to London road ) , with farmland to the south and industry to the north . It lies in the Medway Valley , on the northern edge of the Kent Weald , and adjoins the ancient parishes of Larkfield , Aylesford and Barming . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of the village can be traced to the stream which runs through the parish and gave rise to a number of corn mills along its length . The earliest recorded mention of the village is in the Domesday Book of 1086 . The village contains a number of listed buildings , which include a 12th @-@ century church , an old mill house and two oast houses . 
 More recently , ragstone and newsprint industries have developed and become important sources of local employment . The population of the village grew rapidly with the overspill of housing from the nearby town of Maidstone . Today Ditton has a mixed agricultural and industrial economy , with a wide range of social and leisure facilities . In 2001 it had a population of 4 @,@ 786 . 
 The name Ditton comes from the Saxon " <unk> " meaning the village situated on the dike , or trench of water . This derives from the Bradbourne Stream which rises near East Malling and passes through the village . The stream supplied the now defunct Aylesford Newsprint site , once the largest paper recycling factory in Europe , with part of its water supply . 
 Evidence of the early occupation of Ditton is scant . A Mesolithic <unk> axe , a sharpening flake , three microliths and 36 blades were found at Ditton , but the exact site of the find is now unknown . Mesolithic flint implements , Iron Age pottery and pit dwellings have also been reported in the Holt Hill area of Ditton . 
 An Anglo @-@ Saxon spearhead was found in July 1962 by D. <unk> in a cutting through a natural knoll of sand on Messrs Reed 's playing fields at Cobdown , Ditton . It is possible that the spearhead came from a grave on the top of the knoll , destroyed during the making or widening of the cutting . The first recorded mention of Ditton is in the Domesday Book , with an entry dated 1086 . At that time the village had 31 dwellings . The Domesday Book states : " Haimo the sheriff holds of the bishop ( of Baieux ) <unk> . It was taxed at one suling . The arable land is four carucates . In demesne there are two , and 20 villeins , with five <unk> , having three carucates . There is a church and 6 servants , and one mill of 10 shillings , and eight acres of meadow , and 35 acres of pasture . Wood for the <unk> of six hogs . In the time of King Edward the Confessor it was worth 8 pounds , when he received it 100 shillings , now 8 pounds . <unk> held it of King Edward . " 
 There was another estate ( manor ) in the parish at that time called Sifletone , which also belonged to the Bishop of Baieux ( Bayeux ) , and was entered into the Domesday Book : " Vitalis holds of the bishop ( of Baieux ) Sifletone . It was taxed at three yokes . The arable land is one carucate . In demesne there is one <unk> and an half , and six villeins , with one <unk> , having half a carucate . There are six servants , and one mill of 10s . There are ten acres of meadow , and thirty acres of pasture . In the time of the Confessor it was worth 40 shillings , when he received it four pounds , now 100 shillings . In the time of king Edward the Confessor , two men , <unk> and <unk> , held this land in <unk> , and could turn themselves over with this land to whomever they would . " 
 Thus there were three manors within the parish ; Ditton Manor , with the appendant Brampton Manor , and Sifletone , all of which were owned by the Bishop of Bayeux at this time . The Bishop of <unk> was Odo , Earl of Kent , half brother of William the Conqueror . In 1082 , after it was discovered that Odo planned a military expedition to Italy , he was imprisoned and his estates ( including Ditton , Brampton and Sifletone ) were confiscated to the Crown . Following this , Ditton Manor appears to have been held by the Clares , earls of Gloucester , by a family who assumed their surname from Ditton . Likewise , Sifletone was confiscated and went to another family who took their surname from it . 
 Ditton has a ford which , along with St Peter 's Ad Vincula 's Church , is situated in a conservation area on the west of a large green . The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th @-@ century tower and the first bell of Ditton church was hung there in 1656 . Ditton parish register has as its opening words , " The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom . 1663 . William Jole , rector , inducted Rector of Ditton , 1st August , Anno Dom . 1663 . " Also at the commencement it is recorded , on 1 August 1711 , that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector . In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester , and deanery of Malling . This parish , among others , was obliged to contribute to the repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge . The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott . 
 The north nave window has fragments of fourteenth @-@ century glass , and the nave has a good selection of hanging wall monuments and a benefactions board . A lead plaque on the nave wall , removed from the tower roof in 1859 , has a picture of a ship from Nelson 's time scratched on it . The mill that was recorded in the Domesday Book , Church Mills , was located close to the ford and closed down around 1912 . 
 In 1798 the parish was described in the following terms : " The high road from London , through Wrotham , to Maidstone , crosses the middle of it , at the thirty @-@ first mile stone ; the village stands on it , and the church about a quarter of a mile further southward , on an ascent , beyond which , the parish reaches into the large tract of coppice woods , which extends as far as Teston and Barming . The stream , from <unk> Park runs through this parish and village , across the above road , and having turned two mills , one above and the other below it , runs on to the River Medway , which is the northern boundary of this parish , near the north @-@ west extremity of which , on the road leading from Larkfield to <unk> , and not far distant from that hamlet and the river , is Borough Court . This parish is rather an obscure place , and has nothing further worthy of notice in it . " 
 The three manors ( estates ) of Ditton , Brampton and Sifletone were back in common ownership in the reign of Henry VII , when they belonged to " Thomas Leigh of Sibton in <unk> " . The subsequent history of the manors is as follows : 
 Ditton Manor included a mansion named Ditton Court or Ditton Place that was built in the 16th century , and stood on the present site of Troutbeck House . At the beginning of King James I 's reign it was the residence of the Brewer family , many of whom lie buried in the churchyard , and remained with them until the beginning of the 18th century when , by mortgage or purchase , it came into the possession of the sheriff , Thomas Golding of <unk> , in 1703 . He bequeathed it to his nephew , Thomas Golding of <unk> , who sold it to John Brewer , counsellor at law . Brewer 's niece , Mrs. Carney of West Farleigh , re @-@ conveyed it back to Thomas Golding again in about 1735 and from whom his son , John Golding , inherited it . There is reference in Organa <unk> to an organ built by renowned organ builder John Avery which was moved in the late 18th century from West Malling Parish Church to a recess in the hall of Ditton Court , described as the manor house of the area and owned by the Golding family . Ditton Place was destroyed by fire in 1987 . Today a modern apartment block , named Troutbeck House , has been built on the site of Ditton Place ( as shown on an 1896 map ) , and lies at the centre of a modern housing estate . One of the roads of the estate takes its name from the original house . 
 Brampton Manor probably stood on the site of the New Road Industrial Estate . After the manor was destroyed the site was known as Brampton Field , at least until the 18th Century , and indeed one of the streets of the housing estate which covers the site today is named Brampton Field . 
 <unk> Manor ( Sifletone ) was an estate within Ditton parish and appears to have been incorporated into Ditton Manor at some stage before the 19th century . 
 A manor house , Borough Court ( also known as Brooke Court ) , stood in the northernmost part of the parish ; though it no longer exists it probably stood in the vicinity of the modern Aylesford Newsprint site . The Culpepper family of Aylesford owned the house during the reign of King Edward III ( 1327 – 1377 ) . The High Sheriff of Kent in 1426 – 27 , Walter Culpeper , was the owner until the house devolved onto his heirs , eventually passing to Richard Culpeper ( later Sir Richard Culpepper ) who also owned the manor house at Oxon Hoath . Sir Richard Culpepper died in 1484 without issue and the house was divided amongst his three daughters , one of whom was Joyce Culpeper — whose daughter was Catherine Howard and would become the fifth wife of King Henry VIII . The house was then sold to Francis <unk> who hailed from <unk> , Kent .

 William Kempe , the parson of Ditton , was sued for £ 80 in 1534 for being absent from his parish and for taking a stipend for saying prayers for the souls of the dead ( which was prohibited by a statute of 1529 ) . Although Kempe admitted being absent , he claimed that he was chaplain to baron John Zouche and thus entitled to receive two benefices . 
 William <unk> was an <unk> , and native , of Ditton , who remained in London during the Great Plague of 1665 . During the plague his medical practice expanded and he made his name . He stayed in the city throughout the epidemic , treating by his own account " 40 , 50 or 60 patients a day " . By the end of the year his reputation was sufficient to attract offers from the corporation of Norwich , which tried to employ him when the infection reached there . He wrote a book about his experience which , although not printed at the time , was subsequently published in 1894 for the Epidemiological Society of London under the title <unk> : an Account of the Great Plague of London in the year 1665 . In later life his fortunes appear to have declined , as he could not afford the livery of his company in 1682 . <unk> died on 2 September 1685 aged 54 and was conveyed from London to be buried in the churchyard at Ditton . 
 Thomas Tilson was the rector of Ditton from 1679 – 1702 and was in correspondence with the Protestant cleric Richard Baxter . In one letter Tilson described how a woman from Rochester had gone to her father 's house in West Malling where she died on 4 June 1691 . While on her death bed , at two o 'clock in the morning , she appeared as an apparition to a nurse in Rochester , some nine miles away , where her children were being looked after . It had been the dying woman 's wish to see her children before she died but she had been persuaded not to travel because of her ill health . Baxter included this account in his subsequent book The Certainty of the Worlds of the Spirits published in the same year . Tilson died in 1750 and his memorial in St. Peter 's AD Vincula Church records a bequest he made to the poor of " £ 100 in money , the yearly produce to be distributed annually on the feasts of All Saints and the Purification , in wood and wheat " ( see inscription in photograph ) . 
 Reverend Samuel Bishop ( 1731 – 95 ) was a poet , headmaster of Merchant Taylors ' school and rector of Ditton . His posthumously published book entitled Poems ( 1796 ) was much admired and several times reprinted . Not everyone was complimentary about Bishop and his verses : " the character of Bishop 's countenance is not very intellectual , and there is a timid , and almost mean expression about the mouth . He looks but little qualified to insist upon the discipline necessary to be observed at Merchant Tailor 's ( sic ) school , or to wield the weapons of Dr. Busby . But , we suppose , he did both occasionally , besides writing his epigrams , and composing verses to his wife , — " To Mrs. Bishop . " Of this lady he sings sometimes more like the tea @-@ kettle than the nightingale " . 
 Thomas Golding , sheriff of Kent in 1703 , was living in the nearby parish of Leybourne when he bought Ditton Court , around the start of the 18th century . His arms were " argent , a cross voided between four lions passant , guardant gules " ( a red hollow cross between four lions lying down with their heads and front paws up , on a white or silver background ) . He left Ditton Court to his nephew , another Thomas , who seems to have sold it and then bought it back again around 1735 . 
 The surname Golding is synonymous with a variety of hop known as Goldings and , although it is not certain who discovered the hop , it has been accredited to John Golding ( who died some time before 1811 ) , the great nephew of Thomas and the owner of Ditton Court , or to his son John ( who died at Ditton Place in 1851 ) . 
 Lt. Col. Clifford Sheldon , DSO , was joint managing and senior director of Reeds , the paper manufacturer , and was connected with that firm and its associated companies from 1911 until his death in 1950 at the age of 62 years . He gave his name to the Clifford Sheldon Club House , a converted oast house , which subsequently became the Manor and Greenside <unk> .

 The current A20 , which runs through the village , was once a turnpike , probably established between 1780 and 1820 to connect London with Dover . The Turnpike Act of 1744 required that Turnpike trusts set up milestones along these roads . A series of mileposts made in cast @-@ iron appear on the stretch of road between Aylesford and Addington ; at Ditton , Larkfield and <unk> . The one at Larkfield is shown on an 1862 Ordnance Survey map and the Ditton post is shown on a similar map of 1869 . Both the Larkfield and Ditton posts are classed as Class II listed buildings .

 Ditton Infant School today caters for boys and girls from 4 to 7 years of age and shares its site with Ditton Church of England Junior School . There were 138 children on the infant school roll in 2008 , the time of its most recent Ofsted inspection . 
 Ditton Church of England Junior School is a primary school catering for mixed pupils aged 5 – 11 and is adjacent to the infant school . In 2008 there were 277 children on the school roll and it was inspected by Ofsted in 2010 . 
 Aylesford School – Sports College is a secondary school situated in Teapot Lane , Aylesford , in modern buildings . Its catchment area is to the western side of Maidstone , and includes pupils from Ditton . The school is for mixed gender pupils in years 7 to 11 , with a sixth form for those in years 12 and 13 . In 2004 the school gained specialist status as a Sports College , with the result that the curriculum now includes an element of sports education of every aspect . In 2010 there were 944 pupils on the school roll and it was inspected by Ofsted in the same year . 
 <unk> College ( formerly Mid @-@ Kent College of Higher and Further Education ) is the nearest further education college to Ditton . Three campuses , situated in Maidstone and Medway , cater for around 15 @,@ 000 students aged 16 + . The courses offered cover a number of vocational and academic subjects starting with pre @-@ entry level and finishing at degree level .

 Each year a Remembrance Sunday parade takes place , starting in the village at 11am , to commemorate the military personnel who died in World War I ( 12 names ) and World War II ( 7 names ) . The parade culminates at the War Memorial , which stands on the eastern side of the junction between the A20 road and New Road . A wreath is laid on the monument by members of local groups and of the parish council . 
 The monument was designed by Gilbert Scott , who gifted the land the monument stands on to the village . It records the names of the military personnel who fell in the two world wars . Its design is unique among war memorials in the United Kingdom on account of the roof over the cross . The monument was dedicated and unveiled on 26 September 1920 , in a ceremony attended by the Bishop of Rochester and General Archibald Murray . The monument was granted listed building status in 2000 as a result of Ditton Parish Council approaching the War Memorial Society for assistance to repair it .

 = = Geography = = 
 This history of Ditton has , in part , been shaped by the availability of natural resources in the area , especially water , soil and rocks . Its position in relation to transport links with London , notably the main roads and railways which tend towards the capital city , has also contributed to the village 's development . Nowadays the parish is characterised by industrial units to the north , the middle by residential estates , and the south by fields and woodland . 
 The parish of Ditton lies in the Medway valley and borders the River Medway to the north and the Weald to the south . The Medway is Kent ’ s principal river and rises near East Grinstead in Sussex , flowing eastwards to Maidstone . After passing Ditton parish it turns north and cuts through the North Downs at Rochester , joining the estuary of the River Thames as its final tributary near Sheerness . The Medway is some 112 kilometres ( 70 mi ) long . 
 The availability of water to transport products and raw materials , and as a resource used in the manufacture of paper , was essential to the historical development of paper mills in the area . Bradbourne stream , which meanders through the parish in a south @-@ east to north @-@ west direction , rises in East Malling , crosses under the A20 road and M20 motorway , and joins the river Medway near the Aylesford Newsprint site . Historically the availability of running water was essential to the early settlements that grew up in Kent , and to the establishment of industries in the area ; such as providing power to drive the mills which ground grain . 
 Ditton is situated between the Lower Weald and the Chalk ( North ) Downs . The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata , where a formation of hard sandy limestone known as the Hythe Beds is abundant . From this formation ragstone is obtained . Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England . The Romans used ragstone in the construction of London and villas in the south @-@ east . Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches , civic buildings , houses and bridges over local rivers . The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today .

 = = Economy = = 
 The parish of Ditton contains a number of agricultural , small commercial and industrial businesses , marking a historical shift from a farming @-@ based community to a modern , mixed economy . 
 The Medway valley has long been associated with the newsprint industry , but in February 2015 it was confirmed that the last major paper mill in the parish , Aylesford Newsprint , was to close with the loss of 233 jobs . Ditton 's connection with the industry goes back to 1922 when the first factory was built by Reed International on the banks of the river Medway . Reed International were a major paper manufacturer which , at its height , had in the region of 1 @,@ 500 employees . The business was seriously hampered by the advent of World War II , which caused a shortage of pulp to make newspapers and led to a different material , waste paper , being used in its place . Waste paper was then replaced by recycled fibre , which was fully utilised in the process of producing newsprint . The 60 @-@ acre Newsprint plant belonged to SCA , paper manufacturers from Sweden , in partnership with Mondi , and £ 250 million was invested in developing the site . Aylesford Newsprint was one of the world 's leading manufacturers of newsprint , recycling around 500 @,@ 000 tonnes of material to produce some 400 @,@ 000 tonnes of final product . Media organisations in Europe , America and the Far East relied on the recycled newsprint from the plant for their publications . Ditton stream was a vital water supply for the processes carried out in the plant . 
 At the opposite end of the parish is part of the 580 acre East Malling Research Station . This began in 1913 with 23 acres in response to a need among Kent farmers for assistance with their fruit growing activities . Since fruit was an important part of the Kent economy , the station performed a valuable role is carrying out research experiments and advising farmers on fruit production . The land that forms the research station grounds is conducive to the growing of fruit , with good water retention and drainage properties . The station was also well placed in terms of transport links , since the nearby railway connected with London in one direction and the agricultural college at Wye in the other . It was an indication of the importance of the research station that the government and fruit producers were prepared to give financial support for its work . In 1938 the 360 acre Bradbourne House estate was added to the site . As a result of research work carried out on the site , the station established a reputation as a world centre for the research of perennial crops . Horticultural Research International operated the site until 2009 until 1 April 2010 , since when the research station has been owned by the East Malling Trust . The station is fully engaged with local business and contains a lecture hall that can take 200 delegates . 
 The Ditton Laboratory , a short distance from the research station , was opened in 1930 by the Empire Marketing Board as a part of Cambridge University 's Low Temperature Research Station . The purpose of the laboratory was to carry out experiments on the shipping of fruit across the high seas , in order to extend its life over long , seaborne journeys . This led to an experiment being carried out to simulate , as far as was possible , conditions on board a cargo ship , the so @-@ called " ship on land " experiment . One focus of research was the Cox 's Orange Pippin Apple , which had the reputation of being a difficult fruit to transport over long distances . In 1969 the laboratory was incorporated into the East Malling Research Station as the fruit storage section . Today the building is boarded up and appears to be deserted , although a fish farm and fruit distribution business continue at its rear . 
 Quarrying for ragstone is still an important local industry . Gallagher Aggregates Limited operate the Hermitage Quarry , which is situated 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) to the south of Ditton village . About 50 employees work in the quarry and another 60 on subsidiary functions . According to the firm 's estimates there is only enough ragstone left in the quarry for another four years ' quarrying , with the result that new sources of production are being sought . Ragstone in an important material the construction industry for roads and buildings . 
 In 2011 Gallagher Aggregates applied to extend the Hermitage Quarry into Oaken Wood in the parish of Ditton . The planning committee of Kent County Council granted permission for quarrying in part of the woodland , but the decision was referred to the Secretary of State . Planning committee chairman Richard King said that " local residents and environmental groups have argued that the loss of irreplaceable ancient woodland and impact on the local wildlife site is unacceptable . On balance , however , members felt the job prospects and the economic need for ragstone to support construction in the county in future , and benefits of the project , outweighed these objections . " The application was subsequently approved on appeal by the communities secretary , Eric Pickles , who observed that the economic benefits of being able to produce more ragstone and crushed rock from the site outweighed the loss of the wood . 
 Ditton is five miles from the centre of the county town of Maidstone , which is an important source of employment in the area .

The sister 72 Arriva service between Kings Hill and Maidstone Town Centre also passes through Ditton every 30 minutes ( Monday - Saturday ) . 
 The 703 Arriva service between Maidstone Town Centre and Bluewater Shopping Centre in Greenhithe , Dartford also passes through Ditton however this is an intermittent service that runs three times a day ( Monday - Friday ) . 
 Aylesford railway station , with connecting trains to London St Pancras , is within walking distance of Ditton . East Malling railway station , 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the village , is on the main London – Maidstone and London – Ashford line with trains leaving London Victoria and Maidstone at hourly intervals . The journey to London takes approximately one hour . 
 Maidstone West railway station is 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from Ditton . On 23 May 2011 a new high speed " Javelin " service began from the station to St Pancras International via Strood , though on a trial basis . The service consists of three departures from Maidstone West in the morning , and three departures from St Pancras International in the late afternoon though the early evening . The service calls at Strood , Gravesend , Stratford International and St Pancras International , with journey times of forty @-@ seven minutes . There is also one service in the morning departing St Pancras International for Maidstone West . In the evening there is one service departing from Maidstone West for St Pancras International . Passengers can still travel twice an hour from Maidstone West to St Pancras International in sixty @-@ five minutes by changing at Strood ( an option also open to passengers boarding at Aylesford ) . 
 The M20 motorway is easily accessible from Ditton via junctions 4 and 5 . 
 As Ditton is situated in Kent it has excellent connections to mainland Europe and farther afield through Kent 's major transport nodes : seven freight and passenger ports , including the Port of Dover ; two international high @-@ speed railway stations , Ashford and Ebbsfleet ; London City Airport ( approximately 35 miles ( 56 km ) away ) and London Gatwick ( 40 miles ( 64 km ) away ) . The railway stations at Ashford ( 25 miles ( 40 km ) away ) and Ebbsfleet ( 20 miles ( 32 km ) away ) have connections to Paris and Brussels . 
 Ditton has extensive transport links , being close to the M20 motorway and the national railway network with its regular connections to London . The Channel Tunnel is within easy driving distance and the village is twinned with Rang @-@ du @-@ Fliers in the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais department of the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region of France . 
 = = Ditton Nature Reserve = = 
 Since 31 May 2009 Ditton has had an officially recognised nature reserve , Ditton Quarry off <unk> Road . Natural England declared it a Local Nature Reserve after a partnership had been formed between Ditton Parish Council , local residents , and Tonbridge and Malling Borough Council . 
 Many ragstone quarries have been abandoned and backfilled once exhausted . When Ditton Quarry closed down in 1984 , quarrying operations had left behind a legacy of a lime @-@ rich soil which formed the foundation of a thriving habitat for plants and wildlife ; 140 wild flowers ( including five that are rare in Kent ) , 18 butterfly species , and 50 bird species have been recorded . It is also home to foxes , rabbits , frogs , toads and newts . The quarry is now a Site of Nature Conservation Importance ( SNCI ) . Public access is free . 
 The quarry is also a prime location for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies in a variety of disciplines : <unk> , stratigraphy , palaeontology , geography , and industrial archaeology . Several features make this a unique location for the study of rock formations . Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces , primarily Kentish Ragstone and <unk> facies , and study changes in vertical and lateral facies . The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of <unk> . Shell debris ( ammonites , belemnites , nautiloids , bivalves , etc . ) and bioturbation are also present . The quarry could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate .

 Ditton has various urban open spaces : the New Road 4 @-@ acre ( 16 @,@ 000 m2 ) recreation ground was acquired in 1954 and a second one measuring 11 acres ( 45 @,@ 000 m2 ) was provided in the early 1970s , just prior to the building of the community centre ( see Ditton Community Centre ) . A further 18 acres ( 73 @,@ 000 m2 ) of recreational land was handed to the parish in 1991 following the cessation of quarrying at Ditton Court Quarry ( see Ditton Nature Reserve ) . A small section of the land has been leased to Ditton Bowls Club who , with Sports Council grants and loans from the parish council , have provided a thriving member 's club with a well kept green , looked after by parish council staff . The club has recently added a pavilion for use by its members .

 Set in the grounds of Cobdown Park , the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International , the paper @-@ maker . A new clubhouse was built in 1985 for Reed International Sports and Social Club and in 1989 the club became the Cobdown Sports & Social Club when it was taken over by the club members . Although it remained a members club , with many of the same activities , the club was opened up to the general public and new activities were added . Sports form an important part of these activities , and the club is an important local centre with a wide range of facilities to cater for groups and organisations , such as schools and businesses . Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club . Facilities include a bar , with snooker and pool tables , a darts board , and a big screen for major sporting events . There is a dedicated function room that is used for social and business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated .

 = Montana @-@ class battleship = 
 The Montana @-@ class battleships of the United States Navy were planned as successors to the Iowa class , being slower but larger , better armored , and having superior firepower . Five were approved for construction during World War II , but changes in wartime building priorities resulted in their cancellation in favor of the Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers and Iowa class before any Montana @-@ class keels were laid . With beams of 121 feet , they would have been the first U.S. battleships as originally designed to be too wide to transit the 110 @-@ foot @-@ wide locks of the Panama Canal . 
 Intended armament would have been 12 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) Mark 7 guns in four triple turrets , up from the Iowas ' three triple 16s . With an increased anti @-@ aircraft capability and thicker armor belt , the Montana class would have been the largest , best @-@ protected , and most heavily armed U.S. battleships ever , the only class to come close to rivaling the Empire of Japan 's immense Yamato @-@ class battleships . 
 Preliminary design work for the Montana class began before the US entry into World War II . The first two vessels were approved by Congress in 1939 following the passage of the Second Vinson Act . The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor delayed construction of the Montana class . The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and , to a greater extent , the Battle of Midway , diminished the value of the battleship . Consequently , the US Navy chose to cancel the Montana class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers , amphibious and anti @-@ submarine vessels . 
 Because the Iowas were fast enough to escort the new Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers , their orders were retained , making them the last US Navy battleships to be commissioned . 
 = = History = = 
 As the political situation in Europe and Asia worsened in the prelude to World War II , Carl Vinson , the chairman of the House Committee on Naval Affairs , instituted the Vinson Naval Plan , which aimed to get the Navy into fighting shape after the cutbacks imposed by the Great Depression and pair of London Naval Treaties of the 1930s . As part of the overall plan Congress passed the Second Vinson Act in 1938 , which cleared the way for construction of the four South Dakota @-@ class fast battleships and the first two Iowa @-@ class fast battleships ( hull numbers BB @-@ 61 and BB @-@ 62 ) . Four additional battleships ( with hull numbers BB @-@ 63 , BB @-@ 64 , BB @-@ 65 , and BB @-@ 66 ) were approved for construction in 1940 , with the last two intended to be the first ships of the Montana class . By 1942 , it was apparent to the US Navy high command that they needed as many fast battleships as possible , and hull numbers BB @-@ 65 and BB @-@ 66 were allocated to planned fast battleships Illinois and Kentucky . 
 The Navy , mindful of the ongoing construction of Japan 's Yamato @-@ class battleships , had been working on a 58 @,@ 000 @-@ ton " super battleship " concept since 1938 . This new class , with twelve 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns , was assigned the name Montana and cleared for construction by the United States Congress under the Two @-@ Ocean Navy Act in 1940 ; funding for the new ships was approved in 1941 . These ships , the last battleships to be ordered by the Navy , were originally to be designated BB @-@ 65 through BB @-@ 69 ; however , BB @-@ 65 and BB − 66 were subsequently re @-@ ordered as Iowa @-@ class ships , Illinois and Kentucky , and the Montanas were redesignated BB @-@ 67 through BB @-@ 71 . 
 Completion of the Montana @-@ class , and the last two Iowa @-@ class battleships , was intended to give the US Navy a considerable advantage over any other nation , or probable combination of nations , with a total of 17 new battleships by the late 1940s . The Montanas also would have been the only American ships to come close to equaling Japan 's massive Yamato and her sister Musashi in terms of size and firepower , with only the Kriegsmarine having even more enormous battleships planned , with their H @-@ 42 and onwards designs exceeding the Montana class in size and capabilities . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Preliminary planning for the Montana @-@ class battleships took place in 1939 , when the aircraft carrier was still considered strategically less important than the battleship . The Navy began designing a 65 @,@ 000 @-@ ton battleship to counter the threat posed by the Yamato @-@ class battleships of the Imperial Japanese Navy . Although the Navy knew little about the Yamato class , the new Japanese battleships were rumored to have a main gun battery of 18 inches ( 457 mm ) . Initially , plans were drawn for a 45 @,@ 000 @-@ ton ( 46 @,@ 000 @-@ metric @-@ ton ) US battleship , but after evaluation , the Battleship Design Advisory Board increased the displacement of the planned ship to 58 @,@ 000 tons ( 59 @,@ 000 metric tons ) . 
 At the time , the design board issued a basic outline for the Montana class that called for it to be free of beam restrictions imposed by the Panama Canal , be 25 % stronger offensively and defensively than any other battleship completed or under construction , and be capable of withstanding the " super heavy " 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) shells used by US battleships equipped with either the 16 @-@ inch / 45 caliber guns or 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) / 50 cal Mark 7 guns . Although freed of the restriction of fitting through the Panama Canal , the length and height of the Montana class were limited by one of the shipyards at which they were to be built : the New York Navy Yard could not handle the construction of a 58 @,@ 000 @-@ ton ( 59 @,@ 000 @-@ metric @-@ ton ) ship , and vessels built there had to be low enough to clear the Brooklyn Bridge at low tide . 
 After debate at the design board about whether the Montana class should be fast , achieving the high 33 kn ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) speed of the Iowa class , or up @-@ gunned and up @-@ armored , firepower was selected over speed . By returning the Montana class to the slower 28 kn ( 32 mph ; 52 km / h ) maximum speed of the North <unk> and South <unk> class ships , naval architects were able to increase armor protection for the Montanas , enabling the ships to withstand enemy fire equivalent to their own guns ' ammunition . This limited the Montanas ' ability to escort and defend the Pacific @-@ based Allied aircraft carrier fleet , as the class was to be powered by eight Babcock & Wilcox boilers which would have enabled them to steam at approximately 27 to 28 kn ( 31 to 32 mph ; 50 to 52 km / h ) . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 By January 1941 , the design limit for the 58 @,@ 000 @-@ ton ( 59 @,@ 000 @-@ metric @-@ ton ) battleship plan had been reached , and consensus among those designing the battleship class was to increase the displacement to support the armor and weaponry on the ships . At the same time , planners decided to adopt a slightly greater length and reduce power for a better machinery arrangement , as well as improving internal subdivisions , and selecting as the secondary armament several dual @-@ mounted 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 54 cal guns instead of the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 cal guns used on the Iowas . At this point , the net design for the Montana class somewhat resembled the Iowa class since they would be equipped with the same caliber main guns and similar caliber secondary guns ; however , Montana and her sisters had more armor , mounted three more main guns in one more turret , and were 22 ft ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) longer and 13 ft ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) wider than the Iowa class . 
 By April 1942 , the Montana @-@ class design had been approved ; construction was authorized by the United States Congress and the projected date of completion was estimated to be somewhere between 1 July and 1 November 1945 . The Navy ordered the ships in May 1942 , but the Montana class was placed on hold because the Iowa @-@ class battleships and the Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers were under construction in the shipyards intended to build the Montanas . Both the Iowa and Essex classes had been given higher priorities : the Iowas as they were fast enough to keep up with and defend the Essex @-@ class carriers with 20 mm and 40 mm guns , and the Essexes because of their ability to launch aircraft to gain and maintain air supremacy over the islands in the Pacific and intercept warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The entire Montana class was suspended in May 1942 , before any of their keels had been laid . In July 1942 , the construction of the Montana class was canceled following the Battle of Midway and the corresponding shift in naval warfare from surface engagements to air supremacy and a corresponding shift from battleships to aircraft carriers . 
 = = Ships = = 
 Five ships of the Montana class were authorized on 19 July 1940 , but they were suspended indefinitely until being canceled on 21 July 1943 . The ships were to be built at the New York Navy Yard , Philadelphia Navy Yard , and Norfolk Navy Yard . 
 = = = USS Montana ( BB @-@ 67 ) = = = 
 Montana was planned to be the lead ship of the class . She was the third ship to be named in honor of the 41st state , and was assigned to the Philadelphia Navy Yard . Both the earlier battleship , BB @-@ 51 , and BB @-@ 67 were canceled , so Montana is the only one of the ( 48 at the time ) US states never to have had a battleship with a " BB " hull classification completed in its honor .

 = = Armament = = 
 The armament of the Montana @-@ class battleships would have been similar to the preceding Iowa @-@ class battleships , but with an increase in the number of primary and secondary guns for use against enemy surface ships and aircraft . Had they been completed , the Montanas would have been gun @-@ for @-@ gun the most powerful battleships the United States had constructed , and the only US battleship class that would have come close to equaling the Imperial Japanese Navy battleships Yamato and Musashi in armament , armor , and displacement . 
 = = = Main battery = = = 
 The primary armament of a Montana @-@ class battleship would have been 12 16 " / 50 caliber Mark 7 gun , which were to be housed in four three @-@ gun turrets : two forward and two aft . The guns , the same used to arm the Iowa @-@ class battleships , were 66 ft ( 20 m ) long – 50 times their 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) bore , or 50 calibers , from breechface to muzzle . Each gun weighed about 239 @,@ 000 lb ( 108 @,@ 000 kg ) without the breech , or 267 @,@ 900 lb ( 121 @,@ 500 kg ) with the breech . They fired projectiles weighing up to 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) at a maximum speed of 2 @,@ 690 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) with a range of up to 24 nmi ( 28 mi ; 44 km ) . At maximum range the projectile would have spent almost 1 ½ minutes in flight . The addition of the No. 4 turret would have allowed Montana to overtake the Yamato as the battleship having heaviest broadside overall ; Montana and her sisters would have had a broadside of 32 @,@ 400 lb ( 14 @,@ 700 kg ) vs. 28 @,@ 800 lb ( 13 @,@ 100 kg ) for Yamato . Each gun would have rested within an armored barbette , but only the top of the barbette would have protruded above the main deck . The barbettes would have extended either four decks ( turrets 1 and 4 ) or five decks ( turrets 2 and 3 ) down . The lower spaces would have contained rooms for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them . Each turret would have required a crew of 94 men to operate . The turrets would not have been attached to the ship , but would have rested on rollers , which meant that had any of the Montana @-@ class ships capsized , the turrets would have fallen out . Each turret would have cost US $ 1 @.@ 4 million , but this figure did not take into account the cost of the guns themselves . 
 The turrets would have been " three @-@ gun " , not " triple " , because each barrel would have elevated and fired independently . The ships could fire any combination of their guns , including a broadside of all 12 . Contrary to popular belief , the ships would not have moved sideways noticeably when a broadside was fired . 
 The guns would have been elevated from − 5 ° to + 45 ° , moving at up to 12 ° per second . The turrets would have rotated about 300 ° at about 4 ° per second and could even be fired back beyond the beam , which is sometimes called " over the shoulder " . Within each turret , a red stripe on the wall of the turret , just inches from the railing , would have marked the boundary of the gun 's recoil , providing the crew of each gun turret with a visual reference for the minimum safe distance range . 
 Like most battleships in World War II , the Montana class would have been equipped with a fire control computer , in this case the Ford Mk 1A Ballistic Computer , a 3 @,@ 150 lb ( 1 @,@ 430 kg ) <unk> designed to direct gunfire on land , sea , and in the air . This analog computer would have been used to direct the fire from the battleship 's big guns , taking into account several factors such as the speed of the targeted ship , the time it takes for a projectile to travel , and air resistance to the shells fired at a target . At the time the Montana class was set to begin construction , the rangekeepers had gained the ability to use radar data to help target enemy ships and land @-@ based targets . The results of this advance were telling : the <unk> was able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy , as was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship Washington engaged the Imperial Japanese Navy battleship Kirishima at a range of 18 @,@ 500 yd ( 16 @.@ 9 km ) at night ; the Washington scored at least nine heavy caliber hits that critically damaged the Kirishima and led to her loss . This gave the US Navy a major advantage in World War II , as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy . 
 The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) shells : an armor @-@ piercing round for anti @-@ ship and anti @-@ structure work , and a high @-@ explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment . 
 The Mk . 8 APC ( Armor @-@ Piercing , Capped ) shell weighed in at 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) , and was designed to penetrate the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships . At 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 18 @.@ 3 km ) , the Mk . 8 could penetrate 20 inches ( 508 mm ) of steel armor plate . At the same range , the Mk . 8 could penetrate 21 ft ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) of reinforced concrete . For unarmored targets and shore bombardment , the 1 @,@ 900 lb ( 860 kg ) Mk . 13 HC ( High @-@ Capacity — referring to the large bursting charge ) shell was available . The Mk . 13 shell could create a crater 50 ft ( 15 m ) wide and 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) deep upon impact and detonation , and could defoliate trees 400 yd ( 370 m ) from the point of impact . 
 The final type of ammunition developed for the 16 @-@ inch guns , well after the Montanas had been cancelled , were <unk> " Katie " shells . These were born from the nuclear deterrence that had begun to shape the US armed forces at the start of the Cold War . To compete with the Air Force and the Army , which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on the battlefield , the Navy began a top @-@ secret program to develop Mk . 23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20 kilotons . The shells entered development around 1953 , and were reportedly ready by 1956 ; however , only the Iowa @-@ class battleships could have fired them . 
 = = = Secondary battery = = = 
 The secondary armament for Montana and her sisters was to be 20 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 54 cal guns housed in 10 turrets along the island of the battleship ; five on the starboard side and five on the port . These guns , designed specifically for the Montanas , were to be the replacement for the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 cal secondary gun batteries then in widespread use with the US Navy . 
 The 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 54 cal gun turrets were similar to the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 cal gun mounts in that they were equally adept in an anti @-@ aircraft role and for damaging smaller ships , but differed in that they weighed more , fired heavier rounds of ammunition , and resulted in faster crew fatigue than the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 38 cal guns . The ammunition storage for the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 54 cal gun was 500 rounds per turret , and the guns could fire at targets nearly 26 @,@ 000 yd ( 24 km ) away at a 45 ° angle . At an 85 ° angle , the guns could hit an aerial target at over 50 @,@ 000 ft ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 The cancellation of the Montana @-@ class battleships in 1943 pushed back the combat debut of the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 54 cal guns to 1945 , when they were used aboard the US Navy 's Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers . The guns proved adequate for the carrier 's air defense , but were gradually phased out of use by the carrier fleet because of their weight . ( Rather than having the carrier defend itself by gunnery this would be assigned to other surrounding ships within a carrier battle group . ) 
 = = = Anti @-@ aircraft batteries = = = 
 For the first time since the construction of the Iowa class , the US Navy was not building a fast battleship class solely for the purpose of escorting Pacific @-@ based aircraft carriers , and thus the Montana class would not be designed principally for escorting the fast carrier task forces ; nonetheless they would have been equipped with a wide array of anti @-@ aircraft guns to protect themselves and other ships ( principally the US aircraft carriers ) from Japanese fighters and dive bombers . 
 = = = = Oerlikon 20 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns = = = = 
 The Oerlikon 20 mm anti @-@ aircraft cannon was one of the most heavily produced anti @-@ aircraft guns of World War II ; the US alone manufactured a total of 124 @,@ 735 of these guns . When activated in 1941 , these guns replaced the .50 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) / 90 cal M2 Browning MG on a one @-@ for @-@ one basis . The Oerlikon 20 mm AA gun remained the primary anti @-@ aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40 mm Bofors AA gun in 1943 . 
 These guns are air @-@ cooled and use a gas blow @-@ back recoil system . Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II , the barrel of the 20 mm Oerlikon gun does not recoil ; the breechblock is never locked against the breech and is actually moving forward when the gun fires . This weapon lacks a counter @-@ recoil brake , as the force of the counter @-@ recoil is checked by recoil from the firing of the next round of ammunition . 
 Between December 1941 and September 1944 , 32 % of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon , with the high point being 48 @.@ 3 % for the second half of 1942 . In 1943 , the revolutionary Mark 14 gunsight was introduced , which made these guns even more effective . The 20 mm guns , however , were found to be ineffective against the Japanese kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II . They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier 40 mm Bofors AA guns . 
 = = = = Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns = = = = 
 The Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft gun was used on almost every major warship in the US and UK fleet from about 1943 to 1945 . Although a descendant of German , Dutch , and Swedish designs , the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily Americanized to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the Navy . This resulted in a gun system set to British standards ( now known as the Standard System ) with interchangeable ammunition , which simplified the logistics situation for World War II . When coupled with hydraulic couple drives to reduce salt contamination and the Mark 51 director for improved accuracy , the Bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary , accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945 . 
 = = Armor = = 
 Aside from its firepower , a battleship 's defining feature is its armor . The exact design and placement of the armor , inextricably linked with the ship 's stability and performance , is a complex science honed over decades . 
 A battleship is usually armored to withstand an attack from guns the size of its own , but the armor scheme of the preceding North Carolina class was only proof against 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) shells ( which they had originally been intended to carry ) , while the South Dakota @-@ class battleship ( 1939 ) and Iowa @-@ class battleship classes were designed only to resist their original complement of Mark V 2 @,@ 240 lb ( 1 @,@ 020 kg ) shells , not the new " super @-@ heavy " 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) APC ( Armor Piercing , Capped ) <unk> VIII shells they actually used . The Montanas were the only US battleships designed to resist the Mark VIII . Designed to give a zone of immunity against fire from 16 @-@ inch / 45 @-@ caliber firing 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 225 kg ) shell , between 18 @,@ 000 and 31 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 459 and 28 @,@ 346 m ) and 16 @-@ inch / 45 @-@ caliber firing 2 @,@ 240 lb ( 1 @,@ 016 kg ) shell , between 16 @,@ 500 and 34 @,@ 500 yards ( 15 @,@ 087 and 31 @,@ 546 m ) away . 
 Until the authorization of the Montana class all US battleships were built within the size limits for the Panama Canal . The main reason for this was logistical : the largest US shipyards were located on the East Coast of the United States , while the United States had territorial interests in both oceans . Requiring the battleships to fit within the Panama Canal took days off the transition time from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by allowing ships to move through the canal instead of sailing around South America . By the time of the Two Ocean Navy bill , the Navy realized that ship designs could no longer be limited by the Panama Canal and thus approved the Montana class knowing that the ships would be unable to clear the locks . This shift in policy meant that the Montana class would have been the only World War II – era US battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own . 
 = = Aircraft = = 
 The Montana class would have used aircraft for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting . The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned , but in all probability they would have used either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk . The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship 's fantail .

 The Vought OS2U Kingfisher was a lightly armed two @-@ man aircraft designed in 1937 .

 In June 1942 , the US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics requested industry proposals for a new seaplane to replace the Kingfisher and Curtiss SO3C <unk> . The new aircraft was required to be able to use landing gear as well as floats . Curtiss submitted a design on 1 August , and received a contract for two prototypes and five service @-@ test aircraft on 25 August . The first flight of a prototype <unk> @-@ 1 took place on 16 February 1944 at the Columbus , Ohio Curtiss plant . The first production aircraft were delivered in October 1944 , and by the beginning of 1945 the single @-@ seat Curtiss SC Seahawk floatplane began replacing the Kingfisher . Had the Montana class been completed , they would have arrived around the time of this replacement , and would likely have been equipped with the Seahawk for use in combat operations and seaborne search and rescue . 
 = Rufous @-@ crowned sparrow = 
 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow ( Aimophila ruficeps ) is a small American sparrow . This passerine is primarily found across the Southwestern United States and much of the interior of Mexico , south to the transverse mountain range , and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the transverse range . Its distribution is patchy , with populations often being isolated from each other . Twelve subspecies are generally recognized , though up to eighteen have been suggested . This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts . The crown is rufous , and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak . 
 These sparrows feed primarily on seeds in the winter and insects in the spring and summer . The birds are often territorial , with males guarding their territory through song and displays . Flight is awkward for this species , which prefers to hop along the ground for locomotion . They are monogamous and breed during spring . Two to five eggs are laid in the bird 's nest , which is cup @-@ shaped and well hidden . Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors , while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles . They have been known to live for up to three years , two months . Although the species has been classified as least concern , or unthreatened with extinction , some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This bird belongs to the family <unk> , which consists of the American sparrows and Eurasian buntings . The American sparrows are seed @-@ eating New World birds with conical bills , brown or gray plumage , and distinctive head patterns . Birds in the genus Aimophila tend to be medium @-@ sized at 5 to 8 inches ( 13 to 20 cm ) in length , live in arid scrubland , have long bills and tails in proportion to their body size as well as short , rounded wings , and build cup @-@ shaped nests . 
 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow was described in 1852 by American ornithologist John Cassin as Ammodramus ruficeps . It has also been described as belonging to the genus <unk> , which contains several sparrows in the genus Aimophila that share characteristics , such as a larger bill and a patch of yellow under the bend of the wing , that other members of the genus do not . However , splitting the <unk> sparrows into a separate genus is not generally recognized . A 2008 phylogenetic analysis of the genus Aimophila divided it into four genera , with the rufous @-@ crowned sparrow and its two closest relatives , the Oaxaca sparrow and rusty sparrow , being maintained as the genus Aimophila . In addition , this study suggested that the rufous @-@ crowned sparrow may be more closely related to the brown towhees of the genus <unk> than the other members of the historical genus Aimophila . 
 The derivation of the current genus name , Aimophila , is from the Greek <unk> / <unk> , meaning " thicket " , and <unk> / <unk> , meaning " loving " . The specific epithet is a literal derivation of the common name , derived from the Latin rufus , meaning " reddish " or " tawny " , and -ceps , from caput , meaning " head " . The bird is also occasionally referred to colloquially as the rock sparrow because of its preference for rocky slopes . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Twelve subspecies are generally recognized , although sometimes up to eighteen are named . 
 A. r. ruficeps , the nominate subspecies , was described by Cassin in 1852 . It is found in the coastal ranges of California and on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada . This subspecies is darker and noticeably smaller than A. r. eremoeca and has distinct rufous @-@ brown streaking on its upperparts . 
 A. r. canescens was described by American ornithologist W. E. Clyde Todd in 1922 , and it is found in southwestern California and northeast Baja California as far east as the base of the San Pedro Mártir . While the species itself is listed as of least concern , this subspecies is listed as a " species of special concern " by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife , signifying that this population is threatened with extinction . It appears to be extremely similar to A. r. ruficeps but is darker . 
 A. r. obscura , described by Donald R. Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem in 1923 , is found in the Channel Islands of California on Santa Cruz , Anacapa , and formerly on Santa Catalina . While the Santa Catalina population has not been observed since 1863 , the subspecies seems to have colonized Anacapa Island . No records exist of them before 1940 . This subspecies is similar to A. r. canescens but is darker . 
 A. r. sanctorum was described by van Rossem in 1947 . It was found on the Todos Santos Islands off the coast of northwest Baja California . This subspecies is believed to be extinct . This is the darkest of the coastal subspecies , especially on its underbelly . 
 A. r. sororia was described by Robert Ridgway in 1898 , and is found in the mountains of southern Baja California , specifically the Sierra de la Laguna . It is the palest of the coastal subspecies . 
 A. r. scottii , described by George Sennett in 1888 , is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila . It appears to be a darker gray than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker rufous streaks on its breast . 
 A. r. rupicola was described by van Rossem in 1946 . It is found in the mountains of southwestern Arizona . It is similar in appearance to A. r. scottii but is darker and grayer on its back . 
 A. r. <unk> was described by van Rossem in 1934 , and it is found in northwestern Mexico from southeastern Sonora and southwestern Chihuahua to Nayarit and northern Jalisco . It has more rufous coloration on its back and is paler on its underbelly than A. r. scottii . 
 A. r. eremoeca was described by N. C. Brown in 1882 . It is found from southeastern Colorado to New Mexico , Texas , northern Chihuahua , and central Coahuila . It has grayish upperparts and a dark breast . 
 A. r. fusca , described by Edward William Nelson in 1897 , is found in western Mexico from southern Nayarit to southwestern Jalisco , northern Colima , and Michoacan . It is darker and more rufous on its upperparts than A. r. australis . It also possesses a darker rufous crown which does not show a gray stripe down the middle . 
 A. r. <unk> was described by Philip Sclater in 1867 , and it is found in eastern Mexico from southern Coahuila to San Luis Potosí , northern Puebla , and southern Oaxaca . This subspecies is darker than A. r. eremoeca and has dull brown , not rufous , streaking on the chest . 
 A. r. australis , described by Edward William Nelson in 1897 , occurs in southern Mexico from Guerrero to southern Puebla and Oaxaca . A. r. scottii is similar in appearance , but this subspecies is smaller and has a shorter bill . 
 The other six subspecies that are occasionally recognized are A. r. <unk> and A. r. <unk> , which were described by A. R. Phillips in 1966 , A. r. phillipsi , which was described by J.P. Hubbard and <unk> in 1974 , and A. r. <unk> , A. r. <unk> , and A. r. <unk> , which were described by J.P. Hubbard in 1975 .

 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow is a smallish sparrow at 5 @.@ 25 inches ( 13 @.@ 3 cm ) in length , with males tending to be larger than females . It ranges from 15 to 23 g ( 0 @.@ 53 to 0 @.@ 81 oz ) in weight and averages about 19 g ( 0 @.@ 67 oz ) . It has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts . Its wings are short , rounded , and brown and lack wingbars , or a line of feathers of a contrasting color in the middle of the bird 's wing . The sparrow 's tail is long , brown , and rounded . The face and supercilium ( the area above the eye ) are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black streak on each cheek . The crown ranges from rufous to chestnut , a feature which gives it its common name , and some subspecies have a gray streak running through the center of the crown . The bill is yellow and cone @-@ shaped . The sparrow 's throat is white with a dark stripe . Its legs and feet are pink @-@ gray . Both sexes are similar in appearance , but the juvenile rufous @-@ crowned sparrow has a brown crown and numerous streaks on its breast and flanks during the spring and autumn . 
 The song is a short , fast , bubbling series of chip notes that can accelerate near the end , and the calls include a nasal chur and a thin tsi . When threatened or separated from its mate , the sparrow makes a dear @-@ dear @-@ dear call . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This bird is found in the southwestern United States and Mexico from sea level up to 9 @,@ 800 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , though it tends to be found between 3 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 and 1 @,@ 830 m ) . It lives in California , southern Arizona , southern New Mexico , Texas , and central Oklahoma south along Baja California and in western Mexico to southern Puebla and Oaxaca . In the midwestern United States , the sparrow is found as far east as a small part of western Arkansas , and also in a small region of northeastern Kansas , its most northeastern habitat . The range of this species is discontinuous and is made up of many small , isolated populations . The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow is a non @-@ migratory species , though the mountain subspecies are known to descend to lower elevations during severe winters . Male sparrows maintain and defend their territories throughout the year . 
 This sparrow is found in open oak woodlands and dry uplands with grassy vegetation and bushes . It is often found near rocky outcroppings . The species is also known from coastal scrublands and chaparral areas . The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow thrives in open areas cleared by burning . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 The average territory size of rufous @-@ crowned sparrows in the chaparral of California ranges from 2 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 ha ) to 4 acres ( 1 @.@ 6 ha ) . The density of territories varies by habitat , including 2 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 8 territories per 99 acres ( 40 ha ) of three- to five @-@ year @-@ old burned chaparral to 3 @.@ 9 to 6 @.@ 9 territories for the same amount of coastal scrubland . One pair tends to be supported by a territory , although birds without a mate have been seen sharing a territory with a mated pair . 
 This sparrow is awkward in flight and primarily uses running and hopping to move . The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow will at times forage in pairs during the breeding season , and in family @-@ sized flocks in late summer and early autumn . During the winter they can occasionally be found in loose mixed @-@ species foraging flocks . 
 Predators of adult sparrows include house cats and small raptors like Cooper 's and sharp @-@ shinned hawks , American kestrels , and white @-@ tailed kites . The nests may be raided by a range of species including mammals and reptiles such as snakes , though nest predation has not yet been directly observed , and nesting sparrows have been observed using three kinds of displays to distract potential predators ; the rodent run , the broken wing , and the tumbling off the bush . Birds adopt a rodent run display to distract predators . The head , neck and tail are lowered , wings held out , and feathers fluffed as the bird runs rapidly and voices a continuous alarm call . In the broken wing display , the sparrow imitates having a broken wing by dropping one to the ground and hopping away from the nest with one wing dragging , leading the predator away until the bird ceases the act and escapes the predator . The adult rufous @-@ crowned sparrow distracts a nest predator by falling from the top of a bush to attract the predator to itself in the tumbling off the bush display . 
 The longest lifespan recorded for a rufous @-@ crowned sparrow is three years , two months . Two species of tick , Amblyomma americanum and Ixodes pacificus , are known to parasitize the sparrow . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 This sparrow feeds primarily on small grass and forb seeds , fresh grass stems , and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter . During these seasons , insects such as ants , grasshoppers , ground beetles , and scale insects as well as spiders make up a small part of its diet . In the spring and summer , the bird 's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects . 
 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow forages slowly on or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses . Though it occasionally forages in weedy areas , it is almost never observed foraging in the open . It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs . During the breeding season , it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs . However , normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter . This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area . 
 It is unknown whether this species obtains all of the water it needs from its food or if it must also drink ; however , it has been observed both drinking and bathing in pools of water after rain storms . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow breeds in sparsely vegetated scrubland . Males attract a mate by singing from regular positions at the edge of their territories throughout the breeding season . These birds are monogamous , taking only one mate at a time , and pairs often remain together for several years . If singing males come within contact of each other , they may initially raise their crowns and face the ground to display this feature ; if that fails to make the other bird leave , they stiffen their body , droop their wings , raise their tails , and stick their head straight out . Males guard their territories year @-@ round . 
 While it is not known when precisely the breeding season starts , the earliest that a sparrow has been observed carrying nesting material was on March 2 in southern California . The female bird builds a bulky , thick @-@ walled open @-@ cup nest typically on the ground , though occasionally in a low bush up to 18 in ( 46 cm ) above it , from dried grasses and rootlets , sometimes with strips of bark , small twigs , and weed stems . Nests are well hidden , as they are built near bushes or tall grasses or overhanging rock with concealing vegetation . Once a sparrow chooses a nesting site , it tends to return to the site for many years . It lays between two and five eggs at a time and typically only raises one brood a year , though some birds in California have been observed raising two or even three broods a year . In case of a nesting failure , replacement clutches may be laid . The eggs are an unmarked , pale bluish @-@ white . Broods of the rufous @-@ crowned sparrow have very occasionally been observed to be parasitized by the brown @-@ headed cowbird . 
 Incubation of the eggs lasts 11 to 13 days and is performed solely by the female . The hatchlings are naked and quills do not begin to show until the third day . Only females brood the nestlings , though both parents may bring whole insects to their young . When a young rufous @-@ crowned sparrow leaves the nest after eight or nine days , it is still incapable of flight , though it can run through the underbrush ; during this time it is still fed by the parents . Juveniles tend to leave their parent 's territory and move into adjacent habitat in autumn or early winter . Reproductive success varies strongly with annual rainfall and is highest in wet El Niño years , since cool rainy weather reduces the activity of snakes , the main predator of the sparrow 's nests . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The rufous @-@ crowned sparrow is treated as a species of least concern , or not threatened with extinction , by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about 463 @,@ 323 sq mi ( 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 km2 ) , estimated population of 2 @.@ 4 million individuals , and lack of a 30 % population decline over the last ten years . In years without sufficient rains , many birds fail to breed and those that do produce fewer offspring . Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number . The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases : A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct , and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California 's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s . Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region . Additionally , the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin , though more research is needed to determine the effects of pesticides on the rufous @-@ crowned sparrow . 
 = The Penelopiad = 
 The Penelopiad is a novella by Margaret Atwood . It was published in 2005 as part of the first set of books in the Canongate Myth Series where contemporary authors rewrite ancient myths . In The Penelopiad , Penelope reminisces on the events during the Odyssey , life in Hades , Odysseus , Helen , and her relationships with her parents . A chorus of the twelve maids , whom Odysseus believed were disloyal and whom Telemachus hanged , interrupt Penelope 's narrative to express their view on events . The maids ' interludes use a new genre each time , including a jump @-@ rope rhyme , a lament , an idyll , a ballad , a lecture , a court trial and several types of songs . 
 The novella 's central themes include the effects of story @-@ telling perspectives , double standards between the sexes and the classes , and the fairness of justice . Atwood had previously used characters and storylines from Greek mythology in fiction such as her novel The Robber Bride , short story The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions and poems " Circe : Mud Poems " and " Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing " but used Robert Graves ' The Greek Myths and E. V. Rieu and D. C. H. Rieu 's version of the Odyssey to prepare for this novella . 
 The book was translated into 28 languages and released simultaneously around the world by 33 publishers . In the Canadian market , it peaked on the best seller lists at number one in Maclean 's and number two in The Globe and Mail , but did not place on the New York Times Best Seller List in the American market . Some critics found the writing to be typical of Atwood or even one of her finest works , while others found some aspects , like the chorus of maids , disagreeable . 
 A theatrical version was co @-@ produced by the Canadian National Arts Centre and the British Royal Shakespeare Company . The play was performed at the Swan Theatre in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon and the National Arts Centre in Ottawa during the summer and fall of 2007 by an all @-@ female cast led by director Josette Bushell @-@ Mingo . In the winter season 2011 / 2012 , the show will be given its professional Toronto premiere by Nightwood Theatre , with an all @-@ female cast led by director Kelly Thornton and starring Megan Follows as Penelope . 
 = = Background = = 
 Publisher Jamie Byng of Canongate Books solicited author Margaret Atwood to write a novella re @-@ telling a classic myth of her choice . Byng explained it would be published simultaneously in several languages as part of an international project called the Canongate Myth Series . Atwood agreed to help the rising young publisher by participating in the project . From her home in Toronto , the 64 @-@ year @-@ old author made attempts at writing the Norse creation myth and a Native American story but struggled . After speaking with her British literary agent about canceling her contract , Atwood began thinking about the Odyssey . She had first read it as a teenager and remembered finding the imagery of Penelope 's twelve maids being hanged in the denouement disturbing . Atwood believed the roles of Penelope and her maids during Odysseus ' absence had been a largely neglected scholarly topic and that she could help address it with this project . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The novel recaps Penelope 's life in hindsight from 21st century Hades ; she recalls her family life in Sparta , her marriage to Odysseus , her dealing with suitors during his absence , and the aftermath of Odysseus ' return . The relationship with her parents was challenging : her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her , and her mother was absent @-@ minded and negligent . At fifteen , Penelope married Odysseus , who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her . Penelope was happy with him , even though he was mocked behind his back by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home , Ithaca . The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband 's kingdom . In Ithaca , neither Odysseus ' mother <unk> , nor his nurse Eurycleia , liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly , but often patronising . Shortly after the birth of their son , Telemachus , Odysseus was called to war , leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone . News of the war and rumours of Odysseus ' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope . Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her , she stalled them . The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom 's resources . She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father @-@ in @-@ law 's shroud . She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors . Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise . Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity . After the suitors were massacred , Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them . Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept . Afterwards , Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart , but on the issue of the maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors . 
 During her narrative , Penelope expresses opinions on several people , addresses historical misconceptions , and comments on life in Hades . She is most critical of Helen whom Penelope blames for ruining her life . Penelope identifies Odysseus ' specialty as making people look like fools and wonders why his stories have survived so long , despite being an admitted liar . She dispels the rumour that she slept with <unk> and the rumour that she slept with all the suitors and consequently gave birth to Pan . 
 Between chapters in which Penelope is narrating , the twelve maids speak on topics from their point @-@ of @-@ view . They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime , sing of freedom , and dream of being princesses . They contrast their lives to Telemachus ' and wonder if they would have killed him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man . They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die . In Hades , they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus . 
 = = Style = = 
 The novella is divided into 29 chapters with introduction , notes , and acknowledgments sections . Structured similarly to a classical Greek drama , the storytelling alternates between Penelope 's narrative and the choral commentary of the twelve maids . Penelope narrates 18 chapters with the Chorus contributing 11 chapters dispersed throughout the book . The Chorus uses a new narrative style in each of their chapters , beginning with a jump @-@ rope rhyme and ending in a 17 @-@ line iambic <unk> poem . Other narrative styles used by the Chorus include a lament , a folk song , an idyll , a sea shanty , a ballad , a drama , an anthropology lecture , a court trial , and a love song . 
 Penelope 's story uses simple and deliberately naive prose . The tone is described as casual , wandering , and street @-@ wise with Atwood 's dry humour and characteristic bittersweet and melancholic feminist voice . The book uses the first @-@ person narrative , though Penelope sometimes addresses the reader through the second person pronoun . One reviewer noted that Penelope is portrayed as " an intelligent woman who knows better than to exhibit her intelligence " . Because she contrasts past events as they occurred from her perspective with the elaborations of Odysseus and with what is recorded in myths today , she is described as a metafictional narrator . 
 = = Major themes = = 
 = = = Perspectives = = = 
 The novella illustrates the differences perspectives can make . The stories told in the Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus , and Odysseus to a <unk> court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses . According to Penelope in The Penelopiad Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one @-@ eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops . Homer portrays Penelope as loyal , patient , and the ideal wife , as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy . In The Penelopiad , Penelope feels compelled to tell her story because she is unsatisfied with Homer 's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan . She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive . The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors . From the maids ' perspective , they were innocent victims , used by Penelope to spy , raped and abused by the suitors , and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus . Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view . 
 = = = Feminism and double standards = = = 
 The book has been called " feminist " , and more specifically " vintage Atwood @-@ feminist " , but Atwood disagrees , saying , " I wouldn 't even call it feminist . Every time you write something from the point of view of a woman , people say that it 's feminist . " The Penelopiad 's antagonistic relationship between Penelope and Helen is similar to the relationships of women in Atwood 's previous novels : Elaine and Cordelia in Cat 's Eye , and Iris and Laura in The Blind Assassin , and follows Atwood 's doubt of an amicable universal sisterhood . The story does endorse some feminist reassessments of the Odyssey , like Penelope recognizing Odysseus while disguised and that the geese slaughtered by the eagle in Penelope 's dream were her maids and not the suitors . Using the maids ' lecture on anthropology , Atwood satirizes Robert Graves ' theory of a matriarchal lunar cult in Greek myth . The lecture makes a series of connections , concluding that the rape and execution of the maids by men represent the overthrow of the matriarchal society in favor of patriarchy . The lecture ends with lines from anthropologist Claude Lévi @-@ Strauss ' Elementary Structures of Kinship : " Consider us pure symbol . We 're no more real than money . " 
 Double standards between genders and classes are exposed throughout the novella . Odysseus commits adultery with Circe while expecting Penelope to remain loyal to him . The maids ' relations with the suitors are seen as treasonous and earn them an execution . Penelope condemns Helen for her involvement in getting men killed at Troy . At the same time , Penelope excuses her involvement in getting the maids killed even though , as Atwood reveals , Penelope enlisted the maids to spy on the suitors and even encouraged them to continue after some were raped . 
 = = = Narrative justice = = = 
 Penelope 's story is an attempt at narrative justice to <unk> Helen for her erroneously idealised image in the Odyssey as the archetypal female . Penelope acts like a judicial arbiter , a position she held in Ithaca as the head of state and , during Odysseus ' absence , as head of the household . The ancient form of justice and punishment , which was swift and simple due to the lack of courts , prisons , and currency , is tempered by more modern concepts of balanced distributions of social benefits and burdens . Penelope 's chosen form of punishment for Helen is to correct the historical records with her own bias by portraying her as vain and superficial , as someone who measures her worth by the number of men who died fighting for her . 
 The maids also deliver their version of narrative justice on Odysseus and Telemachus , who ordered and carried out their execution , and on Penelope who was complicit in their killing . The maids do not have the same sanctioned voice as Penelope and are relegated to <unk> genres , though their persistence eventually leads to more valued cultural forms . Their testimony , contrasted with Penelope 's excuses while condemning Helen , demonstrates the tendency of judicial processes to not act upon the whole truth . When compared with the historical record , dominated by the stories in the Odyssey , the conclusion , as one academic states , is that the concepts of justice and penalties are established by " who has the power to say who is punished , whose ideas count " , and that " justice is underwritten by social inequalities and inequitable power dynamics " . 
 = = Influences = = 
 Atwood 's use of myths follows archetypal literary criticism and specifically the work of Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism . According to this literary theory , contemporary works are not independent but are part of an underlying pattern that re @-@ invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning . In The Penelopiad , Atwood re @-@ writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres . 
 The edition of the Odyssey that Atwood read was the E. V. Rieu and D. C. H. Rieu 's translation . For research she consulted Robert Graves ' The Greek Myths . Graves , an adherent to Samuel Butler 's theory that the Odyssey was written by a woman , also wrote The White Goddess which formed the basis of the Maid 's anthropology lecture . 
 Atwood had previously written using themes and characters from ancient Greek myths . She wrote a short story in Ovid <unk> called The Elysium Lifestyle Mansions re @-@ telling a myth with Apollo and the immortal prophet the Sibyl from the perspective of the latter living in the modern age . Her 1993 novel The Robber Bride roughly parallels the Iliad but is set in Toronto . In that novel the characters Tony and <unk> share the same animosity and competition as Penelope and Helen in The Penelopiad . Her poem " Circe : Mud Poems " , published in 1976 , casts doubt on Penelope 's honourable image : 
 She 's up to something , she 's weaving 
 histories , they are never right , 
 she has to do them over , 
 she is weaving her version [ ... ] 
 Atwood published " Helen of Troy Does Counter Dancing " in her 1996 collection Morning in the Burned House in which Helen appears in a contemporary setting as an erotic dancer and justifies her exploitation as men fantasize over her : 
 You think I 'm not a goddess ? 
 Try me . 
 This is a torch song . 
 Touch me and you 'll burn .

 Some reviewers like Christopher Tayler and David <unk> , both writing for The Daily Telegraph , praised the book as " enjoyable [ and ] intelligent " with " Atwood at her finest " . Robert Wiersema echoed that sentiment , adding that the book shows Atwood as " fierce and ambitious , clever and thoughtful " . The review in the National Post called the book " a brilliant tour de force " . Specifically singled out as being good are the book 's wit , rhythm , structure , and story . Mary Beard found the book to be " brilliant " except for the chapter entitled " An Anthropology Lecture " which she called " complete rubbish " . Others criticised the book as being " merely a riff on a better story that comes dangerously close to being a spoof " and saying it " does not fare well [ as a ] colloquial feminist retelling " . Specifically , the scenes with the chorus of maidservants are said to be " mere outlines of characters " with Elizabeth Hand writing in The Washington Post that they have " the air of a failed Monty Python sketch " . In the journal English Studies , Odin <unk> and L. R. Leavis described the book as " a piece of deliberate self @-@ indulgence " , that it reads like an " over @-@ the @-@ top W. S.

 Following a successful dramatic reading directed by Phyllida Lloyd at St James 's Church , Piccadilly on 26 October 2005 , Atwood finished a draft theatrical script . The Canadian National Arts Centre and the British Royal Shakespeare Company expressed interest and both agreed to co @-@ produce . Funding was raised mostly from nine Canadian women , dubbed the " Penelope Circle " , who each donated CAD $ 50 @,@ 000 to the National Arts Centre . An all @-@ female cast was selected consisting of seven Canadian and six British actors , with Josette Bushell @-@ Mingo directing and Veronica Tennant as the choreographer . For music a trio , consisting of percussions , keyboard , and cello , were positioned above the stage . They assembled in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon and rehearsed in June and July 2007 . The 100 @-@ minute play was staged at the Swan Theatre between 27 July and 18 August at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa between 17 September and 6 October . Atwood 's script gave little stage direction allowing Bushell @-@ Mingo to develop the action . Critics in both countries lauded Penny Downie 's performance as Penelope , but found the play had too much narration of story rather than dramatisation . Adjustments made between productions resulted in the Canadian performance having emotional depth that was lacking in Bushell @-@ Mingo 's direction of the twelve maids . The play subsequently had runs in Vancouver at the Stanley Industrial Alliance Stage between October 26 and November 20 , 2011 , and in Toronto , produced by the Nightwood Theatre and staged at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre between January 10 – 29 , 2012 . The Nightwood Theatre show was directed by Kelly Thornton with choreography by Monica <unk> and starring Megan Follows . A review in The Globe and Mail gave the play 3 @.@ 5 of 4 stars .
