 In addition to humans , three primarily terrestrial mammalian species inhabit the archipelago : the Arctic fox , the Svalbard reindeer , and accidentally introduced southern voles , which are found only in Grumant . Attempts to introduce the Arctic hare and the muskox have both failed . There are fifteen to twenty types of marine mammals , including whales , dolphins , seals , walruses , and polar bears . 
 Polar bears are the iconic symbol of Svalbard , and one of the main tourist attractions . While protected , anyone outside of settlements is recommended to carry a firearm to kill polar bears in self @-@ defence , as a last resort , should they attack , and is required to have appropriate means of frightening and chasing off polar bears ; a British schoolboy was killed by a polar bear in 2011 . Svalbard and Franz Joseph Land share a common population of 3 @,@ 000 polar bears , with Kong Karls Land being the most important breeding ground . 
 The Svalbard reindeer ( R. <unk> platyrhynchus ) is a distinct sub @-@ species ; although it was previously almost extinct , it can be legally hunted ( as can Arctic fox ) . There are limited numbers of domesticated animals in the Russian settlements . 
 About thirty species of bird are found on Svalbard , most of which are migratory . The Barents Sea is among the areas in the world with most seabirds , with about 20 million individuals during late summer . The most common are little auk , northern fulmar , thick @-@ billed murre and black @-@ legged kittiwake . Sixteen species are on the IUCN Red List . Particularly Bjørnøya , <unk> , <unk> @-@ Spitsbergen and Hopen are important breeding ground for seabirds . The Arctic tern has the furthest migration , all the way to Antarctica . Only two songbirds migrate to Svalbard to breed : the snow bunting and the wheatear . Rock ptarmigan is the only bird to overwinter . Remains of Predator X from the Jurassic period have been found ; it is the largest dinosaur @-@ era marine reptile ever found — a pliosaur estimated to have been almost 15 m ( 49 ft ) long . 
 Svalbard has permafrost and tundra , with both low , middle and high Arctic vegetation . 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago . Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations , which accounts for about 10 % of the archipelago . Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land , around Isfjorden and where affected by guano . While there is little precipitation , giving the archipelago a steppe climate , plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation . The growing season is very short , and may last only a few weeks . 
 There are seven national parks in Svalbard : <unk> , Indre Wijdefjorden , Nordenskiöld Land , Nordre Isfjorden Land , <unk> @-@ Spitsbergen , Sassen @-@ <unk> Land and Sør @-@ Spitsbergen . The archipelago has fifteen bird sanctuaries , one <unk> protected area and six nature reserves — with <unk> @-@ Svalbard and <unk> @-@ Svalbard both being larger than any of the national parks . Most of the nature reserves and three of the national parks were protected in 1973 , with nearly all the remaining protected occurring in the 2000s . All human traces dating from before 1946 are automatically protected . The protected areas make up 65 % of the archipelago . Svalbard is on Norway 's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 The total Solar eclipse of March 20 , 2015 included only Svalbard and the Faroe Islands in the band of totality . Many scientists and tourists attended .

 Svalbard makes a prominent appearance in Northern Lights by Philip Pullman and the corresponding movie . In the novel it is used as a prison for important and powerful people . It is inhabited by <unk> , mighty polar bears that wear armor forged from Sky @-@ Iron . One of the primary characters , Lord Asriel , was imprisoned and manages to flee from Svalbard during the novel . 
 The fictional town of Fortitude , as portrayed in the 2015 TV series Fortitude ( from UK 's Sky Atlantic ) , is situated in Svalbard . 
 In 2014 the Swedish singer Tove <unk> filmed a music video in Pyramiden for her single Borderline . 
 = Meitnerium = 
 Meitnerium is a chemical element with symbol Mt and atomic number 109 . It is an extremely radioactive synthetic element ( an element not found in nature that can be created in a laboratory ) . The most stable known isotope , meitnerium @-@ 278 , has a half @-@ life of 7 @.@ 6 seconds . The GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt , Germany , first created this element in 1982 . It is named for Lise Meitner . 
 In the periodic table , meitnerium is a d @-@ block transactinide element . It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 9 elements , although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to iridium in group 9 . Meitnerium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues , cobalt , rhodium , and iridium . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Meitnerium was first synthesized on August 29 , 1982 by a German research team led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg at the Institute for Heavy Ion Research ( Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung ) in Darmstadt . The team bombarded a target of bismuth @-@ 209 with accelerated nuclei of iron @-@ 58 and detected a single atom of the isotope meitnerium @-@ 266 : 
 209 
 83Bi + 58 
 <unk> → 266 
 <unk> + n 
 This work was confirmed three years later at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna ( then in the Soviet Union ) . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Using Mendeleev 's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements , meitnerium should be known as eka @-@ iridium . In 1979 , during the Transfermium Wars ( but before the synthesis of meitnerium ) , IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <unk> ( with the corresponding symbol of Une ) , a systematic element name as a placeholder , until the element was discovered ( and the discovery then confirmed ) and a permanent name was decided on . Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels , from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks , the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field , who either called it " element 109 " , with the symbol of ( 109 ) or even simply 109 , or used the proposed name " meitnerium " . 
 The naming of meitnerium was discussed in the element naming controversy regarding the names of elements 104 to 109 , but meitnerium was the only proposal and thus was never disputed . The name meitnerium ( Mt ) was suggested in honor of the Austrian physicist Lise Meitner , a co @-@ discoverer of protactinium ( with Otto Hahn ) , and one of the discoverers of nuclear fission . In 1994 the name was recommended by IUPAC , and was officially adopted in 1997 . It is thus the only element named specifically after a non @-@ mythological woman ( curium being named for both Pierre and Marie Curie ) . 
 = = Isotopes = = 
 Meitnerium has no stable or naturally @-@ occurring isotopes . Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory , either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements . Eight different isotopes of meitnerium have been reported with atomic masses 266 , 268 , 270 , and 274 – 278 , two of which , meitnerium @-@ 268 and meitnerium @-@ 270 , have known but unconfirmed metastable states . Most of these decay predominantly through alpha decay , although some undergo spontaneous fission . 
 = = = Stability and half @-@ lives = = = 
 All meitnerium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive ; in general , heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter . The most stable known meitnerium isotope , <unk> , is also the heaviest known ; it has a half @-@ life of 7 @.@ 6 seconds . A metastable nuclear isomer , <unk> , has been reported to also have a half @-@ life of over a second . The isotopes <unk> and <unk> have half @-@ lives of 0 @.@ 72 and 0 @.@ 44 seconds respectively . The remaining four isotopes have half @-@ lives between 1 and 20 milliseconds . The undiscovered isotope <unk> has been predicted to be the most stable towards beta decay ; no known meitnerium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay . Some unknown isotopes , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , are predicted to have half @-@ lives longer than the known isotopes . Before its discovery , <unk> and <unk> were predicted to have half @-@ lives of 20 seconds and 1 minute respectively , but they were later found to have half @-@ lives of only 0 @.@ 44 seconds and 5 milliseconds respectively . 
 = = Predicted properties = = 
 = = = Chemical = = = 
 Meitnerium is the seventh member of the 6d series of transition metals . Since element 112 ( copernicium ) has been shown to be a transition metal , it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series , with meitnerium as part of the platinum group metals . Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue iridium , thus implying that meitnerium 's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 9 elements , cobalt , rhodium , and iridium . 
 Prediction of the probable chemical properties of meitnerium has not received much attention recently . Meitnerium is expected to be a noble metal . Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 9 elements , the most stable oxidation states of meitnerium are predicted to be the + 6 , + 3 , and + 1 states , with the + 3 state being the most stable in aqueous solutions . In comparison , rhodium and iridium show a maximum oxidation state of + 6 , while the most stable states are + 4 and + 3 for iridium and + 3 for rhodium . The oxidation state + 9 , represented only by iridium in [ <unk> ] + , might be possible for its congener meitnerium in the <unk> ( <unk> ) and the [ <unk> ] + cation , although [ <unk> ] + is expected to be more stable . The tetrahalides of meitnerium have also been predicted to have similar stabilities to those of iridium , thus also allowing a stable + 4 state . It is further expected that the maximum oxidation states of elements from bohrium ( element 107 ) to darmstadtium ( element 110 ) may be stable in the gas phase but not in aqueous solution . 
 = = = Physical and atomic = = = 
 Meitnerium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a face @-@ centered cubic crystal structure , similarly to its lighter congener iridium . It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37 @.@ 4 g / cm3 , which would be the second @-@ highest of any of the 118 known elements , second only to that predicted for its neighbor hassium ( 41 g / cm3 ) . In comparison , the densest known element that has had its density measured , osmium , has a density of only 22 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This results from meitnerium 's high atomic weight , the lanthanide and actinide contractions , and relativistic effects , although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical , and the sample would quickly decay . Meitnerium is also predicted to be paramagnetic . 
 <unk> have predicted the covalent radius of meitnerium to be 6 to 10 pm larger than that of iridium . For example , the Mt – O bond distance is expected to be around 1 @.@ 9 Å . The atomic radius of meitnerium is expected to be around 128 pm . 
 = = Experimental chemistry = = 
 Unambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of meitnerium has yet to have been established due to the short half @-@ lives of meitnerium isotopes and a limited number of likely volatile compounds that could be studied on a very small scale . One of the few meitnerium compounds that are likely to be sufficiently volatile is meitnerium hexafluoride ( <unk> 
 6 ) , as its lighter homologue iridium hexafluoride ( IrF 
 6 ) is volatile above 60 ° C and therefore the analogous compound of meitnerium might also be sufficiently volatile ; a volatile <unk> ( <unk> 
 8 ) might also be possible . For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide , at least four atoms must be produced , the half @-@ life of the isotope used must be at least 1 second , and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week . Even though the half @-@ life of <unk> , the most stable known meitnerium isotope , is 7 @.@ 6 seconds , long enough to perform chemical studies , another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of meitnerium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained . Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the meitnerium isotopes and automated systems can then experiment on the gas @-@ phase and solution chemistry of meitnerium as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements ; some of the separation techniques used for bohrium and hassium could be reused . However , the experimental chemistry of meitnerium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium . 
 The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory attempted to synthesize the isotope <unk> in 2002 – 2003 for a possible chemical investigation of meitnerium because it was expected that it might be more stable than the isotopes around it as it has 162 neutrons , a magic number for deformed nuclei ; its half @-@ life was predicted to be a few seconds , long enough for a chemical investigation . However , no atoms of <unk> were detected , and this isotope of meitnerium is currently unknown . 
 An experiment determining the chemical properties of a transactinide would need to compare a compound of that transactinide with analogous compounds of some of its lighter homologues : for example , in the chemical characterization of hassium , hassium tetroxide ( HsO4 ) was compared with the analogous osmium compound , osmium tetroxide ( OsO4 ) . In a preliminary step towards determining the chemical properties of meitnerium , the GSI attempted sublimation of the rhodium compounds rhodium ( III ) oxide ( <unk> ) and rhodium ( III ) chloride ( <unk> ) . However , macroscopic amounts of the oxide would not sublimate until 1000 ° C and the chloride would not until 780 ° C , and then only in the presence of carbon aerosol particles : these temperatures are far too high for such procedures to be used on meitnerium , as most of the current methods used for the investigation of the chemistry of superheavy elements do not work above 500 ° C.

 James Patrick Seerey ( March 17 , 1923 – April 28 , 1986 ) was an American professional baseball player . An outfielder , Seerey played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for seven seasons in the American League with the Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox . In 561 career games , Seerey recorded a batting average of .224 and accumulated 86 home runs and 261 runs batted in ( RBI ) . 
 Born in Oklahoma and raised in Arkansas , Seerey played football and baseball in high school . After graduating , he joined the Cleveland Indians ' farm system in 1941 , and made his major league debut two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years later . He was primary a starting outfielder the next five seasons for the Indians , but led the league in strikeouts four times . He was traded partway through the 1948 season to the Chicago White Sox , and a month after being traded became one of 16 MLB players to hit four home runs in one game . The following season , he was sent to the minor leagues , and played a few seasons in the farm system for the White Sox before retiring . 
 = = Early life and minor leagues = = 
 Pat Seerey was born in <unk> , Oklahoma in 1923 to James and Marie Seerey . His family moved to Little Rock , Arkansas when he was a child , and he played baseball for the Little Rock Boys ' Club at Lamar Porter Field . He attended Little Rock Catholic High School , where he played baseball and American football , serving as the team 's starting fullback . After graduating from high school in 1941 , he was signed by the Cleveland Indians . Shortly afterwards , he was classified as 4 @-@ F , meaning he would not be lost to the military during World War II . 
 Seerey started his minor league baseball career in 1941 with the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League . In one of his first appearances for the team , he hit for the cycle in a 15 – 4 victory against the Fond du Lac Panthers . In 104 games for Appleton that year , Seerey had a .330 batting average with 31 home runs and 117 runs batted in ; the 31 home runs were a record for the Wisconsin State League at the time . The following season , Seerey played for the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Three @-@ I League . In 117 games for the Raiders , he had a .303 batting average and 33 home runs . In 1943 , Seerey was promoted to the Wilkes @-@ Barre Barons of the Eastern League , and played in 31 games over the first two months of the season . In early June , outfielder Hank Edwards broke his collarbone , and the Indians needed an extra outfielder on the roster ; Seerey was promoted as a result . 
 = = Cleveland Indians = = 
 Seerey made his debut with the Indians on June 9 , 1943 . Almost immediately after his debut , he earned the nickname of " people 's choice " in media due to both his hitting ability and his " willingness to challenge the brick walls of the stadium " . He played in 26 games for the Indians on the season , and hit .222 in 72 at @-@ bats . Entering the 1944 Cleveland Indians season , manager Lou Boudreau planned to use Seerey as the starting center fielder , as he had reported to spring training 25 pounds lighter and Boudreau felt that Seerey could improve on a weak area on the team 's roster . Seerey moved back to left field to begin the season ; in his first game there on the year , he hit a three @-@ run home run to give the Indians a 7 – 4 victory over the Detroit Tigers . A month into the season , Seerey was among the league leaders in runs batted in , which was attributed to better plate discipline , though his fielding in the outfield was still considered a liability . Partway through the season , Seerey 's playing time diminished , yet he remained the team leader in home runs for most of the season despite limited at @-@ bats . He finished the season with 15 home runs , 39 runs batted in , and a league @-@ leading 99 strikeouts in 101 games . 
 Entering the 1945 Cleveland Indians season , Seerey was re @-@ classified as 1 @-@ A , and took a military examination during the offseason . He was not slated to join the military after the exam , and the season started with him on the roster as one of the team 's starting three outfielders , thanks in part to getting in shape after a strict diet during the offseason . He started off with hits in the first seven games of the season . A month into the season , Seerey hit his first two home runs of the season in a 7 – 3 loss to the New York Yankees . He followed that up in a mid @-@ July game against the Yankees with three home runs and eight runs batted in , becoming the fourth Indians player to hit three home runs in a game in a 16 – 4 Indians win . He spent the second half of the season in and out of the starting lineup due to his inconsistent hitting ; manager Boudreau felt that occasional rest days would increase his consistency . In a career @-@ high 126 games , Seerey hit .236 with 14 home runs and 97 strikeouts , which again led the league . 
 After getting married in early 1946 to Jeanne Dillinger , Seerey started the 1946 Cleveland Indians season working with Boudreau to fix his hitting , as his lunge when he swung the bat was causing him to strike out too often and not hit enough home runs . The change worked , as by the start of July Seerey had a team @-@ leading 11 home runs . His second half performance included a doubleheader against the Chicago White Sox where he hit a home run in each game ; the second home run landed in the upper deck of Cleveland Municipal Stadium , a feat that at the time had only been matched by fellow Indians outfielder Jeff Heath . He finished the season with a .225 batting average , 26 home runs , 62 RBIs , and 101 strikeouts . The 26 home runs were fourth in the league , and for the third straight year Seerey led the league in strikeouts . 
 Indians catcher Jim Hegan and Seerey spent the offseason improving their hitting , attending batting school led by Hall of Famer Rogers Hornsby ; Hornsby concentrated primarily on improving Seerey 's timing to help him to hit the ball more frequently . In spring training games , Seerey had nine home runs , and expectations were high for him ; Boudreau gave him the starting job in left field for the opener against the White Sox . Through the first month of the season , Seerey had six home runs , but his performance worsened as the season went on . At the end of June , Seerey was removed from the starting lineup and replaced by both Dale Mitchell and Hank Edwards ; he spent the rest of the season playing part @-@ time . He finished the season with a <unk> batting average and 11 home runs in 82 games . 
 After the 1947 season ended , Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on a strict diet and exercise regimen for the offseason , stating that he had to lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team . By the start of spring training , he had reached his goal of 195 pounds , and felt like he had an easier time swinging the baseball bat as a result . After a good month of spring training , Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season , saying that " he 'll be in there until he stops hitting . " Shortly afterwards , Seerey was removed from the starting lineup , and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded . On June 2 , Seerey was traded with Al <unk> to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster . 
 = = Chicago White Sox and later life = = 
 Seerey was named the starting left fielder upon joining the White Sox , a position he held the rest of the season . Through his first 12 games , Seerey had 16 RBIs . On July 18 , Seerey made history , becoming the fifth player to hit four home runs in one game , doing so in an 11 @-@ inning , 12 – 11 win over the Philadelphia Athletics . Seerey homered in three successive innings ( fourth through sixth ) , hitting his first two off starting pitcher Carl Scheib and the third off reliever Bob Savage . His fourth home run , in the 11th off Lou <unk> , gave the White Sox the win . On that day , Seerey went 4 @-@ for @-@ 6 with seven runs batted in . In 105 games , 95 with the White Sox , Seerey had a .231 batting average , 19 home runs , 70 RBIs , and 102 strikeouts ; he led the league in strikeouts for the fourth time . 
 The White Sox brought on new manager Jack Onslow to begin the 1949 Chicago White Sox season . He had a problem with Seerey , who arrived overweight to spring training , and did not consider him worthy of practicing with the other players until he got the weight back down . After playing in four games for the Sox , his last coming on May 7 , Seerey was sent to the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League , ending his major league career . He played for four minor league teams in 1949 : Los Angeles , the Newark Bears , the Kansas City Blues , and the San Antonio Missions . 
 Seerey spent 1950 with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Western League . Partway through the season , he broke the league 's home run record of 30 , and went on to hit 44 for the Sky Sox over the course of the season . He then finished the season with the Memphis Chickasaws , playing 136 total games with both teams . Seerey split most of the 1951 season between Memphis and Colorado Springs . In one game with the Sky Sox in June , Seerey had two grand slams and nine RBIs in a game , both league records at the time . He ended the season with the Tampa Smokers , and had 28 home runs in 113 between the three teams . 
 In 1952 , Seerey joined a semi @-@ professional baseball team in Guelph , Ontario . With them , he had 11 home runs and a .253 batting average , and retired at season 's end . The 11 home runs were the highest in the league that season . After retiring , Seerey became a janitor in the St. Louis public school system . He died in Jennings , Missouri on April 28 , 1986 at the age of 63 .

 Free Collars Kingdom ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> Kingudamu ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Fujima Takuya . The individual chapters were serialized in Magazine Z , and compiled into three tankōbon volumes released by Kodansha from February 2003 to March 2004 . Set in Ikebukuro , Japan , the series revolves around the struggle of two stray cat groups . Cyan , a young newly abandoned cat , joins one of them , the Free Collars . Each cat has two appearances ; to humans , they appear as normal cats , but to other cats , they appear as <unk> and <unk> . Each cat has their own attack , and some carry weapons . 
 While drawing the series , Fujima changed his art style from one used previously , though he was asked to use his original styling . He also noted that the series was different from his other works , and was unsure of how the audience would respond to it . Free Collars Kingdom is licensed for English language release in the United States by Del Rey , which released the series in 2007 , and in the United Kingdom by Tanoshimi , which released it in 2008 . It was licensed for regional release by Tong Li Publishing in Taiwan , Jonesky in Hong Kong , and Star Comics in Italy . Free Collars Kingdom garnered mixed reviews from critics . The series was praised for its artwork and humor , but criticized for its plot and characters .

 Cyan is a young Abyssinian cat who lives with a boy named Kokoro and his parents in Ikebukuro . When Kokoro becomes sick , his parents abandon Cyan , leaving him in the basement of their apartment complex . Soon he discovers a group of stray cats called the " Free Collars " , who control East Ikebukuro and believe that collars hold down cats ' " Wild Spirit " . Cyan is given the opportunity to join , provided that he removes his collar , the symbol that he is still Kokoro 's pet . Cyan declines , opting to remain in the basement and await Kokoro 's return . However , Cyan comes to realize that he must join the Free Collars if he hopes to survive and reunite with Kokoro . He removes his collar and joins them in their fight against Siam , a rival gang leader who wants control of East Ikebukuro and plans to rule the world and enslave humans . 
 In his ensuing adventures , Cyan grows close to the Free Collars , yet still longs for Kokoro . He becomes frustrated by Siam 's continued advances on East Ikebukuro and his teammates ' unwillingness to mount an offensive attack . Convinced that Siam must be destroyed , Cyan confronts her and learns she was once a Free Collar until her brother , <unk> , was chased onto a road by humans and killed by a bus . Cyan is able to defeat her , and , reminded of <unk> , Siam silently wishes him farewell . Soon after , Cyan learns that Kokoro had recovered but is moving away . Saddened by the thought of leaving the Free Collars , he meets Kokoro at the train station and gives him his torn collar as a memento . Kokoro promises to visit Cyan , and Cyan returns to his new friends .

 Fujima had originally been asked to draw Free Collars Kingdom in a style he had used previously on other works . However , his drawing style evolved during the development of Free Collars Kingdom . 
 In the first volume of Free Collars Kingdom , Fujima expressed his feelings on the series ' release , while also stating that " it went to the press before I knew it " . Fujima noted that the series was " quite a bit different " compared to previous series he had worked on , and that he " had no idea how " the audience would respond to it . He explained that " if you have fun reading it , then I 'll be happy " . In volume two , due to having left @-@ over " open pages " , Fujima used the extra pages to " describe characters " and " have fun " .

 Free Collars Kingdom received mixed reviews from English @-@ speaking audiences . Matthew Alexander of Mania praised the artwork , noting that characters were " cute and sexy with a wide variety of clothing that does a good job expressing the character 's personality " and that , overall , the artwork was " very clean with attractive characters and well @-@ detailed backgrounds " . In his review of the second volume , Alexander wrote that " so far , the story continues to be a fun examination of what life might be like from the cat 's point of view , but I don 't know how the whole Wild Cat storyline is going to be wrapped up in only one more volume " . In his review of the third volume , Alexander felt that " the story probably received an early ending " , but concluded that " despite the series only being three volumes , it really is a worthy read and quite funny if you 've ever owned a cat " . 
 In reviewing the second volume , Manga Life 's Dan Polley felt " Fujima [ did ] a very good job of laying down the framework and executing a plot for fun and carefree adventures . " In his review of the third volume , Polley wrote that " the art is enjoyable , but can sometimes be overloaded " and that " often there are sequences in which there is too much going on and it is hard to decipher exactly what the eyes are seeing . " However , he noted that " fans of the series will continue to enjoy the animalistic cheekiness . " 
 Writing for School Library Journal , Benjamin Russell criticized the series for being " slow and formulaic " with " similarly formulaic " character designs that made " it seem staid " . He also stated that the " animal world " portrayed could be fun and that it was " interesting to see humanoid characters so tiny next to artifacts of human culture " , but it failed to hold the reader 's interest . Casey Brienza of Anime News Network heavily criticized the story , grading it as an " F " and calling it " a pastiche of a large number of manga and anime clichés , not because it seems like it was intended to be a pastiche , but because the manga artist [ Fujima ] flatly is unable to sustain a coherent , unified storyline that is his own , original creation . " However , Brienza did praise the artwork , grading it as an " A " and calling it rich and " beautifully drawn " .

 " Tim McGraw " is the debut single and first published song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . The song was written by Swift and Liz Rose , and produced by Nathan Chapman . It was released on June 19 , 2006 by Big Machine Records as Swift 's debut single and the lead single from Swift 's eponymous debut album . Swift wrote " Tim McGraw " during her freshman year of high school , knowing that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college . The song was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together , once he departed . " Tim McGraw " is musical interconnection of traditional and modern country music . Lyrically , the track lists items in order to associate a past relationship , one of them being country artist Tim McGraw 's music . 
 The song was received with critical praise from music critics who complimented Swift 's vocal delivery . Some critics described it as tender , while others admired its professionalism . " Tim McGraw " performed well commercially . The track spent numbers of weeks upon both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs in the United States . It peaked at number 40 on the former and number six on the latter . The single was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and has sold more than one million copies since its release . The accompanying music video for " Tim McGraw " , directed by Trey Fanjoy , comprises flashbacks by Swift 's love interest , among cut scenes that feature Swift lying on a lake bed . " Tim McGraw " was promoted by Swift on a radio tour and performances in numerous venues . Swift performed it while serving as opening act for various country artists ' concert tours . She also performed it as part of her first headlining concert tour , the Fearless Tour ( 2009 – 10 ) .

 Swift and Liz Rose wrote " Tim McGraw " during Swift 's freshman year at Hendersonville High School . She conceived the idea in the midst of her mathematics class : " I was just sitting there , and I started humming this melody . " She then related the melody to a predicament she was encountering at the moment . Swift knew that she and her senior boyfriend would break up at the end of the year when he left for college . In order to cope with the complicated emotions she was experiencing , Swift wrote the song . Rose said Swift showed up at her after school job , writing songs for Sony / ATV Music , " with the idea and the melody , knowing exactly what she wanted . " She desired for the song to capture the sweetness and sadness of loving and losing someone . It was written about all the different things that would remind the subject of Swift and their time spent together , once he departed . " To her surprise , the first thing that came to mind was [ her ] love of Tim McGraw 's music . " Several personal details were listed for the song . McGraw 's mentioning was a reference to Swift 's favorite song , " Can 't Tell Me Nothin " from his 2004 album Live Like You Were Dying , rather than McGraw as a person . The writing process , as with " Our Song " , took place in approximately twenty minutes , and was executed with the use of a piano . 
 Soon after , Scott Borchetta , CEO of Big Machine Records , signed Swift to his newly formed label . Early into the album production , in a meeting where Borchetta and Swift discussed potential songs for Swift 's debut album , she performed " Tim McGraw " for Borchetta on fluke ukulele . According to Swift , as soon as Borchetta finished listening to the song , he faced Swift and said , " That 's your first single . " She responded , " Well . That 's how that works then . " Prior to that event , Swift did not believe that the song was single material . However , she followed what label executives told her and accepted that they were correct . Swift placed " Tim McGraw " as the first track on Taylor Swift because of its importance to her . The song was eventually released as a CD single on June 19 , 2006 . In retrospect , Swift has said that the song " is reminiscent , and it is thinking about a relationship you had and then lost . I think one of the most powerful human emotions is what should have been and wasn 't ... That was a really good song to start out on , because a lot of people can relate to wanting something you can 't have . " When the song 's subject discovered it , he thought it was " cool " and kept friendship with Swift despite their breakup . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Tim McGraw " is a country song with a length of three minutes and 52 seconds . The song mingles traditional and modern country music features , primarily through its usage of a twelve @-@ string guitar . It is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute . Thus , it is categorized as a ballad with a mid @-@ paced nature . It is written in the key of C major and Swift 's vocals span one octave , from F3 to G4 . Swift 's vocals are prominent in twang . " Tim McGraw " follows the chord progression C5 – Am – F – <unk> – G. 
 The lyrics of " Tim McGraw " regard a summer romance that came to a sudden halt . The song fondly reminisces an ex @-@ boyfriend , and directs the lyrics towards him , rather than country singer Tim McGraw himself . It uses McGraw 's music as a marker in their relationship timeline : " When you think Tim McGraw / I hope you think my favorite song . " Sean Dooley of About.com stated , " Music has the power to evoke memories , and it 's an old Tim McGraw song that triggers her happy memories . " McGraw 's reference is one of the several items used for association of the failed relationship , along with other items and places , such as a little black dress .

 The song was well received by critics . Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine described the track as gem that hit hard . Sean Dooley of About.com complimented Swift 's vocal delivery , describing it as " tender and emotive . " Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believe " Tim McGraw " followed " time @-@ tested narrative conventions and [ ... ] massive pop hooks . " Jeff Tamarkin of Allmusic said that the song demonstrated Swift was " a talent to be reckoned with " , because of her vocal delivery that , according to him , equated that of a seasoned professional . He selected " Tim McGraw " as Taylor Swift 's main highlight for its homage to Tim McGraw , commenting , " It 's a device that 's been used countless times in as many ways [ ... ] , yet it works as a hook here and manages to come off as an original idea . " Rick Bell of Country Standard Time stated , " It 's an impressive debut that , while she pines about lost love and Tim McGraw , will likely have others singing the praises of Taylor Swift . " Roger Holland of PopMatters praised the song , commenting it was " good enough to recall some of the best country singles of recent years " , such as Rachel Proctor 's " Me and Emily " and Julie Roberts 's " Break Down Here . " He complimented Swift 's vocal abilities on the song , saying it was executed " quite perfectly " , something she was unable to carry throughout the album Taylor Swift . However , Holland was repugnant of the song 's title . In 2007 , " Tim McGraw " was listed as a " Winning Song " by Broadcast Music Incorporated ( BMI ) .

 The accompanying music video for " Tim McGraw " was directed by Trey Fanjoy . In regards to the video 's concept , Swift stated , " It deals with the haunting power of music and how hearing a song years after it was first popular can have such an emotional appeal . " Clayton Collins portrayed Swift 's love interest in the music video . He was cast because of his physical resemblance to the real subject of the song , in that they were both tall with dark hair . The video begins with Swift , dressed by a white sundress , as she lies on the grass of a lake @-@ bed and holds a transistor radio . Suddenly , the setting is switched to Collins as he drives a white and orange 1970 Chevrolet CST @-@ 10 . He then turns his radio on and ceases driving , coming to a complete stop on a road .

 Swift spent six months of 2006 promoting " Tim McGraw " and Taylor Swift on a radio tour . She performed the song as she opened for Rascal Flatts on several dates , from October 19 to November 3 , 2006 , included on the Me and My Gang Tour ( 2006 – 07 ) . Swift performed " Tim McGraw " as the concert 's penultimate performance . She dressed in a black , knee @-@ length dress and red cowboy boots with a design of a skull and cross bones across it , playing an acoustic guitar . Swift requested for the audience to raise their cell phones in order to simulate a sky filled with stars , when the song reached the lyrics " He said the way my blue eyes shined / Put those Georgia stars to shame that night / I said that 's a lie . " She also performed the song when she served as opening act on twenty dates for George Strait 's 2007 United States tour , and selected dates for Brad Paisley 's Bonfires & Amplifiers Tour in 2007 . During mid @-@ 2007 , Swift engaged as the opening act on several dates for Tim McGraw 's and Faith Hill 's joint tour , Soul2Soul II Tour ( 2006 – 07 ) , where she again performed " Tim McGraw " . Swift performed the song while she was again opening for Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good Tour in 2008 . 
 Swift 's first broadcast performance of " Tim McGraw " was on October 24 , 2006 , on Good Morning America . She continued promotion for the track at Billboard headquarters , the 2007 Academy of Country Music Awards , The Engine Room , and a concert at the Apple Store in SoHo , New York , which was recorded and released as a live extended play ( EP ) , iTunes Live from SoHo , exclusively sold through the iTunes Store . Since completing promotion for Taylor Swift and its corresponding singles , Swift has performed " Tim McGraw " at the 2009 CMA Music Festival , the 2009 V Festival , and the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief . 
 Swift performed " Tim McGraw " on all venues of her first headlining concert tour , the Fearless Tour , which extended from April 2009 to June 2010 . The performances of " Tim McGraw " set on a small platform located at the opposite end , parallel to the stage in the arena . Swift , dressed in a pastel sundress , sat on a wooden stool while performing with wooden acoustic guitar strapped to her shoulder . Swift then completed the performance standing and walking back to the main stage . As she worked her way back to the stage , she again hugged fans , squeezed their outstretched hands and scrawled quick autographs . Nicole Frehsee of Rolling Stone favored Swift 's performance of " Tim McGraw " at the August 27 , 2009 , concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City .

 = Tuber oregonense = 
 Tuber oregonense , commonly known as the Oregon white truffle , is a species of edible truffle in the genus Tuber . Described as new to science in 2010 , the North American species is found on the western coast of the United States , from northern California to southern British Columbia west of the Cascade Range . A mycorrhizal fungus , it grows in a symbiotic association with Douglas fir . It overlaps in distribution with the closely related T. gibbosum , but they have different growing seasons : T. oregonense typically appears from October through March , while T. gibbosum grows from January to June . The fruit bodies of the fungus are roughly spherical to irregular in shape , and resemble small potatoes up to 5 cm ( 2 in ) in diameter . Inside the truffle is the gleba , which is initially white before it becomes a marbled tan color . The large , often thick @-@ walled , and strongly ornamented spores are produced in large spherical asci . The truffle is highly prized for its taste and aroma . Some individuals have claimed success in cultivating the truffles in Christmas tree farms . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first officially described and named in a 2010 Mycologia article , although Tuber oregonense had been previously used provisionally ( as Tuber oregonense Trappe & Bonito ) in American field guides and other popular publications for several years . The type specimen was collected from Benton County , Oregon on 3 February , 2007 along U.S. Route 20 in Oregon . 
 The specific epithet oregonense derives from the name Oregon and the Latin suffix <unk> ( relating to ) , in reference to western Oregon being its central region of abundance . The fungus is commonly known as the Oregon white truffle . Truffle authority James Trappe initially intended to name the species as a variety of Tuber gibbosum ( i.e. , as Tuber gibbosum var. oregonense ) before molecular analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at the species level . 
 Tuber oregonense is part of the <unk> clade of the genus Tuber , which contains species that have " peculiar wall thickenings on hyphal tips emerging from the peridial surface at maturity . " 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of T. oregonense are hypogeous ( growing in the ground ) , typically 0 @.@ 5 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 2 in ) broad , although specimens up to 7 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) have been recorded . Smaller specimens are spherical or nearly so , and have random furrows ; larger specimens are more irregular in shape , lobed and deeply furrowed . Young fruit bodies have a white peridium , as the truffle matures it develops red to reddish @-@ brown or orangish @-@ brown patches ; with age it becomes orange @-@ brown to reddish @-@ brown overall and often develops cracks on the surface . The peridium is 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 4 mm thick , and the surface texture ranges from relatively smooth to covered with tiny " hairs " that are more dense in the furrows , and more scattered on the exposed lobes . The gleba is solid , in youth the fertile tissue is whitish and marbled with mostly narrow , white , hypha @-@ stuffed veins that emerge throughout the peridium to its surface . In maturity , the fertile tissue is light brown to brown from the color of the spores , but the marbling veins remain white . The odor and flavor of the flesh are mild in youth , but soon become strong , pungent and complex , or " <unk> " . 
 The spores are ellipsoid to somewhat spindle @-@ shaped with narrowed ends , and light brownish in color . The size of the spores varies depending upon the type of asci in which they develop : in one @-@ spored asci they measure 42 @.@ 5 – 62 @.@ 5 by 17 @.@ 5 – 30 µm ; in two @-@ spored asci they are 32 @.@ 5 – 50 by 15 – 25 µm ; in three @-@ spored asci they are 27 @.@ 5 – 45 by 15 – 25 µm ; in four @-@ spored asci they are 25 – 38 @.@ 5 by 13 – 28 µm ; in five @-@ spored asci 28 – 34 by 22 – 25 µm ( all sizes excluding surface ornamentation ) . The spore walls are 2 – 3 µm thick and are covered with a honeycomb @-@ like ( <unk> ) network . The cavities of the honeycomb typically have five or six sides , and the corners form spines that are 5 – 7 µm tall by 0 @.@ 5 µm thick . A " <unk> " appears in some spores when the light microscope objective is focused on the optical cross section but not on the spore wall surface , or on scanning electron microscopy micrographs of the surface . Young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid ( egg @-@ shaped ) or pyriform ( pear @-@ shaped ) ; sometimes the base of the ascus is narrowed like a stipe , and measures up to 15 by 7 µm . Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from the pressure of crowded spores within . They are hyaline ( translucent ) , thin @-@ walled , 60 – 85 by 65 – 75 µm , 1 – 4- ( occasionally 5 ) <unk> , and <unk> ( without a stipe ) at maturity . 
 The <unk> ( the cuticle of the peridium ) is 200 – 300 µm thick plus or minus 80 µm of tightly interwoven hyphae that are 3 – 5 ( sometimes up to 10 ) µm broad . The cells are short and have nearly hyaline walls that measure 0 @.@ 5 – 1 µm thick ; the interior veins emerge through the peridium the cells and often form a localized tissue of rounded cells up to 12 µm broad . The degree to which the surface is covered with fine " hairs " is variable ; these hairs are made of tangled hyphae and emergent thin @-@ walled hyphal tips 2 – 5 µm in diameter , some even and smooth , some with granulated surfaces and some with moniliform walls ( resembling a string of beads ) that are irregularly thickened by hyaline bands that are 0 @.@ 5 – 2 µm wide . The subpellis ( the tissue layer immediately under the <unk> ) is abruptly differentiated from the <unk> , 150 – 220 µm thick , and comprises interwoven , nearly hyaline , thin @-@ walled hyphae 2 – 10 µm wide with scattered cells up to 15 µm wide . The gleba is made of hyaline , thin @-@ walled , interwoven hyphae that are 2 – 7 µm broad with scattered cells that are inflated up to 15 µm .

 Tuber oregonense closely resembles Tuber gibbosum , which grows in the same habitats , but may be distinguished by the structure of its peridium , and differences in spores size and shape . Further , Tuber gibbosum grows from January to June . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Tuber oregonense is a choice edible species . Its odor has been described as " " <unk> " , a complex of garlic , spices , cheese , and " indefinable other essences " ; the fungus is prized after by commercial truffle harvesters and consumers for its intense fragrance . Because they grow in the topsoil and needles , they are considered to have a more " floral " and " herbal " flavor profile than related European truffles . Some individuals have claimed to have had success in growing the truffles in Christmas tree farms in Oregon . Techniques reportedly involve inoculating the ground under young Douglas fir trees with a slurry comprising ground @-@ up truffles mixed in water , or the feces of animals fed truffles . There is , however , no concrete evidence that these methods can be used to establish new truffle patches or to improve the productivity of existing patches . 
 = = Ecology , habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all Tuber species , T. oregonense is mycorrhizal . The fungus grows west of the Cascade Mountains from the southern Puget Sound region of Washington , south to southwestern Oregon at elevations from near sea level up to 425 m ( 1 @,@ 390 ft ) in pure stands of Pseudotsuga menziesii forests up to 100 years old , or Pseudotsuga mixed with Tsuga heterophylla , Picea sitchensis or Alnus species . The species has been commercially harvested in the Pacific Northwest since the <unk> and is often found in Christmas tree plantations as young as five years . The Oregon Truffle Festival , held in Eugene yearly since 2006 to coincide with the maturing of the truffle in late January , features activities such as cultivation seminars and truffle hunting excursions . Fruit bodies are produced from September through the middle of March . The fungus is an important component of the diet of Northern flying squirrels , and comprises the majority of their diet at certain times of the year . 
 = Barnard 's Star = 
 Barnard 's Star / <unk> / is a very @-@ low @-@ mass red dwarf about six light @-@ years away from Earth in the constellation of Ophiuchus . It is the fourth @-@ closest known individual star to the Sun ( after the three components of the Alpha Centauri system ) and the closest star in the Northern Hemisphere . Despite its proximity , at a dim apparent magnitude of about nine , it is not visible with the unaided eye ; however , it is much brighter in the infrared than it is in visible light . 
 The star is named after the American astronomer E. E. Barnard . He was not the first to observe the star ( it appeared on Harvard University plates in 1888 and 1890 ) , but in 1916 he measured its proper motion as 10 @.@ 3 arcseconds per year , which remains the largest proper motion of any star relative to the Solar System . 
 Barnard 's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the celestial equator . Historically , research on Barnard 's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics , its astrometry , and also refining the limits of possible extrasolar planets . Although Barnard 's Star is an ancient star , it still experiences star flare events , one being observed in 1998 . 
 The star has also been the subject of some controversy . For a decade , from the early 1960s to the early 1970s , Peter van de Kamp claimed that there were one or more gas giants in orbit around it . Although the presence of small terrestrial planets around Barnard 's Star remains a possibility , Van de Kamp 's specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Barnard 's Star is a red dwarf of the dim spectral type M4 , and it is too faint to see without a telescope . Its apparent magnitude is 9 @.@ 5 . This compares with a magnitude of − 1 @.@ 5 for Sirius – the brightest star in the night sky – and about 6 @.@ 0 for the faintest objects visible with the naked eye ( this magnitude scale is logarithmic , so the magnitude of 9 @.@ 54 is only about 1 / 27 of the brightness of the faintest star that can be seen with the naked eye ( under good viewing conditions ) . 
 At 7 – 12 billion years of age , Barnard 's Star is considerably older than the Sun , which is 4 @.@ 5 billion years old , and it might be among the oldest stars in the Milky Way galaxy . Barnard 's Star has lost a great deal of rotational energy , and the periodic slight changes in its brightness indicate that it rotates once in 130 days ( the Sun rotates in 25 ) . Given its age , Barnard 's Star was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity . However , in 1998 , astronomers observed an intense stellar flare , surprisingly showing that Barnard 's Star is a flare star . Barnard 's Star has the variable star designation V2500 Ophiuchi . In 2003 , Barnard 's Star presented the first detectable change in the radial velocity of a star caused by its motion . Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard 's Star was attributed to its stellar activity . 
 The proper motion of Barnard 's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90 km / s . The 10 @.@ 3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime , roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon . 
 The radial velocity of Barnard 's Star towards the Sun is measured from its blue shift to be 110 km / s . Combined with its proper motion , this gives a true velocity relative to the Sun of 143 km / s . Barnard 's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around AD 11 @,@ 800 , when it approaches to within about 3 @.@ 75 light @-@ years . However , at that time , Barnard 's Star will not be the nearest star , since Proxima Centauri will have moved even closer to the Sun . Barnard 's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye at the time of its closest approach , since its apparent magnitude will be about 8 @.@ 5 then . After that it will gradually recede from the Sun . 
 Barnard 's Star has a mass of about 0 @.@ 14 solar masses ( M ☉ ) , and a radius 15 % to 20 % of that of the Sun . Thus , although Barnard 's Star has roughly 150 times the mass of Jupiter ( MJ ) , its radius is only 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 0 times larger , due to its much higher density . Its effective temperature is 3 @,@ 100 kelvins , and it has a visual luminosity of 0 @.@ 0004 solar luminosities . Barnard 's Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is , it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon , comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 astronomical units . 
 Barnard 's Star 's has 10 – 32 % of the solar metallicity . Metallicity is the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than helium and helps classify stars relative to the galactic population . Barnard 's Star seems to be typical of the old , red dwarf population II stars , yet these are also generally metal @-@ poor halo stars . While sub @-@ solar , Barnard 's Star 's metallicity is higher than that of a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal @-@ rich disk star range ; this , plus its high space motion , have led to the designation " intermediate population II star " , between a halo and disk star . 
 = = Claims of a planetary system = = 
 For a decade from 1963 to about 1973 , a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by Peter van de Kamp that he had detected , by using astrometry , a perturbation in the proper motion of Barnard 's Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with Jupiter . Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938 , attempting , with colleagues at the Swarthmore College observatory , to find minuscule variations of one micrometre in its position on photographic plates consistent with orbital perturbations that would indicate a planetary companion ; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates , to avoid systemic individual errors . Van de Kamp 's initial suggestion was a planet having about 1 @.@ 6 MJ at a distance of 4 @.@ 4 AU in a slightly eccentric orbit , and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper . Later that year , Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1 @.@ 1 and 0 @.@ 8 MJ . 
 Other astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp 's measurements , and two papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets . George Gatewood and Heinrich Eichhorn , at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques , failed to verify the planetary companion . Another paper published by John L. Hershey four months earlier , also using the Swarthmore observatory , found that changes in the astrometric field of various stars correlated to the timing of adjustments and modifications that had been carried out on the refractor telescope 's objective lens ; the claimed planet was attributed to an artifact of maintenance and upgrade work . The affair has been discussed as part of a broader scientific review . 
 Van de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further claim of two planets ' existence as late as 1982 ; he died in 1995 . Wulff Heintz , Van de Kamp 's successor at Swarthmore and an expert on double stars , questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards . The two men were reported to have become estranged from each other because of this . 
 = = = Refining planetary boundaries = = = 
 While not completely ruling out the possibility of planets , null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s , the latest based on interferometric work with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999 . By refining the values of a star 's motion , the mass and orbital boundaries for possible planets are tightened : in this way astronomers are often able to describe what types of planets cannot orbit a given star . 
 M dwarfs such as Barnard 's Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious . Gatewood was thus able to show in 1995 that planets with 10 MJ ( the lower limit for brown dwarfs ) were impossible around Barnard 's Star , in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general . In 1999 , work with the Hubble Space Telescope further excluded planetary companions of 0 @.@ 8 MJ with an orbital period of less than 1 @,@ 000 days ( Jupiter 's orbital period is 4 @,@ 332 days ) , while <unk> determined in 2003 that within the habitable zone around Barnard 's Star , planets are not possible with an " M sin i " value greater than 7 @.@ 5 times the mass of the Earth ( M ⊕ ) , or with a mass greater than 3 @.@ 1 times the mass of Neptune ( much lower than van de Kamp 's smallest suggested value ) . 
 Even though this research has greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard 's Star , it has not ruled them out completely ; terrestrial planets would be difficult to detect . NASA 's Space Interferometry Mission , which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth @-@ like planets , was reported to have chosen Barnard 's Star as an early search target . However , this mission was shut down in 2010 . ESA 's similar Darwin interferometry mission had the same goal , but was stripped of funding in 2007 .

 Barnard 's Star was studied as part of Project Daedalus . Undertaken between 1973 and 1978 , the study suggested that rapid , unmanned travel to another star system was possible with existing or near @-@ future technology . Barnard 's Star was chosen as a target partly because it was believed to have planets . 
 The theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing nuclear fusion ( specifically , electron bombardment of deuterium and helium @-@ 3 ) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12 % of the speed of light . The star could then be reached in 50 years , within a human lifetime . Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions , the interstellar medium would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed . 
 The initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research . In 1980 , Robert Freitas suggested a more ambitious plan : a self @-@ replicating spacecraft intended to search for and make contact with extraterrestrial life . Built and launched in Jovian ( Jupiter 's ) orbit , it would reach Barnard 's Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus . Once at the star , it would begin automated self @-@ replication , constructing a factory , initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = 1998 flare = = 
 In 1998 a stellar flare on Barnard 's Star was detected based on changes in the spectral emissions on July 17 , 1998 , during an unrelated search for variations in the proper motion . Four years passed before the flare was fully analyzed , at which point it was suggested that the flare 's temperature was 8000 K , more than twice the normal temperature of the star . Given the essentially random nature of flares , Diane Paulson , one of the authors of that study , noted that " the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe " . 
 The flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected in stars of such age . Flares are not completely understood , but are believed to be caused by strong magnetic fields , which suppress plasma convection and lead to sudden outbursts : strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars , while old stars tend to rotate slowly . For Barnard 's Star to undergo an event of such magnitude is thus presumed to be a rarity . Research on the star 's periodicity , or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale , also suggest it ought to be quiescent ; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in the star 's brightness , noting only one possible starspot over 130 days . 
 Stellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard 's Star as a proxy to understand similar stars . It is hoped that photometric studies of its X @-@ ray and UV emissions will shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy . Such research has <unk> implications : given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star , any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares , winds , and plasma ejection events .

 Barnard 's Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun . The neighbors of Barnard 's Star are generally of red dwarf size , the smallest and most common star type . Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf Ross 154 , at 1 @.@ 66 parsecs ( 5 @.@ 41 light years ) distance . The Sun and Alpha Centauri are , respectively , the next closest systems . From Barnard 's Star , the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA = <unk> <unk> <unk> , Dec = − 04 ° 41 ′ 36 ″ , in the eastern part of the constellation Monoceros . The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4 @.@ 83 , and at a distance of 1 @.@ 834 parsecs , it would be a first @-@ magnitude star , as Pollux is from the Earth . 
 = Battle of Dyrrhachium ( 1081 ) = 
 The Battle of Dyrrhachium ( near present @-@ day Durrës in Albania ) took place on October 18 , 1081 between the Byzantine Empire , led by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos ( r . 1081 – 1118 ) , and the Normans of southern Italy under Robert Guiscard , Duke of Apulia and Calabria . The battle was fought outside the city of Dyrrhachium ( also known as Durazzo ) , the Byzantine capital of Illyria , and ended in a Norman victory . 
 Following the Norman conquest of Byzantine Italy and Saracen Sicily , the Byzantine emperor , Michael VII Doukas ( r . 1071 – 1078 ) , betrothed his son to Robert Guiscard 's daughter . When Michael was deposed , Robert took this as an excuse to invade the Byzantine Empire in 1081 . His army laid siege to Dyrrhachium , but his fleet was defeated by the Venetians . On October 18 , the Normans engaged a Byzantine army under Alexios I Komnenos outside Dyrrhachium . The battle began with the Byzantine right wing routing the Norman left wing , which broke and fled . Varangian mercenaries joined in the pursuit of the fleeing Normans , but became separated from the main force and were massacred . Norman knights in the centre attacked the Byzantine centre and routed it , causing the bulk of the Byzantine army to rout . 
 After this victory , the Normans took Dyrrhachium in February 1082 and advanced inland , capturing most of Macedonia and Thessaly . Robert was then forced to leave Greece to deal with an attack on his ally , the Pope , by the Holy Roman Emperor , Henry IV ( r . 1084 – 1105 ) . Robert left his son Bohemond in charge of the army in Greece . Bohemond was initially successful , defeating Alexios in several battles , but was defeated by Alexios outside Larissa . Forced to retreat to Italy , Bohemond lost all the territory gained by the Normans in the campaign . The Byzantine recovery began the Komnenian restoration . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Normans first arrived in Southern Italy in 1015 from northern France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire . As they were paid with lands , soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority ; in 1054 , they defeated the Pope at the Battle of <unk> , forcing him to acknowledge their authority . In 1059 , the Pope made Robert Guiscard , of the Hauteville family , Duke of Apulia , Calabria , and Sicily . However , most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands , and Sicily was in Saracen hands . 
 By 1071 , Robert , together with his brother Roger , had taken over the last Byzantine stronghold in Italy , Bari . By the next year , they conquered all of Sicily , ending the Islamic Emirate of Sicily . In 1073 , the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII sent an envoy to Robert offering the hand of his son Constantine to Robert 's daughter Helena . Guiscard accepted the offer and sent his daughter to Constantinople . However , in 1078 , Michael was overthrown by Nicephorus Botaneiates , an event that destroyed any chances Helena had for the throne . This gave Robert a motive to invade the empire claiming his daughter had been mistreated ; however , his intervention was delayed by a revolt in Italy . 
 Robert conscripted all men of a fighting age into the army , which he refitted . Meanwhile , he sent an ambassador to the Byzantine court with orders to demand proper treatment for Helena and to win over the Domestic of the Schools , Alexios . The results of these attempts remain unknown , but the ambassador fell under Alexios 's charm and as he was returning to Italy , he heard of Alexios 's successful coup against Botaneiates , by which he became Alexios I Komnenos . 
 When the ambassador returned , he urged Robert to make peace , claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but friendship with the Normans . Robert had no intention of peace ; he sent his son Bohemond with an advance force towards Greece and Bohemond landed at <unk> , with Robert following shortly after . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The Norman fleet of 150 ships including 60 horse transports set off towards the Byzantine Empire at the end of May 1081 . The army numbered 30 @,@ 000 men , backed up by 1 @,@ 300 Norman knights . The fleet sailed to <unk> in Byzantine territory ; they were joined by several ships from Ragusa , a republic in the Balkans who were enemies of the Byzantines . 
 Robert soon left <unk> and sailed to the island of Corfu , which surrendered because of a small garrison . Having won a bridgehead and a clear path for reinforcements from Italy , he advanced on the city of Dyrrhachium , the capital and chief port of Illyria . The city was well defended on a long , narrow peninsula running parallel to the coast , but separated by marshlands . Guiscard brought his army onto the peninsula and pitched camp outside the city walls . However , as Robert 's fleet sailed to Dyrrhachium , it was hit by a storm and lost several ships . 
 Meanwhile , when Alexios heard that the Normans were preparing to invade Byzantine territory , he sent an ambassador to the Doge of Venice , Domenico Selvo , requesting aid and offering trading rights in return . The Doge , alarmed by Norman control of the Strait of Otranto , took command of the Venetian fleet and sailed at once , surprising the Norman fleet under the command of Bohemond as night was falling . The Normans counter @-@ attacked tenaciously , but their inexperience in naval combat betrayed them . The experienced Venetian navy attacked in a close formation known as " sea harbour " and together with their use of Greek fire " bombs " , the Norman line scattered , and the Venetian fleet sailed into Dyrrhachium 's harbour . 
 = = Siege of Dyrrhachium = = 
 Robert was not discouraged by this naval defeat , and began his siege of Dyrrhachium . In command of the garrison at Dyrrhachium was the experienced general George Palaeologus , sent by Alexios with orders to hold out at all costs while Alexios himself mustered an army to relieve the city . 
 Meanwhile , a Byzantine fleet arrived and – after joining with the Venetian fleet – attacked the Norman fleet , which was again routed . The garrison at Dyrrhachium managed to hold out all summer , despite Robert 's catapults , ballistae and siege tower . The garrison made continuous sallies from the city ; on one occasion , Palaeologus fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull . Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert 's siege tower . 
 Robert 's camp was struck by disease ; according to contemporary historian Anna Comnena up to 10 @,@ 000 men died , including 500 knights . Even so , the situation of the Dyrrhachium garrison grew desperate because of the effects of Norman siege weapons . Alexios learned of this while he was in Salonica with his army so he advanced in full force against the Normans . According to Comnena , Alexios had about 20 @,@ 000 men ; historian John Haldon puts the army 's size between 18 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 men , while John Birkenmeier estimates it between 20 @,@ 000 – 25 @,@ 000 men . It consisted of Thracian and Macedonian tagmata , which numbered about 5 @,@ 000 men ; the elite <unk> and <unk> units , which numbered around 1 @,@ 000 men ; a force of Manichaeans which comprised 2 @,@ 800 men , Thessalian cavalry , Balkan conscripts , Armenian infantry and other light troops . As well as the native troops , the Byzantines were joined by 2 @,@ 000 Turkish and 1 @,@ 000 Frankish mercenaries , about 1 @,@ 000 Varangians and 7 @,@ 000 Turkish auxiliaries sent by the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm . Alexios also withdrew the <unk> from Heraclea Pontica and the remaining Byzantine holdings in Asia Minor and by doing so , he effectively left them to be overrun by the Turks . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Initial moves = = = 
 Alexios advanced from Salonica and pitched camp on the river <unk> near Dyrrhachium on October 15 . He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers ; among them was George Palaiologos , who had managed to sneak out of the city . A majority of the senior officers , including Palaiologos , urged caution , noting that time was with the Emperor . Alexios , however , favoured an immediate assault , hoping to catch Guiscard 's army from the rear , while they were still besieging the city . Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city , planning to attack the Normans the next day . 
 Guiscard , however , had been informed of Alexios ' arrival by his scouts and on the night of October 17 , he moved his army from the peninsula to the mainland . Upon learning of Guiscard 's move , Alexios revised his battle plan . He split his army into three divisions , with the left wing under the command of Gregory <unk> , the right wing under the command of Nikephoros Melissenos , and himself in command of the centre . Guiscard formed his battle line opposite Alexios 's , with the right wing under the command of the Count of Giovinazzo , the left under Bohemond and Guiscard facing Alexios in the centre . 
 The Varangians had been ordered to march just in front of the main line with a strong division of archers a little behind them . The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and fire a volley before retreating behind them . The archers continued this tactic until the army neared contact . 
 As the opposing armies closed in , Guiscard sent a detachment of cavalry positioned in the centre to feint an attack on the Byzantine positions . Guiscard hoped the feint would draw up the Varangians ; however , this plan failed when the cavalry was forced back by the archers . The Norman right wing suddenly charged forward to the point where the Byzantine left and centre met , directing its attack against the Varangian left flank . The Varangians stood their ground while the Byzantine left , including some of Alexios ' elite troops , attacked the Normans . The Norman formation disintegrated and the routed Normans fled towards the beach . There , according to Comnena , they were rallied by Guiscard 's wife , <unk> , described as " like another Pallas , if not a second Athena " . 
 = = = Byzantine collapse = = = 
 In the meantime , the Byzantine right and centre had been engaging in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them . However , with the collapse of the Norman right , the knights were in danger of being outflanked . At this point , the Varangians ( mainly Anglo @-@ Saxons who had left England after the Norman Conquest ) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right . With their massive battle axes , the Varangians attacked the Norman knights , who were driven away after their horses panicked . The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault . Guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them . The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the Archangel Michael . The Normans immediately set the church on fire , and all Varangians perished in the blaze . 
 Meanwhile , George Palaiologos sortied out of Dyrrhachium , but failed to save the situation . Alexios 's ally , Serbian King Constantine Bodin stayed aside with his army , intending to await the outcome of the battle . When the Byzantines were defeated and started to flee , Bodin retreated with his army . The Turks who had been lent to him by the Seljuk Sultan Suleyman I followed Constantine 's example . 
 Deprived of his left wing ( still in pursuit of the Norman right ) , Alexios was exposed in the centre . Guiscard sent his heavy cavalry against the Byzantine centre . They first routed the Byzantine skirmishers before breaking into small detachments and smashing into various points of the Byzantine line . This charge broke the Byzantine lines and caused them to rout . The imperial camp , which had been left unguarded , fell to the Normans . 
 Alexios and his guards resisted as long as they could before retreating . As they retreated , Alexios was separated from his guard and was attacked by Norman soldiers . While escaping , he was wounded in his forehead and lost a lot of blood , but eventually made it back to Ohrid , where he regrouped his army . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle was a heavy defeat for Alexios . Historian Jonathan Harris states that the defeat was " every bit as severe as that at Manzikert . " He lost about 5 @,@ 000 of his men , including most of the Varangians . Norman losses are unknown , but John Haldon claims they are substantial as both wings broke and fled . Historian Robert Holmes states : " The new knightly tactic of charging with the lance couched – tucked firmly under the arm to unite the impact of man and horse – proved a battle @-@ winner . " 
 George Palaiologos had not been able to re @-@ enter the city after the battle and left with the main force . The defense of the citadel was left to the Venetians , while the city itself was left to the Count of the Tent ( or Byzantine provincial administrators ) mobilizing from Arbanon ( i.e. , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; the term <unk> is short for <unk> της <unk> meaning " Count of the Tent " ) . 
 In February 1082 , Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or <unk> citizen opened the gates to the Normans . The Norman army proceeded to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance . While Guiscard was in Kastoria , messengers arrived from Italy , bearing news that Apulia , Calabria , and Campania were in revolt . He also learned that the Holy Roman Emperor , Henry IV , was at the gates of Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII , a Norman ally . Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360 @,@ 000 gold pieces in return for an alliance . Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope . Guiscard rushed to Italy , leaving Bohemond in command of the army in Greece . 
 Alexios , desperate for money , ordered the confiscation of all the church 's treasure . With this money , Alexios mustered an army near Thessalonica and went to fight Bohemond . However , Bohemond defeated Alexios in two battles : one near Arta and the other near Ioannina . This left Bohemond in control of Macedonia and nearly all of Thessaly . Bohemond advanced with his army against the city of Larissa . Meanwhile , Alexios had mustered a new army and with 7 @,@ 000 Seljuk Turks sent by the Sultan , he advanced on the Normans at Larissa and defeated them . The demoralised and unpaid Norman army returned to the coast and sailed back to Italy . Meanwhile , Alexios granted the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople , as well as exemption from trading duties in return for their renewed aid . They responded by recapturing Dyrrhachium and Corfu and returning them to the Byzantine Empire . These victories returned the Empire to its previous status quo and marked the beginning of the Komnenian restoration .

 = Zyklon B = 
 Zyklon B ( German pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; anglicized / <unk> <unk> / or translated Cyclone B ) was the trade name of a cyanide @-@ based pesticide invented in Germany in the early 1920s . It consisted of hydrogen cyanide ( prussic acid ) , a cautionary eye irritant , and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth . The product is infamous for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder a million people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz @-@ Birkenau , Majdanek , and other extermination camps . 
 Hydrogen cyanide , a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration , was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s . Research at Degesch of Germany led to the development of Zyklon ( later known as Zyklon A ) , a pesticide which released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat . It was banned after a similar product was used by Germany as a chemical weapon in World War I. In 1922 , Degesch was purchased by Degussa , where a team of chemists that included Walter Heerdt and Bruno Tesch developed a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers . The new product was also named Zyklon , but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version . Uses included delousing clothing and disinfecting ships , warehouses , and trains . 
 In early 1942 , Zyklon B emerged as the preferred killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust . Around a million people were killed using this method , mostly at Auschwitz . Tesch was executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans . Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide , but still has industrial applications . Firms in several countries continue to produce Zyklon B under alternative brand names , including Detia @-@ Degesch , the successor to Degesch , who renamed the product to Cyanosil in 1974 . 
 = = Mechanism = = 
 Hydrogen cyanide is a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration . Cyanide prevents the cell from producing adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) by binding to one of the proteins involved in the electron transport chain . This protein , cytochrome c oxidase , contains several subunits and has ligands containing iron groups . The cyanide component of Zyklon B can bind at one of these iron groups , heme a3 , forming a more stabilized compound through metal @-@ to @-@ ligand pi bonding . As a result of this new iron @-@ cyanide complex , the electrons that would situate themselves on the heme a3 group can no longer do so . Instead , these electrons destabilize the compound ; thus , the heme group no longer accepts them . Consequently , electron transport is halted , and cells can no longer produce the energy needed to synthesize ATP . In a human weighing 68 kilograms ( 150 lb ) , death occurs within two minutes of inhaling 70 milligrams ( 0 @.@ 0025 oz ) of hydrogen cyanide . 
 = = History = = 
 Hydrogen cyanide , discovered in the late 18th century , was used in the 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California . Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos , goods wagons , ships , and mills . Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas . Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für <unk> <unk> ( Degesch ) , a state @-@ controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical . Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye irritant to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide . The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon ( cyclone ) . As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I , Zyklon was soon banned . 
 Deutsche Gold- und Silber @-@ <unk> ( German Gold and Silver Refinery ; Degussa ) became sole owners of Degesch in 1922 . There , beginning in 1922 , Walter Heerdt , Bruno Tesch , and others worked on packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and adsorbent stabilizers such as diatomaceous earth . The new product was also labelled as Zyklon , but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version . Heerdt was named the inventor of Zyklon B in the Degesch patent application ( number DE <unk> ) dated 20 June 1922 . The German Patent Office awarded the patent on 27 December 1926 . 
 = = Corporate structure and marketing = = 
 In 1930 , Degussa ceded 42 @.@ 5 per cent ownership of Degesch to IG Farben and 15 per cent to Th . Goldschmidt AG , in exchange for the right to market pesticide products of those two companies through Degesch . Degussa retained managerial control . 
 While Degesch owned the rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the packaging system , the chemical formula was owned by Degussa . <unk> GmbH , which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa , owned the rights to a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing . This process was performed under license by two companies , Dessauer Werke and <unk> Kolin , who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product , which was packaged using equipment , labels , and canisters provided by Degesch . The finished goods were sent to Degesch , who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors : Heerdt @-@ Linger GmbH ( Heli ) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow ( Testa ) of Hamburg . Their territory was split along the Elbe river , with Heli handling clients to the west and south , and Testa those to the east . Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli , and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of Testa . 
 Prior to World War II Degesch derived most of its Zyklon B profits from overseas sales , particularly in the United States , where it was produced under license by <unk> & <unk> prior to 1931 and by American Cyanamid from 1931 to 1943 . From 1929 , the United States Public Health Service used Zyklon B to disinfect freight trains and clothes of Mexican immigrants entering the United States . Uses in Germany included delousing clothing ( often using a portable sealed chamber invented by Degesch in the 1930s ) and disinfecting ships , warehouses , and trains . By 1943 , sales of Zyklon B accounted for 65 per cent of Degesch 's sales revenue and 70 per cent of its gross profits . 
 = = Use in the Holocaust = = 
 In early 1942 , Zyklon B emerged as the preferred killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust . The chemical claimed the lives of roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz @-@ Birkenau , Majdanek , and elsewhere . Most of the victims were Jews , and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz . Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen , Dachau , and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli , and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa . Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers . Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942 – 44 , 56 metric tons ( about 8 per cent of domestic sales ) were sold to concentration camps . Auschwitz received 23 @.@ 8 tons , of which 6 tons were used for fumigation . The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage ( the product had a shelf life of only three months ) . Testa conducted <unk> for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes . In April 1941 , the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized <unk> of the chemical , and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight . 
 Rudolf Höss , commandant of Auschwitz , said that the use of Zyklon @-@ B to kill prisoners came about on the initiative of one of his subordinates , SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer ( captain ) Karl Fritzsch , who used the substance to kill some Russian POWs in late August 1941 in the basement of Block 11 in the main camp . The experiment was repeated on more Russian POWs , with Höss watching , in September . Block 11 proved unsuitable for mass killings , as the basement was difficult to air out afterwards and the crematorium ( Crematorium I , which operated until July 1942 ) was some distance away . The site of the killings was moved to Crematorium I , where more than 700 victims could be killed at once . By the middle of 1942 , the operation was moved to Auschwitz II – Birkenau , a nearby satellite camp which had been under construction since October 1941 . 
 The first gas chamber at Auschwitz II – Birkenau was the " red house " ( called Bunker 1 by SS staff ) , a brick cottage converted to a gassing facility by tearing out the inside and bricking up the windows . It was operational by March 1942 . A second brick cottage , the " white house " or Bunker 2 , was converted some weeks later . According to Höss , Bunker 1 held 800 victims and Bunker 2 held 1 @,@ 200 victims . These structures were in use for mass killings until early 1943 . At that point , the Nazis decided to greatly increase the gassing capacity of Birkenau . Crematorium II , originally designed as a mortuary , with morgues in the basement and ground @-@ level incinerators , was converted into a killing factory by installing gas @-@ tight doors , vents for the Zyklon B to be dropped into the chamber , and ventilation equipment to remove the gas afterwards . Crematorium III was built using the same design . Crematoria IV and V , designed from the start as gassing centers , were also constructed that spring . By June 1943 , all four crematoria were operational . Most of the victims were killed using these four structures . 
 The Nazis began shipping large numbers of Jews from all over Europe to Auschwitz in the middle of 1942 . Those who were not selected for work crews were immediately gassed . The group selected to die , about three @-@ quarters of the total , included almost all children , women with small children , all the elderly , and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit . The victims were told they were to undergo delousing and a shower . They were stripped of their belongings and herded into the gas chamber . 
 The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute . The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS , on the order of the supervising SS doctor . After the doors were shut , SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes in the side of the chamber . The victims were dead within 20 minutes . Johann Kremer , an SS doctor who oversaw gassings , testified that the " shouting and screaming of the victims could be heard through the opening and it was clear that they fought for their lives " . 
 Sonderkommandos ( special work crews forced to work at the gas chambers ) wearing gas masks then dragged the bodies from the chamber . The victims ' glasses , artificial limbs , jewelry , and hair were removed , and any dental work was extracted so the gold could be melted down . If the gas chamber was crowded , which they typically were , the corpses were found half @-@ squatting , their skin discolored pink with red and green spots , with some found foaming at their mouths , or bleeding from their ears . The corpses were burned in the nearby incinerators , and the ashes were buried , thrown in the river , or used as fertilizer . With the Soviet Red Army approaching through Poland , the last mass gassing at Auschwitz took place on 30 October 1944 . In November 1944 , Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler , head of the SS , ordered gassing operations to cease across the Reich . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 After World War II ended in 1945 , Bruno Tesch and Karl Weinbacher of Tesch & Stabenow were tried in a British military court and executed for knowingly providing Zyklon B to the SS for use on humans . Gerhard Peters , who served as principal operating officer of Degesch and Heli and also held posts in the Nazi government , served two years eight months in prison as an accessory before being released due to amendments to the penal code . 
 Use of hydrogen cyanide as a pesticide or cleaner has been banned or restricted in some countries . Most hydrogen cyanide is used in industrial processes , made by companies in Germany , Japan , the Netherlands and the US . Degesch resumed production of Zyklon B after the war . The product was sold as Cyanosil in Germany and Zyklon in other countries . It was still produced as of 2000 . Degussa sold Degesch to Detia @-@ Freyberg GmbH in 1986 . The company is now called Detia @-@ Degesch . A fumigation product similar to Zyklon B is also in production by <unk> <unk> <unk> of the Czech Republic , under the trade name Uragan D2 . Uragan means " hurricane " or " cyclone " in Czech . 
 Subsequent use of the word " Zyklon " in trade names has prompted angry reactions in English @-@ speaking countries . The name " Zyklon " on portable roller coasters made since 1965 by <unk> provoked protests among Jewish groups in the U.S. in 1993 , 1999 , and 2011 . In 2002 , British sportswear and football equipment supplier Umbro issued an apology and stopped using the name " Zyklon " , which had appeared since 1999 on the box for one of its trainers , after receiving complaints from the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Beth Shalom Holocaust Centre . Also in 2002 , Siemens withdrew its application for an American trademark of the word " Zyklon " , which their subsidiary <unk> Bosch und Siemens <unk> had proposed to use for a new line of home appliances in the United States . ( The firm was already using the name in Germany for one of their vacuum cleaners . ) Protests were lodged by the Simon Wiesenthal Center after the trademark application was reported to BBC News Online by one of their readers . French company IPC 's product names used " Cyclone " for <unk> and suffix " B " for biodegradable : " Cyclone B " was renamed " Cyclone Cap Vert " ( " green cap " ) in 2013 after protests from Jewish groups . A rabbi said the name was " horrible ignorance at best , and a Guinness record in evil and cynicism if the company did know the history of the name of its product . " 
 Holocaust deniers claim that Zyklon B gas was not used in the gas chambers , relying for evidence on the research of Fred A. Leuchter , who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings . Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings . Leuchter 's negative control , a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building , had no cyanide residue . In 1999 , James Roth , the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter 's samples , stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks , and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface . The surface that had been exposed to the chemical was not identified , and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount . In 1994 , the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re @-@ examined Leuchter 's claim , stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction . Using <unk> techniques , they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers ( as positive controls ) and living quarters ( as negative controls ) . They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters .

 A.I. Artificial Intelligence , also known as A.I. , is a 2001 American science fiction drama film directed by Steven Spielberg . The screenplay by Spielberg was based on a screen story by Ian Watson and the 1969 short story Super @-@ Toys Last All Summer Long by Brian Aldiss . The film was produced by Kathleen Kennedy , Spielberg and Bonnie Curtis . It stars Haley Joel Osment , Jude Law , Frances O 'Connor , Brendan Gleeson and William Hurt . Set in a futuristic post @-@ climate change society , A.I. tells the story of David ( Osment ) , a childlike android uniquely programmed with the ability to love . 
 Development of A.I. originally began with producer @-@ director Stanley Kubrick in the early 1970s . Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid @-@ 1990s , including Brian Aldiss , Bob Shaw , Ian Watson , and Sara Maitland . The film languished in protracted development for years , partly because Kubrick felt computer @-@ generated imagery was not advanced enough to create the David character , whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray . In 1995 , Kubrick handed A.I. to Spielberg , but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick 's death in 1999 . Spielberg remained close to Watson 's film treatment for the screenplay . The film was greeted with generally positive reviews from critics , grossed approximately $ 235 million , and was nominated for two Academy Awards at the 74th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Original Score ( by John Williams ) . The film is dedicated to Stanley Kubrick . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the late 21st century , global warming has flooded the coastlines , wiping out coastal cities ( such as Amsterdam , Venice , and New York City ) and drastically reducing the human population . There is a new class of robots called Mecha , advanced humanoids capable of emulating thoughts and emotions . 
 David ( Haley Joel Osment ) , a prototype model created by Cybertronics of New Jersey , is designed to resemble a human child and to display love for its human owners . They test their creation with one of their employees , Henry Swinton ( Sam Robards ) , and his wife Monica ( Frances O 'Connor ) . The <unk> ' son , Martin ( Jake Thomas ) , had been placed in suspended animation until a cure could be found for his rare disease . Initially frightened of David , Monica eventually warms up enough to him to activate his imprinting protocol , which irreversibly causes David to have an enduring childlike love for her . He is also befriended by Teddy ( Jack Angel ) , a robotic teddy bear , who takes it upon himself to care for David 's well @-@ being . 
 A cure is found for Martin and he is brought home ; as he recovers , it becomes clear he does not want a sibling and soon makes moves to cause issues for David . First , he attempts to make Teddy choose whom he likes more . He then makes David promise to do something and in return Martin will tell Monica that he loves his new " brother " , making her love him more . The promise David makes is to go to Monica in the middle of the night and cut off a lock of her hair . This upsets the parents , particularly Henry , who fears that the scissors are a weapon , and warns Monica that a robot programmed to love may also be able to hate . 
 At a pool party , one of Martin 's friends unintentionally activates David 's self @-@ protection programming by poking him with a knife . David grabs Martin , apparently for protection , but they both fall into the pool . David sinks to the bottom while still clinging to Martin . Martin is saved from drowning , but Henry mistakes David 's fear during the pool incident as hate for Martin . 
 Henry persuades Monica to return David to Cybertronics , where he will be destroyed . However , Monica cannot bring herself to do this and , instead , tearfully abandons David in the forest ( with Teddy ) to hide as an unregistered Mecha . 
 David is captured for an anti @-@ Mecha " Flesh Fair " , an event where obsolete and unlicensed Mecha are destroyed in front of cheering crowds . David is nearly killed , but the crowd is swayed by his fear ( since Mecha do not plea for their lives ) into believing he is human and he escapes with Gigolo Joe ( Jude Law ) , a male prostitute Mecha on the run after being framed for the murder of a client by the client 's husband . 
 The two set out to find the Blue Fairy , who David remembers from the story The Adventures of Pinocchio . He is convinced that the Blue Fairy will transform him into a human boy , allowing Monica to love him and take him home . 
 Joe and David make their way to Rouge City , a Las Vegas @-@ esque resort . Information from a holographic answer engine called " Dr. Know " ( Robin Williams ) eventually leads them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flooded ruins of Manhattan . There , David meets an identical copy of himself and , believing he is not special , becomes filled with anger and destroys the copy Mecha . David then meets his human creator , Professor Allen Hobby ( William Hurt ) , who excitedly tells David that finding him was a test , which has demonstrated the reality of his love and desire . However , David learns that he is the namesake and image of Professor Hobby 's deceased son and that many copies of David , along with female versions called Arlene , are already being manufactured . 
 Sadly realizing that he is not unique , a disheartened David attempts to commit suicide by falling from a ledge into the ocean , but Joe rescues him with their stolen <unk> . David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater and wants to go down to her . At that moment , Joe is captured by the authorities with the use of an electromagnet , but he sets the <unk> on submerge . David and Teddy take it to the fairy , which turns out to be a statue from a submerged attraction at Coney Island . Teddy and David become trapped when the Wonder Wheel falls on their vehicle . Believing the Blue Fairy to be real , David asks to be turned into a real boy , repeating his wish without an end , until the ocean freezes in another ice age and his internal power source drains away . 
 Two thousand years later , humans are extinct and Manhattan is buried under several hundred feet of glacial ice . The now highly advanced Mecha have evolved into an intelligent , silicon @-@ based form . On their project to study humans — believing it was the key to understanding the meaning of existence — they find David and Teddy and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans , making the pair very special and unique . 
 David is revived and walks to the frozen Blue Fairy statue , which cracks and collapses as he touches it . Having downloaded and comprehended his memories , the advanced Mecha use these to reconstruct the Swinton home and explain to David via an interactive image of the Blue Fairy ( Meryl Streep ) that it is impossible to make him human . However , at David 's insistence , they recreate Monica from DNA in the lock of her hair , which Teddy had saved . One of the Mecha warns David that the clone can live for only a single day and that the process cannot be repeated . The next morning , David is reunited with Monica and spends the happiest day of his life with her and Teddy . Monica tells David that she loves him and has always loved him as she drifts to sleep for the last time . David lies down next to her , closes his eyes and goes " to that place where dreams are born " . Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches as David and Monica lie peacefully together .

 Kubrick began development on an adaptation of Super @-@ Toys Last All Summer Long in the early 1970s , hiring the short story 's author , Brian Aldiss , to write a film treatment . In 1985 , Kubrick brought longtime friend Steven Spielberg on board to produce the film , along with Jan Harlan . Warner Bros. agreed to co @-@ finance A.I. and cover distribution duties . The film labored in development hell , and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989 . Bob Shaw served as writer very briefly , leaving after six weeks because of Kubrick 's demanding work schedule , and Ian Watson was hired as the new writer in March 1990 . Aldiss later remarked , " Not only did the bastard fire me , he hired my enemy [ Watson ] instead . " Kubrick handed Watson The Adventures of Pinocchio for inspiration , calling A.I. " a picaresque robot version of Pinocchio " . 
 Three weeks later Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment , and concluded his work on A.I. in May 1991 with another treatment , at 90 pages . Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a GI Mecha , but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute . Kubrick joked , " I guess we lost the kiddie market . " In the meantime , Kubrick dropped A.I. to work on a film adaptation of Wartime Lies , feeling computer animation was not advanced enough to create the David character . However , after the release of Spielberg 's Jurassic Park ( with its innovative use of computer @-@ generated imagery ) , it was announced in November 1993 that production would begin in 1994 . Dennis Muren and Ned Gorman , who worked on Jurassic Park , became visual effects supervisors , but Kubrick was displeased with their previsualization , and with the expense of hiring Industrial Light & Magic . 
 = = = Pre @-@ production = = = 
 In early 1994 , the film was in pre @-@ production with Christopher " Fangorn " Baker as concept artist , and Sara Maitland assisting on the story , which gave it " a feminist fairy @-@ tale focus " . Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A.I. , but as Pinocchio . Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor . Some of his unproduced work for A.I. can be seen on the DVD , The Work of Director Chris Cunningham . Aside from considering computer animation , Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role . Cunningham helped assemble a series of " little robot @-@ type humans " for the David character . " We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing , " producer Jan Harlan reflected . " But it was a total failure , it looked awful . " Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant . Meanwhile , Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. would be closer to Steven Spielberg 's sensibilities as director . Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995 , but Spielberg chose to direct other projects , and convinced Kubrick to remain as director . The film was put on hold due to Kubrick 's commitment to Eyes Wide Shut ( 1999 ) . After the filmmaker 's death in March 1999 , Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg to take over the director 's position . By November 1999 , Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson 's 90 @-@ page story treatment . It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) . Spielberg remained close to Watson 's treatment , but removed various sex scenes with Gigolo Joe . Pre @-@ production was briefly halted during February 2000 , because Spielberg pondered directing other projects , which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha . The following month Spielberg announced that A.I. would be his next project , with Minority Report as a follow @-@ up . When he decided to fast track A.I. , Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The original start date was July 10 , 2000 , but filming was delayed until August . Aside from a couple of weeks shooting on location in Oxbow Regional Park in Oregon , A.I. was shot entirely using sound stages at Warner Bros. Studios and the Spruce Goose Dome in Long Beach , south LA . The Swinton house was constructed on Stage 16 , while Stage 20 was used for Rouge City and other sets . Spielberg copied Kubrick 's obsessively secretive approach to filmmaking by refusing to give the complete script to cast and crew , banning press from the set , and making actors sign confidentiality agreements . Social robotics expert Cynthia <unk> served as technical consultant during production . Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law applied prosthetic makeup daily in an attempt to look shinier and robotic . Costume designer Bob Ringwood ( Batman , Troy ) studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras . Spielberg found post @-@ production on A.I. difficult because he was simultaneously preparing to shoot Minority Report .

 The film 's soundtrack was released by Warner Sunset Records in 2001 . The original score was composed by John Williams and featured singers Lara Fabian on two songs and Josh Groban on one . The film 's score also had a limited release as an official " For your consideration Academy Promo " , as well as a complete score issue by La @-@ La Land Records in 2015 .

 Warner Bros. used an alternate reality game titled The Beast to promote the film . Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City ( kept online at <unk> ) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the Xbox video game console that followed the storyline of The Beast , but they went undeveloped . To avoid audiences mistaking A.I. for a family film , no action figures were created , although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film 's release in June 2001 . 
 In November 2000 , during production , a video @-@ only webcam ( dubbed the " Bagel Cam " ) was placed in the craft services truck on the film 's set at the Queen Mary Dome in Long Beach , California .

 The film received generally positive reviews . Based on 190 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , 73 % of the critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6 @.@ 6 out of 10 .

 Producer Jan Harlan stated that Kubrick " would have applauded " the final film , while Kubrick 's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I. Brian Aldiss admired the film as well : " I thought what an inventive , intriguing , ingenious , involving film this was . There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it 's so long since I wrote it . " Of the film 's ending , he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film : " That is one of the ' ifs ' of film history - at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick 's wine . The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence . But it 's a brilliant piece of film and of course it 's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers . " Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg 's direction , as well as the cast and visual effects . Roger Ebert awarded the film 4 out of 4 stars , saying that it was " Audacious , technically masterful , challenging , sometimes moving [ and ] ceaselessly <unk> Maltin gives the film a not @-@ so @-@ positive review in his Movie Guide , giving it two stars out of four , writing : " [ The ] intriguing story draws us in , thanks in part to Osment 's exceptional performance , but takes several wrong turns ; ultimately , it just doesn 't work . Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story ' Super Toys Last All Summer Long ' ; [ the ] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities . " However , he calls John Williams ' music score " striking " . Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris ( 1972 ) , and praised both " Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick 's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work . " Film critic Armond White , of the New York Press , praised the film noting that " each part of David ’ s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema ’ s most thoughtful , speculative artists – Borzage , Ozu , <unk> , Tarkovsky . " Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as " the most underrated film of the past few years . " When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film , he wept during the ending . 
 Mick LaSalle gave a largely negative review . " A.I. exhibits all its creators ' bad traits and none of the good . So we end up with the structureless , meandering , slow @-@ motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy , cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg . " Dubbing it Spielberg 's " first boring movie " , LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens , and compared Gigolo Joe to the " useless " Jar Jar Binks , yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic Albert Einstein . Peter Travers gave a mixed review , concluding " Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick 's darker side of the future . " But he still put the film on his top ten list that year for best movies . David Denby in The New Yorker criticized A.I. for not adhering closely to his concept of the Pinocchio character . Spielberg responded to some of the criticisms of the film , stating that many of the " so called sentimental " elements of A.I. , including the ending , were in fact Kubrick 's and the darker elements were his own . However , Sara Maitland , who worked on the project with Kubrick in the 1990s , claimed that one of the reasons Kubrick never started production on A.I. was because he had a hard time making the ending work . James Berardinelli found the film " consistently involving , with moments of near @-@ brilliance , but far from a masterpiece . In fact , as the long @-@ awaited ' collaboration ' of Kubrick and Spielberg , it ranks as something of a disappointment . " Of the film 's highly debated finale , he claimed , " There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg ; the outstanding question is where Kubrick 's vision left off and Spielberg 's began . " 
 Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated , " Worldwide , A.I. was very successful ( and the 4th highest earner of the year ) but it didn 't do quite so well in America , because the film , so I 'm told , was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes . Plus , quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film , thinking for instance that the Giacometti @-@ style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens ( whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film ) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg , whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted , filmed faithfully by Spielberg . " 
 In 2002 , Spielberg told film critic Joe Leydon that " People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick , and think they know me , when most of them don 't know either of us " . " And what 's really funny about that is , all the parts of A.I. that people assume were Stanley 's were mine . And all the parts of A.I. that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley 's . The teddy bear was Stanley 's . The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley 's . The whole first 35 , 40 minutes of the film – all the stuff in the house – was word for word , from Stanley 's screenplay . This was Stanley 's vision . " " Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up . But I could see why . Because , obviously , I 've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental . And I 've been accused of sentimentalizing hard @-@ core material . But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of A.I. , not me . I 'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie , with the Flesh Fair and everything else . That 's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place . He said , ' This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own . ' " 
 Upon rewatching the film many years after its release , BBC film critic Mark Kermode apologized to Spielberg in an interview in January 2013 for " getting it wrong " on the film when he first viewed it in 2001 . He now believes the film to be Spielberg 's " enduring masterpiece " .

 A Night to Remember is a 1955 non @-@ fiction book by Walter Lord about the sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912 . The book was hugely successful , and is still considered a definitive resource about the Titanic . Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books , memoirs and articles that they had written . He authored a follow @-@ up book , The Night Lives On , in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found . 
 The film A Night to Remember , based on the book and with advice from Lord , was released in 1958 . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Lord traveled on the RMS Olympic , Titanic 's sister ship , when he was a boy and the experience gave him a lifelong fascination with the lost liner . As he later put it , he spent his time on the Olympic " prowling around " and trying to imagine " such a huge thing " sinking . He started reading about and drawing Titanic at the age of ten and spent many years collecting Titanic memorabilia , causing people to " take note of this oddity . " He majored in history at Princeton University and graduated from Yale Law School before joining the New York @-@ based advertising agency J. Walter Thompson . Writing in his spare time , he interviewed 63 survivors of the disaster . 
 A Night to Remember was only Lord 's second book but was a huge success , thanks in no small part to the aggressive advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955 . The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time . Within two months of its publication , the book had sold 60 @,@ 000 copies and remained listed as a best @-@ seller for six months . The Ladies ' Home Journal and Reader 's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club . The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956 . 
 Since then the book has never been out of print and has been translated into over a dozen languages . Its success enabled Lord to leave the world of advertising and become a full @-@ time writer . After the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in 1985 sparked a new wave of public interest in the disaster he wrote a follow @-@ up book , The Night Lives On ( 1986 ) . Daniel Allen Butler comments that " although it was of immense interest to Titanic buffs the world over , it lacked the spark of the original , " which by 1998 had reached its fiftieth printing . 
 = = Critical commentaries = = 
 The book received widespread praise from contemporary critics . The New York Times called it " stunning ... one of the most exciting books of this or any other year " . The Atlantic Monthly praised the book for doing " a magnificent job of re @-@ creative chronicling , enthralling from the first word to the last . " Entertainment Weekly said that it was " seamless and skillful ... it 's clear why this is many a researcher 's Titanic bible " , while USA Today described it as " the most riveting narrative of the disaster . " 
 The secret to Lord 's success , according to the New York Herald Tribune 's critic Stanley Walker , was that he used " a kind of literary pointillism , the arrangement of contrasting bits of fact and emotion in such a fashion that a vividly real impression of an event is conveyed to the reader . " Walker highlighted the way that Lord had avoided telling the story through the prism of social class , which had been the usual style of previous narratives , and instead successfully depicted the human element of the story by showing how those aboard reacted to the disaster whatever their class . 
 Steven Biel , an American cultural historian , notes the novelistic way in which Lord tells the story . The book depicts events through the eyes of multiple individuals , violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives . Nathaniel Philbrick , writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of A Night to Remember , notes that at the time of publication it was the first significant book about Titanic for nearly forty years . He argues that the book 's hallmarks are its restraint , brevity and readability , which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship . The narrative builds suspense , making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective . It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way , describing the sights and sounds of the night of the disaster " with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary " , as Biel puts it . 
 A key to Lord 's method is his technique of adopting an unconventional approach to the chronology of the event , " [ taking ] an imaginative approach to time and space in which hours and minutes prove extremely malleable , the ship itself seems almost infinitely complex , and the disaster assumes order and unity from far away . " In short it is " a modernist narrative [ constructed ] around a modernist event . " Reviewers highlighted the way in which Lord depicted the human side of the Titanic story , which The New York Times called " the core of Mr. Lord 's account , and explains its fascination , a pull as powerful in its way as the last downward plunge of the ship itself . " While the " legendary acts of gallantry " stood out , the book invites readers to put themselves in the place of those aboard and implicitly asks how they would react in the same situation . As Newsweek put it , " What would it be like to be aboard a sinking ocean liner ? " 
 The significance of Lord 's book , according to Biel , is that it " gave the disaster its fullest retelling since 1912 and made it speak to a modern mass audience and a new set of postwar concerns . In the creation of the Titanic myth there were two defining moments : 1912 , of course , and 1955 . " Lord updates the popular interpretation of the Titanic disaster by portraying it in world @-@ historical terms as the symbolic and actual end of an era , and as an event which " marked the end of a general feeling of confidence . " Uncertainty replaced orderliness , and the ship 's sinking marked the beginning of the twentieth century 's " unending sequence of disillusionment . Before the Titanic , all was quiet . Afterward , all was tumult . " Biel notes that Lord 's underlying theme is a rather nostalgic reflection of the " nobler instincts " exhibited in the disaster and their subsequent eclipse . Such ideals were attractive for a post @-@ war society that celebrated the role of the nuclear family and the traditional roles of the male breadwinner and female homemaker . 
 Lord 's invocation of an era of confidence and certainty was also a relevant theme at the height of the Cold War . The University of California sociologist Fred Davis comments that nostalgia " thrives ... on the rude transitions wrought by such phenomena as war , depression , civil disturbance , and cataclysmic natural disasters – in short , those events that cause masses of people to feel uneasy and to wonder whether the world and their being are quite what they always took them to be . " The turmoil and uncertainty of the early Atomic Age and the onset of profound social changes made the old concepts of the nuclear family and traditional gender roles , reflected in the behaviour of Titanic 's passengers , resonate with a mid @-@ 1950s audience . 
 The gradual nature of the disaster was also more comforting , in some respects , compared with the nature of modern technological failures such as air crashes . Time 's reviewer made this point explicitly : " This air age , when death comes too swiftly for heroism or with no survivors to record it , can still turn with wonder to an age before yesterday when a thousand deaths at sea seemed the very worst the world must suffer . " It was , as Steven Biel comments , " a <unk> kind of disaster " in which the victims had time to prepare and chose how to die .

 The book has been adapted twice for the screen . The first production was staged as a live adaptation screened on 28 March 1956 by NBC TV and sponsored by Kraft Foods as part of the Kraft Television Theatre strand . It has been described as " the biggest , most lavish , most expensive thing of its kind " attempted up to that point , with 31 sets , 107 actors , 72 speaking parts , 3 @,@ 000 gallons of water and costing $ 95 @,@ 000 ( $ 826 @,@ 860 @.@ 5 at present @-@ day prices ) . George Roy Hill directed and Claude Rains provided a narration – a practice borrowed from radio dramas which provided a template for many television dramas of the time . It took a similar approach to the book , lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes . Rains ' narration was used " to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner " , as a reviewer put it , and closed with his declaration that " never again has Man been so confident . An age had come to an end . " The production was a major hit , attracting 28 million viewers , and greatly boosted the book 's sales . It was rerun on kinescope on 2 May 1956 , five weeks after its first broadcast . 
 The second adaptation was the classic 1958 British drama film A Night to Remember starring Kenneth More , which is still widely regarded as " the definitive cinematic telling of the story . " The film came about after its eventual director , Roy Ward Baker , and its producer , Belfast @-@ born William MacQuitty both acquired copies of the book – Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife – and decided to obtain the film rights . MacQuitty had actually seen Titanic being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly . He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant . The film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character , Second Officer Charles Lightoller , played by More . Its conclusion reflects Lord 's world @-@ historical theme of a " world changed for ever " with a fictional conversation between two survivors , Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie , sitting on an overturned lifeboat .

 <unk> Montez Blount ( born December 5 , 1986 ) is an American football running back for the New England Patriots of the National Football League ( NFL ) . He won Super Bowl XLIX with the Patriots over the reigning champion Seattle Seahawks . He was signed by the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League ( NFL ) as an undrafted free agent in 2010 . He has also been a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Pittsburgh Steelers . 
 Blount rushed for over 1 @,@ 000 yards in each of his two seasons in junior college . He then committed to the Oregon Ducks football program as a junior , for the 2008 season . That year he ran for over 1 @,@ 000 yards and scored a school record 17 touchdowns . 
 After the opening game of the 2009 season , Blount was suspended for punching a Boise State University opponent and angrily confronting fans after the nationally televised season @-@ opening loss . Though the suspension was announced to be for the remainder of the season , due to his meeting of specific criteria set by the football staff , he was eventually reinstated after missing eight games .

 Blount was born December 5 , 1986 , in Madison , Florida , to Gary and Barbara Blount . He has one brother and one sister . Blount is the great @-@ nephew of avant @-@ garde jazz musician Sun Ra ( born Herman Blount ) . He attended Taylor County High School in the small town of Perry , Florida , where he was a two @-@ sport star in both football and track . In high school football , he was a four @-@ year starter and three @-@ time 1 @,@ 000 @-@ yard rusher . He first reached the milestone as a sophomore and equaled the feat the following season despite playing with a thigh bruise for most of the year . He accorded second @-@ team All @-@ state player honors as a prep senior . In track & field , Blount competed in events such as the 100 @-@ meter dash ( 11 @.@ 34 s ) , the long jump ( 22 @-@ 1 or <unk> ) and the shot put ( 53 @-@ 2 or <unk> ) .

 Considered only a two @-@ star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com , Blount was not ranked among the best running back prospects in the nation in 2005 .

 While at East Mississippi Community College in <unk> , Mississippi , Blount rushed for more than 1 @,@ 000 yards in each of his two seasons , accumulating 367 carries for 2 @,@ 292 yards and 18 rushing touchdowns . Among his career highlights was a 273 @-@ yard performance with three scores in a win over Northeast Mississippi Community College during his freshman year ; he led the state of Mississippi in rushing yards with 1 @,@ 106 as early as October 2006 . Blount was rated as the No. 1 junior college prospect by The Clarion @-@ Ledger and received Junior College All @-@ American honors . 
 By the end of his sophomore year , Blount had become one of the highest ranked junior college prospects . He was named the nation ’ s top junior college running back and the No. 12 overall prospect in the Rivals.com Junior College Top 100 . Blount was heavily recruited by several high @-@ major schools , including Florida State , Ole Miss , and West Virginia . He committed to Oregon in December 2007 .

 Blount entered his junior year at Oregon sharing the running back role with senior Jeremiah Johnson . The two backs lived together , and the talkative Johnson advised Blount in his first Pac @-@ 10 season . For Blount , it was the first season in which he split time with another running back , and his reaction was mixed . The two backs each contributed nearly 100 yards and three touchdowns in an early 63 – 14 win over the Washington State Cougars , and both again performed well in a late season victory over the Oregon State Beavers . But Blount brought lackluster performances to games against USC and Cal . Overall , Blount rushed for 17 touchdowns , setting a single @-@ season school record , and 1 @,@ 002 yards . Blount and Johnson became only the second duo in team history to both clear 1 @,@ 000 rushing yards in the same season ; Johnson led the team with 1 @,@ 201 yards . 
 He clashed several times during the season with veteran head coach Mike Bellotti , earning a suspension for the first quarter of a November loss to the Cal Golden Bears for " not following team rules . " 
 After the end of the season , he missed a number of workouts . Bellotti suspended him indefinitely on February 10 for " failure to fulfill team obligations . " 
 Blount responded fairly well to the suspension , improving his attendance in both academic and athletic pursuits . He was reinstated by newly appointed head coach Chip Kelly in March . He attended some , but not all , voluntary workouts during the off @-@ season , but was praised for an improved attitude by fellow members of the football program . He arrived at training camp in better physical shape than in 2008 . At 243 pounds ( 110 kg ) , he was somewhat above his optimal weight , but was slimming down , and aiming for a 2 @,@ 000 yard season . Blount was named to the watch lists for the Walter Camp Award and the Doak Walker Award for the 2009 season . 
 = = = = Boise State incident = = = = 
 The Ducks opened their 2009 season with a 19 – 8 loss to the Boise State Broncos . Blount ended the game with negative yardage ( − 8 ) . Blount had been interviewed by a Sports Illustrated reporter earlier in the summer and was asked about the excessive late hits in the 2008 game in Eugene between Oregon and Boise State . He had been quoted that because of the way Boise State beat Oregon in Eugene they " owed them an ass @-@ <unk> ' . " In the 2008 game , Oregon quarterback Jeremiah <unk> was forced to leave the game after taking a helmet to the chin on a late hit by a Boise State defender . Oregon lost that game but the late hits were a topic of discussion as the teams prepared for the season opener against each other . Shortly after the game 's end , Boise State defensive player Byron Hout came up to Blount during the team 's handshakes and said , " How 's that for an ass @-@ <unk> ' ? " Blount punched Hout , knocking him to the ground . Blount then hit teammate Garrett Embry , who was attempting to restrain him , in the helmet . 
 As he was escorted to the locker room , Blount confronted Boise State fans who were jeering at him after seeing the video replay . Blount says that one Boise State fan brandished a chair at him and another punched him . Two police officers and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him into the locker room . Video of the incident spread rapidly on the Internet . 
 Blount apologized after the incident saying , " I just apologize to everybody that was watching this — ESPN , national TV — I just apologize to all of our fans , all the Boise fans . It was just something that I shouldn 't have done . I lost my head , and I shouldn 't have taken it that far . " 
 Suspension 
 Oregon coach Chip Kelly suspended Blount for the rest of the 2009 season . According to the Associated Press , " On Friday [ Kelly ] told a sobbing Blount of his decision : That punch would cost Blount the season , and ultimately his career with the Ducks . ' He understands that his actions are unacceptable . We will not put up with that . ' Kelly said . " Blount was not dismissed from the team , however , and would be permitted to attend practice and retain his scholarship . 
 Chip Kelly consulted with Oregon officials in advance of Blount 's suspension . Afterward , the Pac @-@ 10 expressed support for the suspension . Kelly stated that he made his judgment based on the entire event and had not theorized how it would have changed had only certain parts of the incident occurred . 
 Following the announcement of Blount 's punishment , a number of sports writers and analysts questioned whether or not suspension for the entire season was excessive . Wrote analyst Tom <unk> : " But did Blount 's punishment ( banned from games the rest of the season ) fit the crime ? Blount should have been benched for three to five games , giving him a break for being in an emotional spot after being provoked by Hout . " 
 Blount called Hout and Petersen to apologize on September 5 . Kelly participated in the calls . Hout was not suspended for his taunting , though Petersen stated that he did receive disciplinary action . Petersen accepted the apology as sincere , and expressed the wish that Blount would be able to go on playing football , and that many parties would learn from the experience . 
 Blount was given the opportunity to continue practicing with the team but was not at the first practice due to unspecified obligations . However , Blount was on the sidelines at practice the following day and began practice with the scout team a week later . 
 Reinstatement 
 On October 1 , an apology letter from Blount was published in the Oregon school newspaper the Oregon Daily Emerald . Later that day , the Oregon Athletic Department released a statement indicating that a plan that could reinstate Blount to the team was under consideration . The next day , head coach Chip Kelly announced that if Blount meets certain guidelines , he could return for the November 7 game against the Stanford Cardinal . Pac @-@ 10 commissioner Larry Scott responded that the conference alone had the power to reinstate Blount and would take Oregon 's appeal under consideration if it occurred . 
 Blount was not reinstated in time for the Stanford game , but two days after the Ducks ' loss to Stanford , the Ducks requested , and the Pac @-@ 10 approved , Blount 's reinstatement for the Ducks ' November 14 game against Arizona State . Blount released a statement thanking head coach Kelly for showing that he " cares enough to offer me this second chance " and that it was up to Blount to " prove to people that their lasting impressions of me are not what they saw in Boise . " Blount suited up for the Arizona State and Arizona games , but since his replacement , LaMichael James , was playing so well , Blount did not see any playing time in those games . 
 In their final game of the season , the Civil War against rival Oregon State , the Ducks trailed by 9 points in the third quarter . Blount came into the game for James and several plays later , scored on a 12 @-@ yard run to bring the Ducks within 2 points . Blount ended up rushing for 51 yards in the game and the Ducks would go on to win the game 37 – 33 and earn a berth in the 2010 Rose Bowl against Ohio State .

 Blount was not drafted in the 2010 NFL Draft but agreed in principle to a free agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers following the draft . However , after a meeting with Tennessee Titans head coach Jeff Fisher , Blount decided to sign as an undrafted free agent with the Titans instead . In August 2010 , Blount was involved in another incident in which he threw a punch , this time with a Tennessee Titans teammate , defensive end Eric <unk> , a few moments after having his own helmet ripped off in practice . The play ended with some pushing and shoving , Blount threw a right fist , contacting <unk> 's facemask . Blount quickly talked to Titans Head Coach Jeff Fisher before leaving the field . " He apologized , and I said he didn 't have to apologize , " Fisher said . " It 's football . It 's training camp . " " His past is his past . Is that the first punch you 've seen in camp this year ? No . I 'm not disappointed whatsoever . I have great confidence in the young man that he learned from his mistake , and he 's very competitive . That 's why we brought him in here is to watch him run the football like that , " Fisher said . Blount survived the final roster cut and was placed on the Titans ' 53 man roster . Blount was then waived to make room for veteran linebackers Tim Shaw ( Chicago Bears ) and Patrick Bailey ( Pittsburgh Steelers ) . Titans sources indicated that Blount would be signed to the rookie practice squad , if Blount cleared waivers . Blount was waived on September 5 , 2010 .

This is around the same time that Blount was pulled over for smoking cannabis in the suburbs of Pittsburgh , just seven miles north of the city On October 31 , 2010 , Blount recorded his breakout game as a Tampa Bay Buccaneer . He accumulated 120 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns on 22 carries , and 9 receiving yards in the Buccaneers ' 38 – 35 victory at the Arizona Cardinals .

 = Pong = 
 Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game . It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two @-@ dimensional graphics . While other arcade video games such as Computer Space came before it , Pong was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity . The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table @-@ tennis game by earning a higher score . The game was originally manufactured by Atari , which released it in 1972 . Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co @-@ founder Nolan Bushnell . Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping @-@ pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey , which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari . Surprised by the quality of Alcorn 's work , Bushnell and Atari co @-@ founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game . 
 Pong quickly became a success and is the first commercially successful arcade video game machine , which helped to establish the video game industry along with the first home console , the Magnavox Odyssey . Soon after its release , several companies began producing games that copied Pong 's gameplay , and eventually released new types of games . As a result , Atari encouraged its staff to produce more innovative games . The company released several sequels that built upon the original 's gameplay by adding new features . During the 1975 Christmas season , Atari released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores . It was also a commercial success and led to numerous copies . The game has been remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release . Pong has been referenced and parodied in multiple television shows and video games , and has been a part of several video game and cultural exhibitions . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Pong is a two @-@ dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis . The player controls an in @-@ game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen , and can compete against either a computer @-@ controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side . Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth . The aim is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent ; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other . 
 = = Development and history = = 
 Pong was the first game developed by Atari . After producing Computer Space , Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies . The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game . Soon after the founding , Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science ; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex . Prior to working at Atari , Alcorn had no experience with video games . To acclimate Alcorn to creating games , Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm @-@ up exercise . Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product , and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot , two paddles , and digits for score keeping . In 2011 , Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before ; Bushnell played a version on a PDP @-@ 1 computer in 1964 while attending college . However , Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell 's viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey 's Tennis game . In May 1972 , Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame , California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration , specifically the table tennis game . Though he thought the game lacked quality , seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn . 
 Alcorn first examined Bushnell 's schematics for Computer Space , but found them to be illegible . He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor – transistor logic and Bushnell 's game . Feeling the basic game was too boring , Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal . He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball 's angle of return . For example , the center segments return the ball a 90 ° angle in relation to the paddle , while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles . He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play ; missing the ball reset the speed . Another feature was that the in @-@ game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen . This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect . Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect , Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played ; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise . 
 Three months into development , Bushnell told Alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd . Dabney wanted the game to " boo " and " hiss " when a player lost a round . Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with digital circuits . After inspecting the sync generator , he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the game 's sound effects . To construct the prototype , Alcorn purchased a $ 75 Hitachi black @-@ and @-@ white television set from a local store , placed it into a 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wooden cabinet , and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry . The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability . 
 In August 1972 , Bushnell and Alcorn installed the Pong prototype at a local bar , Andy Capp 's Tavern . They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar 's manager , Bill Gattis ; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gattis . Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype on one of the tables near the other entertainment machines : a jukebox , pinball machines , and Computer Space . The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks . Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing ; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally , rather than the driving game . A few days later , the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gattis contacted Alcorn to fix it . Upon inspecting the machine , Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters . 
 After hearing about the game 's success , Bushnell decided there would be more profit for Atari to manufacture the game rather than license it , but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued . Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested — Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa — to preserve the relationships for future dealings . Upon hearing Bushnell 's comment , the two groups declined his offer . Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong ; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball , which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia . Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line . The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972 . Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office , but was unable to keep up with demand . The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly , about ten machines a day , many of which failed quality testing . Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities . By 1973 , they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners . 
 = = = Home version = = = 
 After the success of Pong , Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products . In 1974 , Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television : Home Pong . The system began development under the codename Darlene , named after an attractive female employee at Atari . Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype , and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games . The two worked in shifts to save time and money ; Lee worked on the design 's logic during the day , while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings . After the designs were approved , fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype . The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires , which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee ; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype was constructed . The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974 , and was , at the time , the highest @-@ performing chip used in a consumer product . 
 Bushnell and Gene Lipkin , Atari 's vice @-@ president of sales , approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong , but were rejected . Retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers . Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog . Atari staff discussed the game with a representative , Tom Quinn , who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal . Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere , Atari 's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers . In January 1975 , Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City , but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due to the fact that they did not know that they needed a private showing . 
 While at the show , they met Quinn again , and , a few days later , set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order . In order to gain approval from the Sporting Goods department , Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago . Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the Sears Tower and , despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game , obtained approval . Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75 @,@ 000 units in time for the Christmas season ; however , Quinn requested double the amount . Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150 @,@ 000 units , he agreed . Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by venture capitalist Don Valentine . Supervised by <unk> Tubb , the factory fulfilled the Sears order . The first units manufactured were branded with Sears ' " Tele @-@ Games " name . Atari later released a version under its own brand in 1976 . 
 = = = Lawsuit from Magnavox = = = 
 The success of Pong attracted the attention of Ralph Baer , the inventor of the Magnavox Odyssey , and his employer , Sanders Associates . Sanders had an agreement with Magnavox to handle the Odyssey 's <unk> , which included dealing with infringement on its exclusive rights . However , Magnavox had not pursued legal action against Atari and numerous other companies that released Pong clones . Sanders continued to apply pressure , and in April 1974 Magnavox filed suit against Atari , Bally Midway , Allied Leisure and Chicago Dynamics . Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Baer 's patents and his concept of electronic ping @-@ pong based on detailed records Sanders kept of the Odyssey 's design process dating back to 1966 . Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odyssey 's table tennis game prior to releasing Pong . In response to claims that he saw the Odyssey , Bushnell later stated that , " The fact is that I absolutely did see the Odyssey game and I didn 't think it was very clever . " 
 After considering his options , Bushnell decided to settle with Magnavox out of court . Bushnell 's lawyer felt they could win ; however , he estimated legal costs of US $ 1 @.@ 5 million , which would have exceeded Atari 's funds . Magnavox offered Atari an agreement to become a licensee for US $ 700 @,@ 000 . Other companies producing " Pong clones " — Atari 's competitors — would have to pay royalties . In addition , Magnavox would obtain the rights to Atari products developed over the next year . Magnavox continued to pursue legal action against the other companies , and proceedings began shortly after Atari 's settlement in June 1976 . The first case took place at the district court in Chicago , with Judge John Grady presiding . To avoid Magnavox obtaining rights to its products , Atari decided to delay the release of its products for a year , and withheld information from Magnavox 's attorneys during visits to Atari facilities . 
 = = Impact and legacy = = 
 The Pong arcade games manufactured by Atari were a great success . The prototype was well received by Andy Capp 's Tavern patrons ; people came to the bar solely to play the game . Following its release , Pong consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin @-@ operated machines . Bushnell estimated that the game earned US $ 35 – 40 per day , which he described as nothing he 'd ever seen before in the coin @-@ operated entertainment industry at the time . The game 's earning power resulted in an increase in the number of orders Atari received . This provided Atari with a steady source of income ; the company sold the machines at three times the cost of production . By 1973 , the company had filled 2 @,@ 500 orders , and , at the end of 1974 , sold more than 8 @,@ 000 units . The arcade cabinets have since become collector 's items with the cocktail @-@ table version being the rarest . Soon after the game 's successful testing at Andy Capp 's Tavern , other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it . Similar games appeared on the market three months later , produced by companies like <unk> and Nutting Associates . Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the solid state technology used in the game . When the company did file for patents , complications delayed the process . As a result , the market consisted primarily of " Pong clones " ; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines . Bushnell referred to the competitors as " Jackals " because he felt they had an unfair advantage . His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts . 
 Home Pong was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears ; around 150 @,@ 000 units were sold that holiday season . The game became Sears ' most successful product at the time , which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award . Similar to the arcade version , several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console 's success , many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games . Magnavox re @-@ released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features , and would later release updated versions . Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console ; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models . Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977 , which plays six variations of electronic tennis . The next year , it was followed by an updated version , the Color TV Game 15 , which features fifteen variations . The systems were Nintendo 's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves — they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey . The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare ; Atari 's Pong consoles are common , while APF Electronics ' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare . Prices among collectors , however , vary with rarity ; the Sears Tele @-@ Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand . 
 Several publications consider Pong the game that launched the video game industry as a lucrative enterprise . Video game author David Ellis sees the game as the cornerstone of the video game industry 's success , and called the arcade game " one of the most historically significant " titles . Kent attributes the " arcade phenomenon " to Pong and Atari 's games that followed it , and considers the release of the home version the successful beginning of home video game consoles . Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra referred to the game 's release as the start of a new entertainment medium , and commented that its simple , intuitive gameplay made it a success . Entertainment Weekly named Pong one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013 . Many of the companies that produced their own versions of Pong eventually became well @-@ known within the industry . Nintendo entered the video game market with clones of Home Pong . The revenue generated from them — each system sold over a million units — helped the company survive a difficult financial time , and spurred them to pursue video games further . After seeing the success of Pong , Konami decided to break into the arcade game market and released its first title , Maze . Its moderate success drove the company to develop more titles . Pong has also been used in programming classrooms to teach the fundamentals of languages such as Java and C + + . 
 Bushnell felt that Pong was especially significant in its role as a social lubricant , since it was multiplayer @-@ only and did not require each player to use more than one hand : " It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say , ' I 'd like to play Pong and there 's nobody to play . ' It was a way you could play games , you were sitting shoulder to shoulder , you could talk , you could laugh , you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends , you could put down your beer and hug . You could put your arm around the person . You could play left @-@ handed if you so desired . In fact , there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said , ' I met my wife playing Pong , ' and that 's kind of a nice thing to have achieved . " 
 = = = Sequels and remakes = = = 
 Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products , leading Atari to produce sequels in the years followings the original 's release : Pong Doubles , Super Pong , Ultra Pong , <unk> , and Pin @-@ Pong . The sequels feature similar graphics , but include new gameplay elements ; for example , Pong Doubles allows four players to compete in pairs , while <unk> has them compete against each other in a four way field . Bushnell also conceptualized a free @-@ to @-@ play version of Pong to entertain children in a Doctor 's office . He initially titled it Snoopy Pong and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy 's doghouse with the character on top , but retitled it to Puppy Pong and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action . Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese 's restaurants . In 1976 , Atari released Breakout , a single @-@ player variation of Pong where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball . Like Pong , Breakout was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay : Arkanoid , Alleyway , Break ' Em All . 
 Atari remade the game on numerous platforms . In 1977 , Pong and several variants of the game were featured in Video Olympics , one of the original release titles for the Atari 2600 . Pong has also been included in several Atari compilations on platforms including the Sega Mega Drive , PlayStation Portable , Nintendo DS , and personal computer . Through an agreement with Atari , Bally Gaming and Systems developed a slot machine version of the game . The Atari developed TD Overdrive includes Pong as an extra game to be played during the loading screen . In 1999 , the game was remade for home computers and the PlayStation with 3D graphics and power @-@ ups . In 2012 , Atari celebrated the 40th anniversary of Pong by releasing Pong World .

 Pong has appeared in several facets of popular culture . The game is prominently featured in episodes of television series : That ' 70s Show , King of the Hill , and Saturday Night Live . In 2006 , an American Express commercial featured Andy Roddick in a tennis match against the white , in @-@ game paddle . Other video games have also referenced and parodied Pong ; for example Neuromancer for the Commodore 64 and Banjo @-@ Kazooie : Nuts and Bolts for the Xbox 360 . The concert event Video Games Live has performed audio from Pong as part of a special retro " Classic Arcade Medley " . Frank Black 's song " Whatever Happened to Pong ? " on the album Teenager of the Year heavily references the game 's elements . 
 Dutch design studio Buro <unk> created a Pong @-@ themed clock as a fun project within their offices . After the studio decided to manufacture it for retail , Atari took legal action in February 2006 . The two companies eventually reached an agreement in which Buro <unk> could produce a limited number under license . In 1999 , French artist Pierre <unk> created an installation entitled " Atari Light " , in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play Pong on an illuminated ceiling . The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001 , and the Museo de Arte <unk> de Castilla y León in 2007 . The game was included in the London Barbican Art Gallery 's 2002 Game On exhibition meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history , development , and culture . 
 = Trijata = 
 In the Hindu epic Ramayana , Trijata ( Sanskrit : त ् <unk> , <unk> ) is a rakshasi ( demoness ) who is assigned the duty of guarding the kidnapped princess and goddess Sita , the heroine of the epic . Sita , the consort of Rama ( the prince of Ayodhya and an avatar of the god Vishnu ) , has been abducted by Ravana of Lanka , a demon king whom Trijata serves . 
 In the Ramayana , Trijata appears as a wise old rakshasi , who dreams of Ravana 's destruction and Rama 's victory . She accompanies Sita on a survey of the battlefield of the war between Rama and Ravana , and reassures Sita of Rama 's well @-@ being when Sita sees her husband unconscious and presumes him dead . In later Ramayana adaptations , Trijata becomes the daughter of Vibhishana , the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama . She plays a much greater role in later versions , especially Southeast Asian ones . 
 Barring a few exceptions where Trijata is cast as Ravana 's agent , she is generally portrayed as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her adversity . On numerous occasions , she offers solace to Sita and brings news from the outside world ; she also dissuades Sita from committing suicide . After Rama 's victory and Ravana 's death , Trijata is richly rewarded by Sita and Rama . While some Ramayana adaptations mention her being a devotee of Rama , Southeast Asian versions often depict her as the wife of Rama 's monkey general Hanuman , whom she bears a son . She is worshipped as a local goddess in Varanasi and Ujjain ; both in India . 
 = = Names = = 
 While Indian , Javanese and Balinese versions of the Ramayana call her Trijata , she is known as <unk> in the Laotian Phra <unk> Phra Lam , <unk> in the Thai Ramakien and Devi Seri Jali in the Malay Hikayat Seri Rama . 
 = = The Ramayana = = 
 In the original Ramayana by Valmiki , Trijata is described as an aged rakshasi ( demoness ) who is prominently featured in two incidents . The first takes place in the Sundara Kanda , the epic 's fifth book . The kidnapped princess Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka . The demon @-@ king of Lanka , Ravana has ordered the <unk> who guard Sita to convince her to marry him by any means possible , since Sita adamantly refuses and is still faithful to her husband Rama . After Ravana leaves , the rakshasis start to harass Sita to compel her to change her will . The aged Trijata intervenes and narrates a prophetic dream that predicts Ravana 's doom and Rama 's victory . 
 In her dream , Trijata sees Rama and his brother Lakshmana riding the celestial elephant Airavata toward Sita . Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky , allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon . Then the trio ride to Lanka and get into the Pushpaka Vimana ( aerial chariot of Ravana ) to fly towards the north , while Ravana , drenched in oil and with a red complexion , lies on the ground . Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung . A black woman in a red saree , drags him to the south . Other members of Ravana 's family , like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit , face similar fates . Ravana 's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments , riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana . The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey ( vanara ) messenger of Rama burns the city . Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her ; in turn , Sita promises that if Trijata 's dream materializes , she will protect her rakshasi guards . 
 The second incident is found in the sixth book , Yuddha Kanda . Rama and his brother Lakshmana come with a monkey army to rescue Sita from the clutches of the demon @-@ king . On the first day of war , Ravana 's son Indrajit binds the brothers with the weapon <unk> ( serpent @-@ noose ) and the brothers lose consciousness . Ravana sends Sita with Trijata to see the battlefield . Thinking her husband is dead , Sita laments , but is reassured by Trijata that the brothers are still alive . Trijata expresses her love for Sita and tells her that the captive 's " moral character and gentle nature " have compelled her to love her . 
 = = Trijata and Vibhishana = = 
 In the Ramayana , Sita has few other rakshasi benefactors besides Trijata . When Hanuman – the monkey @-@ general of Rama who was tasked to find Sita – meets her in Lanka , she tells him that the wife of Vibhishana ( the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama in the war ) sent her daughter Kala ( in other recensions of the Ramayana , known as Nanda or <unk> ) to proclaim Ravana 's intention to not surrender Sita to Rama , despite the advice of the wise minister Avindhya and <unk> . Another friend , Sarama , consoles Sita when Ravana shows Sita an illusory severed head of Rama . She also informs her of Rama 's well @-@ being and his entry in Lanka with his army . In some versions of the Ramayana , an interpolated canto mentions how Sarama also tells Sita of the burning of Lanka by Hanuman after his meeting with Sita . Ravana 's wife Mandodari is described to have rescued Sita in some versions , when Ravana tries to kill Sita . In later Rama @-@ centric literature , Sarama was identified as Vibishana 's wife , while Trijata was regarded as his daughter . 
 The Tamil epic Kamba Ramayana , <unk> 's commentary on the Ramayana ( <unk> ) , the Oriya Balaramadasa Ramayana , the Javanese Kakawin Ramayana and the Malay Seri Rama all accord the status of Vibhishana 's daughter to Trijata , a trend generally followed by post @-@ Ramayana literature . Though <unk> 's commentary on the Ramayana states that Trijata is Vibhishana 's daughter in the epic , Goldman considers this " strange " given her advanced age in the original epic . 
 A few works relate Trijata to Vibhishana in a position other than his daughter . The Ananda Ramayana and the Marathi Bhavartha Ramayana of Eknath regard Trijata as the wife and the sister of Vibhishana ( thus sister of Ravana ) respectively . The Jain version , the <unk> of <unk> Gani , says Trijata is a sister of Ravana , Vibhishana , Kumbhakarna , and Shurpanakha . <unk> 's commentary on the Bhattikavya also describes Trijata as Ravana 's sister . 
 = = Trijata and Sita = = 
 In later literature , Trijata plays the roles which were attributed to Kala , Sarama , and Mandodari in the original Ramayana . She becomes a more important character in Southeast Asian versions of the Ramayana , particularly in Indonesian retellings such as the Kakawin Ramayana . 
 In the <unk> ( the narrative of Rama in the epic Mahabharata ) , Sita informs Hanuman that Trijata brought her a message from Avindhya about the well @-@ being of Rama , and that he and Lakshamana will soon come to rescue her from Lanka . Trijata thus assumes the role assigned to Kala in the original Ramayana . The Raghuvamsa , the <unk> , the Balaramadasa Ramayana , the Kakawin Ramayana and the Seri Rama all replace Sarama with Trijata in the episode where the truth of the illusory head of Rama is revealed to Sita . The Prasannaraghava has Trijata inform Sita about the burning of Lanka , instead of Sarama . The Balaramadasa Ramayana makes Trijata the saviour of Sita , when she stops Ravana from killing Sita in the Ashoka Vatika ; this role was originally assigned to Mandodari . Trijata again saves Sita 's life when a vengeful Ravana rushes to slay his captive after his son Indrajit is killed in the war . In the Ramayana , <unk> – a minister of Ravana – stops him , while other adaptations attribute the act variously to Avindhya or Mandodari . 
 Besides crediting Trijata for acts attributed to others in the original epic , later literature adds new elements which grant Trijata a bigger role . In the Ramayana , just before meeting Hanuman , the thought of suicide crosses Sita 's mind , but she never attempts it . In the Prasannaraghava , Trijata and Sita engage in a " friendly conversation " before Ravana comes to meet her . After Ravana 's departure , Sita tells Trijata of her intent to commit suicide and urges Trijata to help her create a wood pyre . Trijata , however , refuses , saying there is not enough firewood . The Kakawin Ramayana also narrates that , when Sita sees the illusory severed heads of Rama and Lakshmana , she prepares a pyre . Trijata is ready to die with Sita , but first wants to inform her father Vibhishana . She returns with the news of Rama 's well @-@ being . Later on , after seeing Rama and Lakshmana bound by Indrajit 's <unk> , Sita instructs Trijata to again create a pyre , but Trijata holds off until she can confirm the truth from her father , and returns with the news that Rama is alive . 
 Many adaptations of the Ramayana narrate the friendship and companionship developed between Trijata and Sita . Trijata fulfils two important objectives : she comforts Sita and constantly updates Sita about the happenings of the war and the welfare of Rama . The Balaramadasa Ramayana describes Trijata assuaging Sita 's grief when they hear that Indrajit has wounded Rama and Lakshmana a second time . In the <unk> of Rajasekhara , Trijata employs two rakshasas to bring her news from the battlefield . The Ananda Ramayana narrates that , upon hearing Lakshmana 's conch sound , Sita urges Trijata to find out what has happened . Trijata learns of the death of Indrajit by Lakshmana and passes the news to Sita . The Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas also depicts Trijata breaking the news of Indrajit 's death to Sita , upon her inquiry . In another episode in the text , the two discuss the impending duel between Rama and Ravana on the final day of war . Sita is concerned that the ten @-@ headed Ravana is invincible and will magically regrow his severed heads . Trijata reassures Sita that Rama will slay Ravana by shooting an arrow through the demon @-@ king 's heart . The text emphasizes that Trijata is a devotee of Rama , a feature also found in the Bhavartha Ramayana . 
 The Kakawin Ramayana says that , when Sita is tormented by her 300 rakshasi guards , only Trijata comes to her rescue and offers her solace , keeping her company and playing games with her . In the Seri Rama , Trijata ( here called " Dewi <unk> " ) is in charge of Sita 's custody in Lanka . Sita tells Ravana that she will not even consider Ravana 's marriage proposal while her husband is alive , and will believe he 's dead only if she sees his head in Ravana 's hands . To trick Sita , Ravana visits her with two heads and proclaims that they belong to Rama and Lakshmana , but Trijata stops him and asks him to return the next day . She presents the heads to Sita , who decides to commit suicide , but Trijata asks her to wait until she can verify the truth . Carrying Sita 's dagger , she meets Rama and in return receives a girdle woven by Sita from Rama . She is carried back to Lanka by Hanuman . When Ravana arrives the next day , <unk> rebukes him for his deception and informs him that she had met Rama herself the previous day . An enraged Ravana tries to kill Trijata , who runs and seeks refuge in Sita , who takes all the blame . Trijata is recused of her duties and Sita is transferred to an iron castle , guarded by an army commanded by one of Ravana 's ministers . 
 = = Trijata as Ravana 's agent = = 
 While Trijata is generally portrayed in a positive light , the early Jain versions of the Ramayana either ignore her or demonize her as an agent of Ravana . <unk> 's <unk> , as well as Hemachandra 's <unk> and Ramayana , say that when Hanuman meets Sita and shows her Rama 's signet @-@ ring , Sita is overjoyed ; Trijata reports this to her master Ravana . Hemachandra emphasizes that Trijata 's job was to " tempt " Sita at Ravana 's behest . The Krittivasi Ramayana , possibly influenced by Jain narratives , portrays Trijata appealing to Sita to wed Ravana and rule as the queen of Lanka ; it is Sarama who functions as Sita 's friend in this version . 
 = = After the war = = 
 Numerous Ramayana adaptations record the gratitude of Sita and Rama who reward Trijata richly . In the Mahabharata version , Trijata is rewarded and honoured by Rama at the end of the war . 
 The <unk> mentions that after the war , Trijata accompanies Sita to her kingdom Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana ; Rama uses the Pushpaka Vimana to return to Ayodhya . In the Ananda Ramayana , both Trijata and Sarama journey to Ayodhya in the Pushpaka Vimana . Later , when Sita visits Lanka , she tells Sarama to treat Trijata as if she would her . The Kakawin Ramayana mentions how Trijata is honoured with rich gifts by Sita at Ayodhya as her loyal companion and solace , and the one who saved her life twice . 
 The oldest Indian manuscript to mention Trijata 's presence in Ayodhya is the <unk> . Many suggest that , after Sita 's exile and the subsequent battle between Rama and his sons , Sita be <unk> by Rama . Trijata and <unk> are called from Lanka to attest to Sita 's chastity and both of them suggest an ordeal to convince the world of her purity . 
 In the Thai Ramakien , Hanuman helps Vibhishana ( here called <unk> ) kill a demon . Hanuman then marries Trijata ( <unk> ) ; their union results in the birth of a son , <unk> , a demon with a monkey head . In the Malay version , after the great war , Vibhishana requests that Hanuman wed his daughter Trijata ( Seri Jati ) . Hanuman agrees , on the condition that he remain with her for only a month . While Hanuman leaves for Ayodhya with Rama , Trijata gives birth to his son Hanuman <unk> ( <unk> ) . The Javanese Wayang golek puppet tradition also portrays Trijata as the wife of Hanuman . 
 = = Remembrance and assessment = = 
 Trijata is remembered as a friend and loyal companion of Sita in her time of need . Camille <unk> , an expert on the literature of Rama , summarizes Trijata 's character : 
 For more than twenty centuries the poets , who retold the Rāma @-@ story , have dealt lovingly on Trijatā 's friendship for Sītā . [ ... ] [ Trijatā ] conquered the heart of those poets , and through them , the heart of all those who become acquainted with the Rāma @-@ story . [ ... ] the poets of the <unk> [ ... ] conferred on the humble Trijatā the boon of immortality . No dream is better known in India than the dream of Trijatā , who will live for ever in the hearts of millions as the ideal of a true friend , because she comforted Sītā in her darkest hour : A <unk> IN <unk> IS A <unk> <unk> . 
 A temple dedicated to Trijata ( called <unk> in this region ) is situated near the Kashi Vishwanath Temple , the most prominent temple in Varanasi . As per local lore , Trijata wanted to accompany Sita to Ayodhya , but Sita said that she would not be allowed in Ayodhya as she was a demoness . Sita suggested her to visit Varanasi and attain moksha ( emancipation ) and blessed her to be worshipped as a goddess . Trijata enjoys daily worship as a local goddess . Flowers and green vegetables are offered to appease her . Women - who worship at her shrine for seven consecutive Wednesdays - are believed to be blessed with progeny and with the goddess ' protective glaze on their family . Many devotees flock the shrine on Kartik Poornima , the last day of the Hindu month of Kartik and its next day , the first day of Margashirsha month . It is believed that the goddess will fulfill the wishes of all who worship at her shrine , after paying obeisance at Kashi Vishwanath Temple on Kartik Poornima . On the first day of Margashirsha , worshippers who had observed a vrata ( fast ) in the previous month of Kartik conclude the vrata by bathing in the Ganges at the Dashashwamedh Ghat in the name of Trijata . Local lore holds that Rama granted a boon to Trijata : those who do not bathe in her honour after observing the vrata will lose all merit ( punya ) – gained from the fast – to her . 
 A temple of Trijata also exists in the temple complex of <unk> Hanuman Temple , Ujjain . Special puja ( worship rituals ) is offered to the goddess for 3 days , starting from Kartik Poornima . 
 In the Telugu Sita <unk> , Ramaswami <unk> portrays Trijata as the daughter of the Dravidian Vibhishana and the Aryan Gandharva Sarama . Trijata , a half @-@ Aryan , is labelled a traitor , who betrays her uncle Ravana and helps Sita . Vibhishana 's betrayal towards his brother and defection to Rama is also blamed on his Aryan wife .

 Don Draper ( Jon Hamm ) is being interviewed by a reporter from Advertising Age and declines to speak about his personal life . As a result , he comes across as arrogant and a cipher in the published story , a fact that senior partners Roger Sterling ( John Slattery ) and Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) lament . The effects of the bad publicity is brought home just after Harry Crane ( Rich Sommer ) has sold a Jai <unk> special to ABC , but it must be pulled because the client , Pete Campbell 's ( Vincent Kartheiser ) college friend , Horace Cook Jr . , nicknamed " Ho Ho " , fires the agency because Draper did not mention the client in his interview . Because of the agency 's narrow client base , the loss is financially detrimental . Bert suggests Don do an interview with The Wall Street Journal to make amends , but Don demurs . Later , Peggy Olson ( Elisabeth Moss ) comes up with an idea to regain the <unk> Ham account . She hires two actresses to fight over a ham in a grocery store . The plan goes awry when the fight turns real and one of the women sues the other for assault , and Peggy has to ask Don for bail and hush money .

 A different client , Jantzen swimwear , asks for help to maintain a family @-@ friendly image in a field where bikinis are becoming more common and more revealing . Don Draper tries to sell a pitch wherein the model 's breasts are covered by the slogan , " So well built , we can 't show you the second floor " . The Jantzen representatives reject the ad as overly risque , and Draper - exasperated by the clients ' refusal to acknowledge a changing culture and the realities of their business - ends up throwing the men out of the meeting room . As they leave , he finally agrees to do the interview with The Wall Street Journal . As the episode ends , Don is seen telling the journalist the swashbuckling story of how he instigated the formation of SCDP by having Lane Pryce fire them .

President Barack Obama , a fan of Mad Men , had sent series creator Matthew Weiner a letter to express his admiration .

A week prior to the premiere of the episode , recurring cast member Crista Flanagan ( who plays Lois Sadler ) posed nude for Playboy . 
 Screenings for the episode was shown in Los Angeles , California on July 21 , 2010 , and again five days later at Duffy Square in New York City an hour before it was televised nationwide . An estimated 10 @,@ 000 people appeared at the screening in New York City . The designs of costumes were altered , according to Bryant , to reflect the general fashion development and changes in mainstream pop culture during the 1960s . In an interview with the San Francisco Chronicle , she teased : " My characters are in an office environment in New York ; it 's very different from what was going on in London at the time . But there will be some progression in their costumes , just like in real life . 
 The press were given advanced copies of the episode . Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review . Weiner criticized the episode 's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times , expressing that the publication revealed too much information . He continued : " I 'm kind of powerless . It 's the bargain you make . I wanted to have press , and it was nice to get that kind of space with those pictures . The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don ’ t ? It was all very disappointing to me . 
 " Public Relations " features several references to media , music , film , and other pop culture phenomena . Peggy and a coworker engage in a humorous conversation , in which they subsequently refer to " A Dear John and Marsha Letter " by Stan Freberg . The episode depicts the growing acceptance of the bikini in mainstream popular culture in the United States during the 1960s .

 On 5 May 2009 on the News at One on RTÉ Radio 1 , Lee announced that he was resigning as Economic Editor with RTÉ and announced his intention to seek the Fine Gael nomination for the Dublin South by @-@ election in 2009 . Lee took a year 's unpaid leave from RTÉ in May 2009 . On 6 May 2009 Lee was chosen as the Fine Gael candidate for the by @-@ election . He was the only candidate for the nomination . 
 He was elected on the first count to represent Dublin South on 6 June 2009 . He received over 53 % of the 1st preference vote . In total he received 27 @,@ 768 1st preference votes . His RTÉ position was filled by Europe editor Sean Whelan , but only as correspondent . Instead , David Murphy was promoted to Business Editor . When elected , Lee was referred to as a " Celebrity TD " . 
 In an opinion poll concerning support for possible candidates in the 2011 presidential election conducted by the Sunday Independent in October 2009 , Lee came third , receiving 12 % support , in front of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern among other high @-@ profile politicians . 
 Lee highlighted the failure of <unk> , the holding company for US publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , and the potential impact on the Irish taxpayers of the loans given by Anglo Irish Bank to the investors in <unk> on 13 January 2010 . Lee saw this as another example for the urgent need of an investigation into the Irish banking crisis . 
 = = = Resignation from politics = = = 
 On 8 February 2010 he announced his resignation from Fine Gael and from Dáil Éireann , due to having " virtually no influence or input " into shaping Fine Gael 's economic policies at a time of economic upheaval . It emerged that on 2 February , Lee met with the Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny and told him of his intention to resign . Kenny then offered Lee the frontbench position as spokesman on economic planning . Speaking to reporters outside Leinster House soon after his announcement , Lee said it would have been dishonest of him to accept the position : " I had absolutely no input for nine months . I think I had to be honest with myself and honest with the electorate about that and not pretend . " Asked if his resignation was a vote of no confidence in Kenny , Lee said there were " certainly lots of large <unk> at the moment in relation to the leader 's position " . He said he had " minimal involvement " with Fine Gael finance spokesman Richard Bruton . " I had a maximum of two or three conversations with Richard Bruton in a total nine months period . I don ’ t know how my relationship is with [ him ] " Lee said . 
 Kenny noted Lee had been appointed chair of the party 's committee on economic policy and also its forum . " I had anticipated a very important role for [ George Lee ] in the coming period with Fine Gael . " Kenny 's spokesman later dismissed the proposition that the resignation had implications for his leadership . He cited the public endorsement of Kenny by 20 Dáil deputies over the course of the weekend . Former Fine Gael leader Michael Noonan said he was surprised at the decision : " I thought that George Lee was fitting in well " , adding that he believed he would have been a cabinet member in a Fine Gael @-@ led government . 
 George Lee was criticised after his resignation by Senator Eoghan Harris , who was speaking on the Lunchtime programme of Newstalk Radio . Harris suggested financial considerations and long working hours of politicians were the reasons why Lee resigned . Fine Gael TD Brian Hayes , who was Lee 's campaign manager in the Dublin South by @-@ election , said that in discussions with Lee , the latter had complained about " a major reduction in his income " since leaving RTÉ to become a Dáil backbencher . Lee denied that financial considerations had anything to do with his decision to quit politics .

 Why Should The Fire Die ? is the third major album release and fifth album overall by progressive acoustic trio Nickel Creek . The album was released on Sugar Hill on August 9 , 2005 in the United States , and on August 8 in the United Kingdom . Why Should the Fire Die ? is the first Nickel Creek album to feature string bassist Mark Schatz . 
 The album peaked at # 17 on the Billboard 200 , making it the highest charting Nickel Creek album on the chart to date . Why Should the Fire Die ? also topped both the magazine 's Top Internet Albums and Top Bluegrass Albums charts . By November 2006 , the album had sold 258 @,@ 784 copies . The album earned Nickel Creek two Grammy Award nominations : the award for Best Contemporary Folk Album , an award which they previously won for This Side , and the award for Best Country Instrumental Performance ( " Scotch & Chocolate " ) . 
 Why Should the Fire Die ? was praised by contemporary music critics primarily for its creativity , and for its instrumental quality , with one critic complimenting the album 's " sheer musical brilliance " . 
 = = Conception and production = = 
 In the time that Nickel Creek spent writing songs for Why Should the Fire Die ? , numerous songs did not make the cut , and only fourteen were used in the final draft of the album . When discussing the album , Sean Watkins said that the band " did so much co @-@ writing together and filtering . I mean there ’ s like 30 songs that didn ’ t get used . " After writing the songs , Sara Watkins said in her online journal that the trio spent five days " going over the details of the arrangements on each of the seventeen songs we 're seriously considering for the record and making good demos of each of them " . The band started recording the album in November 2004 , and the album was " completed , mixed , and mastered " by April 2005 . 
 The recording for Why Should the Fire Die ? took place at Barefoot Recording in Los Angeles , California . In an interview with Rolling Stone , Thile said : " The studio needs to be dark . I don 't want to be reminded by my surroundings that what I 'm singing about isn 't happening right then . I like to really dissolve into the story . But the <unk> I use more for keeping my vocal cords relaxed and clear . " 
 The release of Why Should the Fire Die ? marked the first major Nickel Creek release with Alison Krauss absent as a producer . The album 's producing duties were carried out by Tony Berg and former Smash Mouth producer Eric Valentine . Sara Watkins stated in an interview with Paste Magazine that the producer change made for a " more congruent project overall " . The band attributed much of the credit for their morphing sound to both their new producers and Krauss . The album was not recorded digitally , but in a more old @-@ fashioned way using Telefunken microphones , and the special effects in the fiddle on the track " First and Last Waltz " was reel tape delay . 
 = = Songs = = 
 " When in Rome " , the opening track on Why Should the Fire Die ? , was chosen as the lead , and only single . The song 's title alludes to the American proverb " When in Rome , do as the Romans do " , and Chris Thile , the song 's author , said " The idea behind the song – and I do love it ! - is if there is something better , it 's worth leaning towards just a little bit because you 'll have a great time here regardless . " Critics commented on the song favorably , with George Graham saying that " When in Rome " has " rock energy level and some sonic manipulation , with hints of old @-@ time Appalachian music in the fiddle , while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode . " 
 The second track , " Somebody More Like You " was written by guitarist Sean Watkins . The break @-@ up song , written from Watkins ' perspective , was described as " scathing " , and like " Aimee Mann @-@ style modern pop " , with lyrics like " I hope you meet someone your height so you can see eye to eye / With someone as small as you " . Watkins said the song wasn 't written for anyone in particular , but said " I had this clever line and decided to build a song around it . " " Jealous of the Moon " , the third track , was co @-@ written by Chris Thile and Gary Louris of Jayhawks fame . This song was released as a promotional single in the United States . The fourth track and first instrumental on Why Should the Fire Die ? , " Scotch & Chocolate " , earned Nickel Creek a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Instrumental . However , the song lost to the trio 's former record producer Alison Krauss with her band Union Station for " <unk> Branch " , from the band 's twelfth album , Lonely Runs Both Ways . As with the first three songs on the album , critics responded favorably to " Scotch & Chocolate " . Rolling Stone considered the song to be " Celtic @-@ infused " , Slant Magazine named it the best song on the album , and Stylus Magazine called it a " brisk , lively instrumental " . The latter also said the song was " every bit as physically exciting as Shooter Jennings or Big and Rich . " 
 " Can 't Complain " , a Chris Thile @-@ composed piece , was the fifth track on Why Should the Fire Die ? . According to Sean Watkins , the song was written by Thile " from the point of view of a friend " . Unlike the first four songs on the album , the song received mixed reviews . Being There called it " nothing more than a generic ballad with little merit " , and PopMatters said that it was a " one @-@ too @-@ many Thile tune about screwed @-@ up relationships " . However , some critics found it amazing ; Village Voice called the song a " lushly arpeggiated ballad " . The sixth track , a Bob Dylan cover , " Tomorrow is a Long Time " , was the only track on the album not composed at least partially by one of the members of Nickel Creek . The track had previously been covered by " Watkins Family Hour " , a duo that consists of Sara Watkins and Sean Watkins , at their home base of Largo in Los Angeles . Both the album version and the live Watkins Family Hour version feature Sara Watkins as the lead vocalist . Watkins was heavily praised for her " graceful " and " beautifully " sung rendition of the song . " Eveline " , a tribute to the James Joyce short story of the same name , was the seventh track on the album . A Thile @-@ Sean Watkins composed piece , " Eveline " has been said to feature " irregular tunings " , and vocal harmonization that is similar to that on Radiohead 's OK Computer . Allmusic cited this track as the " brooding centerpiece " of the album . 
 The eighth song and second instrumental on Why Should the Fire Die ? , " Stumptown " , was written by Chris Thile . The song was written as a tribute to Stumptown Coffee Roasters , Chris Thile 's favorite coffee house in the world . " Stumptown " is also the album 's shortest song , at one minute and forty three seconds . " Anthony " , the ninth track , is the only song recorded by Nickel Creek that was written solely by Sara Watkins . " Anthony " , which features a ukulele melody , was described by several critics to be " old @-@ timey " . One of three Thile @-@ Watkins @-@ Watkins composed pieces on the album , " Best Of Luck " was the tenth track on Why Should the Fire Die ? . Sara Watkins had the lead vocal for " Best Of Luck " , and was complimented by critics for her " snippy " and " assertive " <unk> prefix Magazine pegged the song to be the formula that makes " this album , and trio , unstoppable " . The eleventh track , " Doubting Thomas " , was written by Chris Thile and is named after Doubting Thomas , a biblical term . All the members of Nickel Creek came from devout Christian families , and the song is about questioning faith . The third and final instrumental , " First and Last Waltz " , is Why Should the Fire Die ? ' s twelfth track . One of the three songs written by all of Nickel Creek 's members , it comes before the penultimate track , " Helena " . At Nickel Creek 's concerts , the song was played as a segue into " Helena " . The album recording of " First And Last Waltz " has been called a " chilly effects @-@ draped recital piece " , due to its use of sound effects . " Helena " , the penultimate track , was written by Chris Thile . Producer Eric Valentine provided drumming duties for this song . Thile described the track to be what he considered " the ultimate climax " of Why Should the Fire Die ? , and some contemporary critics found the song to be the highlight of the album . The final song on Why Should the Fire Die ? , the title track , is a slow waltz . PopMatters described the song as being " gorgeously sung " , but " an odd choice to conclude a record that is so often bidding for the true fun of pop music " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 For the majority , Why Should the Fire Die ? received positive reviews from United States contemporary music critics . PopMatters said that the album was " hardly the stuff of mountain music " , and Village Voice described it to be " much sleeker , sexier , and more carefully assembled than work by the competition . " A review from the Houston Chronicle also stated that Why Should the Fire Die ? is " like Wilco with country rock and Radiohead with guitar riff rock , " and that " the trio has successfully proved the vitality of creative Darwinism . " Some critics even went as far as to call the album 's musical genre " emo @-@ grass " . 
 The album also received much critical praise for its instrumental strength , with BBC stating that " what shines through immediately is the sheer musical brilliance . " The magazine Being There said that " like any good bluegrass band , Nickel Creek proves capable of playing rousing instrumentals . " BBC also discussed the difference between the three instrumentals featured on the album , stating " " First And Last Waltz " is smooth and dreamy , " Stumptown " is a merry little jig , and " Scotch And Chocolate " is just reel @-@ y ( sic ) good . " 
 Reviews for Why Should the Fire Die ? also included praise of the album 's vocals , particularly Sara Watkins ' " snippy " , " beautifully sung " and " assertive " vocals on various tracks , and the trio 's vocal harmonization was also complimented .

 = Richard II of England = 
 Richard II ( 6 January 1367 – c . 14 February 1400 ) , also known as Richard of Bordeaux , was King of England from 1377 until he was deposed on 30 September 1399 . Richard , a son of Edward , the Black Prince , was born in Bordeaux during the reign of his grandfather , Edward III . Richard was the younger brother of Edward of Angoulême ; upon whose death , Richard , at four years of age , became second in line to the throne after his father . Upon the death of Richard 's father prior to the death of Edward III , Richard , by primogeniture , became the heir apparent to the throne . With Edward III 's death the following year , Richard succeeded to the throne at the age of ten . 
 During Richard 's first years as king , government was in the hands of a series of councils . Most of the aristocracy preferred this to a regency led by the king 's uncle , John of Gaunt , yet Gaunt remained highly influential . The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 . The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis . In the following years , however , the king 's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential , and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant . By 1389 Richard had regained control , and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents . 
 In 1397 , Richard took his revenge on the appellants , many of whom were executed or exiled . The next two years have been described by historians as Richard 's " tyranny " . In 1399 , after John of Gaunt died , the king disinherited Gaunt 's son , Henry of Bolingbroke , who had previously been exiled . Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers . Claiming initially that his goal was only to reclaim his patrimony , it soon became clear that he intended to claim the throne for himself . Meeting little resistance , Bolingbroke deposed Richard and had himself crowned as King Henry IV . Richard died in captivity in February 1400 ; he is thought to have been starved to death , although questions remain regarding his final fate . 
 Richard was said to have been tall , good @-@ looking and intelligent . While probably not insane , as earlier historians believed , he may have had what modern psychologists would call a " personality disorder " towards the end of his reign . Less warlike than either his father or grandfather , he sought to bring an end to the Hundred Years ' War that Edward III had started . He was a firm believer in the royal prerogative , something which led him to restrain the power of the aristocracy , and to rely on a private retinue for military protection instead ; in contrast to the fraternal , martial court of his grandfather , he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court , in which the king was an elevated figure , with art and culture at the centre . 
 Richard 's posthumous reputation has to a large extent been shaped by Shakespeare , whose play Richard II portrayed Richard 's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the fifteenth century Wars of the Roses . Modern historians do not accept this interpretation , while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition . Most authorities agree that , even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic , the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment , and this led to his downfall . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of Edward , the Black Prince , and Joan of Kent ( " The Fair Maid of Kent " ) . Edward , heir to the throne of England , had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the Hundred Years ' War , particularly in the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 . After further military adventures , however , he contracted dysentery in Spain in 1370 . He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year . Joan of Kent had been at the centre of a marriage dispute between Thomas Holland , Earl of Kent , and William Montacute , Earl of Salisbury , from which Holland emerged victorious . Less than a year after Holland 's death in 1360 , Joan married Prince Edward . Since she was a granddaughter of King Edward I and a first cousin of King Edward III , the marriage required papal approval . 
 Richard was born at the Archbishop 's Palace , Bordeaux , in the English principality of Aquitaine , on 6 January 1367 . According to contemporary sources , three kings – " the King of Castille , the King of Navarre and the King of Portugal " – were present at his birth . This anecdote , and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of Epiphany , was later used in the religious imagery of the Wilton Diptych , where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the Virgin and Child . His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died in 1371 , and Richard became his father 's heir . The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in 1376 . The Commons in parliament genuinely feared that Richard 's uncle , John of Gaunt , would usurp the throne . For this reason , the prince was quickly invested with the princedom of Wales and his father 's other titles . On 21 June the next year , Richard 's grandfather Edward III also died , and at the age of ten Richard was crowned king on 16 July 1377 . Again , fears of John of Gaunt 's ambitions influenced political decisions , and a regency led by the King 's uncles was avoided . Instead the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of " continual councils " from which John of Gaunt was excluded . Gaunt , together with his younger brother Thomas of Woodstock , Earl of Buckingham , still held great informal influence over the business of government . However , the king 's councillors and friends , particularly Sir Simon de Burley and Robert de Vere , Duke of Ireland , increasingly gained control of royal affairs and earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point where the councils were discontinued in 1380 . Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of taxation levied through three poll taxes between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent . By 1381 , there was a deep @-@ felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society . 
 = = Peasants ' Revolt = = 
 Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the Peasants ' Revolt , the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the Black Death and subsequent outbreaks of the plague . The rebellion started in Kent and Essex in late May , and on 12 June , bands of peasants gathered at Blackheath near London under the leaders Wat Tyler , John Ball and Jack Straw . John of Gaunt 's Savoy Palace was burnt down . The Archbishop of Canterbury Simon Sudbury , who was also Lord Chancellor , and the king 's Lord High Treasurer , Robert Hales , were both killed by the rebels , who were demanding the complete abolition of serfdom . The king , sheltered within the Tower of London with his councillors , agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate . 
 It is unclear how much Richard , who was still only fourteen years old , was involved in these deliberations , although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations . The king set out by river on 13 June , but the large number of people thronging the banks at Greenwich made it impossible for him to land , forcing him to return to the Tower . The next day , Friday , 14 June , he set out by horse and met the rebels at Mile End . The king agreed to the rebels ' demands , but this move only emboldened them ; they continued their looting and killings . Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at Smithfield and reiterated that the demands would be met , but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king 's sincerity . The king 's men grew restive , an altercation broke out , and William Walworth , the mayor of London , pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him . The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened , but the king acted with calm resolve and , saying " I am your captain , follow me ! " , he led the mob away from the scene . Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army , but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes . 
 The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted , and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country , he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion . On 28 June at <unk> , he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants ' Revolt . Despite his young age , Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion . It is likely , though , that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority , and helped shape the absolutist attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign . 
 = = Coming of age = = 
 It is only with the Peasants ' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the annals . One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia , daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor ( King of Bohemia Charles IV ) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania , on 20 January 1382 . The marriage had diplomatic significance ; in the division of Europe caused by the Great Schism , Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years ' War . Nonetheless , the marriage was not popular in England . Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire , the political alliance never resulted in any military victories . Furthermore , the marriage was childless . Anne died from plague in 1394 , greatly mourned by her husband . 
 Michael de la Pole had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations ; he had the king 's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age . De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family . When Richard made him chancellor in 1383 , and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later , this antagonised the more established nobility . Another member of the close circle around the king was Robert de Vere , Earl of Oxford , who in this period emerged as the king 's favourite . Richard 's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment . This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl 's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386 . The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature , due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king . 
 Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France . While the court party preferred negotiations , Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large @-@ scale campaign to protect English possessions . Instead , a so @-@ called crusade led by Henry le Despenser , Bishop of Norwich , was dispatched , which failed miserably . Faced with this setback on the continent , Richard turned his attention instead towards France 's ally , Scotland . In 1385 , the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north , but the effort came to nothing , and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle . Meanwhile , only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England . The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure , and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person . With Gaunt gone , the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham – who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester – and Richard Fitzalan , Earl of Arundel . 
 = = First crisis of 1386 – 88 = = 
 The threat of a French invasion did not subside , but instead grew stronger into 1386 . At the parliament of October that year , Michael de la Pole – in his capacity of chancellor – requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm . Rather than consenting , the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed . The parliament ( later known as the Wonderful Parliament ) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel . The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a <unk> from his kitchen at parliament 's request . Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go . A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year . 
 Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative , and from February to November 1387 went on a " gyration " ( tour ) of the country to muster support for his cause . By installing de Vere as Justice of Chester , he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in Cheshire . He also secured a legal ruling from Chief Justice Robert Tresilian that parliament 's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable . 
 On his return to London , the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock ( now Duke of Gloucester ) , Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp , Earl of Warwick , who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole , de Vere , Tresilian , and two other loyalists : the mayor of London , Nicholas Brembre , and Alexander Neville , the Archbishop of York . Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time , as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements . The three earls then joined forces with Henry Bolingbroke , Earl of Derby ( Gaunt 's son , later King Henry IV ) , and Thomas de Mowbray , Earl of Nottingham – the group known to history as the Lords Appellant . On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge , where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country . 
 Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants ' demands ; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed , while de Vere and de la Pole – who had by now also left the country – were sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388 . The proceedings went further , and a number of Richard 's chamber knights were also executed , among these Burley . The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king . 
 = = A fragile peace = = 
 Richard gradually re @-@ established royal authority in the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament . The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide , anti @-@ French coalition came to nothing , and the north of England fell victim to a Scottish incursion . Richard was now over twenty @-@ one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name . Furthermore , John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king , after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics . Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389 , claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors . He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly . Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years , having reconciled with his former adversaries . Still , later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived . In particular , the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten . 
 With national stability secured , Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France . A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of Aquitaine possessed by the English crown . However , the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay homage to the King of France – a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public . Instead , in 1396 , a truce was agreed to , which was to last twenty eight years As part of the truce , Richard agreed to marry Isabella , daughter of Charles VI of France , when she came of age . There were some misgivings about the betrothal , in particular because the princess was then only six years old , and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years . 
 Although Richard sought peace with France , he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland . The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun , and the Anglo @-@ Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene . In the autumn of 1394 , Richard left for Ireland , where he remained until May 1395 . His army of more than 8 @,@ 000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages . The invasion was a success , and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship . It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard 's reign , and strengthened the king 's support at home , although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short @-@ lived . 
 = = Second crisis of 1397 – 99 = = 
 The period that historians refer to as the " tyranny " of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s . The king had Gloucester , Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397 . The timing of these arrests and Richard 's motivation are not entirely clear . Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king , there is no evidence that this was the case . It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386 – 88 and eliminate them as threats to his power . Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial , at the parliament of September 1397 . After a heated quarrel with the king , he was condemned and executed . Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial . As the time for the trial drew near , Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead . It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood . Warwick was also condemned to death , but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment . Arundel 's brother Thomas Arundel , the Archbishop of Canterbury , was exiled for life . Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities . While recruiting retainers for himself in various counties , he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants . The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown , although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings . 
 These actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt , but with the support of a large group of other magnates , many of whom were rewarded with new titles , who were disparagingly referred to as Richard 's " <unk> " . These included the former <unk> Henry Bolingbroke , Earl of Derby , who was made Duke of Hereford , and Thomas de Mowbray , Earl of Nottingham , who was created Duke of Norfolk . Also among them were John and Thomas Holland , the king 's half @-@ brother and nephew , who were promoted from earls of Huntingdon and Kent to dukes of Exeter and Surrey respectively ; the Duke of York 's son Edward , Earl of Rutland , who received Gloucester 's French title of Duke of Aumale ; Gaunt 's son John Beaufort , Earl of Somerset , who was made Marquess of Somerset and Marquess of Dorset ; John Montacute , Earl of Salisbury ; and Lord Thomas le Despenser , who became Earl of Gloucester . With the forfeited lands of the convicted appellants , the king could reward these men with lands suited to their new ranks . 
 A threat to Richard 's authority still existed , however , in the form of the House of Lancaster , represented by John of Gaunt and his son Henry Bolingbroke , Duke of Hereford . The house of Lancaster not only possessed greater wealth than any other family in England , they were of royal descent and , as such , likely candidates to succeed the childless Richard . Discord broke out in the inner circles of court in December 1397 , when Bolingbroke and Mowbray became embroiled in a quarrel . According to Bolingbroke , Mowbray had claimed that the two , as former Lords Appellant , were next in line for royal retribution . Mowbray vehemently denied these charges , as such a claim would have amounted to treason . A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle , but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead : Mowbray for life , Bolingbroke for ten years . On 3 February 1399 , John of Gaunt died . Rather than allowing Bolingbroke to succeed , Richard extended the term of his exile to life and expropriated his properties . The king felt safe from Bolingbroke , who was residing in Paris , since the French had little interest in any challenge to Richard and his peace policy . Richard left the country in May for another expedition in Ireland . 
 In 1398 Richard summoned a packed Parliament to Shrewsbury — known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury — which declared all the acts of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void , and announced that no restraint could legally be put on the king . It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king 's friends , making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again . 
 = = Overthrow and death = = 
 In June 1399 , Louis , Duke of Orléans , gained control of the court of the insane Charles VI of France . The policy of rapprochement with the English crown did not suit Louis 's political ambitions , and for this reason he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England . With a small group of followers , Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399 . Men from all over the country soon rallied around the duke . Meeting with Henry Percy , Earl of Northumberland , who had his own misgivings about the king , Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony . Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere . The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland , so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south . Edmund of Langley , Duke of York , who was acting as Keeper of the Realm , had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke . Meanwhile , Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July . He made his way to Conwy , where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations . On 19 August , Richard II surrendered to Henry at Flint Castle , promising to abdicate if his life were spared . Both men then returned to London , the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry . On arrival , he was imprisoned in the Tower of London on 1 September . 
 Henry was by now fully determined to take the throne , but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma . It was argued that Richard , through his tyranny and misgovernment , had rendered himself unworthy of being king . However , Henry was not next in line to the throne ; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March , who was descended from Edward III 's third son , the second to survive to adulthood , Lionel of Antwerp . Bolingbroke 's father , John of Gaunt , was Edward 's fourth son , the third to survive to adulthood . The problem was solved by emphasising Henry 's descent in a direct male line , whereas March 's descent was through his grandmother . The official account of events claims that Richard voluntarily agreed to abdicate in favour of Henry on 29 September . Although this was probably not the case , the parliament that met on 30 September accepted Richard 's abdication . Henry was crowned as King Henry IV on 13 October . 
 The exact course of Richard 's life after the deposition is unclear ; he remained in the Tower until he was taken to Pontefract Castle shortly before the end of the year . Although King Henry might have been amenable to letting him live , this all changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon , Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser , and possibly also the Earl of Rutland – all now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richard – were planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the Epiphany Rising . Although averted , the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live . He is thought to have starved to death in captivity on or around 14 February 1400 , although there is some question over the date and manner of his death . His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in the old St Paul 's Cathedral on 17 February before burial in Kings Langley Church on 6 March . 
 Rumours that Richard was still alive persisted , but never gained much credence in England ; in Scotland , however , a man identified as Richard came into the hands of Regent Albany , lodged in Stirling Castle , and serving as the notional – and perhaps reluctant – figurehead of various anti @-@ Lancastrian and Lollard intrigues in England . Henry IV 's government dismissed him as an imposter and several sources from both sides of the Border suggest the man had a mental illness , one also describing him as a " beggar " by the time of his death in 1419 , but he was buried as a king in the local Dominican friary in Stirling . Meanwhile , in 1413 , Henry V – in an effort both to atone for his father 's act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard 's survival – had decided to have the body at King 's Langley moved to its final resting place in Westminster Abbey . Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb , where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed . 
 = = Court culture = = 
 In the last years of Richard 's reign , and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397 , the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country , a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England . In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge , one that differed sharply from that of earlier times . A new form of address developed ; where the king previously had been addressed simply as " highness " , now " royal majesty " , or " high majesty " were often used . It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking , and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king . The inspiration for this new <unk> and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent , not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard 's two wives , but also the court that the Black Prince had maintained while residing in Aquitaine . 
 Richard 's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the royal prerogative , the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth , when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants ' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant . Richard rejected the approach his grandfather , Edward III , had taken to the nobility . Edward 's court had been a martial one , based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains . In Richard 's view , this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage . To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment , he pursued a policy of peace towards France . At the same time , he developed his own private military retinue , larger than that of any English king before him , and gave them livery badges with his White Hart , which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych ( right ) . He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant , venerated figure , and art and culture , rather than warfare , were at the centre . 
 = = Patronage and the arts = = 
 As part of Richard 's programme of asserting his authority , he also tried to cultivate the royal image . Unlike any other English king before him , he had himself portrayed in panel paintings of elevated majesty , of which two survive : the over life @-@ size Westminster Abbey portrait of the king ( c . 1390 , see top of page ) , and the Wilton Diptych ( 1394 – 99 ) , a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign . It is one of the few surviving English examples of the courtly International Gothic style of painting that was developed in the courts of the Continent , especially Prague and Paris . Richard 's expenditure on jewellery , rich textiles and metalwork was far higher than on paintings , but as with his illuminated manuscripts , there are hardly any surviving works that can be connected with him , except for a crown , " one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith " , that probably belonged to Anne . 
 Among Richard 's grandest projects in the field of architecture was Westminster Hall , which was extensively rebuilt during his reign , perhaps spurred on by the completion in 1391 of John of Gaunt 's magnificent hall at Kenilworth Castle . Fifteen life @-@ size statues of kings were placed in niches on the walls , and the hammer @-@ beam roof by the royal carpenter Hugh <unk> , " the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture " , allowed the original three Romanesque aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space , with a dais at the end for Richard to sit in solitary state . The rebuilding had been begun by Henry III in 1245 , but had by Richard 's time been dormant for over a century . 
 The court 's patronage of literature is especially important , because this was the period in which the English language took shape as a literary language . There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to patronage of poetry , but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive . The greatest poet of the age , Geoffrey Chaucer , served the king as a diplomat , a customs official and a clerk of The King 's Works while producing some of his best @-@ known work . He was also in the service of John of Gaunt , and wrote The Book of the Duchess as a eulogy to Gaunt 's wife Blanche . Chaucer 's colleague and friend John Gower wrote his Confessio Amantis on a direct commission from Richard , although he later grew disenchanted with the king . 
 = = Character and assessment = = 
 Contemporary writers , even those less sympathetic to the king , agreed that Richard was a " most beautiful king " , though with a " face which was white , rounded and feminine " , implying he lacked manliness . He was athletic and tall ; when his tomb was opened in 1871 he was found to be six feet tall . He was also intelligent and well read , and when agitated he had a tendency to stammer . While the Westminster Abbey portrait probably shows a good similarity of the king , the Wilton Diptych portrays the king as significantly younger than he was at the time ; it must be assumed that he had a beard by this point . Religiously , he was orthodox , and particularly towards the end of his reign he became a strong opponent of the Lollard heresy . He was particularly devoted to the cult of Edward the Confessor , and around 1395 he had his own arms impaled with the mythical arms of the Confessor . Though not a warrior king like his grandfather , Richard nevertheless enjoyed tournaments , as well as hunting . 
 The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by Shakespeare 's play about the king , Richard II . Shakespeare 's Richard was a cruel , vindictive and irresponsible king , who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power . Writing a work of fiction , however , Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions . Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel , who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham . Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography , which was highly unsympathetic to Richard . The Tudor orthodoxy , reinforced by Shakespeare , saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard 's misrule that did not end until Henry VII 's accession in 1485 . The idea that Richard was to blame for the later @-@ 15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century , but came to be challenged in the twentieth . More recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II . 
 Richard 's mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century . One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop Stubbs . Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign , Richard 's mind " was losing its balance altogether " . Historian Anthony Steel , who wrote a full @-@ scale biography of the king in 1941 , took a psychiatric approach to the issue , and concluded that the king had schizophrenia . This was challenged by <unk> Galbraith , who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis , a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period , like Anthony Goodman and Anthony Tuck . Nigel Saul , who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II , concedes that – even though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illness – he showed clear signs of a narcissistic personality , and towards the end of his reign " Richard 's grasp on reality was becoming weaker " . 
 One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure . His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern absolute monarchy as exemplified by the Tudor dynasty . More recently , Richard 's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents , and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did . Yet his actions were too extreme , and too abrupt . For one , the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation , and so help Richard 's popularity with the Commons in parliament . However , this promise was never fulfilled , as the cost of the royal retinue , the opulence of court and Richard 's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been , without offering commensurate benefits . As for his policy of military retaining , this was later emulated by Edward IV and Henry VII , but Richard 's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country . As Simon Walker concludes : " What he sought was , in contemporary terms , neither unjustified nor unattainable ; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him . "

 = StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty = 
 StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty is a military science fiction real @-@ time strategy video game developed and released by Blizzard Entertainment for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. A sequel to the award @-@ winning 1998 video game StarCraft and its expansion set Brood War , the game was released worldwide on July 27 , 2010 . It is split into three installments : the base game with the subtitle Wings of Liberty , an expansion pack Heart of the Swarm , and a stand @-@ alone expansion pack Legacy of the Void . 
 The game revolves around three species : the Terrans , human exiles from Earth ; the Zerg , a super @-@ species of assimilated life forms ; and the Protoss , a technologically advanced species with vast mental powers . Wings of Liberty focuses on the Terrans , while the expansions Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void focus on the Zerg and Protoss , respectively . The game is set four years after the events of 1998 's StarCraft : Brood War , and follows the exploits of Jim Raynor as he leads an insurgent group against the autocratic Terran Dominion . The game includes both new and returning characters and locations from the original game . 
 The game was met with very positive reviews from critics , receiving an aggregated score of 93 % from Metacritic . Similar to its predecessor , StarCraft II was praised for its engaging gameplay , as well as its introduction of new features and improved storytelling . The game was criticized for lacking features that existed in the original StarCraft game including LAN play and the ability to switch between multiplayer regions . At the time of its release , StarCraft II became the fastest @-@ selling real @-@ time strategy game of all time , with over three million copies sold worldwide in the first month . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 StarCraft II features the return of the three species from the original game : Protoss , Terran , and Zerg . In the Terran campaign , the original StarCraft briefing room is replaced with an interactive version of the battlecruiser Hyperion , with Jim Raynor , now a bitter and hard @-@ drinking mercenary captain , as the central character . In a departure from previous Blizzard games , the campaign is non @-@ linear , with Raynor taking jobs for money and using that money to buy additional units and upgrades . Although each play through will vary , the end result remains consistent , keeping the storyline linear . Blizzard 's Vice President Rob Pardo stressed that each campaign will function very differently . The Terran campaign , Wings of Liberty , places players in a mercenary @-@ style campaign , as Terran rebel group Raynor 's Raiders raise funds by taking assignments from outside groups . The second release , Heart of the Swarm , is Zerg @-@ focused and has role @-@ playing elements . Kerrigan is the focus of the campaign , and the story revolves around the possibility of her redemption . The Protoss @-@ themed Legacy of the Void will be the final expansion , with the Protoss Artanis attempting to reunite the Protoss tribes in order to stop Amon , a fallen Xel 'Naga . 
 Wings of Liberty has 29 playable campaign missions , but only 26 of them are playable in a single playthrough since three missions are choice @-@ related alternates . There is one secret mission named " Piercing the Shroud " , which can be unlocked on the " Media Blitz " mission , by destroying a Science Facility in a corner of the map . There is also a series of four missions in which the player plays as the Protoss in reliving the memory of Zeratul . 
 The Wings of Liberty campaign contains several missions with unique features , such as lava that floods the battlefield every five minutes , forcing the player to move their units to high ground before they 're destroyed . In another mission , enemy units will only attack the player at night , forcing the player into a form of siege warfare . Finally , in one mission , the player must use a single unit to influence the tide of an AI @-@ controlled battle . The single player missions are highly customizable and are featured in the StarCraft II Community Zone . Between missions , players can choose units , buildings , and upgrades that are not available in the multiplayer missions . A major new addition to the map @-@ making community will be the StarCraft II Marketplace , where high quality maps will be sold for a small fee as " premium maps " over Battle.net. The mode of payment has not yet been announced . Lead Designer Dustin Browder has mentioned that even maps like player @-@ created Defense of the Ancients in Warcraft III would not meet the quality requirements to be branded as a premium map . 
 Wings of Liberty features approximately the same number of units as the original StarCraft . Some units from the original game have returned , some featuring new upgrades and abilities . For example , the Protoss Zealot , a melee unit from the original game , now has the <unk> ability to dash forward and quickly reach nearby enemies as a refinement of its speed upgrade from the original . Other units have been replaced or removed entirely : for example , the Scout , a Protoss fighter craft present in the original , has been replaced by the Phoenix . Other changes to unit design have been inspired by story events in StarCraft and its expansion , StarCraft : Brood War , replacing old units with new or renamed versions which sport different attributes and abilities . Units in StarCraft II have new abilities , compared to the original , that encourage more complex interaction with the game environment . Among these are the inclusion of units that can traverse varying levels of terrain , or have the ability to teleport short distances . Some Protoss units can be warped into pylon @-@ powered areas using the Warp Gate , a slight modification of an existing building called the Gateway . StarCraft II 's campaign also has exclusive units that are only playable in the campaign and not in the regular multiplayer mode , though they are available for custom maps . These mostly consist of units that have been scrapped from development such as the Terran Diamondback as well as various returning units from the original StarCraft such as the Terran Wraith and Goliath . The campaign also features <unk> mercenaries , modified versions of certain units with enhanced attributes such as health or damage that become available for hire once the standard unit is unlocked . 
 = = = Editor = = = 
 The StarCraft II Editor is a campaign , map , and mod editor . It is far more sophisticated than StarCraft 's <unk> and Warcraft III 's World Editor for creating custom maps and campaigns , and it is the first editor by Blizzard to feature built @-@ in mod creation and usage support . Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used , along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process ( including those made as April Fools jokes ) will be available in the editor . Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard , it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing , retrieval , and online activation of the editor client . Lead Producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the editor gives players the ability to create RPG , Hero @-@ type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III . At BlizzCon 2009 , Blizzard demonstrated a build of the StarCraft II Editor showcasing its capabilities , such as the ability to customize the user interface to include features such as the Item system from Warcraft III . The final build includes a third @-@ person style perspective for missions . 
 The editor was available for the first time during the phase 1 beta testing of StarCraft II , when it came with a patch . With the start of phase 2 , the editor was updated . At present , there is a large map @-@ making community using the editor , creating first @-@ person shooter games , RPGs , tower defense , and <unk> @-@ type games . The map database is constantly being updated as more map makers create mods for the community . The new editor also changes the way maps are distributed : rather than hosting games using local map files , users now create and join games using maps that have been published to Battle.net. map or mod uploads are limited to a total of 50 MB of storage , divided between ten files at most , with no file being larger than 10 MB . Although the StarCraft II Editor offers more features than the original StarCraft Editor in terms of game customization , there are concerns that the publishing limitations of Battle.net will not allow for large @-@ scale custom maps or extensive map availability unless there is an external map publishing tool .

 The campaign storyline of StarCraft II takes place four years after StarCraft : Brood War , and features the return of Zeratul , Arcturus Mengsk , Artanis , Sarah Kerrigan , and Jim Raynor . It also features new characters such as Rory Swann and Tychus Findlay . In StarCraft II , players revisit familiar worlds , like Char , Mar Sara , and Tarsonis , as well as new locations , such as the jungle planet Bel 'Shir and New Folsom . The Xel 'Naga , an ancient space @-@ faring race responsible for creating the Protoss and the Zerg , also play a major role in the story . 
 At the conclusion of Brood War , Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector , having annihilated the United Earth Directorate 's Expeditionary Force , defeated the Terran Dominion , and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur . However , after the conclusion of Brood War , Kerrigan retreats to Char , despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector . In the four years leading up to the events of StarCraft II , she has not been seen or heard from by any of the other characters . 
 Arcturus Mengsk has been left to rebuild the Dominion , and is consolidating his power while fending off harassment from rival Terran groups . Mengsk has become power @-@ hungry , declaring Jim Raynor an outlaw and showing little desire to protect or aid the colonies under his jurisdiction . Valerian Mengsk , a character introduced in the novel Firstborn , will play an important role in Dominion politics , due to his position as heir apparent to the throne . Meanwhile , Jim Raynor , whose role in the events of StarCraft and Brood War has been marginalized by the media under the Dominion 's control , has become a mercenary who spends his free time drinking in <unk> 's Bar . Chris Metzen , Vice President of Creative Development at Blizzard , has emphasized that by the events of StarCraft II , Raynor has become jaded and embittered by the way he was used and betrayed by Arcturus Mengsk . Other new characters to the series include Tychus Findlay , an ex @-@ convict and marine who becomes a member of Raynor 's crew , and Matt Horner , Raynor 's second in command , a character originally featured in the novel Queen of Blades . 
 Following the fall of Aiur and the death of the Dark Templar matriarch Raszagal , the Protoss have retreated to the Dark Templar homeworld of Shakuras . There , Artanis , a former student of Tassadar , is trying to unify the Khalai Protoss and the Dark Templar , who have nearly separated into warring tribes as a result of centuries of distrust . Zeratul , tormented over the murder of his matriarch , has disappeared to search for clues to the meaning of Samir Duran 's cryptic statements regarding the Protoss / Zerg hybrids in Brood War 's secret mission " Dark Origin " . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Four years after the Brood War , the Dominion is once again the dominant Terran power in the Koprulu sector . News reports reveal that in the four years since the end of the Brood Wars , the standing Dominion military forces have been reduced and defense budget has instead been diverted to hunting down rebel forces that operate against the Dominion . For reasons unknown , Kerrigan gathered the swarm at Char and then vanished from sight . With the Zerg gone , the Protoss have once again taken a passive role in the galaxy . Jim Raynor has formed a revolutionary group named Raynor 's Raiders in order to overthrow Dominion Emperor Arcturus Mengsk . On Mar Sara , Raynor meets with an old comrade , Tychus Findlay . Together , they liberate the local population from Dominion control and also discover a component of a mysterious Xel 'Naga artifact . As the Zerg begin to overrun Mar Sara , Raynor arranges an evacuation to his battlecruiser , the Hyperion , captained by Matt Horner , Raynor 's second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 With Tychus acting as the middleman , the Raiders embark on a series of missions to find the remaining pieces of the Xel 'Naga artifact , which they sell to the enigmatic Moebius Foundation in order to fund their revolution . Along the way , they meet with Gabriel Tosh , a rogue Dominion psychic assassin known as a Spectre , and Ariel Hanson , a researcher on the Zerg and leader of a small farming colony . The Raiders perform missions to help Tosh procure the raw materials to train new Spectres as well as to aid Hanson as she attempts to secure her colonists who are caught between the Zerg infesting their planets and the Protoss attempting to eradicate the infestation . Horner also arranges a series of missions to undermine Mengsk , recovering intelligence information about his war crimes and broadcasting them across the Dominion . Finally , Zeratul sneaks aboard the Hyperion to deliver a psychic crystal that allows Raynor to share visions involving an ominous prophecy where Zerg @-@ Protoss hybrids and an enslaved Zerg swarm wipe out Humanity and the Protoss . The vision reveals that only Kerrigan has the power to prevent the eradication of all life in the sector and beyond . 
 After collecting more artifact pieces , Raynor 's forces encounter Dominion battleships at the pre @-@ agreed Moebius Foundation rendezvous point . The Moebius Foundation is revealed to be under the control of Valerian Mengsk , Arcturus ' son . Valerian , intending to show himself as a worthy successor to his father , asks Raynor to help him invade Char and use the artifact to restore Kerrigan 's humanity , thus weakening the Zerg . To the initial dismay of the crew , Raynor agrees . With Valerian 's aid , Raynor recovers the final artifact piece , and the Raiders and Dominion invade Char . The Dominion fleet is devastated by the heavy Zerg defenses , but Raynor secures a foothold on Char and <unk> with Dominion forces led by Horace Warfield , a decorated Dominion general . Warfield is later injured and appoints Raynor commander of surviving Dominion forces as well . The combined forces of the Raiders and Dominion military push towards the main Hive Cluster of the planet , protecting the artifact as it charges to full power , and the artifact eventually destroys all Zerg within its blast radius . Raynor 's team finds Kerrigan restored to human form ; however , Tychus reveals that he made a deal with Arcturus Mengsk , trading Kerrigan 's life for his own freedom . Raynor defends Kerrigan from Tychus ' attempt to kill her , fatally shooting Tychus in the process . The closing scene shows Raynor carrying Sarah Kerrigan out of the main hive in his arms .

 The English language version of StarCraft II has Robert Clotworthy and James Harper reprising their roles from StarCraft as the voices of Jim Raynor and Arcturus Mengsk . Notable absences included Tricia Helfer replacing Glynnis Talken as Kerrigan , Michael Dorn replacing Michael Gough as Tassadar , and Fred Tatasciore filling in for the late Jack Ritschel as Zeratul . The voice director for the game was Andrea Romano . Over 58 voice actors were hired for the game , some of whom voiced multiple characters . 
 = = Development = = 
 The development of StarCraft II was announced on May 19 , 2007 , at the Blizzard Worldwide Invitational in Seoul , South Korea . According to Rob Pardo and Chris Sigaty , development on the game , though initially delayed for a year by the temporary reassignment of Blizzard 's resources to World of Warcraft , began in 2003 , shortly after Warcraft III : The Frozen Throne was released . StarCraft II supports the DirectX 9 ( Pixel shader 2 @.@ 0 ) software , and it is also fully compatible with DirectX 10 as well . The development team had decided not to add exclusive DirectX 10 graphic effects . The Mac version uses OpenGL . The game previously featured the Havok physics engine , which allowed for more realistic environmental elements such as " debris rolling down a ramp " which has since been replaced for a custom physics engine . Additionally , there are plans to implement VoIP into the game . 
 At the June 2008 Blizzard Worldwide Invitational , Blizzard Executive Vice President Rob Pardo announced that development of the single @-@ player campaign was approximately one @-@ third complete , as well as that Wings of Liberty would be followed up by two expansion packs – StarCraft II : Heart of the Swarm , which would focus around the Zerg and StarCraft II : Legacy of the Void , which would focus around the Protoss . On February 25 , 2009 , Blizzard announced the Blizzard Theme Park Contest , where prizes would include two beta keys for StarCraft II . The updated news and updates page of Battle.net for Warcraft III : The Frozen Throne stated that the top 20 players from each realm was to be given a StarCraft II beta key . 
 Blizzard posted a release date for the game 's first beta of Summer 2009 , but failed to release a beta during that time . Since May 6 , 2009 , it was possible to sign up for the beta phase of the game . In November 2009 , the game 's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that it would happen next year . In February 2010 , Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month . On February 17 , 2010 , StarCraft II began closed beta testing , as promised . The beta was expected to last for 3 – 5 months . Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $ 400 . Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9 . According to the company , they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of beta testing . As of July 23 , 2010 , eighteen patches had been released for the beta ( only seventeen on European servers ) , including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor . On May 12 , 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X , for the users who had signed up . On May 17 , 2010 , Blizzard announced that the first phase of the beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31 , but it was later extended to June 7 . The second phase began on July 7 , 2010 , and ended on July 19 , 2010 . 
 In an interview held in June 2009 , Rob Pardo indicated that LAN support would not be included in StarCraft II . Removing LAN requires players to connect through Blizzard 's servers before being able to play multiplayer games , causing gamers to voice their dissatisfaction online . Further controversy was sparked when Blizzard confirmed that the game would not support cross @-@ server play out of the box , restricting gamers to only play against local opponents — for instance , US gamers against those in the US and Europeans against Europeans . The company originally explained that Australia and New Zealand servers would be located in Southeast Asia , pitting them against combatants from Indonesia , the Philippines , Malaysia , Singapore , and Thailand . However , starting from patch 1 @.@ 1 @.@ 0 , it was announced that the Southeast Asia / Australia / New Zealand version of the game would not be strictly region @-@ locked , with gamers able to play on both the SEA / ANZ servers and the North American ones . 
 Mike Morhaime , president of Blizzard , announced during the opening ceremony of <unk> 2009 that StarCraft II and the new Battle.net platform would both be released in 2010 , with an approximately one @-@ month gap between releases . As of March 2010 , Blizzard had stated that the new platform was being tested outside the beta and was planned for release in early July 2010 , for both StarCraft II and World of Warcraft : Cataclysm , with a later upgrade for Diablo III . On May 5 , 2010 , it was revealed that StarCraft II and Battle.net 2 @.@ 0 would be integrated with social networking site Facebook , " linking the world 's premier online gaming platform with the world 's most popular social platform " — a move that allowed gamers to search among their Facebook friends for StarCraft II opponents . Wired magazine , in its annual Vaporware Award , ranked StarCraft II first among the delayed technology products of 2009 . StarCraft II was finally released on July 27 , 2010 , with launch parties in selected cities of countries around the world . Customers and reviewers who received the installation DVD before the July 27 release were greeted with an error screen , telling them to wait until the release date . There was no known workaround and some reviewers had praised the action for limiting journalists to playing and reviewing the game with actual players . 
 Compared to the original StarCraft , StarCraft II was designed to focus more heavily on the multiplayer aspect , with changes that include major improvements to Battle.net , a new competitive " ladder " system for ranked games , and new matchmaking mechanics that are designed to " match @-@ up " players of equal skill level . In addition , the replay function , which allows players to record and review past games , was improved . Blizzard also stated that they incorporated changes to the game that were suggested by fans . StarCraft II continues its predecessor 's use of pre @-@ rendered cinematic cut scenes to advance the plot while also improving the quality of in @-@ game cut scenes within the levels themselves , which are rendered on @-@ the @-@ fly using the same game engine as the graphics in the game proper . Blizzard stated that , with the new graphics engine that StarCraft II uses to render the gameplay , they " can actually create in @-@ game cut @-@ scenes of near @-@ cinematic quality " . Improvements include advanced scenery allocation and more detailed space terrain , such as floating space platforms with planets and asteroids in the background . Small cliffs , extensions , and even advertising signs were also shown to have been improved and refined .

 During the development of StarCraft II , it was also announced that the game and its expansions would form a trilogy , with each chapter to center on one of the three playable races . The first expansion – Heart of the Swarm , which focuses on the Zerg race – was released on March 12 , 2013 . The second expansion Legacy of the Void , which centers on the Protoss race , was released on November 10 , 2015 .

 On April 8 , 2010 , Blizzard officially announced that the game would be available in a standard and collector 's edition . The game was also made available for digital download from Blizzard on the release date ; pre @-@ loading began on July 15 . The collector 's edition comes with an artbook , 2 GB flash drive modeled after Jim Raynor 's dog tag with the original StarCraft and Brood War expansion preloaded , behind @-@ the @-@ scenes DVD , soundtrack , comic book , unique avatar portraits , a unique model for the in @-@ game Thor unit in multiplayer , and a World of Warcraft pet . 
 On June 24 , 2010 , at a press @-@ only Korean event , Blizzard announced that Korean players would be able to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription . In PC bangs , or other <unk> , players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won ( approx . $ .50 to $ 1 @.@ 50 ) per hour . Other options include a 30 @-@ day subscription for ₩ 9900 ( approx . $ 8 ) , a 24 hours play @-@ time ticket for ₩ 2000 ( approx . $ 1 @.@ 50 ) , and unlimited access for ₩ 69 @,@ 000 ( approx . $ 56 ) . The end @-@ user license agreement ( EULA ) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard 's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play , while the game itself remains the property of Blizzard . Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well , giving Blizzard greater control over how the game is used . Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by Blizzard . 
 On August 3 , 2011 , Blizzard replaced the previously available StarCraft II demo with the new StarCraft II : Starter Edition . It allows anyone to play part of the game for free and it comes as a 7 GB package downloaded using the Blizzard <unk> client . The Starter Edition is available for Mac and Windows , and requires a Battle.net account and an Internet connection to play .

 Blizzard entered into a co @-@ marketing agreement with Korean Air that lasted for six months , in which two of the airline 's airplanes on both domestic and international routes prominently displayed StarCraft II advertising featuring Jim Raynor on the fuselage . On August 3 , 2010 , Blizzard announced that StarCraft II sold more than one million units worldwide within one day of its release . After two days , when Blizzard began selling the game as a digital download on its website , approximately 500 @,@ 000 additional units of the game were sold , bringing the total up to 1 @.@ 5 million worldwide and making it the fastest @-@ selling strategy game of all time . In its first month on sale , StarCraft II sold a total of three million copies worldwide . As of December 2010 , the game has sold nearly 4 @.@ 5 million units . The game was also heavily pirated , reportedly being downloaded over 2 @.@ 3 million times , and setting a record for most data transferred by a single torrent in only three months .

 Several gaming and technology sites reported an " overheating bug " with StarCraft II that in some cases resulted in permanent damage to video cards . The source of the problem is the fact that the frame rate is not locked on menu screens . This causes the graphics card to continuously render the image , resulting in excessive heat . Blizzard has acknowledged the problem , and posted a temporary workaround . They also recommended ensuring computer systems are well ventilated and contacting the <unk> manufacturer for hardware @-@ related issues . In response to the reports , Blizzard 's Public Relations Manager , Bob Colayco said : " There is no code in our software that will cause video cards to overheat . When we saw this issue first reported , we conducted thorough additional testing and determined that for those players experiencing this problem , the cause is most likely hardware @-@ related . " <unk> has also suggested that the problem is not with StarCraft II , but rather due to poorly maintained hardware and inadequate cooling . They do however agree that the overheating only occurs on non @-@ framerate locked screens and provide the fix that Blizzard has offered to users . Other articles recommend that users regularly clean the dust out of their computer to improve the cooling efficiency of their systems . Blizzard posted a message on their official forums regarding the issue that has since been removed . The original message was : " Screens that are light on detail may make your system overheat if cooling is overall insufficient . This is because the game has nothing to do so it is primarily just working on drawing the screen very quickly . "

 StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty has been met with critical acclaim since its release . It received an aggregated score of 92 @.@ 39 % at GameRankings and 93 / 100 at Metacritic . The game was particularly praised for retaining the popular RTS gameplay from StarCraft , while introducing new features and improved storytelling . GamesRadar felt that " in many ways , StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty feels like StarCraft 2 @.@ 0 – and that ’ s a good thing " , stating that it " delivers on all fronts " . <unk> said the game was " the best RTS game released in years and one of the best games on PC " . In relation to its story , GameTrailers stated , " If there 's anything immediately apparent from Wings of Liberty 's story , it 's that the series ' narrative structure has evolved well beyond the original 's sparse between @-@ sortie intermissions , " calling it " an epic and entertainingly told yarn " , while Eurogamer criticized the dialogue as being " flat " and the characters as being " either clichéd , banal or both " . Giant Bomb echoed this view while also noting the Hyperion portion between missions , finding it to have " more depth of character , more believable pathos , more surprise twists — than I honestly expected out of the story " . IGN however noted that " no doubt franchise fans will eat it up , but newcomers may be wondering what all the fuss is about while going through the early missions that lack the kind of urgency you would hope when the fate of civilization is in peril . " 
 Joystiq was very positive towards the improved multiplayer matchmaking service , calling it " similar to Xbox Live and PlayStation Network , which is a welcome change from the archaic matchmaking of Battle.net in previous Blizzard games " , while GameSpot called the amount of online content " remarkable " , noting the variety of maps and up to 12 player online support . When comparing the single and multiplayer modes , GameSpy felt that the single @-@ player portion was " less inspiring , mostly because of the extremely shallow learning curve " , with the online multiplayer being " so smooth , so challenging , and so much plain @-@ old @-@ fun " . John Meyer of Wired praised the improved graphics engine , saying that it " shows decades of polish " and a " slick new presentation " . Matt Peckham of PC World also noted that some buyers expressed dissatisfaction with the absence of LAN @-@ based multiplayer gameplay , the lack of cross @-@ realm play and the campaign being limited to the Terran race . Game Revolution , in relation to only being able to play the Terran campaign , however , pointed out that " Wings of Liberty has 29 missions ; the original StarCraft had just over 30 . Fair odds say the next one will have roughly the same amount ; <unk> brought about 30 too . We already got the full game for $ 50 , and we ’ re getting offered two expansions . If you want to feel outraged about something , pick something else . " 
 Ars Technica gave the overall game a verdict of " buy " and especially praised the single @-@ player campaign as " fun as hell " . They were also very impressed with the game modding tools that allow users to create their own content and distribute it to other fans . The two " ugly " issues they identified with the game were lack of LAN play and the decision to split up the regions . They suggested that these decisions were influenced by Activision rather than by the game designers at Blizzard , and felt that this would turn many people off of the game and make things difficult for people who have international friends . In a separate article , Ars Technica vigorously supported StarCraft II against a series of 1 @-@ star ratings given to the game on Amazon.com in protest against the lack of LAN play . They argued in Blizzard 's defense against complaints that it was not a full game because only the Terran campaign was released , but did suggest that the customers ' complaints about the lack of LAN and cross @-@ region play were legitimate .

 StarCraft : Brood War has been called the most successful e @-@ sport in the world that includes its own ranking system , and it has been referred to as the national pastime in South Korea , where there are two television channels dedicated to broadcasting professional StarCraft matches . Since its launch , StarCraft II has become a successful e @-@ Sport with many leagues of ongoing tournaments with prize @-@ pools up to US $ 170 @,@ 000 . There have been many tournaments with players from around the world ; GomTV <unk> Global League , <unk> StarCraft League , Major League Gaming , ESL and the North American Star League . StarCraft II has also become the main title in major LANs throughout the world like Assembly and <unk> . 
 The first large StarCraft II tournaments occurred during the beta testing phase , the most notable being the <unk> Invitational and Day [ 9 ] ' s King of the Beta . Currently the largest professional tournament is the GSL ( GomTV Star League ) which is a monthly tournament held in South Korea . The tournament enjoys major corporate sponsorships and prize pools of over $ 100 @,@ 000 . A new North American StarCraft League was announced on February 21 , 2011 and is scheduled for an initial run of three seasons offering $ 400 @,@ 000 in prize money . The first season of the North American Star League started on April 12 , 2011 , with 50 players divided into 5 divisions . It ended on July 10 , 2011 , and the total prize pool was US $ 100 @,@ 000 . The North American Star League has since run for an additional season , with a fifth starting in early 2013 . On May 2 , 2012 , Ongamenet and KeSPA announced a formal switch in StarCraft competition from Brood War to StarCraft II : Wings of Liberty . <unk> will transition over to StarCraft II by late 2012 . 
 After three years of negotiations , Blizzard decided that the Korean e @-@ Sports Players Association ( KeSPA ) was unwilling to cooperate with them in regards to the sharing of profits from competitive StarCraft multiplayer games . This breakdown led to an uncertain future of KeSPA 's legal ability to broadcast Blizzard 's intellectual property of both StarCraft and StarCraft II without paying royalties . MBC Television agreed to Blizzard 's new terms in June 2010 ; KeSPA received a license from Blizzard and Ongamenet will host StarCraft II competitions starting in the summer of 2012 . 
 Blizzard and GomTV signed an agreement on May 26 , 2010 , allowing the latter to create and broadcast the GomTV <unk> Global League , a series of tournaments , each with a US $ 170 @,@ 000 prize pool , in South Korea . This agreement followed the decision from Blizzard to cease the negotiation with KeSPA , and it confirmed that Blizzard had decided to take another route to promote StarCraft II as an e @-@ Sport in South Korea . The non @-@ profit public interest group Public Knowledge made the following statement regarding the issue : " The Battle.net Terms of Use state that it is a violation of the agreement — and an infringement of Blizzard 's copyright in the underlying game — to " use the Service for any ' e @-@ sports ' or group competition sponsored , promoted or facilitated by any commercial or non @-@ profit entity without Blizzard 's prior written consent .

 In early 2012 Blizzard Entertainment announced the 2012 StarCraft II World Championship Series ( WCS ) , featuring over 30 offline events . The WCS featured thousands of dollars in prize pools and a system starting from National Qualifiers , National Finals , Continental Finals , and culminating in the World Championship Finals in Shanghai , China . The Battle.net World Championship ( also known as the WCS Global Finals ) winner was professional South Korean player Lee @-@ Sak " <unk> " Won from team <unk> , winning both the trophy and US $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 There are other StarCraft 2 tournaments that may not bear the WCS name , but allow players to earn WCS points . A few such tournaments include some of the aforementioned tournaments such as Intel Extreme Masters ( IEM ) and DreamHack Open , but also ASUS <unk> , Red Bull Battlegrounds , and <unk> Cup . A full list of tournaments can be found on the StarCraft 2 <unk> . 
 Professional StarCraft II began to decline in popularity by 2012 , in part because of competition from games like League of Legends . 
 = = LAN play = = 
 StarCraft II does not offer the ability to play directly over a local area network ( LAN ) , as is possible with StarCraft ; all network games are routed through the Internet via Blizzard 's gaming servers . The latency delay between commands issued and game response when played online is greatly reduced when playing over a LAN and this allows for much finer control over in @-@ game units ; there were concerns that a professional scene would not develop as a result . Over 250 @,@ 000 fans signed a petition asking Blizzard to add LAN play to StarCraft II , before the game 's release . Currently , Blizzard has no plans to support LAN play . Although it does not change the routing of the game through Blizzard 's servers , a Players Near You feature was added in StarCraft II patch 2 @.@ 0 @.@ 4 , to help with organizing games with other players on the same local network .

 = Point Loma , San Diego = 
 Point Loma is a seaside community within the city of San Diego , California . Geographically it is a hilly peninsula that is bordered on the west and south by the Pacific Ocean , the east by the San Diego Bay and Old Town , and the north by the San Diego River . Together with the Silver Strand / Coronado peninsula , the Point Loma peninsula defines San Diego Bay and separates it from the Pacific Ocean . The term " Point Loma " is used to describe both the neighborhood and the peninsula . 
 Point Loma has an estimated population of 47 @,@ 981 ( including Ocean Beach ) , according to the 2010 Census . The Peninsula Planning Area , which includes most of Point Loma , comprises approximately 4 @,@ 400 acres ( 1 @,@ 800 ha ) . 
 Point Loma is historically important as the landing place of the first European expedition to come ashore in present @-@ day California . The peninsula has been described as " where California began " . Today , Point Loma houses two major military bases , a national cemetery , a national monument , and a university , in addition to residential and commercial areas . 
 = = History = = 
 Loma is the Spanish word for hill . The original name of the peninsula was La Punta de la Loma de San Diego , translated as Hill Point of San Diego . This was later anglicized to Point Loma . 
 There were no permanent indigenous settlements on Point Loma because of a lack of fresh water . Kumeyaay people did visit Ocean Beach periodically to harvest mussels , clams , abalone and lobsters . 
 Point Loma was discovered by Europeans on September 28 , 1542 when Portuguese navigator Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo ( João Rodrigues <unk> in Portuguese ) departed from Mexico and led an expedition for the Spanish crown to explore the west coast of what is now the United States . Cabrillo described San Diego Bay as " a very good enclosed port " . Historians believe he docked his flagship on Point Loma 's east shore , probably at Ballast Point . This was the first landing by a European in present @-@ day California , so that Point Loma has been described as " where California began " . 
 More than 200 years were to pass before a permanent European settlement was established in San Diego in 1769 . Mission San Diego itself was in the San Diego River valley , but its port was a bayside beach in Point Loma called La Playa ( Spanish for beach ) . The historic La Playa Trail , the oldest European trail on the West Coast , led from the Mission and Presidio to La Playa , where ships anchored and unloaded their cargoes via small boats . Part of the route became present @-@ day Rosecrans Street . In his book Two Years Before the Mast , Richard Henry Dana , Jr. describes how sailors in the 1830s camped on the beach at La Playa , accumulated cattle hides for export , and hunted for wood and jackrabbits in the hills of Point Loma . The beach at La Playa continued to serve as San Diego 's " port " until the establishment of New Town ( current downtown ) in the 1870s . 
 Ballast Point got its name from the practice of ships discarding their ballast there on arriving in San Diego Bay and taking on ballast as they left for the open ocean . Fort <unk> was constructed at Ballast Point in 1797 . Ballast Point and La Playa are now on the grounds of Naval Base Point Loma . 
 The longtime association of San Diego with the U.S. military began in Point Loma . The southern portion of the Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852 . Over the next several decades the Army set up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans . Significant U.S. Navy presence in San Diego began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma . The Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego was commissioned in 1921 and the San Diego Naval Training Center in 1923 , both in Point Loma ; the Naval Training Center was closed in 1997 . During World War II the entire southern portion of the peninsula was closed to civilians and used for military purposes , including a battery of coast artillery . Following the war the area retained multiple Navy commands , including a submarine base and a Naval Electronics Laboratory ; they were eventually consolidated into Naval Base Point Loma . Other portions of Fort Rosecrans became Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery and Cabrillo National Monument . 
 Following the death in 1891 of Helena Blavatsky its founder , Katherine Tingley moved the headquarters of the Theosophical Society to " Lomaland " , a hilltop campus in Point Loma overlooking the ocean . The facility with its unusual architecture and even more unusual lifestyles became an important source of music and culture for residents of San Diego between 1900 and 1920 . Producing most of its own food , the Society also experimented widely with planting trees and crops such as eucalyptus and avocado , giving that formerly barren part of Point Loma its current heavily wooded character . The Lomaland site is now the campus of Point Loma Nazarene University . 
 During the 1920s there was a dirt airstrip known as Dutch Flats in what is now the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma . That is where Charles Lindbergh first tested and flew his airplane , The Spirit of St. Louis , which had been built in San Diego by the Ryan Aeronautical Company . A U.S. Post Office now located on the site contains several historic plaques commemorating Dutch Flats and Lindbergh . 
 Due to the prevailing sea @-@ breezes and long north @-@ south ridge , Point Loma was a well @-@ known gliding site during 1929 @-@ 1935 . William Hawley Bowlus the Superintendent of Construction on the Spirit of St. Louis and resident of Point Loma built the first American sailplane the Bowlus SP @-@ 1 and flew that aircraft along the west side of Point Loma to establish new American endurance records . Bowlus later used other refined designs to soar for over 9 hours near the Cabrillo National Monument , and one of Bowlus ' students Jack C. Barstow soared over Point Loma for over 15 hours in 1930 to establish an unofficial world record for soaring endurance .

 The best known landmark in Point Loma is the Old Point Loma lighthouse , an icon occasionally used to represent the entire city of San Diego . ( It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the " Old Spanish Lighthouse " ; in fact it was built after California was admitted to the United States . ) Perched atop the southern point that creates the entrance of the bay with Coronado , the small , two story lighthouse was completed in 1854 and first lit on November 15 , 1855 . At 422 feet ( 129 m ) above sea level at the entrance of the bay , the seemingly good location for a lighthouse soon proved to be a poor choice , as fog and cloud within the marine layer often obscured the beam for ocean @-@ going vessels . On March 23 , 1891 , the lighthouse ceased to be used for its original purpose , as a new lighthouse was built nearer sea level on the same southern point . The Old Point Loma Lighthouse is now partially open to the public and has been refurbished to its historic 1880s interior . It is located within the Cabrillo National Monument , named after Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo , the first European explorer to see San Diego Bay . The lighthouse is listed on the National Register of Historic Places . 
 In addition to the lighthouse , there are four other sites in Point Loma listed on the National Register of Historic Places : Cabrillo National Monument , the Marine Corps Recruit Depot Historic District , Naval Training Center San Diego , and Rosecroft . 
 Point Loma is recognized as a National Landmark of Soaring of the National Soaring Museum because of the many record flights that took place along the promontory . Two plaques honoring these accomplishments are near the entrance to the Cabrillo National Monument .

 = = = Geology = = = 
 On the west side of the peninsula there are sandstone cliffs along the ocean , called the Sunset Cliffs . Geologically these cliffs are known as the Point Loma Formation . They contain fossils , including dinosaur fossils , from the Late Cretaceous period , about 75 million years ago . The formation represents one of the few sites containing dinosaur fossils in the state of California . Overlying the Point Loma Formation is another Late Cretaceous deposit called the Cabrillo Formation , which crops out in various areas of Point Loma . 
 The top of the peninsula is fairly flat , reaches an elevation of 422 ft ( 129 m ) , and is capped by much younger sandstone and conglomerate deposits from the Pleistocene era , 1 million years or less in age . These flat @-@ lying beds lie directly on top of the gently dipping Point Loma and Cabrillo formations . The gap in the sedimentary record , called an Angular unconformity , represents about 70 million years of non @-@ deposition and / or erosion . 
 The cliffs on the ocean side of the peninsula are sheer and are undergoing constant erosion due to wave action . On the east side the land slopes into San Diego Bay more gradually , so that homes and developments go right to the water 's edge . At the northern end of the peninsula the cliffs and hills become lower , disappearing entirely in Ocean Beach and the Midway area , where the San Diego River flows . 
 Much of the Midway area is former marshland which has been filled in for development . In fact , the San Diego River used to flow through the Midway area into San Diego Bay , isolating Point Loma from San Diego . Because of fears that San Diego Bay might silt up , the river was diverted to its present course north of Point Loma by a levee built in 1877 . Parts of Liberty Station and Point Loma Village are also fill land , reclaimed from sand spits and wetlands surrounding the Bay . The only remnant of the formerly extensive wetlands in Point Loma , aside from the riverbed itself , is a city @-@ owned nature preserve called <unk> Slough , which branches off from the river near its mouth .
