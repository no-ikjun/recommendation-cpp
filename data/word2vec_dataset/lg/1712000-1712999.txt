 In contrast to his real @-@ life personality , which was described as " a regular guy and , by all accounts , one of show business ' most low @-@ key , decent people " , Hartman often played seedy , vain or unpleasant characters as well as comedic villains . He noted that his standard character was a " jerky guy " , and described his usual roles as " the weasel parade " , citing Lionel Hutz , Bill McNeal , Troy McClure and Ted Maltin from Jingle All the Way as examples . Hartman enjoyed playing such roles because he " just want [ ed ] to be funny , and villains tend to be funny because their foibles are all there to see . " 
 He often played supporting roles , rather than the lead part . He said " throughout my career , I 've never been a huge star , but I 've made steady progress and that 's the way I like it , " and " It 's fun coming in as the second or third lead . If the movie or TV show bombs , you aren 't to blame . " Hartman was considered a " utility player " on SNL with a " kind of Everyman quality " which enabled him to appear in the majority of sketches , often in very distinct roles . Jan Hooks stated of his work on SNL : " Phil never had an ounce of competition . He was a team player . It was a privilege for him , I believe , to play support and do it very well . He was never insulted , no matter how small the role may have been . " He was disciplined in his performances , studying the scripts beforehand . Hooks added : " Phil knew how to listen . And he knew how to look you in the eye , and he knew the power of being able to lay back and let somebody else be funny , and then do the reactions . I think Phil was more of an actor than a comedian . " Film critic Pauline Kael declared that " Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks on Saturday Night Live are two of the best comic actors I 've ever seen . " 
 Writer and acting coach Paul Ryan noted Hartman 's work ethic with his impressions . He assembled a collection of video footage of the figure he was preparing to impersonate and watched this continually until he " completely embodied the person " . Ryan concluded that " what made [ Hartman 's impressions ] so funny and spot on was Phil 's ability to add that perfect touch that only comes from trial and error and practicing in front of audiences and fellow actors . " Hartman described this process as " technical . " Journalist Lyle V. Harris said Hartman showed a " rare talent for morphing into ... anybody he wanted to be . " 
 Ken Tucker summarized Hartman 's comedic style : " He could momentarily fool audiences into thinking he was the straight man , but then he 'd cock an eyebrow and give his voice an ironic lilt that delivered a punchline like a fast slider — you barely saw it coming until you started laughing . " Hartman claimed that he borrowed his style from actor Bill Murray : " He 's been a great influence on me – when he did that smarmy thing in Ghostbusters , then the same sort of thing in Groundhog Day . I tried to imitate it . I couldn 't . I wasn 't good enough . But I discovered an element of something else , so in a sick kind of way I made myself a career by doing a bad imitation of another comic . "

 Hartman married Gretchen Lewis in 1970 and they divorced sometime before 1982 . He married real estate agent Lisa Strain in 1982 , and their marriage lasted three years . Strain told People that Hartman was reclusive off screen and " would disappear emotionally ... he 'd be in his own world . That passivity made you crazy . " Hartman married former model and aspiring actress Brynn Omdahl ( born Vicki Jo Omdahl ) in November 1987 , having met her on a blind date the previous year . Together they had two children , Sean and <unk> Hartman . The marriage had difficulties — Brynn reportedly felt intimidated by her husband 's success and was frustrated she could not find any on her own , although neither party wanted a divorce . Hartman considered retiring to save the marriage . He tried to get Brynn acting roles but she became progressively more reliant on narcotics and alcohol , entering rehab several times . Because of his close friendship with SNL associate Jan Hooks , Brynn joked on occasion that Hooks and Hartman were married " on some other level " . 
 Stephen Root , Hartman 's NewsRadio co @-@ star , felt that few people knew " the real Phil Hartman " as he was " one of those people who never seemed to come out of character , " but he nevertheless gave the impression of a family man who cared deeply for his children . In his spare time , Hartman enjoyed driving , flying , sailing , marksmanship and playing the guitar .

 On the evening of May 27 , 1998 , Brynn Hartman visited the Italian restaurant <unk> di <unk> in Encino , California , with producer and writer Christine Zander , who said she was " in a good frame of mind . " After returning to the couple 's nearby home , Brynn started a " heated " argument with her husband , who threatened to leave her if she started using drugs again , after which he then went to bed . While Hartman slept , Brynn entered his bedroom sometime before 3 : 00 a.m. local time on May 28 with a .38 caliber handgun and fatally shot him twice in the head once in his side . She was intoxicated and had recently taken cocaine . 
 Brynn drove to the home of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing , but he did not initially believe her . The pair drove back to the house in separate cars , after which Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time . Upon seeing Hartman 's body , Douglas called 911 at 6 : 20 a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans ' two children from the premises , by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth . 
 Los Angeles police stated Hartman 's death was caused by a " domestic discord " between the couple . A friend stated that Brynn allegedly " had trouble controlling her anger ... She got attention by losing her temper . " A neighbor of the Hartmans told a CNN reporter that the couple had been experiencing marital problems : " It 's been building , but I didn 't think it would lead to this " , and actor Steve Guttenberg said they had been " a very happy couple , and they always had the appearance of being well @-@ balanced . " 
 Other causes for the incident were later suggested . Before committing the act , Brynn was taking the antidepressant drug Zoloft . A wrongful @-@ death lawsuit was filed in 1999 by Brynn 's brother , Gregory Omdahl , against the drug 's manufacturer , Pfizer , and her child 's psychiatrist Arthur <unk> , who provided samples of Zoloft to Brynn . Hartman 's friend and former SNL colleague Jon Lovitz has accused Hartman 's former NewsRadio co @-@ star Andy Dick of re @-@ introducing Brynn to cocaine , causing her to relapse and suffer a nervous breakdown . Dick claims to have known nothing of her condition . In 2006 , Lovitz claimed that Dick had approached him at a restaurant and said , " I put the Phil Hartman hex on you ; you 're the next one to die . " The following year at the Laugh Factory comedy club in Los Angeles , Lovitz and Dick had a further altercation over the issue . Dick asserts that he is not at fault in relation to Hartman 's death . 
 Brynn 's sister Katharine Omdahl and brother @-@ in @-@ law Mike Wright raised the two Hartman children . Hartman 's will stipulated that each child will receive their inheritance over several years after they turn 25 . The total value of Hartman 's estate was estimated at $ 1 @.@ 23 million . In accordance with Hartman 's will , his body was cremated by Forest Lawn Memorial Park and Mortuary , Glendale , California , and his ashes were scattered over Santa Catalina Island 's Emerald Bay .

 Hartman was widely mourned in Hollywood . NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer stated that Hartman " was blessed with a tremendous gift for creating characters that made people laugh . Everyone who had the pleasure of working with Phil knows that he was a man of tremendous warmth , a true professional and a loyal friend . " Guttenberg expressed shock at Hartman 's death , and Steve Martin said he was " a deeply funny and very happy person . " Matt Groening called him " a master " , and director Joe Dante said , " He was one of those guys who was a dream to work with . I don 't know anybody who didn 't like him . " Dan Snierson of Entertainment Weekly concluded that Hartman was " the last person you 'd expect to read about in lurid headlines in your morning paper " and " a decidedly regular guy , beloved by everyone he worked with . " In 2007 , Entertainment Weekly ranked Hartman the 87th greatest television icon of all time , and Maxim named Hartman the top Saturday Night Live performer of all time . 
 Rehearsals for The Simpsons were canceled on the day of Hartman 's death , as was that night 's performance by The Groundlings . The season five premiere episode of NewsRadio , " Bill Moves On , " finds Hartman 's character , Bill McNeal , has died of a heart attack , while the other characters reminisce about his life . Lovitz joined the show in his place from the following episode . A special episode of Saturday Night Live commemorating Hartman 's work on the show aired on June 13 , 1998 . Rather than substituting another voice actor , the writers of The Simpsons retired Hartman 's characters , and the season ten episode " Bart the Mother " ( his final appearance on the show ) was dedicated to him , as was his final film , Small Soldiers . 
 At the time of his death , Hartman was preparing to voice Zapp Brannigan , a character written specifically for him on Groening 's second animated series Futurama . Even though the role was made for Hartman , he still insisted on auditioning and according to Groening , he ' nailed it ' . After Hartman 's death , Futurama 's lead character Philip J. Fry was named in his honor , and Billy West took over the role of Brannigan . Though executive producer David X. Cohen credits West with using his own take on the character , West later said that he purposely tweaked Zapp 's voice to better match Hartman 's intended portrayal . Hartman was also planning to appear with Lovitz in the indie film The Day of Swine and Roses , scheduled to begin production in August 1998 . 
 <unk> and Hartman 's brother , John Hartmann , published the album Flat TV in 2002 . The album is a selection of comedy sketches recorded by Hartman in the 1970s that had been kept in storage until their release . Hartmann commented : " I 'm putting this out there because I 'm dedicating my life to fulfilling his dreams . This [ album ] is my brother doing what he loved . " In 2013 , Flat TV was optioned by Michael " <unk> " <unk> 's animation company Worker Studio for an animated adaptation . The deal came about after Michael T. Scott , a partner in the company , posted a hand @-@ written letter he had received from Hartman in 1997 on the internet , leading to a correspondence between Scott and Paul Hartmann . 
 In 2007 , a campaign was started on Facebook by Alex Stevens and endorsed by Hartman 's brother , Paul Hartmann , to have Hartman inducted to Canada 's Walk of Fame . Amongst the numerous events to publicize the campaign , Ben Miner , of the Sirius XM Radio channel Laugh Attack , dedicated the month of April 2012 to Hartman . The campaign ended in success and Hartman was inducted to the Walk of Fame on September 22 , 2012 , with Paul accepting the award on his late brother 's behalf . Hartman was also awarded the Cineplex Legends Award . In June 2013 , it was announced that Hartman would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , which was unveiled on August 26 , 2014 . Additionally , a special prize at the Canadian Comedy Awards was named for Hartman . Beginning with the 13th Canadian Comedy Awards in 2012 , the Phil Hartman Award was awarded to " an individual who helps to better the Canadian comedy community . " In 2015 , Rolling Stone magazine ranked Hartman as one of the top @-@ ten greatest Saturday Night Live cast members throughout the show 's forty @-@ year history , coming in seventh on their list of all one @-@ hundred @-@ and @-@ forty @-@ one players . 
 Hartman has been cited as an influence by Bill Hader and Mike Myers .

 = SMS Bussard = 
 SMS Bussard ( " His Majesty 's Ship Bussard — Buzzard " ) was an unprotected cruiser of the Imperial German Navy , built in the 1880s . She was the lead ship of her class , which included five other vessels . The cruiser 's keel was laid in 1888 , and she was launched in January 1890 and commissioned in October of that year . Intended for overseas duty , Bussard was armed with a main battery of eight 10 @.@ 5 @-@ centimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns , and could steam at a speed of 15 @.@ 5 knots ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 Bussard served abroad for the majority of her career , first in the East Asia Division in the mid @-@ 1890s , and in German East Africa for the first decade of the 20th century . She had a relatively peaceful career ; her only major action came while stationed in Asia in 1894 . There , she assisted in suppressing a local revolt in Samoa . In 1910 , she returned to Germany , where she remained in service for only two more years ; she was stricken in October 1912 and scrapped the following year in Hamburg . 
 = = Design = = 
 Bussard was 82 @.@ 6 meters ( 271 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 12 @.@ 5 m ( 41 ft ) and a draft of 4 @.@ 45 m ( 14 @.@ 6 ft ) forward . She displaced 1 @,@ 868 t ( 1 @,@ 838 long tons ; 2 @,@ 059 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines powered by four coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . These provided a top speed of 15 @.@ 5 kn ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) and a range of approximately 2 @,@ 990 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 540 km ; 3 @,@ 440 mi ) at 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with eight 10 @.@ 5 cm K L / 35 guns in single pedestal mounts , supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total . They had a range of 8 @,@ 200 m ( 26 @,@ 900 ft ) . Two guns were placed side by side forward , two on each broadside in sponsons , and two side by side aft . The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon . She was also equipped with two 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes , both of which were mounted on the deck . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Bussard was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Danzig under the contract name " C " . She was launched on 23 January 1890 ; fitting @-@ out work was completed quickly , and the new cruiser was ready for commissioning into the Imperial fleet on 7 October 1890 . She thereafter served on overseas stations in the German Empire . Early in her career , Bussard served on the East Asia Station with the East Asia Division . In July 1893 , she and her sister ship Falke assisted in the suppression of a local revolt led by Mata 'afa Iosefo in Samoa . They were joined by the old British corvette HMS <unk> , and the three vessels bombarded rebel positions on 7 July , forcing their surrender . Mata 'afa was taken to Apia , the capital , while Bussard remained behind to ensure the demilitarization of his supporters . 
 In 1898 , Bussard returned to Germany , arriving in the Elbe River in March . On the return voyage , she carried several tropical birds for the Berlin Zoological Garden . After her arrival , Bussard went into drydock at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig for reconstruction . The barque rig was cut down to a top @-@ sail schooner rig . A new , larger conning tower structure was built . Work was completed by 1900 , when Bussard returned to service . She was sent to China in response to the Boxer Rebellion earlier that year . While en route to China on 6 August 1900 , a boiler room exploded aboard Bussard , due to a blown out manhole gasket ; the explosion killed three sailors and seriously wounded another three men . After arriving in China , Bussard took part in the attack on the Taku Forts , along with her sisters Seeadler and Geier . Her crew suffered no casualties during the campaign . 
 As of 1901 , Bussard was assigned to the East Africa Station in German East Africa , along with the unprotected cruiser Schwalbe . The only other German warships in Africa at the time were the gunboats Habicht and the elderly Wolf ; these two ships were stationed in German West Africa . Bussard remained on the East Africa station in 1904 , and Schwalbe was replaced by her sister Sperber . During this period , Hans <unk> served as the ship 's navigation officer ; he held this position for two years . 
 By 1908 , Sperber had been transferred to German West Africa , and another of Bussard 's sisters , Seeadler , took her place alongside Bussard . Bussard remained in Africa until 1910 , when she returned to Germany for a second and final time . She remained in active service for only a brief time ; she was stricken from the naval register on 25 October 1912 and was broken up for scrap the following year in Hamburg . 
 = Blue men of the Minch = 
 The blue men of the Minch , also known as storm kelpies or in Scottish Gaelic as na fir <unk> , fear gorm or sruth nam fear gorm , are mythological creatures inhabiting the stretch of water between the northern Outer Hebrides and mainland Scotland , looking for sailors to drown and stricken boats to sink . They appear to be localised to the Minch and surrounding areas , unknown in other parts of Scotland and without counterparts in the rest of the world . 
 Apart from their blue colour , the mythical creatures look much like humans , and are about the same size . They have the power to create storms , but when the weather is fine they float sleeping on or just below the surface of the water . The blue men swim with their torsos raised out of the sea , twisting and diving as porpoises do . They are able to speak , and when a group approaches a ship its chief may shout two lines of poetry to the master of the vessel and challenge him to complete the verse . If the skipper fails in that task then the blue men will attempt to overturn the ship and capsize it . 
 Suggestions to explain the mythical blue men include that they may be a personification of the sea , or originate with the Picts , whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks . The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland , where they spent the winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Minch , a strait that separates the northwest Highlands of Scotland and the northern Inner Hebrides from the northern Outer Hebrides , is home to the blue men . According to lexicographer Edward Dwelly , in the Scottish Gaelic terms for the blue men – na fir <unk> , fear gorm and sruth nam fear gorm – the word gorm refers to any shade of blue and fear can be translated as " man " , na fir representing the plural " the men " . 
 The blue men are also styled as storm kelpies . The most common water spirits in Scottish folklore , kelpies are usually described as powerful horses , but the name is attributed to several different forms and fables throughout the country . The name kelpie may be derived from the Scottish Gaelic <unk> or <unk> , meaning " heifer " or " colt " . 
 = = Folk beliefs = = 
 = = = Description and common attributes = = = 
 The mythical blue men may have been part of a tribe of " fallen angels " that split into three ; the first became the ground dwelling fairies , the second evolved to become the sea inhabiting blue men , and the remainder the " Merry Dancers " of the Northern Lights in the sky . The legendary creatures are the same size as humans but , as the name implies , blue in colour . Writer and journalist Lewis Spence thought they were the " personifications of the sea itself " as they took their blue colouration from the hue of the sea . Their faces are grey and long in shape and some have long arms , which are also grey , and they favour blue headgear ; at least one account claims that they also have wings . The tempestuous water around the Shiant Isles 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) to the north of Skye , an area subject to rapid tides in all weathers , flows beside the caves inhabited by the blue men , a stretch of water known as the Current of Destruction owing to the number of ships wrecked there . 
 Although other storm kelpies are reported as inhabiting the Gulf of <unk> , described by poet , writer and folklorist Alasdair Alpin MacGregor as " the fiercest of the Highland storm kelpies " , the blue men are confined to a very restricted area . According to Donald A. Mackenzie they have no counterparts elsewhere in the world or even in other areas of Scotland ; such limited range is rare for beliefs in spirits and demons . Folklorist and Tiree minister John Gregorson Campbell states that they were unknown in Argyll on the nearby coast of the mainland for instance , although Church of Scotland minister John Brand , who visited <unk> in Shetland in mid @-@ 1700 , recounts a tale of what may have been a blue man in the waters around the island . In the form of a bearded old man it rose out of the water , terrifying the passengers and crew of a boat it was following . 
 In traditional tales the blue men have the power to create severe storms , but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water . They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea , twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise . To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night . They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray , roaring with laughter as vessels capsize . 
 When the blue men gather to attack passing vessels their chief , sometimes named as <unk> , rises up out of the water and shouts two lines of poetry to the skipper , and if he cannot add two lines to complete the verse the blue men seize his boat . Mackenzie highlights the following exchange between the skipper of a boat and the chief of the blue men : 
 The quick responses took the blue chief by surprise ; defeated and unable to do any damage to the vessel , the blue men returned to their underwater caves , allowing the vessel free passage through the strait . The blue men may alternatively board a passing vessel and demand tribute from its crew , threatening that if it is not forthcoming they will raise up a storm . 
 = = = Capture and killing = = = 
 No surviving tales mention attempts to kill the demons , but a Gregorson Campbell story tells of the capture of a blue man . Sailors seize a blue man and tie him up on board their ship after he is discovered " sleeping on the waters " . Two fellow blue men give chase , calling out to each other as they swim towards the ship : 
 On hearing his companions ' voices the captured spirit breaks free of his bonds and jumps overboard as he answers : 
 Sailors thus believed that all blue men have names by which they address each other . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Mackenzie 's explanation of the legend of the blue men was based partly on research into the Annals of Ireland and goes back to the times of Harald Fairhair , the first Norse king , and his battles against the Vikings . The Scottish Gaelic term fear gorm , meaning " blue men " , is the descriptor for a negro according to Dwelly . Thus sruth nam fear gorm , one of the blue men 's Gaelic names , literally translates as " stream of the blue men " , or " river , tide or stream of the blue negro " . Around the 9th century the Vikings took Moors they had captured and were using as slaves to Ireland . The Vikings spent winter months near the Shiant Isles , and Mackenzie attributes the story of the blue men to " marooned foreign slaves " . He quotes an excerpt from historian Alan Orr Anderson 's Early sources of Scottish history , A.D. 500 to 1286 : 
 These were the blue men [ fir <unk> ] , because Moors are the same as negroes ; Mauritania is the same as negro @-@ land [ literally , the same as blackness ] . 
 More recent newspaper reports have repeated Mackenzie 's hypothesis . Historian Malcolm Archibald agrees the legend originates from the days Norsemen had North African slaves , but speculates that the myth may have originated with the Tuareg people of Saharan Africa , who were known as the " blue men of the desert " . 
 The origin of the blue men of the Minch may alternatively lie with " tattooing people " specifically the Picts , whose Latin name picti means " painted people " . If they were seen crossing the water in boats resembling the kayaks of the Finn @-@ men they may have given simple islanders and mariners the impression of the upper part of the body rising out of the water . 
 = Krake = 
 Krake ( German for " octopus " ) is a steel Dive Coaster roller coaster at Heide Park in <unk> , Lower Saxony , Germany manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard . It is the first roller coaster of its kind in Germany . At a cost of 12 million euros , the roller coaster features floorless trains , 476 m ( 1 @,@ 562 ft ) of track , and a maximum height of 41 m ( 135 ft ) . The attraction officially opened to the public on April 16 , 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 Speculation that Heide Park would be getting a new roller coaster began in late 2009 after it was revealed that the park was working on a project code named " <unk> 2011 " ( translates to " Monster 2011 " ) . In September 2010 , track pieces from manufacture Bolliger & Mabillard began to be delivered to the park which then led to rumours that the new roller coaster would be a Dive Coaster . On October 31 , 2010 , Heide Park officially announced Germany 's first Dive Coaster , Krake . 
 Construction was handled by RCS , a German construction company . Beginning with the splashdown area , construction later progressed into the <unk> loop and station areas . In late January 2011 , the final piece of track ( top of the first drop ) was installed . After testing and a ribbon cutting ceremony , Krake opened on April 16 , 2011 . 
 After the original advertised octopus mouth ( where riders would drop through ) that was to be placed at the bottom of the first drop was never built , the public began to question why the park didn 't follow through with what they advertised . In response , the mouth was constructed during the following off @-@ season .

 Krake is based on a pirate theme and features riders being " eaten " by an octopus . 
 Once the floor drops and the front gate opens , the train is dispatched straight into the 41 @-@ metre ( 135 ft ) lift hill . Once at the top , the train continues going straight for a short period before making a left turn into the holding brake . After about three seconds , the train descends the 87 @-@ degree drop and reaches a speed of 103 km / h ( 64 mph ) . At the bottom , the train enters the " monster 's " mouth , followed by a splashdown . Then , the train goes through an Immelmann loop . After going over an airtime hill , the train makes a banked right turn into the final brake run . The train makes a left turn into the brake run before entering the station .

 = Madness ( band ) = 
 Madness are an English ska band from Camden Town , London , that formed in 1976 . One of the most prominent bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s 2 Tone ska revival , they continue to perform with their most recognised line @-@ up of seven members . 
 Madness achieved most of their success in the early to mid @-@ 1980s . Both Madness and UB40 spent 214 weeks on the UK singles charts over the course of the decade , holding the record for most weeks spent by a group in the 1980s UK singles charts . However , Madness achieved this in a shorter time period ( 1980 – 1986 ) . 
 Madness have had 15 singles reach the UK top ten , one UK number one single ( " House of Fun " ) and two number ones in Ireland , " House of Fun " and " Wings of a Dove " . 
 = = Career = =

 The core of the band formed as The North London Invaders in 1976 , and included Mike Barson ( Monsieur <unk> ) on keyboards and vocals , Chris Foreman ( Chrissy Boy ) on guitar and Lee Thompson ( Kix ) on saxophone and vocals . They later recruited John Hasler on drums and Cathal Smyth ( better known as Chas Smash ) on bass guitar . Later in the year , they were joined by lead vocalist Dikron Tulane . 
 This six @-@ piece line @-@ up lasted until part way through 1977 , when Graham McPherson ( better known as Suggs ) took over the lead vocals after seeing the band perform in a friend 's garden . Dikron went on to be an actor under the name <unk> <unk> . Smyth , who left after an argument with Barson , was replaced by Gavin Rodgers , Barson 's girlfriend 's brother . McPherson was kicked out of the band for too often choosing to watch Chelsea instead of rehearsing . Thompson left the band after Barson criticised his saxophone playing . 
 By 1978 , the band had allowed McPherson to return , after filling in temporarily for Hasler ( who had taken over vocals when McPherson was removed ) . Thompson returned after patching things up with Barson . Drummer Daniel Woodgate ( Woody ) and bass player Mark Bedford ( <unk> ) also joined the band , replacing Garry Dovey and Rodgers , respectively . After briefly changing their name to Morris and the Minors , the band renamed itself as Madness in 1979 , paying homage to one of their favourite songs by ska / reggae artist Prince Buster . The band remained a sextet until late 1979 , when Chas Smash rejoined and officially became the seventh member of Madness as a backing vocalist and dancer . 
 = = = 1979 – 1981 : Early success = = = 
 During 1979 , the band began to attract a live following in London , being regulars at the Dublin Castle in Camden Town . The band 's first commercial recording was the Lee Thompson composition " The Prince " . The song , like the band 's name , paid homage to their idol , Prince Buster . The song was released through 2 Tone Records , the label of The Specials founder Jerry Dammers . The song was a surprise hit , peaking in the UK music charts at number 16 . A performance of " The Prince " on popular UK music show Top of the Pops helped Madness gain public recognition . Madness then toured with fellow 2 Tone bands The Specials and The Selecter , before recording their debut album . 
 That debut album , One Step Beyond ... was released by Stiff Records . The album included a re @-@ recording of " The Prince " and its B @-@ side " Madness " , and the band 's second and third singles : " One Step Beyond " and " My Girl " . The title song was a cover of the B @-@ side of the 1960s Prince Buster hit " Al Capone " . One Step Beyond ... stayed in the British charts for 78 weeks , peaking at number 2 . After the release of " My Girl " , the band felt that they had exhausted the material from One Step Beyond ... , and did not want to release any more singles from the album . However , Dave Robinson , head of Stiff Records , disagreed . Eventually , a compromise was made , and the band decided to release an EP featuring one album track and three new tracks . The result was the Work Rest and Play EP , which was headlined by the song " Night Boat to Cairo " , from the One Step Beyond album . The EP reached number 6 in the UK singles chart . 
 Live recordings of Madness performances as well as those by other 2 Tone bands were used in the documentary film and soundtrack album Dance Craze . 
 In 1980 , the band 's second album , Absolutely reached number 2 in the UK album charts . Absolutely spawned some of the band 's biggest hits , most notably " Baggy Trousers " , which peaked at number 3 in the UK singles chart . " Embarrassment " reached number 4 in the charts , and the instrumental song " The Return of the Los Palmas 7 " climbed to number 7 . Although the album reviews were generally less enthusiastic than those of One Step Beyond ... , they were mostly positive . Robert Christgau gave the album a favourable B- grade , but Rolling Stone awarded the album just one out of five stars . Rolling Stone was particularly scathing of the ska revival in general , stating that " The Specials wasn 't very good " and Madness were simply " the Blues Brothers with English accents " . 
 A drama @-@ documentary film entitled Take It or Leave It was released in 1981 , featuring the band members playing themselves in a re @-@ creation of their early days to the then @-@ current period . 
 = = = 1981 – 1983 : Change of direction = = = 
 In 1981 , the band 's third studio album , 7 , reached number 5 in the UK album charts and contained three hit singles : " Grey Day " ( no . 4 , April 1981 ) , " Shut Up " ( no . 7 , September 1981 ) , and " Cardiac Arrest " ( no . 14 , February 1982 ) . In an article in 1979 , Chris Foreman explained that the band 's music would move with the times , and change styles as time goes on . This was shown to be the case , as unlike the two ska @-@ filled , fast @-@ paced albums that preceded it , 7 was something of a change in direction . Suggs ' vocal performance changed significantly , and his strong accent from the previous albums had been watered down . The album strayed from the ska @-@ influenced sound of One Step Beyond ... and Absolutely , and moved towards a pop sound ; a trend that continued with subsequent albums . 
 Near the end of 1981 , Madness released one of their most recognised songs : a cover of Labi Siffre 's 1971 hit " It Must Be Love " . The song climbed to number 4 in the UK , and in 1983 , the song peaked at number 33 in the US charts . In 1982 , Madness released their only number 1 hit to date , " House of Fun " , which they played live on the 1980s series The Young Ones , and also reached number 1 in the album charts with their first compilation , Complete Madness . 
 In November 1982 , they released their fourth studio album , The Rise & Fall , which was well received in the UK , but did not get an American release . Instead , many of its songs were included on the US compilation Madness , including " Our House " , which was their most internationally successful single to date . " Our House " reached number 5 in the UK music charts and number 7 in the US charts ; it was also performed live on The Young Ones . Many reviewers compared The Rise & Fall to The Kinks ' Village Green Preservation Society , and it is at times retrospectively considered a concept album . The album also featured " Primrose Hill " , which was more similar to The Beatles song " Strawberry Fields Forever " , containing similar psychedelic imagery and a layered arrangement . 
 = = = 1983 – 1986 : Decline and breakup = = = 
 In 1983 , their single " Wings of a Dove " peaked at number 2 in the UK charts , followed by " The Sun & The Rain " ( no . 5 , November 1983 ) . Their following album , Keep Moving , peaked at number 6 in the UK album charts , and two singles from that album reached the top 20 in the UK music charts . The album received some good reviews , with Rolling Stone magazine giving the album four out of five stars , applauding the band 's changing sound . This was an improvement as the last album reviewed by the magazine , Absolutely , was heavily criticised . 
 On 5 October 1983 the band were rehearsing and discussing a possible television series , which was being written for them by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis . Barson then informed the band that he would not be able to take part , as he was tired of the music business and wanted to spend more time with his wife . They had recently relocated to Amsterdam . Barson agreed to finish recording the album Keep Moving ; he left after playing for the last time with the band at the Lyceum Ballroom on 21 December 1983 . After leaving the band James Mackie took Barson 's place appearing with Madness on the US hit television show Saturday Night Live on 14 April 1984 . After leaving the band , Barson returned to the UK for the filming of two music videos as he had played on the tracks , " Michael Caine " and " One Better Day " . He officially left the band in June 1984 , following the release of " One Better Day " , however finished live performance with the band in 1983 , Paul Carrack took Barson 's place whilst the band toured America in early 1984 . The six remaining members left Stiff Records and formed their own label , <unk> Records , which was a sub @-@ label of Virgin Records . In 1985 , the label released the band 's sixth album , Mad Not Mad . Barson 's keyboard parts were filled by synthesisers and Steve Nieve joined the band to take his place . In later years , frontman Suggs described the album as a " polished turd " . The album reached number 16 in the UK charts , which was the band 's lowest position on the album charts to date . Despite the poor chart showing , the album was listed as number 55 in NME 's All Time 100 Albums . The singles for the album fared even worse , with " Yesterday 's Men " peaking at number 18 in the UK charts . The subsequent singles , " Uncle Sam " and " Sweetest Girl " , failed to make the top 20 , which was a first for Madness singles . 
 Madness were not only running their own label at the time , but also had their own recording studio , Liquidator Studios . The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London , in what was once the premises of their fan club office . They built a 24 @-@ track professional studio in the cellar . The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area , while a room upstairs is used for song mixing . The band have recorded a number of demos and b @-@ sides at Liquidator , as well as The Madness album in 1988 . Other acts to use the studio include <unk> Sharkey , The Farm , Apollo 440 , The Potato 5 , The Nutty Boys , The <unk> and The Butterfield 8 . The studio is still regularly used by musicians , including members of Madness themselves . 
 The band then attempted to record a new album , and 11 demo tracks were recorded . However , " musical differences " arose between band members , and in September 1986 , the band announced that they were to split . Barson rejoined the band for a farewell single , " ( Waiting For ) The Ghost Train " , but did not appear in the music video . The band officially split following the release of the single , which reached a high of number 18 in the UK . In 1988 , four members of the band – Suggs , Chas Smash , Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman – continued under the name The Madness . After one self @-@ titled album and two singles that failed to make the top 40 , the band split . 
 = = = 1992 – 2003 : Reunion and Our House musical = = = 
 Towards the end of 1991 , " It Must Be Love " was re @-@ released and eventually reached number 6 in the UK singles chart in February 1992 . Following that , the singles compilation Divine Madness was released and peaked at number 1 in the album charts . Madness then announced plans for a reunion concert , Madstock ! , which was held at Finsbury Park , London on 8 and 9 August of that year . The original line @-@ up reunited , performing together for the first time since Barson left the band in 1984 . Over 75 @,@ 000 fans attended the weekend festival , and the dancing of the crowd caused some nearby tower blocks to shake perceptibly as they resonated with the frequency of the music . 
 After the Finsbury Park comeback , a live album was released , and the associated single , " The Harder They Come " ( a cover of Jimmy Cliff 's 1973 song ) reached number 44 in the UK , with the album reaching number 22 . 
 The band continued to reunite for annual UK Christmas season tours and held three more Madstock ! festivals ; in 1994 , 1996 and 1998 . Also in 1998 , Madness returned to America for their first tour there since 1984 . The live album Universal Madness was recorded at the Universal Amphitheatre in L.A. and released the following year . In 1999 , Madness released their first studio album since 1986 , entitled Wonderful . The album reached number 17 in the UK album charts , and the lead single , " <unk> " , gave the band their first new top 10 hit in the UK since 1983 . Neither of the two subsequent singles from the album , " Johnny The Horse " and " Drip Fed Fred " , entered the top 40 of the UK charts . 
 From 28 October 2002 to 16 August 2003 , a musical based on Madness songs , Our House , ran at the Cambridge Theatre in London . Madness played a role in the executive production of the show , and Suggs played a role in the production for a period , playing the central character 's father . It won an Olivier Award for best new musical of 2003 , and the performance was released on DVD on 1 November 2004 . There was also a previous musical based on Madness songs , One Step Beyond ! , written by Alan Gilbey . The musical had a brief run at the Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1993 and a run at Putney Arts Theatre , London in 2012 . 
 = = = 2004 – 2010 : The Dangermen and The Liberty of Norton Folgate = = = 
 In 2004 , the band played a series of low @-@ key concerts as The Dangermen , performing covers of classic reggae and ska songs . A lot of the songs were those played by the band when they were first forming , and the band performed the songs as a celebration of their 25th anniversary . 
 This led to the release of the album The Dangermen Sessions Vol . 1 on V2 Records in August 2005 . During the sessions which produced the album , in mid @-@ 2005 , guitarist Chris Foreman announced his departure , citing " the petty , time consuming bollocks that goes on in the band " as his reason for leaving . The band completed the album without him , and on release , it peaked at no . 11 in the UK album charts , which was the band 's highest studio album chart position in 21 years . Although two singles were released , neither was a major success in the UK . The more successful of the two , " Shame & Scandal " , reached number 38 , but was more successful in France where it peaked at number 12 . " Girl Why Don 't You ? " did not chart and the band left the V2 record label shortly after . At this time , Kevin Burdette joined as the band 's guitarist for live appearances and also appeared in the videos for both " Sorry " and " NW5 " in early 2007 . 
 The six remaining original members of Madness began working on their first original album in seven years . 
 In March 2007 , the non @-@ LP single " Sorry " was released on the band 's own record label Lucky 7 Records , peaking in the UK charts at number 23 . The single included a version featuring UK hip hop artists Sway <unk> and Baby Blue . 
 The new Madness song " NW5 " ( then still titled " NW5 ( I Would Give You Everything ) " ) and a re @-@ recorded version of " It Must Be Love " were featured in the German film Neues vom <unk> in . The two songs were released in Germany as a double A @-@ Side , and both of them were turned into music , which – besides members of the film 's cast – featured Suggs , Chas Smash , Woody and stand @-@ in guitarist Burdette . A re @-@ recorded version of " NW5 " was released as a single on 14 January 2008 in the UK reaching no . 24 – this recording featured original Madness guitarist Chris Foreman , who had rejoined the band in time for the 2006 Christmas tour , but had not participated in the original recording of the song . 
 In June 2008 , Madness played the majority of their new album The Liberty of Norton Folgate at London 's Hackney Empire for three nights . The Hackney Empire performances were recorded and sold to fans as they left the show on USB wristbands . Madness played two dates in December 2008 , firstly in Manchester on 18 December , and secondly a return gig to The O2 in London on the 19th . 
 In December 2008 the band also announced that for their 30th anniversary in 2009 , they would be staging a fifth Madstock festival in London 's Victoria Park on 17 July 11 years after the last Madstock concert . It was originally rumoured that the newly reformed The Specials would make an appearance after finishing their reunion tour . However , this did not occur , although original Specials keyboardist Jerry Dammers – who was not part of the reunion line @-@ up – was announced as a support act with The Spatial AKA Orchestra shortly before the festival . Dammers would support Madness again during their 2009 Christmas tour , when he opened each night with a DJ set . 
 Through late March and early April 2009 the band played a series of festival and separate headlining dates across Australia . The lead @-@ up single from their latest album , entitled " Dust Devil " , was released on 11 May on Lucky 7 Records . Alfie Allen and Jaime Winstone co @-@ starred in the music video . The single charted at No. 64 on the UK singles charts and at No. 1 on the UK Independent charts on 17 May 2009 . 
 The new album , entitled The Liberty of Norton Folgate , was released a week later , on 18 May 2009 . It charted at No. 5 in the UK album charts . The band continued to play various festivals , including Pinkpop , Splendour , and Glastonbury . On 27 September 2009 , the band also played a free concert on a closed @-@ off Regent Street in association with Absolute Radio . 
 On Friday 28 August , Madness played the Rock en Seine festival near Paris , on the same night where Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher engaged in a physical altercation , resulting in the split of the band . As Oasis cancelled their headlining slot , Madness , even though having played earlier in the evening , were asked to replace them . They accepted the invitation and both of their sets during the festival were said to have been well received . 
 As in previous years , the band embarked on a Christmas tour of the UK ( also playing one concert in Dublin ) , playing at various medium @-@ sized venues . Mark Bedford took a break from the band and was replaced by Graham Bush for the tour . 
 Some members of the band appeared in Catherine Tate 's Nan 's Christmas Carol . They first posed as carol singers , then played " Baggy Trousers " over the credits . On 18 January 2010 , Madness released a fourth single , " Forever Young " , from The Liberty of Norton Folgate . The single failed to chart . 
 During an interview with RTÉ 2fm radio host Dave Fanning on 24 May 2010 , drummer Daniel Woodgate stated that the members of the band were in the final stages of preparing songs for the follow @-@ up to The Liberty of Norton Folgate . The band hope to be able to start recording the album later on in 2010 . 
 In September 2010 , Madness were awarded the Idol Award at the Q Awards in London . Guitarist Chris Foreman stated in his acceptance speech that Madness were recording a new album . 
 Madness toured the UK throughout November and December 2010 with their final show at London 's Earl 's Court , where they played a new song from their upcoming album . However , two concerts , in Hull and Sheffield , were cancelled due to a heavy snowfall , although they were later rescheduled for 5 and 6 February 2011 respectively . 
 = = = 2011 – 2015 : Oui Oui Si Si Ja Ja Da Da = = = 
 In June 2011 , the band performed at Meltdown Festival at the Royal Festival Hall , curated by inspiration Ray Davies , who also introduced the band on stage . The concert served as the premiere of three new songs – " 1978 " , " Can 't Keep a Good Thing Down " and " Death of a Rude Boy " . 
 The summer of 2012 saw two notable performances . In June , the band performed at the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace . The band performed " Our House " and " It Must Be Love " from the roof of the palace with accompanying animations projected onto the palace front . In August , the band was the first to perform at the closing ceremony of the London Olympic Games . Departed bass player Mark ' <unk> ' Bedford rejoined the band for both performances . In August 2012 , Madness released " Death of a Rude Boy " as a free teaser track from their new album . Madness ' 10th studio album Oui Oui Si Si Ja Ja Da Da was released on 29 October 2012 and entered the UK album charts at <unk> In January 2013 the album re @-@ entered the chart at no . 16 on the back of the airplay success of the single " Never Knew Your Name " . 
 From the start of 2013 Mark Bedford increased his performances with the band building to his full @-@ time return to the group , which meant a close to the four years Graham ' <unk> ' Bush had spent with the band . 
 On 22 March 2013 the band performed outside the BBC Television Centre in a live broadcast for BBC Four . This was followed by Goodbye Television Centre , a celebration of 50 years of the television centre , marking the closure of the grade II listed building and the last show to be broadcast from it . Following that the band was the closing act to the new year celebration of 2014 in Dublin , Ireland . 
 On 22 March 2014 Suggs confirmed to music @-@ <unk> that Madness were writing a new album which he stated " the band plan to record in the summer and release by the end of 2014 " . 
 In October 2014 , Cathal Smyth , aka Chas Smash , took a break from Madness to pursue a solo career . His solo album , A Comfortable Man , was released on 11 May 2015 . Madness is continuing with just six members . 
 In February 2015 the band announced the Grandslam tour , taking in 20 outdoor venues .

 The Madness was a line @-@ up of Madness without Mark Bedford , Daniel Woodgate and Mike Barson , active between 1988 and 1989 . Formed by Suggs , Chas Smash , Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman in 1988 , they distinguished this line @-@ up from the previous Madness line @-@ up only by adding the word " The " to the band 's name . The Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and many on @-@ line discographies consider this band to be the same as " Madness " . Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman also alluded to this view on their album Crunch ! , which was dedicated to " the good ship Madness and all who sailed in her ( 1979 to 1989 ) " .

 The Nutty Boys were Lee Thompson and Chris Foreman of Madness . The name " The Nutty Boys " was actually the name of their album , while the new band was called " Crunch ! " . The posters for their first concert mistakenly listed the band as " The Nutty Boys " instead of " Crunch ! " , and the name accidentally stuck . While the members of the band Madness were nicknamed " The Nutty Boys " as a whole , this section lists only the work released by Thompson and Foreman under " The Nutty Boys " name in the early 1990s .

 Madness collaborated with Elvis Costello in 1983 on a version of their song " Tomorrow 's ( Just Another Day ) " . It was released as a bonus track to the 12 " copy of the single . In later years , Barson stated that Costello 's " Watching the Detectives " was the main influence on the song " My Girl " . For Wonderful in 1999 , Ian Dury laid down vocals on the track " Drip Fed Fred " which was released as the last single from the album . It was to be Dury 's last recording before his death . Ill health prevented Dury from actively promoting the single , although he did appear on the National Lottery Show , but for a later performance on TFI Friday , the song was reworked to incorporate Phill Jupitus on vocals . Live , Madness have collaborated with artists such as UB40 and Prince Buster , notably at their first Madstock concert . They have also played live frequently with members of the other 2 Tone bands , such as The Specials . In May 2008 , Suggs and Carl performed live with Pet Shop Boys at London 's Heaven collaborating on a new composition of " My Girl " . A few days afterwards , Pet Shop Boys posted their own version of the track on their official website . 
 In late 2010 , the band collaborated in the Cage Against The Machine project , in which numerous artists performed John Cage 's 4 ′ 33 ″ for a charity single intended to prevent the winner of The X Factor claiming the Christmas Number 1 . The title refers to the previous year 's successful campaign to get Rage Against the Machine 's " Killing in the Name " to chart above X Factor winner Joe McElderry . 
 = = Lyrical themes = = 
 Frequent themes in Madness ' songs included childhood memories ( e.g. , " Baggy Trousers " , and " Our House " ) and petty crime ( e.g. , " Shut Up " , and " <unk> the Eye " ) . Although Madness were seen by some as somewhat of a humorous band with catchy , bouncy songs , many of their songs took a darker tone ( such as the singles " Grey Day " and " Tomorrow 's ( Just Another Day ) " ) and they sometimes tackled what were , at the time , controversial issues in their lyrics . " Embarrassment " ( from the Absolutely album ) was written by Lee Thompson , and reflected the unfolding turmoil following the news that his teenage sister had become pregnant and was carrying a black man 's child . Madness discussed animal testing in the song " Tomorrow 's Dream " . The band criticised the National Health Service in " Mrs. Hutchinson " , which told the story of a woman who , after several misdiagnoses and mistreatment , became terminally ill . The story was based on the experiences of Mike Barson 's mother . Madness ' final single prior to disbanding , " ( Waiting For ) The Ghost Train " , commented on apartheid in South Africa . 
 = = Skinhead controversy = = 
 Early in their career , Madness were linked to skinheads ; members of a British working @-@ class subculture that the media often stereotyped as racist ( although many skinheads , including the original generation , are non @-@ racist or anti @-@ racist ) . Not only was Madness , along with other 2 Tone bands , popular with skinheads , but it was said that the band members themselves were associated with the subculture . 
 The band 's relationship with the skinheads varied at times . Barson was particularly displeased with the band 's skinhead association , often finding it disappointing that so many were present at performances . Prior to becoming a full member of the band , Chas Smash had been involved in fights with skinheads at performances . In one particular incident on 18 November 1979 , Madness were supported by Red Beans and Rice , who featured a black lead singer , and the band was prevented from completing the performance due to the racist chants from certain members of the skinhead filled audience . Suggs later came on stage to show his displeasure at their behaviour , but this did not stop much of the audience from Nazi saluting at the end of the show . 
 = = Awards = = 
 The band 's first notable musical award came in 1983 when Chris Foreman and Cathal Smyth won an Ivor Novello Award for Best Song for the international hit " Our House " . Madness received another Ivor Novello Award 17 years later for an " Outstanding Song Collection " . In 2005 , they were awarded the MOJO " Hall of Fame " Award , notably for being " an artist 's artist " . In 2007 , a campaign took place by fans of Madness for the band to be awarded a Brit Award . Many fans and critics feel they have been overlooked over their past 30 years in the music industry . In July 2009 , Madness were awarded the ' Silver Clef ' Icon Award . In September 2010 , Madness were awarded the ' Idol Award ' at the 2010 Q Awards in London .

 = Murano ( skyscraper ) = 
 The Murano is a residential skyscraper in Center City , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States . Part of a condominium boom occurring in the city , the Murano was announced in 2005 and was developed jointly by Thomas Properties Group and P & A Associates . The building , named after Murano , Italy , was completed in 2008 at a cost of US $ 165 million . The site , previously occupied by a parking lot , was the location of the Erlanger Theatre from 1927 to 1978 . 
 The blue glass and concrete , 43 @-@ story , 475 feet ( 145 m ) skyscraper was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Associates . Murano 's condos range between 740 square feet ( 69 m2 ) and 2 @,@ 625 square feet ( 240 m2 ) and were designed to be loft @-@ like with each featuring a balcony . The building features ground level retail space and an adjacent parking garage . Located in the West Market Street neighborhood of Center City , a neighborhood that first saw residential development in 2002 , the building struggled to fill its units during the late @-@ 2000s recession . In July 2009 the Murano 's owners held a successful auction on forty of the building 's units . Thomas Properties Group lowered the price for the remaining unsold units based on what the forty units went for at the auction . 
 = = History = = 
 The Murano was announced in 2005 when Philadelphia , Pennsylvania was experiencing a condominium boom that had begun in the late 1990s ; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments . The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P & A Associates of Philadelphia . The planned site of the Murano was on West Market Street in Center City , an area which had not had any residential development until 2002 when 2121 Market Street was converted into apartments . Construction began around the end of 2005 . 
 Built by construction firm Turner Construction Company , the US $ 165 million Murano was completed in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18 . The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold . As of December 31 , 2008 , sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale . In 2008 and 2009 the late @-@ 2000s recession hurt the condominium market , with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high @-@ end condo sales declining 24 percent . Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood , with potential buyers unwilling to take a chance on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession . In 2009 , Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs . On June 27 , Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower . The 40 units went for between US $ 335 @,@ 000 and US $ 796 @,@ 000 , priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction . Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction .

 Located at 21st and Market Streets , the 43 @-@ story , 475 feet ( 145 m ) Murano is named after Murano , Italy , a town famous for its glass . Designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz and Associates , the Murano has 302 condos that include one to three bedroom condos that range from 740 square feet ( 69 m2 ) to 2 @,@ 625 square feet ( 240 m2 ) . Also included are penthouses that range from 1 @,@ 660 square feet ( 150 m2 ) to 2 @,@ 625 square feet ( 240 m2 ) . The condominiums are designed to be loft @-@ like and each feature a balcony . The curved facade features floor @-@ to @-@ ceiling blue windows separated at intervals by bands of white concrete . The Murano contains 570 @,@ 000 square feet ( 53 @,@ 000 m2 ) including 9 @,@ 000 square feet ( 840 m2 ) of ground floor retail space . 
 Adjacent to the building on 21st Street is a parking garage . The developers planned to put ground level retail in the parking garage but say they were dissuaded by residents who feared the shops would attract the homeless . 
 Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron praised how the concrete bands break up the glass and " serve as a bridge , linking the Murano visually to its older neighbors " . However , she criticized how the building doesn 't connect physically to its neighbors , such as lack of access to John F. Kennedy Boulevard and lack of shops on the ground floor of the parking garage . Saffron believed shops in the parking garage would have helped create a connection between West Market Street and the Logan Square neighborhood . 
 = Backmasking = 
 Backmasking is a recording technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward . Backmasking is a deliberate process , whereas a message found through phonetic reversal may be unintentional . 
 Backmasking was popularised by the Beatles , who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album Revolver . Artists have since used backmasking for artistic , comedic and satiric effect , on both analogue and digital recordings . The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for " clean " releases of explicit songs . 
 Backmasking has been a controversial topic in the United States since the 1970s and 1980s , when allegations from Christian groups of its use for Satanic purposes were made against prominent rock musicians , leading to record @-@ burning protests and proposed anti @-@ backmasking legislation by state and federal governments .

 In 1877 , Thomas Edison invented the phonograph , a device allowing sound to be recorded and reproduced on a rotating cylinder with a stylus ( or " needle " ) attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn . Emile Berliner invented the familiar lateral @-@ cut disc phonograph record in 1888 . His design overtook the Edison phonograph in the 1920s , partly because Berliner 's patent expired in 1918 , leaving others free to use his invention . 
 In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording , one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards . In 1878 , Edison noted that , when played backwards , " the song is still melodious in many cases , and some of the strains are sweet and novel , but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way " . The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist Aleister Crowley , who suggested in his 1913 book Magick ( Book 4 ) that an adept " train himself to think backwards by external means " , one of which was to " listen to phonograph records , reversed " . In the movie Gold Diggers of 1935 , the end of the dancing pianos musical number " The Words Are in My Heart " is filmed in reverse motion with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed . 
 The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology : the development of musique concrète , an avant @-@ garde form of electronic music , which involves editing together fragments of natural and industrial sounds ; and the concurrent spread of the use of tape recorders in recording studios . These two trends led to tape music compositions , composed on tape using techniques including reverse tape effects . 
 The Beatles , who incorporated the techniques of concrète into their recordings , were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking . Singer John Lennon and producer George Martin both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966 's Revolver ; specifically the album tracks " Tomorrow Never Knows " and " I 'm Only Sleeping " , and the single " Rain " . Lennon stated that , while under the influence of marijuana , he accidentally played the tapes for " Rain " in reverse and enjoyed the sound . The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles , and the effect was used first in the guitar solo for " Tomorrow Never Knows " and later in the coda of " Rain " . According to Martin , the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the " Tomorrow Never Knows " tapes , and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon 's vocals and guitar , which he did with a clip from " Rain " . Lennon then liked the effect and kept it . Regardless , " Rain " was the first song to feature a backmasked message : " Sunshine … Rain … When the rain comes , they run and hide their heads " ( listen ; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song ) . 
 = = = Sayings = = = 
 The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a controversy . The latter has its roots in an event in 1969 , when WKNR @-@ FM DJ Russ Gibb received a phone call from a student at Eastern Michigan University who identified himself as " Tom " . The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle Paul McCartney had died , and claimed that the Beatles song " Revolution 9 " contained a backward message confirming the rumor . Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable , and heard " Turn me on , dead man … turn me on , dead man … turn me on , dead man … " . Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called " The Great Cover @-@ up " , and to the original clue were added various others , including the alleged backmasked message " Paul is a dead man , miss him , miss him , miss him " , in " I 'm So Tired " . The " Paul is dead " rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in popular music . 
 After Gibb 's show , many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed . Initially , the search was done mostly by fans of rock music ; but , in the late 1970s , during the rise of the Christian right in the United States , fundamentalist Christian groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the conscious mind and reach the subconscious , where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener . In 1981 , Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that Led Zeppelin 's " Stairway to Heaven " contained hidden messages that were heard by the subconscious . In early 1982 , the Trinity Broadcasting Network 's Paul Crouch hosted a show with self @-@ described neuroscientist William <unk> , who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the Church of Satan to place hidden subliminal messages on records . Also in 1982 , fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking , along with at least one mass record @-@ smashing . During the same year , thirty North Carolina teenagers , led by their pastor , claimed that singers had been possessed by Satan , who used their voices to create backward messages , and held a record @-@ burning at their church . 
 Allegations of demonic backmasking were also made by social psychologists , parents and critics of rock music , as well as the Parents Music Resource Center ( formed in 1985 ) , which accused Led Zeppelin of using backmasking to promote Satanism . 
 = = = Legislation = = = 
 One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections . A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of Arkansas and California . The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that " can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the Antichrist " . Involved in the discussion on the bill was a California State Assembly Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing , during which " Stairway to Heaven " was played backwards , and William <unk> testified . The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued . The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983 , referenced albums by The Beatles , Pink Floyd , Electric Light Orchestra , Queen and Styx , and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker : " Warning : This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward . " However , the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor Bill Clinton and defeated . House Resolution <unk> , introduced in 1982 by Representative Bob Dornan ( R @-@ California ) , proposed mandating a similar label ; the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce , Transportation and Tourism and was never passed . Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada . 
 With the advent of compact discs in the 1980s , but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for personal computers in the 1990s , it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards , and the controversy died down . 
 = = = Resurgence = = = 
 Though the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s , the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade , with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s . At the same time , the development of sound editing software with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio , which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder . The Sound Recorder utility , included with Microsoft Windows from Windows 95 to Windows XP , allows one @-@ click audio reversal , as does popular open source sound editing software Audacity . Following the growth of the Internet , backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples , which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music . 
 In January 2014 , the first backmasked video was released as part of a Grammy Awards promotional campaign . A customized video player allowed the user to watch a piece of film accompanied by a music soundtrack both forwards and backwards . The backwards content contained a hidden visual story and the words ' music unleashes you ' embedded into the reversed audio track . 
 = = Use = = 
 Backmasking has been used as a recording technique since the 1960s . In the era of magnetic tape sound recording , backmasking required that the source reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape actually be played backwards , which was achieved by first being wound onto the original <unk> reel , then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source ( this would reverse the stereo channels as well ) . Digital audio recording has greatly simplified the process . 
 <unk> words are unintelligible noise when played forward , but when played backwards are clear speech . Listening to backmasked audio with most turntables requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse ( though some can play records backwards ) . With magnetic tape , the tape must be reversed and spliced back in to the cassette . Compact discs were difficult to reverse when first introduced , but digital audio editors , which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade , allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources . 
 = = = Satanic backmasking = = = 
 In the 1973 film The Exorcist , a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards . This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects . Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs , whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism , backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery . Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons . For example , thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band 's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting " Join Us " over and over . ( listen ) . However , Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band 's use of Satanic imagery was " solely for effect " . Cradle of Filth , another band that has employed Satanic imagery , released a song entitled " Dinner at Deviant 's Palace " , consisting almost entirely of unusual sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord 's Prayer ( a backwards reading of the Lord 's Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass ) . Seattle @-@ based grunge band Soundgarden parodied the phenomenon of Satanic backmasking on their 1989 album Ultramega OK . When played backwards , the songs " 665 " and " 667 " reveal a song about Santa Claus . Marilyn Manson used this technique . For example , in the beginning of his song " Tourniquet " when played backwards , his voice is heard saying " This is my lowest point of vulnerability " as explained in his book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell . 
 = = = Aesthetic use = = = 
 Backmasking is often used for aesthetics , i.e. , to enhance the meaning or sound of a track . During the Judas Priest subliminal message trial , lead singer Rob Halford admitted to recording the words " In the dead of the night , love bites " backwards into the track " Love Bites " , from the 1984 album Defenders of the Faith . Asked why he recorded the message , Halford stated that " When you 're composing songs , you 're always looking for new ideas , new sounds . " Stanley Kubrick used " Masked Ball " , an adaptation by Jocelyn Pook of her earlier work " Backwards Priests " ( from the album Flood ) featuring reversed Romanian chanting , as the background music for the masquerade ball scene in Eyes Wide Shut . At the end of " Before I Forget " by Slipknot , lead singer Corey Taylor 's voice can be heard saying " ... You 're wasting it " which is in reference to how Rick Rubin , the producer of their album Vol . 3 : The Subliminal Verses , wanted Taylor to change the chorus vocal melody because he felt it wasn 't catchy ; however , Taylor stood his ground and the chorus stayed unchanged . 
 One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song . Missy Elliott used this technique in one of her songs , " Work It " , as did Jay Chou ( " You Can Hear " , from Ye Hui Mei ) , At the Drive @-@ In ( " 300 MHz " , from Vaya ) , and Lacuna Coil ( " Self Deception " , from <unk> ) . A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track . John Lennon originally wanted to do so with " Rain " , but objections by producer George Martin and bandmate Paul McCartney cut the backward section to 30 seconds . The Stone Roses have made heavy use of this technique in songs including " Don 't Stop " , " Guernica " , and " Simone " , which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks , sometimes overdubbed with new vocals that sound somewhat similar to the initial track when backmasked . Meanwhile , Klaatu used the reversed vocals from " Anus of Uranus " ( from their first album , 3 : 47 EST ) as the vocals for the song " Silly Boys " ( on their third album , Sir Army Suit ) . The lyrics for " Silly Boys " on the lyric sheet from Sir Army Suit are accordingly printed backwards . Danish band Mew 's 2009 album No More Stories ... contains a track , " New Terrain " , which , when listened to in reverse , reveals a new song , entitled " Nervous " . 
 Artists often use backmasking of sounds or instrumental audio to produce interesting sound effects . One such sound effect is the reverse echo . When done on tape , such use of backmasking is known as reverse tape effects . One example is Matthew Sweet 's 1999 album In Reverse , which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse . For live concerts , the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator . 
 = = = Humorous and parody messages = = = 
 A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song . The B @-@ side of the 1966 Napoleon XIV single " They 're Coming to Take Me Away , Ha @-@ <unk> ! " is a reversed version of the entire forwards record , entitled " ! <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> er <unk> " . It reached # 3 in the US charts and # 4 in the UK . 
 WWE wrestler Al Snow had a theme song that had backmasking in it . The song was mostly instrumental , but at one point a clearly audible voice can be heard saying a line of gibberish . When the song is played backward , the gibberish is actually saying " I AM IN <unk> " . The message played on Al Snow 's character as an unstable mad man . 
 The Beatles song " Free as a Bird " was originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon . In 1995 a studio version of the recording , incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney , George Harrison and Ringo Starr , was released as a new single from The Beatles Anthology 1 project , 25 years after their break @-@ up and 15 years after the death of Lennon . In a humorous self @-@ parody and tribute to Lennon , the surviving Beatles inserted a backmasked clip of Lennon saying " Turned out nice again . " at the very end of the song . 
 Pink Floyd dropped a backmasked message into " Empty Spaces " : 
 ... Congratulations . You have just discovered the secret message . Please send your answer to Old Pink , care of the Funny Farm , Chalfont ... 
 Roger ! Carolyne 's on the phone ! 
 Okay . 
 The first line may refer to former lead singer Syd Barrett , who is thought to have suffered a nervous breakdown years earlier . The first known instance of Pink Floyd having a backwards message is on the song " Bike " . When played backward , it produces a nonsense poem . 
 In " Weird Al " Yankovic 's " Nature Trail to Hell " , from 1984 's " Weird Al " Yankovic in 3 @-@ D , Yankovic 's backmasked voice declares that " Satan eats Cheez Whiz " ( listen ) . Another early example can be found on the J. Geils Band track " No <unk> , Please " , from 1980s album Love <unk> . The message , disguised as a foreign @-@ sounding language spoken under the narration , is , " It doesn 't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad . " Belgian act <unk> Noire included a satirical backmasked message on their 1988 album Tetra saying " You fucking asshole , play the record in the normal way " . Tenacious D includes the backmasked message " Eat Donkey Crap " at the end of " Karate " from their self @-@ titled first album . 
 Electric Light Orchestra and Styx , following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy , released songs that parody the allegations made against them . ELO , after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album Eldorado , included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album , 1975 's Face The Music . " Down Home Town " begins with a voice twice repeating ( in reverse ) " Face the mighty waterfall " . And the opening instrumental " Fire On High " contains the backmasked message " The music is reversible , but time is not . Turn back ! Turn back ! Turn back ! Turn back ! " ( listen ) . In 1983 ELO released an entire album , Secret Messages , in response to the controversy . Among the many backmasked messages on the album are : " Welcome to the big show " ( 2x ) ; " Thank you for listening " ; " Look out there 's danger ahead " ; " Hup two three four " ; " Time After Time " ; and " You 're playing me backwards " . Styx also released an album in response to allegations of Satanic backmasking : 1983 's Kilroy Was Here , which deals with an allegorical group called the " Majority for Musical Morality " that outlaws rock music . A sticker on the album cover contains the message , " By order of the Majority for Musical Morality , this album contains secret backward messages " , and the song " Heavy Metal Poisoning " does in fact contain the backmasked Latin words " <unk> <unk> , Novus ordo <unk> " ( " [ God ] has favored our undertakings ; a new order for the ages " ) — part of the Great Seal which encircles the pyramid on the back of the American dollar bill . 
 Iron Maiden 's 1983 album Piece of Mind features a short backwards message , included by the band in response to allegations of Satanism that were surrounding them at the time . Between the songs " The Trooper " and " Still Life " is inebriated drummer Nicko McBrain doing an impression of Idi Amin Dada : " ' What ho ' , sed de t 'ing wid de t 'ree bonce [ said the thing with the three heads ] . Don 't meddle wid t <unk> you don 't understand , " followed by a belch . Prince 's controversial song " Darling Nikki " includes the backmasked message , " Hello , how are you ? I am fine , because I know that the Lord is coming soon . " The Waitresses ' 1982 EP I Could Rule the World if I Could Only Get the Parts included a backwards masking warning on the cover and a message masked within the song " The Smartest Person I Know " : " Anyone who believes in backwards masking is a fool . " 
 Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards . One such message was included by " Weird Al " Yankovic in " I Remember Larry " , from the 1996 album Bad Hair Day , on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark , " Wow , [ you ] must have an awful lot of free time on your hands " ( listen ) . Similarly , the B @-@ 52 's song " Detour Through your Mind " , from the 1986 LP Bouncing off the Satellites , contains the message , " I buried my parakeet in the backyard . Oh no , you 're playing the record backwards . Watch out , you might ruin your needle . " A similar message comes from the Canadian band Frozen Ghost from their 1987 self @-@ titled debut album : " You are ruining your needle ! " 
 Meanwhile , Christian rock group Petra included in their song " Judas Kiss " , from the 1982 album More Power to Ya , the message , " What are you looking for the devil for , when you ought to be looking for the Lord ? " Bloodhound Gang 's 1996 controversy @-@ begging track " Lift Your Head Up High ( And Blow Your Brains Out ) " mocked the Judas Priest controversy directly , and included the backmasked phrase " Devil child , wake up and eat Chef Boyardee <unk> " . The band Mindless Self Indulgence released a song titled " <unk> ! " , which contains the forward lyrics " Play that record backwards / Here 's a message yo for the <unk> / Play that record backwards / And go fuck yourself " . The backwards messages in the song include , " clean your room " , " do your homework " , " don 't stay out too late " , and " eat your vegetables " . 
 Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series The Simpsons entitled " New Kids on the <unk> . " Bart Simpson joins a boy band called the Party Posse , whose song " Drop Da Bomb " includes the repeated lyric " Yvan <unk> <unk> . " Lisa Simpson becomes suspicious and plays the song backward , revealing the backmasked message " Join the Navy " , which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal recruiting tool for the United States Navy . 
 = = = Critical or explicit messages = = = 
 Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards . Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track " Hot Poop " , from We 're Only in It for the Money ( 1968 ) . The released version contains at the end of its side " A " the backmasked message " Better look around before you say you don 't care . / Shut your fucking mouth ' bout the length of my hair . / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person ? " This profanity @-@ laced verse , originally from the song " Mother People " , was censored by Verve Records , so Zappa edited the verse out , reversed it , and inserted it elsewhere in the album as " Hot Poop " ( though even in the backward message the word " fucking " is censored ) . On the same album , a modified backmasking can be heard in " Harry , You 're a Beast " with Madge saying , " Don 't come in me , in me " repeatedly before she starts crying . In at least one bootleg version of the album , these words are very clear . 
 Another example is found in Roger Waters ' 1991 album Amused to Death , on which Waters recorded a backward message , possibly critical of film director Stanley Kubrick , who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from 2001 : A Space Odyssey . The message appears in the song " Perfect Sense Part 1 " , in which Waters ' backmasked voice says , " Julia , however , in light and visions of the issues of Stanley , we have changed our minds . We have decided to include a backward message , Stanley , for you and all the other book burners . " 
 = = = Censorship = = = 
 A further use of backmasking is to censor words and phrases deemed inappropriate on radio edits and " clean " album releases . For example , The Fugees ' clean version of the album The Score contains various backmasked profanities ; thus , when playing the album backwards , the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish . When used with the word " shit " , this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to " ish " . As a result , " ish " became a euphemism for " shit " . 
 In Britney Spears ' 2011 song " Till The World Ends " , Spears says " if you want this good shit " . However , on the official version , " shit " is reversed , creating the " ish " sound ; therefore , the official version says " if you want this good ish " . Backmasking is also used to censor the word " joint " in the video for " You Don 't Know How It Feels " by Tom Petty , resulting in the line " Let 's roll another <unk> " . 
 = = Accusations = = 
 Artists who have been accused of backmasking include Led Zeppelin , The Beatles , Pink Floyd , Electric Light Orchestra , Queen , Styx , Judas Priest , The Eagles , The Rolling Stones , Jefferson Starship , AC / DC , Black Oak Arkansas , Rush , Britney Spears , and Eminem . 
 Electric Light Orchestra was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album Eldorado . The title track , " Eldorado " , was said to contain the message " He is the nasty one / Christ , you 're infernal / It is said we 're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live . " ELO singer and songwriter Jeff Lynne responded by calling this accusation ( and the related charge of being " devil @-@ worshippers " ) " <unk> " , and stating that the message " is absolutely manufactured by whoever said , ' That 's what it said . ' It doesn 't say anything of the sort . " The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations . 
 In 1981 , Styx was accused of putting the backward message " Satan move through our voices " on the song " Snowblind " , from Paradise Theatre . Guitarist James Young called these charges " rubbish , " and responded , " If we want to make a statement , we 'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $ 400 tape player to understand us . " The vinyl reproduction of Paradise Theater had laser etching on side one , spelling out Styx at the top , and two ladies facing each other on the sides . But on side two , the side with the song ( Snow Blind ) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil , and play the album backwards to hear the backward message . In 1983 , the band released a concept album , Kilroy Was Here , satirizing the Moral Majority . 
 A well @-@ known alleged message is found in rock group Led Zeppelin 's 1971 song " Stairway to Heaven " . The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with " Here 's to my sweet Satan " ( listen ) . Swan Song Records issued a statement to the contrary : " Our turntables only play in one direction — forwards . " Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant denied the accusations in an interview : " To me it 's very sad , because ' Stairway To Heaven ' was written with every best intention , and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end , that 's not my idea of making music . " Another widely known alleged message , " It 's fun to smoke marijuana , " in Queen 's song " Another One Bites the Dust " , is similarly disclaimed by the group 's spokesperson .

 Various fundamentalist Christian groups have declared that Satan — or Satan @-@ influenced musicians — use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior . Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use . Minister Jacob <unk> wrote in his 1982 book Backward Masking Unmasked that rock groups " are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious . " Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that " the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics — being affected through a subliminal message . " Mills has toured America warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in rock music . 
 Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes . The web page for Alabama group Dial @-@ the @-@ Truth Ministries argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in " Stairway to Heaven " , saying that the song contains the backward message , " It 's my sweet Satan ... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan . "

 In 1985 , Dr. Joe Stuessy testified to the United States Congress at the Parents Music Resource Center hearings that : 
 The message [ of a piece of heavy metal music ] may also be covert or subliminal . Sometimes <unk> tracks are mixed in underneath other , louder tracks . These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind . Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward , called backmasking . There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of <unk> . We need more research on that . 
 Stuessy 's written testimony stated that : 
 Some messages are presented to the listener backwards . While listening to a normal forward message ( often somewhat nonsensical ) , one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message ( in other words , the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward , and a different set of words going backwards ) . Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric , the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message .

 Serial killer Richard Ramirez , on trial in 1988 , stated that AC / DC 's music , and specifically the song " Night Prowler " on Highway to Hell , inspired him to commit murder . Reverse speech advocate David John Oates claimed that " Highway to Hell " , on the same album , contains backmasked messages including " I 'm the law " , " my name is Lucifer " , and " she belongs in hell " . AC / DC 's Angus Young responded that " you didn 't need to play [ the album ] backwards , because we never hid [ the messages ] . We 'd call an album Highway To Hell , there it was right in front of them . " 
 In 1990 , British heavy metal band Judas Priest was sued over a suicide pact made by two young men in Nevada . The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album Stained Class contained hidden messages , including the forward subliminal words " Do it " in the song " Better By You , Better Than Me " ( a cover version of a Spooky Tooth song ) , and various backward subliminal messages . The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest 's placement of subliminal messages on the record , and the judge 's ruling stated that " The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli , even if perceived , may precipitate conduct of this magnitude . There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli . " Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music , messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive , and they would prefer to insert the command " Buy more of our records .

 Skeptic Michael Shermer claims that the emergence of the " Paul is dead " phenomenon , including the alleged message at the end of " I 'm So Tired " , was caused by faulty perception of a pattern . Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man 's environment , but that today this ability leads to false positives . Stanford University psychology professor Brian <unk> postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility , and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are " bizarre " and " implausible . " Rumors of backmasking in popular music have been described as auditory pareidolia . James Walker , president of Christian research group Watchman Fellowship , states that " You could take a Christian hymn , and if you played it backwards long enough at different speeds , you could make that hymn say anything you want to " ; Led Zeppelin publicist BP Fallon concurs , saying " Play anything backwards , and you 'll find something . " Eric <unk> of audio reversal website <unk> states that " Mathematically , if you listen long enough , eventually you 'll find a pattern " , while Jeff Milner recounts , " Most people , when I show them the site , say that they 're not able to hear anything , until , of course , I show them the reverse lyrics . " 
 Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental phonetic reversals , in which the spoken or sung phonemes form new combinations of words when listened to backwards . Olcott states that " Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible , and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song . " 
 In 1985 , University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using Psalm 23 from the Bible , Queen 's " Another One Bites the Dust " , and other sound passages made up for the experiment . Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist , it is ineffective . Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards , were unable to judge the types of messages ( Christian , Satanic , or commercial ) , and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases . Vokey concluded that " we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered , backward messages on listeners ' behaviour , either consciously or unconsciously . " Similar results to Vokey and Read 's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982 . A 1988 experiment by T.E. Moore found " no evidence that listeners were influenced , consciously or unconsciously , by the content of the backward messages . " In 1992 , an experiment found that exposure to backward messages did not lead to significant changes in attitude . Psychology professor Mark D. Allen says that " delivering subliminal messages via backward masking is totally and ridiculously impossible " . 
 The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the observer @-@ expectancy effect . The Skeptic 's Dictionary states that " you probably won 't hear [ backmasked ] messages until somebody first points them out to you . Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for . " In 1984 , S. B. Thorne and P. <unk> found that " when vague and unfamiliar stimuli are presented , [ test subjects ] are highly likely to accept suggestions , particularly when the suggestions are presented by someone with prestige and authority . " Vokey and Read concluded from their 1985 experiment that " the apparent presence of backward messages in popular music is a function more of active construction on the part of the perceiver than of the existence of the messages themselves .

 " The Return of Harmony " is the collective name for the first and second episodes of the second season of the Canadian @-@ American animated television series My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic , as well as the twenty @-@ seventh and twenty @-@ eighth episodes of the series overall . Both episodes were directed by Jayson Thiessen and written by M.A. Larson . Part one of the episode aired in the United States on September 17 , 2011 on the Hub Network . Part two aired the following week , on September 24 . The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 0 @.@ 2 and was viewed by over 339 @,@ 000 viewers , making it the highest @-@ rated episode ever broadcast by the Hub at that point . This is also the last My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic episode to be produced by Studio B Productions . 
 The series follows a unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in Ponyville . Twilight becomes close friends with five other ponies : Applejack , Rarity , Fluttershy , Rainbow Dash , and Pinkie Pie . In the first part of the episode , a <unk> named Discord escapes from his stone prison and Twilight and her best friends discover that the Elements of Harmony have been stolen . They must retrieve them in order to save Equestria from eternal chaos , but they have to contend with Discord 's mind games first . In part two , Twilight is determined to find the Elements of Harmony after her best friends are hypnotically brainwashed by Discord and all of Equestria begins to fall into disarray .

 = = = Part one = = = 
 <unk> walks her students through Canterlot 's sculpture garden , where she shows her class a strange statue of a chimera @-@ like creature known as a <unk> , a creature that represents discord and a lack of harmony . The Cutie Mark Crusaders – Sweetie Belle , Apple Bloom , and <unk> – get into a fight over exactly what the statue represents . Soon , the statue begins to mysteriously pulse , though no pony notices at the moment . As the group moves away from the statue , small cracks appear along its surface and an evil chuckle is heard . 
 Later , Twilight and her best friends Applejack , Fluttershy , Pinkie Pie , Rainbow Dash , and Rarity find strange phenomena occurring around Ponyville , such as cotton candy clouds dispensing chocolate milk , ears of corn in their husks instantly turning into popcorn , and Applejack 's apples turning bigger . However , Twilight 's magic is not strong enough to stop it , though they can get some of the phenomena somewhat under control . Soon , Spike coughs up a letter from Celestia , urging Twilight and her best friends to see her in Canterlot . On arrival , Celestia takes them to a grand hall with stained @-@ glass windows , including one heralding the ponies ' defeat of Nightmare Moon , and to the vault where the Elements of Harmony are kept . Celestia tells the ponies that the strange phenomena they have noticed is being caused by an old enemy of hers named Discord , the spirit of chaos and disharmony . Celestia tells of how Discord once ruled Equestria in an eternal state of chaos before she and Luna defeated him by turning him into a stone statue ( the <unk> statue that stood in the sculpture garden ) . But he has recently escaped his prison and Celestia asks Twilight and her best friends to use the Elements of Harmony ( as they did to defeat Nightmare Moon previously ) to defeat Discord . However , as she offers the Elements to them , they are shocked to find that the box that normally holds the Elements is completely empty . 
 Suddenly , an image of Discord on the stained @-@ glass windows comes to life , teasing the ponies and Celestia . Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to where they can be located . Twilight believes Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there . Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game , telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic ( enforcing this rule by making the unicorns ' horns and Pegasi 's wings vanish ) , and that if any of them leave the game , he automatically wins . Despite their handicap , the ponies enter the maze , but they are soon separated by Discord 's magic . He is able to individually test Applejack , Pinkie Pie , Rarity , and Fluttershy against their respected Elements , making them be momentarily hypnotized , lose some of their color , and become a polar opposite of their Element . Twilight encounters each of them after this point , aware of their personality shift , but oblivious to their encounter with Discord . Soon , they find Rainbow Dash , having regained her wings , flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty , but also forfeiting the game by leaving ; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory , warning of an incoming storm of chaos . 
 = = = Part two = = = 
 Twilight confronts Discord , accusing him of cheating since he destroyed the labyrinth before they could get to the end of the game . However , Discord counters this by reminding her that , while he had hinted at where the Elements were , he never said anything about them being in the labyrinth . As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain , Twilight realizes that a line from Discord 's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself . 
 Determined and with renewed hope , Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville , which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner : The day @-@ night cycle is haphazard and buildings float off the ground . Discord continues to taunt Twilight , but she is determined to get back to the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends ' personalities continue to become more warped , losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome . Managing to get them all into the library , Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book , are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements . She forces her best friends to wear the Elements , though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord , the sooner they never have to see each other again ; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present . They go to face Discord , but the Elements fail to activate . The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart , leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color . 
 Twilight sadly returns to the library , preparing to pack and leave Ponyville , when she finds Spike coughing up scroll after scroll . Twilight is surprised to find these to be the friendship report letters that she had previously sent to Celestia , and the memories of her friendships in Ponyville make her regain her color . Inspired by this , she returns to her other four best friends and uses a memory spell to remind them of their friendship , cancelling Discord 's magic and returning them to normal . 
 However , Rainbow Dash is still apart from the group and without her , the Elements will not activate . They find Rainbow Dash protecting a cloud , believing it to be her home of <unk> . They start to give chase , but Rainbow flies away . They quickly use a hot @-@ air balloon , pulled along by Fluttershy , to catch up to Rainbow . At first , it seems that Rainbow has the upper hand , but as soon as Twilight reminds Fluttershy that if she gets away Discord will win , Fluttershy puts on an enormous burst of speed and the ponies eventually catch Rainbow and manage to tie her down long enough for Twilight to cast her memory spell . The ponies share a hug before remembering that Ponyville is still under Discord 's influence . 
 The ponies collect the Elements and re @-@ approach Discord , who casually passes off their threat . However , with all six ponies restored , the Elements activate , firing a rainbow @-@ beam of light that engulfs Discord and Ponyville . In moments , Ponyville has been returned to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone . The ponies ' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot , led by Celestia , who praises their heroism and the power of their friendship and reveals a new stained @-@ glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord . 
 = = Production = = 
 " The Return of Harmony " was directed by James Wootton ( with assistance from supervising director Jayson Thiessen ) and written by M.A. Larson . John de Lancie guest stars in the episode as Discord . According to Thiessen , Lauren Faust had conceived of Discord while watching a series of Star Trek : The Next Generation episodes , using Q ( portrayed by de Lancie ) as a template . When it came time to consider voice actors for the role , the production team had considered using a stand @-@ in for de Lancie , but were surprised to learn that de Lancie himself was available for the role . Upon hearing the news , the team altered some elements of the episode to provide more allusion to his previous role , such as the flash of light when Discord would appear or <unk> de Lancie was later surprised by the large positive responses from the adult fans of the series , leading him to learn more about this fandom and participating as executive director of the documentary about the fandom Bronies : The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little <unk> de Lancie has since re @-@ voiced Discord for later episodes of the series and promotions on The Hub . 
 The episodes were the final to feature Lauren Faust as executive producer . Near the end of the first season , Faust announced that she had left the series , and for the second season , she stepped down as executive producer , to become consulting producer . Her involvement in the second season consisted mainly of story conception and scripts . Despite her decreased participation , she still has high hopes for the staff members , stating that " the gaps I have left are being filled by the same amazing artists , writers , and directors who brought you Season 1 . I 'm certain the show will be as entertaining as ever " . In addition , a new storyboard editor named Jim Miller was hired for the second season and a majority of the animation was " outsourced " to animation company Top Draw . According to Thiessen , this allowed for a greater pre @-@ production process for season two episodes . 
 " The Return of Harmony " was the first episode of the second season . According to Thiessen , the Hub and its parent company Hasbro had " approved the season two before we were done with season one ; they knew they had something good on their hands . " He explained , " they saw [ the success ] of the show early on , which is [ … ] rare because usually a season will be one and aired before a network will renew it because they want to know what the numbers are , but they , I guess , a bit of a risk on their behalf , but I 'm glad they did . " The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie Star Wars Episode IV : A New Hope . According to Thiessen , the joke was an " afterthought " ; originally , there was going to be a more elaborate ending , but due to time constraints , a new finale was created . During the animation stage , one of the directors noted that the scene was " kind of like the ending to A New Hope " and so , the decision was made to create " scene for scene " parody of the original .

 Both parts of the episode received largely positive reviews from critics . Carina Belles from We Got This Covered , in a review of the first part , called the series " plain awesome " , noting that it was " basically Lord of the Rings , only with ponies . " Belles praised the expressing animation , writing that " the already incredible art has also improved , with a wider variety of styles being used . " A review from <unk> of the first part of the episode called the plot " an interesting revisit of the premise of the pilot [ ' Friendship Is Magic ' ] " . Furthermore , the review called John de Lancie 's performance " superb " and praised the animation . Reviews for part two were positive as well . <unk> gave the episode a largely positive review , however , the site did note that the episode " feels a bit rushed , even as a two @-@ parter " and that " Fluttershy 's and Rarity 's restoration sequences in particular feel rushed and inadvertently echo [ the mind wipe sequences from ] Men in Black . " 
 Many reviews praised the series ' pop culture references . Carina Belles applauded the series for making subtle pop culture references , citing Pinkie Pie 's mention of " Chocolate Rain " , a reference to a popular Internet meme . Many reviews and critics positively commented on the episode 's ending , which featured a parody of the closing scenes to the original Star Wars . Cyriaque Lamar from i09 wrote positively of the scene , writing , " Honestly , modern My Little Pony fandom is one of those things I 'm live @-@ and @-@ let @-@ live about , even though it baffles me entirely [ but ] this morning 's episode of the show did a little homage to A New Hope . " i09 later named the scene one of " The Best Television Moments of 2011 " . John Farrier from <unk> wrote , " It ’ s hard for Bronies to get respect from some quarters , but [ the closing Star Wars parody ] scene alone says much in favor of the show . " The entertainment site Dorkly , an affiliate of CollegeHumor , featured a video comparing the two scenes and wrote , " May the adorable be with you . " Topless Robot writer Anne Mathews named the Star Wars parody the " <unk> Easter Egg " in My Little Pony : Friendship Is Magic , writing , " This scene is a direct shoutout to the fans and completely cements the creator Lauren Faust 's geek cred . The only thing missing is a Wookiee yell at the end ! "

 = The Boat Race 1914 = 
 The 71st Boat Race took place on 28 March 1914 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race . In this year 's race , umpired by former rower Frederick I. Pitman , Cambridge won by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds . The victory took the overall record to 39 – 31 in Oxford 's favour . It would be the last race for six years following the outbreak of the First World War . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2015 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1913 race by three @-@ quarters of a length , and led overall with 39 victories to Cambridge 's 30 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the 1882 and 1883 races , his son Robert Bourne ( who rowed four times from 1909 to 1912 ) , and Harcourt Gilbey Gold ( Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four @-@ time Blue ) . Cambridge were coached by Stanley Bruce ( who had rowed in the 1904 race ) . For the eleventh year the umpire was old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884 , 1885 and 1886 races . 
 According to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , the Cambridge crew " rapidly developed into a crew which gave every promise of being quite sensationally fast . " Conversely , he noted that Oxford suffered " from a dearth of material " which , followed by constant changes in the crew order , resulted in a " merely eight good men in a boat — and nothing more " . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12 st 9 @.@ 25 lb ( 80 @.@ 2 kg ) , 3 @.@ 25 pounds ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) per rower more than their opponents . The Oxford crew saw five participants return , including cox Henry Wells who was taking part in his fourth race . Cambridge 's crew also included five participants with Boat Race experience , including Sidney Swann who was making his fourth appearance in the event . Swann and Ewart Horsfall had both won gold medals in the men 's eight at the 1912 Summer Olympics , rowing for Leander Club . They defeated New College in the final for whom Arthur Wiggins , Beaufort Burdekin and Frederick Pitman rowed . 
 = = Race = = 
 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . In bright sunshine , a light wind and smooth water , umpire Pitman started the race at 2 : 20 p.m. Although rating slower than Oxford , Cambridge took a lead and were three @-@ quarters of a length ahead by Craven Steps . They extended their lead to a length and a quarter by the Mile Post and continued to pull away as they passed below Hammersmith Bridge . According to Drinkwater , they took " things easy in the rough water " towards Barnes Bridge and went on to pass the finishing post four and a half lengths ahead , in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds . It was Cambridge 's first victory since the 1908 race and took the overall record in the event to 39 – 31 in Oxford 's favour . Drinkwater concluded that while " Oxford were a poor crew ... individually they had quite a lot of talent " . By comparison , he noted that Cambridge " were a reasonably high @-@ class crew ... but they lacked quickness " . 
 It was the last race until 1920 , as a result of the outbreak of the First World War , and first time since 1853 that there was a break in the annual tradition . During the conflict , at least 42 Blues were killed , including five of the 1914 participants : Dennis Ivor Day , cox L. E. Ridley , John Andrew Ritson and Gordon Garnett of the Cambridge crew , and Reginald William Fletcher from the Oxford boat . 
 = 200 ( Stargate SG @-@ 1 ) = 
 " 200 " is the sixth episode of the science fiction television series Stargate SG @-@ 1 's tenth season , and the 200th episode of the series overall . Unlike the more serious nature of the season 's story arc , " 200 " is a light @-@ hearted parody of both Stargate SG @-@ 1 and other sci @-@ fi shows , as well as popular culture like The Wizard of Oz . 
 " 200 " won the 2007 Constellation Award for Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script , and was nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form . The episode also marks the first time original SG @-@ 1 member Jack O 'Neill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) is seen since the beginning of Season 9 . 
 The episode received a 1 @.@ 9 average household rating , one of the few episodes of the season that surpassed the average rating of Stargate SG @-@ 1 's previous season . " 200 " also received near @-@ universal praise for its humor and writing . Despite the strong performance of the episode , the Sci @-@ Fi Channel announced soon after the episode 's airing it would not be renewing the series for another season . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Martin Lloyd ( Willie Garson ) , an extraterrestrial turned Hollywood writer , returns to Stargate Command looking for assistance from SG @-@ 1 with his script for the movie adaptation of the television show Wormhole X @-@ Treme , first featured earlier in the series in the episode " Wormhole X @-@ Treme ! " . The team , especially Lt. Colonel Mitchell ( Ben Browder ) , is reluctant to help . Mitchell is excited about his next off @-@ world mission because it marks his 200th trip through the Stargate . However , when technical glitches prevent the team from setting off on their mission , they are stuck in the briefing room under the orders of General Landry ( Beau Bridges ) , because the Pentagon believes a successful science fiction film about intergalactic wormhole travel will serve as a good cover story to keep the real Stargate program a secret . 
 The notes session quickly devolves into the team members pitching their own versions of a successful sci @-@ fi film , including a zombie invasion ( from Mitchell ) , a previously unseen mission where O 'Neill became invisible ( from Carter ) , " tributes " to The Wizard of Oz and Farscape ( from Vala ) , and Teal 'c as a private investigator ( from Teal 'c himself ) . Also featured are a vignette of the team 's mental image of a " younger and edgier " SG @-@ 1 ( sparked by the studio 's suggestion to replace the original Wormhole X @-@ Treme cast ) , a suggested scene by Martin that turns out to be both scientifically inaccurate and highly derivative of Star Trek , a re @-@ imagined version of the SG @-@ 1 pilot episode where all the characters are marionettes in the style of the television series Thunderbirds , and an imagined wedding that features the return of General O 'Neill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) . 
 Ultimately , the planning session is all for naught , as the studio decides to cancel the movie in favor of renewing the series . At the end of the episode , the focus shifts ten years into the future , where the Wormhole X @-@ Treme cast and crew are celebrating their 200th episode , as well as renewed plans for a movie . 
 = = Production = = 
 Executive producer Robert C. Cooper originally proposed they write a normal script for the 200th episode . However it soon became clear that deciding who would have the privilege of writing the 200th episode would be problematic . This led to the idea to create a sketch episode in the manner of Saturday Night Live , with each writer creating a vignette . The episode took shape when the writers thought to bring back Wormhole X @-@ Treme and the character of Martin , and frame the whole episode as a notes session . By the end of the writing process the episode had turned into " an homage to the cast , crew , and die @-@ hard fans . " 
 Stargate producers were not sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode , so they devised many scenes where Anderson was " in " the episode but not actually shown . However , Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes . In the DVD special Stargate SG @-@ 1 : Behind the 200th Cooper said , " it was a big deal for us to have [ him ] back for the 200th episode . We obviously didn 't think we could do it without him . " 
 Despite the markedly different content of the episode , " 200 " took no longer to shoot than a normal episode , mainly because much of the filming took place on the briefing room set . On the other hand , the episode was much more expensive than a typical one , due to the unusual sequences . For example , the marionettes used in an elaborate spoof of the series were created by the <unk> brothers , who also made the puppets for Team America : World Police ; each puppet cost about US $ 25 @,@ 000 , and the wires pulling each puppet had to be readded by CGI in post production because they didn 't show up well enough . Several existing sets were used as stand @-@ ins ; for example , the bridge of the Odyssey was used for a Star Trek : The Original Series spoof , while a set from the sister production Stargate : Atlantis was used as the chamber of the Wizard of Oz . 
 In an interview about the tenth season of Stargate , Cooper and series co @-@ creator Brad Wright stated that there was a fine line between the humor of regular episodes turning into camp . While jokes for the joke 's sake are usually limited in normal episodes , the line between humor and camp is deliberately crossed frequently in " 200 " . The producers even talked about recreating a part of Blazing Saddles that breaks the fourth wall , but they could not afford the horses . 
 The producers made sure that the episode was well @-@ publicized , dropping hints that Anderson 's character O 'Neill would return for the episode . Joe Mallozzi , executive producer for the series , also hinted that series fans would finally meet the <unk> , an enigmatic race referenced in the second season episode " The Fifth Race " but never seen . Despite the outlandish scenes filmed for the episode , many of the writers ' favorite moments did not make it to production due to time constraints . For example , Cooper noted that a Gilligan 's Island skit was cut from the script . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Most of the episode is devoted to references and allusions to other works , as well as the show itself . The title sequence is deliberately shorter than most other episodes , poking fun at shows like Lost as well as the Sci @-@ Fi Channel itself , which had shortened SG @-@ 1 's Season 9 opening but changed it back after fans demanded it . When Martin learns that his main actor has backed out of the movie , the SG @-@ 1 team offers various suggestions for how to replace him or work around his non @-@ availability — a reference to Michael Shanks 's absence from the sixth season of Stargate SG @-@ 1 . Anderson himself also pokes fun at the ending of the eighth season episode " Moebius " , which was intended to be the series finale before the ninth season was announced . The final scene of " 200 " , which features interviews with the Wormhole X @-@ Treme cast , was added as an afterthought , and contains comments from the real cast which were used out of context as an inside joke . 
 The episode also riffs on other science fiction shows . Early in the episode , Dr. Jackson asks why anyone would make a movie version of a TV series that lasted only three episodes — Teal 'c responds that it had strong DVD sales . This is a reference to the series Firefly , which Fox executives decided to cancel after airing only three episodes ( although 14 episodes had been filmed , and 11 of them were actually aired — 8 more after the cancellation announcement had been made ) . The high number of DVDs of these episodes that sold afterwards justified making a feature film based on the series , Serenity . ( Firefly is again referenced when Lloyd refuses to use footage from the Wormhole X @-@ Treme series for the movie , saying that " it 's a movie , not a clip show . " This is an allusion to Joss Whedon 's insistence that the movie Firefly would not use footage from the original series because it is " not a clip show " . ) In addition , one of the sequences is a parody of the original Star Trek series , with SG @-@ 1 standing in for the crew of the Enterprise . Brad Wright , the co @-@ creator of the series , fills in as the engineer Montgomery Scott . The episode also pokes good @-@ humored fun at the series Farscape , including its habit of inventing swear words . The Farscape sequence itself is an in @-@ joke , since the Stargate : SG @-@ 1 actors Ben Browder and Claudia Black had both starred in the earlier series ( and indeed Black reprises her original role of <unk> Sun , though Browder plays a different character , Stark , while Michael Shanks portrays Browder 's Farscape character , John Crichton ) . Several other shows and movies are parodied , including the The Wizard of Oz ( the story is re @-@ told with the members of the SG @-@ 1 team as the adventurers in Oz . The writers based the parody on a fan painting they had hanging in their office ) . The episode also makes fun of 24 's " ticking clock of jeopardy " , and an entire sequence is enacted with all the characters played by marionettes , in the style of Thunderbirds and Team America : World Police .

 The episode won the 2007 Constellation Award for Best Overall 2006 Science Fiction Film or Television Script , and was nominated for the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form . Richard Dean Anderson also won a SyFy Genre Award for his guest appearance in the episode . 
 The episode was generally well received . IGN declared the episode " one of the smartest and funniest hours of television to grace the small screen yet this season . " They went on to applaud the decision not only to parody other works but the show itself . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune agreed , but also noted that " you don 't need to be a longtime fan of the long @-@ running program to enjoy its jibes at sci @-@ fi clichés or expedient writing . " Eclipse Magazine noted that although the episode was " not a work of comic genius " , " 200 " was the best comedy episode of the series . 
 The highly publicized debut of the episode garnered a 1 @.@ 9 average household rating , a 36 % jump from the previous episode , and the first episode of the tenth season to reach or exceed the previous season 's rating of 1 @.@ 8 ; Stargate SG @-@ 1 at that point was averaging about 3 @.@ 3 million viewers per regular episode in the United States .

 Shortly after this episode was aired , <unk> announced that the Sci @-@ Fi Channel had decided not renew Stargate SG @-@ 1 for the coming year . The Channel later confirmed this decision , at the same time announcing that Stargate Atlantis had been picked up for another season . Many fans denounced <unk> 's cancellation announcement , both the timing of it ( apparently it had been made while the cast and crew were celebrating the episode 's airing ) — and the decision itself , on the ground that , while ratings were not as high as they had been in previous seasons , the series was still drawing an audience of a respectable size . ( For example , it had a season average of 2 million viewers in Australia , half of them in the 18 – 49 demographic . ) Sci Fi responded that the cancellation decision had not been based on ratings so much as a feeling the series had run its course .

 The environmental impact of aviation in the United Kingdom is increasing due to the increasing demand for air travel in the country . In the past 25 years the UK air transport industry has seen sustained growth , and the demand for passenger air travel in particular is forecast to increase more than twofold , to 465 million passengers , by 2030 . Two airports ; London Heathrow Airport and London Gatwick Airport , are amongst the top ten busiest airports in the world for international passenger traffic . Whilst more than half of all passengers travelling by air in the UK currently travel via the five London area airports , regional airports have experienced the most growth in recent years , due to the success of ' no @-@ frills ' airlines over the last decade . 
 The ability of the existing airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited , and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this . The strategy is generally based on making the best use of existing facilities , although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary , three of them at the London airports of Stansted , Heathrow and , towards the end of the timeframe involved , Gatwick . This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry ; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts . The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee , by environmentalist and campaign groups , and in research papers , for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences . 
 Support for airport expansion is based on an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right , but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole . One study predicts that the government 's strategy will realise an additional £ 13 billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) by 2030 . Another study which is critical of the government approach , and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport , indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion . In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions , a figure that is set to rise as demand increases . Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport , air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050 . Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements , whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes . Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel , primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively . Local environmental issues include noise and air quality , and the impact of these , particularly in the case of the former , is subject to debate . Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally , and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this . 
 = = Air transport framework = = 
 Air transport in the United Kingdom is a growth industry . In the period 1981 to 2006 the number of terminal passengers increased by 400 per cent and air transport movements by 250 per cent . Although the transport of freight declined slightly year on year between 2004 and 2006 , in the decade since 1996 air freight has increased by 31 per cent . During the period in which government policy was being formulated the number of passengers exceeded 200 million , and in 2006 the industry handled over 236 million passengers ( up 3 per cent from the previous year ) , with nearly 2 @.@ 4 million air transport movements ( up 1 @.@ 8 per cent ) . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 Air traffic services for all UK airspace is provided by National Air Traffic Services ( NATS ) , which also provides air traffic control at 15 airports . The largest airport operator is BAA Limited , owner of six UK airports including London Heathrow airport . In some cases airport ownership is in the hands of local government authorities rather than private businesses , and the largest UK owned operator , Manchester Airports Group , operator of Manchester Airport , Bournemouth Airport , East Midlands Airport , and Humberside Airport , is owned by a consortium of 10 Manchester area local authorities . Whilst the number of airports in the UK runs into hundreds , many are smaller aerodromes dealing with general aviation rather than air transport . In terms of the latter , statistics are collected from 59 main airports , and the largest concentration of services is located in the London and South East of England areas . 
 Heathrow is the largest airport in the country , handling over 67 million terminal passengers in 2006 , making it the third busiest airport in the world , and the busiest if measured by the number of international passengers . Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport , which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents . Even though there are no dedicated freight services operating out of Heathrow , the practise of transporting cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft means that this airport still accounts for more than half of all freight handled by UK airports . Gatwick airport , with 34 million terminal passengers , is the second largest in the country , eighth busiest in the world for international passenger traffic , and lays claim to the busiest single runway airport in the world . Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137 million terminal passengers , 59 per cent of the national total . Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over the past decade , and these two airports are the major hubs for express freight operations . 
 Outside of London and the South East , the use of regional airports has increased dramatically in recent years , with the amount of air traffic using these facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005 . To illustrate this growth , in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter International Airport , Bristol International Airport , and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent , 113 per cent , and 60 per cent respectively . In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth , with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent , and those of Gatwick increasing by less than 10 per cent . 
 = = = Airlines = = = 
 The majority of all passengers travelling by air to or from the UK are carried by UK airlines , of which there are around forty , and at the end of 2006 the UK air transport fleet numbered 963 aircraft , flying just under 1 @.@ 2 million flights and averaging over eight hours of flying daily . Together the two largest airlines as measured by passenger numbers ; British Airways and easyJet , account for nearly half of the 127 million passengers flown on UK airlines . In terms of capacity , both available and used , British Airways is again the largest airline , whilst easyJet is pushed into third place by Virgin Atlantic Airways . British Airways passenger flights also account for over 50 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines , and when combined with its cargo operations the airline carries over 60 per cent of all cargo carried by UK airlines . 
 The advent in the mid @-@ 1990s of ’ no @-@ frills ’ carriers , such as easyJet , has had a significant impact on air travel in the UK . In 2005 these airlines carried 77 @.@ 5 million passengers , up from just 4 @.@ 3 million in 1996 . They are responsible for the growth of regional airports , operating from 35 airports in 2006 compared to 10 in 1996 , and increasing the choice of international destinations , serving 150 in 2006 , compared to 12 a decade earlier . The annual rate of growth in the overall demand for air travel has remained stable since 1975 , averaging 5 @.@ 8 per cent annually . Recent growth is being serviced by the no @-@ frills airlines at the expense of traditional carriers which , since 2000 , have experienced flat or declining traffic levels . In response , traditional carriers have lowered costs to compete more effectively on price , leading to lower prices on the short haul routes serviced by this sector , especially in business fares . They have also limited or reduced capacity and in some cases launched no @-@ frills subsidiaries of their own . 
 = = = Passenger travel = = = 
 Just over a fifth of all terminal passengers are travelling on domestic routes only , whilst half are travelling between the UK and the rest of the European Union ( EU ) . Of the latter , travel between the UK and Spain , France , Germany and Italy account for around half , with Spain almost matching the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers . Outside of the EU , the USA , the Far East , Switzerland and the Middle East together account for just over half of all passengers flying between the UK and the rest of the world , with the USA exceeding the other three combined in terms of passenger numbers . Air travel is the most popular mode of transport for visitors both to and from the UK . In 2005 it was used for 80 per cent of all visits by UK residents travelling overseas and by 74 per cent of all inbound visits . Just over a quarter of all passengers are travelling on business . The advent of no @-@ frills carriers has had a significant effect on passenger travel profiles , with strong growth in business travel from regional airports , and increasing inbound traffic generated for the purposes of non @-@ UK residents visiting friends and relatives based in the UK . Whilst these carriers have been perceived to democratise air travel , providing the opportunity for lower income groups to travel more often , the main result is actually that middle and higher income groups travel more often , and often for shorter trips . Researchers have been raising concern about the globally increasing hypermobility of individuals , involving frequent and often long distance air travel and the resulting environmental and climate impacts . 
 = = = Capacity = = = 
 The availability of airport capacity has been identified as an important constraint on the ability to meet the increasing demand for air travel . In many cases airport capacity is already fully used in meeting current demand . At Heathrow and Gatwick airports the runways are full for " … virtually the whole day " . In 2003 the runway at Birmingham airport was expected to reach full capacity by 2009 at the latest , whilst terminal capacity at Edinburgh airport had reached its limit . Government forecasts that year predicted that by 2030 the number of passengers could rise to between 400 million passengers per annum ( mppa ) and 600 mppa , representing a two to threefold increase , and a figure of 500 mppa by 2030 was regarded by the government as robust . In 2006 the government reported that at 228 mppa the demand for air travel the previous year was in line with the 2003 forecast , but also revised the forecast demand for 2030 downwards to 465 mppa as a result of capacity constraints , even taking into account proposed airport developments . 
 = = = Government and regulation = = = 
 The law governing aviation in the UK is defined by the Civil Aviation Act 1982 , which is updated periodically with amendments , the latest being the Civil Aviation Act 2006 . The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to aviation is the Department for Transport ( DfT ) . At the operational level the independently run Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) regulates economic , safety , and consumer protection aspects , as well as airspace policy , although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) . International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) as established by the Chicago Convention , whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil Aviation Conference ( ECAC ) . As a consequence , other than in airport development , there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation . 
 = = Airport development strategy = = 
 Whilst airport development in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes , the government regards airports as an important part of the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach . To support this , the government began a three @-@ year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document . This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy . One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport . Another key issue for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs . Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published . These focussed on the economic , environmental , social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions , and together they generated half a million responses . During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation . The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government 's conclusions . 
 The White Paper does not in itself authorise or preclude any development , but seeks instead to define a " national strategic framework for the future development of airport capacity " over the next 30 years . The principal conclusion is that the two extremes of failing to provide additional airport capacity , and encouraging growth without regard for the wider impacts , are equally unacceptable options . Instead a " balanced and measured approach " to the future of air transport in the UK is adopted . This approach is designed to cater for the forecast growth in demand , thus supporting economic prosperity nationally and enabling ordinary people to travel at reasonable cost , whilst at the same time managing and mitigating the environmental impacts of aviation and ensuring that the costs associated with them are reflected in the price of air travel . The strategy seeks to minimise new airport development by making best use of existing facilities , and specific policies include : 
 = = = Subsequent developments = = = 
 In December 2006 the government published the Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006 to report on progress made in " … delivering a sustainable future for aviation . " The report re @-@ iterates the government ’ s commitment to the strategy defined in the original White Paper , stating that it " … strikes the right balance between economic , social and environmental goals . " It also reports that ; the extra runway at Edinburgh airport is now thought unlikely to be needed before 2020 ; Bristol airport does not currently see a case to support extending its runway , although the option will be kept under review ; the additional runway at Stansted airport is not expected to be operational before 2015 ; and the runway extension at Liverpool airport is now being proposed for early next decade . Elsewhere , recent forecasts conducted for Birmingham airport indicate that a new runway will not be required there before 2030 . 
 Following the publication of the White Paper , the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow ( ' Project Heathrow ' for short ) was set up to examine how expansion at Heathrow could best be accomplished within the constraints of the stringent environmental limits the White Paper required . A provisional assessment indicates that increased usage of the existing runways could be realised without increasing the number of people affected by noise if ' mixed mode ' operations ( the simultaneous use of both runways for arrivals and departures ) are phased in gradually as noisier aircraft are retired . Indications ahead of the Project Heathrow environmental assessment indicate that increased noise and deterioration in air quality are likely to significantly constrain traffic using a new third runway . These issues are to be addressed as part of a three @-@ month consultation beginning in December 2007 , and considerable opposition is being mobilised against the expansion of Heathrow . 
 = = Economic impact = = 
 The aviation industry and the government have together commissioned two significant studies into the economic impact of air transport , both undertaken by the consultancy Oxford Economic Forecasting ( OEF ) . The first ; The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the UK Economy , was published in 1999 and was used as a source of economic information in The Future of Air Transport White Paper . The second study ; The Economic Contribution of the Aviation Industry in the UK , co @-@ sponsored by the national tourist agency VisitBritain , was published in October 2006 to extend and update the earlier report , and was used as a source in the Air Transport White Paper Progress Report 2006 . Both studies concluded that whilst aviation is an important industry in its own right , the most important contribution is as " … a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole . " 
 Environmental groups dispute the economic benefits that are claimed for air transport , and the OEF reports have been specifically challenged . The Aviation Environment Federation ( AEF ) , publishing the Rebuttal of Oxford Economic Forecasting Report , has labelled the 2006 OEF report " biased and misleading " . <unk> , an umbrella movement for national environmental organisations and airport community groups opposed to aviation expansion , has produced a critique of the 2006 OEF report and the DfT ’ s reliance on economic research that has been " … sponsored by the aviation industry . " In response to government policy supporting further growth in aviation , Friends of the Earth ( <unk> ) published Pie in the Sky in September 2006 . This study concludes that the economic benefits of aviation have been exaggerated , and that the costs arising from environmental damage , as well as to other sectors of the economy , are ignored . Also published in 2006 , the Environmental Change Institute study <unk> and decide - Aviation , climate change and UK policy re @-@ examined the economic arguments made in favour of aviation , concluding that restricting future growth would not necessarily be detrimental to the economy , and could potentially result in some economic benefits . 
 = = = Direct economic impact = = = 
 In terms of direct impact on the UK economy , air transport is an £ 11 @.@ 4 billion industry , a figure which represents 1 @.@ 1 per cent of the country ’ s economy . It employs 186 @,@ 000 people ( full @-@ time equivalents ) , and indirectly supports an additional 334 @,@ 000 jobs , although the inclusion of indirect employment as an economic benefit of air transport is disputed . In terms of productivity the aviation industry in 2004 was the third most productive , after the oil / gas extraction and utilities sectors , exceeding the national average by a factor of two and a half . The industry is also very capital intensive , accounting for up to 3 @.@ 5 per cent of total UK business investment in the period 2000 to 2004 . Air transport was directly responsible for £ 3 @.@ 6 billion in tax and national insurance contributions in 2004 / 5 , which includes £ 0 @.@ 9 billion raised in Air Passenger Duty ( APD ) , a figure set to double after APD rates were doubled in February 2007 . Because of the global nature of the industry , article 15 of the Chicago Convention effectively prevents the imposition of fuel duty on aviation , and the industry does not pay Value Added Tax ( VAT ) . Environmental groups argue that these , along with duty @-@ free sales , are iniquitous tax concessions valued at £ 9 billion annually . Despite generating £ 6 @.@ 9 billion in exports in 2004 , representing 3 per cent of all UK exports and 7 per cent of the total export of services , the patronage in the UK of air transport services provided by overseas airlines resulted in a £ 3 @.@ 3 billion balance of payments deficit attributable to the industry . 
 = = = Indirect economic impact = = = 
 The government ’ s response to the challenges of an increasingly global economy is to build a " strong , modern knowledge economy " , and the 2006 OEF study concludes that the UK economy is " … set to become increasingly dependent on aviation as the structure of the economy evolves . " The availability of air transport services is regarded as an important factor in facilitating business activities , with benefits being realised in sales and marketing activities , customer and supplier relationships , the ability to serve a wider market , access to emerging markets , and more efficient production . Within industry sectors that are likely to support the development of a knowledge based economy , such as pharmaceuticals , banking and finance , communication services , computer services etc . , there is conflicting evidence about a correlation between growth in a sector and that sector ’ s use of air travel , although survey results show that knowledge based services and high @-@ tech manufacturing businesses are more dependent on air transport for sales than their more traditional economy counterparts . 
 The most successful example of the country ’ s economic evolution is the international financial services industry based in London . Within this sector aviation services are seen as critically important for both businesses and their clients , even in the era of video @-@ conferencing . London ’ s air transport services are widely regarded within the London business community surveyed by the OEF to provide a competitive advantage over the rest of Europe , and expansion of airport capacity in the South East has significant support . Whilst these economic contributions are not disputed by environmental groups , they are not considered as sufficient justification to support further growth in air transport services which would primarily service increased demand for leisure travel rather than a business travel market which is already well served . 
 Transport links generally are regarded as an important factor which affects a company ’ s decision on where to locate , and thus invest , although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance . Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as an important factor in the decision of where in the UK to locate operations , whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air transport links has affected their decision to invest in the UK . The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias , though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report 's authors . 
 Tourism is an industry where the influence of air transport services is more obvious . In 2005 some 22 million overseas visitors arrived by air , spending around £ 12 billion ( 1 @.@ 1 per cent of GDP ) and supporting 170 @,@ 000 jobs in the tourist industry . In the same year air travel also accounted for 36 million trips abroad by UK tourists , and UK tourists as a whole spend twice as much abroad as overseas visitors spend in the UK . This has led to the assertion that aviation represents a " net negative effect " on the UK tourism industry , and that restraining demand for air travel would encourage more domestic tourism , with the consequent economic benefit of reducing the tourism deficit . 
 Exports and imports by air in 2005 were estimated at £ 62 @.@ 7 billion and £ 59 @.@ 6 billion respectively , with a significant majority of air freight operations being conducted with countries outside of the EU , and express freight operations transporting 5 per cent by value of all UK exports in 2004 . Whilst export / import facilities provide opportunities for international trade and competition , they are not without negative effect , and British horticulture is one example of domestic industry damaged by cheap imports . 
 = = = Forecast economic impact = = = 
 Attempts to quantify the economic impact of growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made , and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis . The OEF study has produced a figure of £ 2 @.@ 5 billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow , or £ 7 billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there . Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £ 13 billion per annum in GDP by 2030 . Calculations done for the AEF , based on a new runway at Stansted , and which assume increased taxation of the industry , result in a negative economic benefit . 
 = = Environmental impact = = 
 External costs , also referred to as hidden costs , are <unk> of the environmental and climate impacts of air transport . Whilst setting a financial value on all such impacts is difficult to do precisely , figures have been produced for the most significant . In 2000 the government valued the annual cost of climate change induced by greenhouse gas emissions from UK air transport at £ 1 @.@ 4 billion , rising to £ 4 @.@ 8 billion per annum by 2030 . The impact of noise was costed at around £ 25 million per annum in 2000 , and for the same year the impact on air quality was costed at between £ 119 million and £ 236 million per annum . Based on figures produced by the European Environment Agency the AEF has calculated a much higher total external cost for 2000 of around £ 6 billion . 
 = = = Global environmental impact = = = 
 Whilst carbon emissions from all UK activities other than aviation had declined by 9 per cent in the 10 years between 1990 and 2000 , carbon emissions from aviation activities doubled in the same period . Air transport in the UK accounted for 6 @.@ 3 per cent of all UK carbon emissions in 2006 . When the radiative forcing impact of other emissions are taken into account the total impact of emissions attributable to aviation is estimated to be twice that of its carbon emissions alone . Although the government has committed to reducing total UK carbon emissions by 60 per cent from existing levels by 2050 , its policy is based on the use of " … economic instruments to ensure that growing industries are catered for within a reducing total . " Even if this reduction in total carbon emissions is achieved , research published in February 2006 concluded that aviation could account for between 24 per cent and 50 per cent of the UK 's carbon budget by 2050 . 
 The government recognises that there are no viable alternative aviation fuels , and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous , it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this . The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes . Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels , the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism . The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation ( ICAO ) , which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998 , but progress is slow . In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) with an original target to implement this by 2008 . In 2006 the government re @-@ affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation , and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011 , with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year . 
 The aviation industry is seeking to reduce its climate change impacts by becoming more fuel efficient , and in the last 40 years fuel efficiency has more than doubled . In June 2005 , Sustainable Aviation ; a joint initiative involving a number of UK airlines , airports , manufacturers and the air traffic service provider NATS , was launched with a vision statement relating to environmental issues of " … removing or minimising any negative impacts on the local and global environment … " . One of its commitments is to achieve , by means of airframe , engine and air traffic management improvements , a 50 % reduction in CO 
 2 emissions , and an 80 % reduction in NOx emissions in new aircraft of 2020 relative to new aircraft in 2000 . These are however long term aspirations , and whilst progress is being made in engine development , the more immediate efforts of Sustainable Aviation to address climate change are directed towards supporting research , common reporting of emissions , emissions trading , and personal offsetting . 
 Critics of an expansionist policy consider the EU ETS to be too late and to price carbon too low to adequately mitigate the climate change impact of aviation emissions . Instead they advocate addressing these impacts by constraining demand for air travel . The study <unk> and Decide - Aviation , climate change and UK policy , noting that a 10 per cent increase in fares generates a 5 to 15 per cent reduction in demand , recommends that the government should seek an alternative aviation policy based on managing demand rather than providing for it . This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes " … against the expansion of UK airport capacity " and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively . In another study the levying of £ 9 billion of taxes is calculated to constrain the forecast growth in demand by 2030 to 315 million passengers , reducing the annual rate of growth to 2 per cent . The environmental message is echoed in the ninth report of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee , published in July 2006 , which labels the government strategy a predict and provide model and expresses scepticism about the timescale and efficiency of the EU ETS . It recommends instead that the government rethinks its airport expansion policy and considers ways , particularly via increased taxation , in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies , so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms .

 Under the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act aircraft in flight are specifically exempted from trespass and nuisance controls , which denies any form of redress to those living near airports who are disturbed by noise . Government sanctioned measurements of noise near airports take an average sound level , measured in decibels ( dB ) , over a 16 ‑ hour day , and are expressed as an LAeq figure . Officially , 57 dB LAeq is the threshold at which noise levels become disturbing , 63 dB LAeq represents moderate disturbance , whilst 69 dB LAeq represents high disturbance . Technological improvements in aircraft design means that aircraft are becoming quieter . Taking Heathrow as an example , between 1990 and 2004 the area around the airport affected by noise levels of 57 db LAeq and above fell by 60 per cent , whilst the number of people similarly affected fell by 51 per cent . Campaign groups dispute the methodology used to measure noise , asserting that it is flawed in a number of ways . Amongst other issues they point to the World Health Organisation view that annoyance begins at 50 db LAeq whilst serious annoyance begins at 55 dB LAeq , and they assert that the LAeq measurement does not give sufficient weight to the increasing incidence of noise events . Their conclusion is that noise levels , and the number of people affected , have increased rather than decreased . This is borne out by the latest survey of attitudes to noise published in November 2007 which reports that , compared with over 20 years ago , more people today are annoyed by the same level of noise as measured by LAeq . Whilst this may be attributable to changing attitudes , the report concludes that the contribution of aircraft numbers to annoyance has increased , and that an alternative method of estimating levels of annoyance that takes this into account would appear to be more relevant than the LAeq measurement . The report has attracted criticism in peer reviews , and one such review , characterising the survey as inconclusive , counsels " ... against using the detailed results and conclusions [ ... ] in the development of government policy . " 
 Air quality around airports is another major issue and a 2006 study found that levels of nitrogen dioxide exceeds EU guidelines at more than two thirds of airports surveyed . Whilst aircraft contribute to the problem the study states that " … cars , buses and taxis ferrying passengers to and from these sites are dominant sources of pollution . " Birmingham airport dismissed the findings , asserting that the results were skewed by M42 motorway traffic unrelated to the airport , whilst studies at Southampton Airport attribute 5 @.@ 55 per cent of total pollutants to airport activities , the majority of the remainder being generated by non @-@ airport related road traffic . The government recognises Heathrow as the only UK airport where national and European air quality limits are being exceeded . 
 A provision of the original Civil Aviation Act allows designated airports to be required to provide facilities for consultation with affected parties , where local environmental concerns can be raised , and some 51 airports have been so designated . A 2000 consultation by the government re @-@ iterated its policy that generally , local issues arising from airport operations are best addressed locally . To support this the Civil Aviation Act was extended in 2006 to give all airports the authority to mandate measures to address noise and air quality issues beyond their boundaries , and to impose financial penalties on aircraft which fail or are unable to adhere to such measures . The Civil Aviation Act 2006 also extends the provisions of section 78 of the original act , augmenting the powers of the Secretary of State to intervene directly in operations at designated airports ; currently Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted , " … for the purpose of avoiding , limiting or mitigating the effect of noise and vibration connected with aircraft landing or taking off . " The largest airports also implement voluntary schemes to assist local communities in coping with the local impacts of airport operations . Birmingham International Airport , for example , has been operating a sound insulation scheme since 1978 , in which 7 @,@ 600 properties are eligible for sound proof glazing paid for by the airport . Schemes are also available to residents most affected by noise around Heathrow , designed to protect property prices ahead of any development of a third runway , assist with relocation costs for people who wish to move , and provide sound insulation for private and communal property currently affected by noise . In both cases local residents have also set up campaign groups ; Birmingham Airport anti @-@ Noise Group , and <unk> <unk> at Heathrow , to represent themselves over local environmental issues arising from airport operations . Even the smallest of airports engaged in air transport operations ; Gloucestershire Airport , has attracted organised opposition to its plans to extend the main runway there , and the umbrella group <unk> lists over 20 local airport campaign groups . 
 = Eremoryzomys = 
 Eremoryzomys polius , also known as the gray rice rat or the Marañon oryzomys , is a rodent in the tribe Oryzomyini of the family Cricetidae . Discovered in 1912 and first described in 1913 by Wilfred Osgood , it was originally placed in Oryzomys and named Oryzomys polius . In 2006 , a cladistic analysis found that it was not closely related to Oryzomys in the strict sense or to any other oryzomyine then known , so that it is now placed in its own genus , Eremoryzomys . The Brazilian genus Drymoreomys , named in 2011 , is probably the closest relative of Eremoryzomys . Eremoryzomys has a limited distribution in the dry upper valley of the Marañón River in central Peru , but may yet contain more than one species . 
 A large , long @-@ tailed rice rat , with head and body length of 138 to 164 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 5 in ) , Eremoryzomys polius has gray fur and short ears . There are well @-@ developed ungual tufts of hair on the hindfeet . Females have eight mammae . The rostrum ( front part of the skull ) is long and robust and the braincase is rounded . The bony palate is relatively short . The IUCN assesses the conservation status of the species as " Data Deficient " ; it is poorly known but may be threatened by habitat destruction .

 The first two specimens of Eremoryzomys polius were collected by Wilfred Osgood and M.P. Anderson in 1912 . The next year , Osgood described these animals as a new species in the genus Oryzomys , Oryzomys polius . Osgood wrote that he was unable to find any species closely related to O. polius and compared it with O. <unk> ( currently Aegialomys <unk> ) " for convenience " . Its relationships remained obscure ever afterward and it was never assigned to any of the several groups of species recognized within Oryzomys . 
 In 2006 , Marcelo Weksler published a large @-@ scale cladistic analysis of Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , the tribe to which O. polius belongs . He used both morphological data and molecular characters from the IRBP gene . In all of his analyses , O. polius was found to be part of clade D , one of four large groups within Oryzomyini , as the sister group to a clade containing all the other species of clade D. Clade D was supported by two shared derived ( synapomorphic ) molecular characters and by seven morphological synapomorphies — the tail has a different color above and below ; the parietal bone extends to the side of the skull ; the incisive foramina ( openings in the palate ) extend back between the first molars ; the posterolateral palatal pits ( perforations of the palate near the third molars ) are complex ; the sphenopalatine vacuities ( openings in the mesopterygoid fossa , the gap behind the end of the palate ) are large ; the pattern of the arterial circulation in the head is derived ; and the posteroloph ( a crest at the back ) is present on the third upper molar . Two other molecular synapomorphies supported the clade of all members of clade D except O. polius , coupled with three morphological traits — in these species , but not in O. polius , the first upper molar has an additional small root at the outer ( labial ) side ; the first lower molar has additional small roots ; and the second upper molar has the mesoflexus ( one of the valleys between the cusps and crests ) divided in two . 
 In Weksler 's analysis , species placed in Oryzomys did not form a coherent ( monophyletic ) group , but instead were found at various positions across the oryzomyine tree , and he suggested that most of these species , including O. polius , should be placed in new genera . Later in 2006 , Weksler and others described ten new genera for species formerly placed in Oryzomys , including Eremoryzomys for polius ; thus , the species is now known as Eremoryzomys polius . In reference to its " isolated distribution " , they incorporated the Greek word <unk> " lonely place " into the generic name . The 2008 IUCN Red List , citing Pacheco , commented that Eremoryzomys may in fact include more than one species . In 2011 , a new oryzomyine , Drymoreomys albimaculatus , was described from southeastern Brazil , and phylogenetic analysis of morphological and molecular data suggested that this animal is the closest known relative of Eremoryzomys . 
 Eremoryzomys is now one of about 28 genera in the tribe Oryzomyini , which includes well over a hundred species distributed mainly in South America , including nearby islands such as the Galápagos Islands and some of the Antilles . Oryzomyini is one of several tribes recognized within the subfamily Sigmodontinae , which encompasses hundreds of species found across South America and into southern North America . Sigmodontinae itself is the largest subfamily of the family Cricetidae , other members of which include voles , lemmings , hamsters , and deermice , all mainly from Eurasia and North America . 
 = = Description = = 
 Eremoryzomys polius is a large , long @-@ tailed rice rat that in color resembles some North American woodrats ( <unk> ) . The fur is grayish above and lighter below , where the hairs are gray at the bases but white at the tips . The external ears ( pinnae ) are short and the tail is dark above and light below . The hindfeet have well @-@ developed ungual tufts ( patches of hair ) along the plantar margins and between all of the digits , a character shared only with Sooretamys <unk> among oryzomyines . The squamae , small structures resembling scales that cover the soles of the hindfeet in many oryzomyines , are well developed . The claw of the first digit extends nearly to the end of the first phalanx of the second toe and the claw of the fifth toe extends slightly beyond the first phalanx of the fourth toe . As in most oryzomyines , the female has eight mammae . Head and body length is 138 to 164 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 to 6 @.@ 5 in ) . In Osgood 's original two specimens , an old female and an adult female , tail length is 188 and 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 4 and 7 @.@ 1 in ) , respectively ; hindfoot length is 30 and 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 and 1 @.@ 2 in ) ; and greatest skull length is 37 and 34 @.@ 7 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 and 1 @.@ 37 in ) . Eremoryzomys polius has 12 thoracic , 7 or 8 lumbar , and 35 or 36 caudal vertebrae ; the presence of 12 thoracic vertebrae is a putative synapomorphy of Oryzomyini . 
 = = = Skull = = = 
 In the skull , the rostrum ( front part ) is long and robust . The nasal bones are short , not extending further back than the lacrimals , and the premaxillaries extend about as far back as the nasals . The zygomatic notch , an extension at the front of the zygomatic plate , is present . The plate 's back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar . A strong jugal bone is present in the zygomatic arch ( cheekbone ) , so that the maxillary and squamosal bones , which form the front and back parts of the arch , respectively , do not overlap when seen from the side . The narrowest part of the interorbital region ( located between the eyes ) is to the front and the region 's margins exhibit strong beading . Various crests develop on the rounded braincase , especially in old animals . The parietal bones form part of the roof of the braincase and , unlike in some other rice rats , also extend to the sides of the braincase . The interparietal bone at the back of the braincase is narrow and wedge @-@ shaped , so that the parietal and occipital bones meet extensively . 
 The incisive foramina are very long , extending well between the molars . The posterolateral palatal pits are well @-@ developed and recessed into a fossa ( depression ) . The bony palate is relatively short , with the mesopterygoid fossa extending forward to the end of the molar row or even between the third molars . The roof of the fossa is perforated by large sphenopalatine vacuities . Usually , an alisphenoid strut is present ; this extension of the alisphenoid bone separates two foramina ( openings ) in the skull , the masticatory – buccinator foramen and the foramen ovale accessorium . The condition of various grooves and foramina of the skull indicates that the pattern of the arterial circulation of the head is derived . The subsquamosal fenestra , an opening at the back of the skull determined by the shape of the squamosal bone , is large and the mastoid bone is perforated by a fenestra ( opening ) . The squamosal lacks a suspensory process that contacts the tegmen tympani , the roof of the tympanic cavity , a defining character of oryzomyines . 
 In the mandible , the mental foramen , an opening in the mandible just before the first molar , opens to the outside , not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines . The upper and lower masseteric ridges , which anchor some of the chewing muscles , usually join into a single crest at a point below the first molar and do not extend forward beyond the molar . There is no distinct capsular process of the lower incisor , a trait Eremoryzomys shares with only a few other oryzomyines . 
 = = = Molars = = = 
 The molars are bunodont ( with the cusps higher than the connecting crests ) and brachydont ( low @-@ crowned ) . On the upper first and second molar , the outer and inner valleys between the cusps and crests do not interpenetrate . Many accessory crests are present , including the mesolophs and mesolophids . The anterocone and anteroconid , the front cusps on the upper and lower first molar , are not divided into smaller outer and inner cusps . Small accessory roots are absent from the molars , so that each of the three upper molars has two roots on the outer side and one on the inner side and each of the lower molars has one root at the front and one at the back . 
 = = Distribution and status = = 
 As far as now known , Eremoryzomys polius is confined to a small area in central Peru , at an altitude of 760 to 2 @,@ 100 m ( 2 @,@ 490 to 6 @,@ 890 ft ) , but the species may range more widely . It occurs in forest in the dry lowlands of the upper parts of the basin of the Marañón River , east of the main mountain range of the Andes . The biogeographical pattern indicated by the relationship between Eremoryzomys and the Brazilian Drymoreomys is unusual . While there are some similar cases of relationships between Andean and Atlantic Forest animals , these involve inhabitants of humid forests in the Andes ; Eremoryzomys , in contrast , lives in an arid area . Because E. polius is so poorly known , the 2008 IUCN Red List assesses it as " Data Deficient " . It is threatened by habitat destruction for cattle pasture and is not known from any protected areas . 
 = No Such Thing as Vampires = 
 " No Such Thing as Vampires " is the pilot episode of the American paranormal romance television drama Moonlight , which premiered on CBS on September 28 , 2007 in the United States . It was written by series creators / executive producers Trevor Munson and Ron Koslow , and directed by executive producer Rod Holcomb . The pilot introduces Mick St. John ( Alex O 'Loughlin ) , a private investigator who has been a vampire for over fifty years ; Beth Turner ( Sophia Myles ) , St. John 's love interest ; Josef Kostan ( Jason Dohring ) , St. John 's mentor and friend ; and Coraline Duvall ( Shannyn Sossamon ) , St. John 's ex @-@ wife and sire . 
 The series , originally titled Twilight , was commissioned by Warner Bros. Television as a presentation lasting 14 – 20 minutes . Alex O 'Loughlin , Shannon Lucio , Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were cast in the lead roles , and Rod Holcomb was hired as director . The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS for the 2007 – 2008 American television season . David Greenwalt joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Joel Silver ; however , health reasons forced Greenwalt to leave the series . All of the original actors save for the male lead role were recast in June 2007 , and Sophia Myles , Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them . With an almost entirely different cast , a retooled , full @-@ length pilot for television audiences was re @-@ shot . 
 Although received poorly by critics , the pilot managed to finish first among total viewers and adults 18 – 49 for its night . Many critics criticized the acting and the writing ; one said that it had the " worst writing of the new season " . A few found that even though the series did not seem great , it " had potential " . Jason Dohring 's performance was praised , and one critic wished that he had " a bit more screen time " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Mick St. John , a private investigator , dreams of being interviewed by a woman off @-@ camera , where he reveals that he is 90 years old , and that unlike other vampires , he has standards and does not hunt women , children or innocents . Mick 's job leads him to the scene of the murder of a young woman , where Beth , a reporter for the online newspaper BuzzWire , notices two large puncture wounds on the woman 's neck . While walking around the scene , she meets Mick and tells him he looks very familiar , but he insists that they do not know each other . Beth gives the murder article a vampire theme , using the puncture wounds as inspiration . The article makes Josef , a 400 @-@ year @-@ old vampire friend of Mick 's , concerned for the safety of vampires . To get more information on the murder , Mick goes to the morgue , where his friend Guillermo ( Jacob Vargas ) supplies him with blood . Mick does not detect any traces of vampire contact on the dead woman , eliminating them as her reason of death . Mick then comes across Beth at the dead woman 's apartment , where they find a necklace with a vial of blood inside . 
 Professor Ellis ( Rudolf Martin ) , a lecturer of the dead woman , gives a eulogy at her funeral . Chloe , a friend of the dead woman , attacks Ellis and slashes his neck , whose blood Mick recognizes as the blood in the vial . Beth tracks down Chloe , who explains that the professor has a vampire @-@ worshipping blood cult , and he believes that he is a vampire . Later , Mick finds Chloe 's dead body , who was murdered by Ellis . Knowing that Beth has gone to Ellis 's class , he rushes to save her . After the class , Beth talks to Ellis about vampires and the young woman 's murder , but he discovers that she is wearing a wire . Ellis attacks Beth and although she escapes , she is kidnapped by the professor 's teaching assistant . Mick tracks down the assistant , defeats him , and takes an unconscious Beth to his apartment . In flashbacks to 22 years in the past , Mick investigates the case of a missing girl . In a domestic fight between Mick and his ex @-@ wife Coraline over the kidnapped girl , Mick stabs Coraline 's heart with the leg of a broken chair . He lights the house on fire and rescues the girl , leaving Coraline to the fire . It is revealed that the little girl has grown up to be Beth , and that Mick has tried to watch over her and keep her safe over the years . In the present , Beth wakes up and remembers that Mick was stabbed by the assistant , and that he was the one who saved her as a child . Mick dismisses the claims as being caused by her head injury . Thanking him for saving her , she hugs him .

 Trevor Munson conceived the character of Mick Angel in 2004 and spent two and a half years writing a novel featuring the character . The story was adapted into a feature film script , and Bruce Willis was considered as a possibility for the lead role . The script was shown to Nina Tassler at CBS , who paired Munson with Ron Koslow , creator of Beauty and the Beast , to rewrite the script as a television series . The series was titled Twilight , and Koslow and Munson wrote the pilot , which Warner Bros. Television initially commissioned as a presentation lasting 14 – 20 minutes in January 2007 . Joel Silver and Gerard Bocaccio were hired to be executive producers on the project under the former 's production banner , Silver Pictures , in the same month . Alex O 'Loughlin and Shannon Lucio were cast in the presentation , and Rod Holcomb was hired as director . 
 The project was renamed Moonlight when picked up by CBS on May 14 , 2007 , prior the upfronts . David Greenwalt , creator of Miracles and co @-@ creator of Angel , joined the staff in May 2007 as showrunner and executive producer alongside Silver . CBS hired Greenwalt during the pilot process to restructure the original concept by Koslow and Munson , however health reasons forced him to leave the series , and Chip Johannessen took over showrunner duties in August 2007 . All of the original actors save for the lead role of Mick St. John were recast in June 2007 : Shannon Lucio , Rade Šerbedžija and Amber Valletta were originally cast in the roles of Beth Turner , Josef Kostan and Coraline Duvall respectively before Sophia Myles , Jason Dohring and Shannyn Sossamon replaced them . With an almost entirely different cast , a retooled , full @-@ length pilot for television audiences was re @-@ shot . To promote the series , Silver , along with the rest of the main cast , attended the Comic @-@ Con International in San Diego on July 27 , 2007 , where the show was featured . 
 Joel Silver approached Dohring " out of the blue and said , ' There 's a role , and I 'm making it younger ' " . Dohring read two pages of script featuring Josef , and was interested by the character 's " dark " and " sharp " personality . Dohring had to go through the normal audition process and was not sure if he would have gotten the role without Silver , who had " pushed it all the way through to the end " . Munson explained that the goal of the casting changes was " to lighten the show up a bit " . He believed the changes granted the studio 's and network 's wish to " make it a little younger and hipper " . O <unk> felt that the whole cast 's becoming " a little bit younger " especially effected the character Josef , as the originally chosen actor , Šerbedžija , was twice Jason Dohring 's age . The creators and the network were concerned that Josef , whose relationship with Mick was important , would appear as more of a " father figure " rather than as a friend . O <unk> supported the recasting of Josef with a younger actor due to the resulting " level of ease in that age difference " .

 " No Such Thing as Vampires " finished first among total viewers and adults 18 – 49 for its night . It was seen by 8 @.@ 54 million American viewers , and received a 5 @.@ 7 household rating and a 10 % share of all televisions in use . The critical responses to the pilot were overall unfavorable . Several critics compared it detrimentally with the television series Angel , as well as other vampire related media , including Forever Knight , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Blood Ties , The Night Stalker , Dark Shadows and the works of Anne Rice . Tim Goodman of The San Francisco Chronicle considered it as a " flat @-@ out awful " pilot of what " may well be the worst new fall show " . Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette described the pilot as " a weak , generic private @-@ eye drama with a vampire story overlay " , and Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe felt that it came close to a " full @-@ on nightmare " . 
 The writing of the pilot was criticized as " ponderous " , and having " familiar , conventional plots " . One critic claimed it did not offer much " to inspire an actor " , while another thought it had the " worst writing of the new season " . The dialogue was described as " groan @-@ inducing " . Tom Shales of The Washington Post criticized the series creators ' decision to make St. John a private investigator , and felt that they " appear eager to avoid what makes their show unique " . Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times saw promise in the series , but remarked it got " lost between concept and execution , and instead of suspense we get silliness , as if the creators were determined to use only the clichés of both genres " . The acting of the pilot was criticized as " sub @-@ par " and " woeful " . Robert Bianco of USA Today felt that Moonlight had a " less adept cast " than Angel . Matthew Gilbert of the Boston Globe depreciated the chemistry between O 'Loughlin and Myles as " artificial " , and said that they " exchange lines of dialogue with a stilted rhythm and no natural flow " . O 'Loughlin was described as a " <unk> " , and " passable in the lead role " , while Sossamon 's appearance was said to be " preposterously not @-@ scary " . Travis Fickett of IGN praised the actors , however , and felt that O 'Loughlin did " a decent job " , and that Myles was " perhaps the most promising aspect of the show " . Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune commended Myles as " reasonably good " . 
 Not all reviews , however , were negative . Sarah Stegall of SF Scope gave the pilot a decent review , and said that if Moonlight could survive " the Friday night time slot " and the " thwarted expectations of [ vampire ] fans who were expecting Blade " , she thought it would " rock " . Kara Howland of TV Guide gave the pilot a positive review , and thought it was a " solid start " . Several critics praised Jason Dohring 's portrayal of Josef . One said that he gave the pilot " a small burst of energy " , while another said that he made it " crackle with a bit of wit " . Dohring was described as " a welcome presence " , and one critic wished for " a bit more screen time " . Travis Fickett of IGN praised the action scenes , and noted that " once the action gets started , it plays well " . 
 = Bikini = 
 A bikini is a two @-@ piece swimsuit with a bra top and underwear . Bikini bottoms can range from full pelvic coverage to a thong or G @-@ string . 
 The name for the bikini design was coined in 1946 by Parisian engineer Louis Réard , the designer of the bikini . He named the swimsuit after Bikini Atoll , where testing on the atomic bomb was taking place . Fashion designer Jacques Heim , also from Paris , re @-@ released a similar design earlier that same year , the Atome . 
 More revealing than a one @-@ piece swimsuit , the bikini was slow to be adopted , and in many countries it was banned from beaches and public places . The Vatican declared it sinful . While still considered risqué , the bikini gradually became a part of popular culture when film stars — Brigitte Bardot , Raquel Welch , Ursula Andress and others — began wearing them on public beaches and in film . 
 The bikini design had become common in Western countries by the mid @-@ 1960s as beachwear , swimwear and underwear . By the late 20th century it had also become common as sportswear , particularly in sports such as beach volleyball and bodybuilding . By the early 2000s bikinis had become a US $ 811 million business annually , and boosted spin @-@ off services such as bikini waxing and sun tanning . 
 = = Etymology and terminology = = 
 While the two @-@ piece swimsuit as a design existed in classical antiquity , the modern design first attracted public notice in Paris on July 5 , 1946 . French mechanical engineer Louis Réard introduced a design he named the " bikini " , taking the name from the Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean , which is Marshallese for coconut place . Four days earlier , the United States had initiated its first peace @-@ time nuclear weapons test at Bikini Atoll as part of Operation Crossroads . Réard hoped his swimsuit 's revealing style would create an " explosive commercial and cultural reaction " similar to the explosion at Bikini Atoll . 
 By making an inappropriate analogy with words like bilingual and bilateral containing the Latin prefix " <unk> " ( meaning " two " in Latin ) , the word bikini was first back @-@ derived as consisting of two parts , [ bi + <unk> ] by Rudi Gernreich , who introduced the monokini in 1964 . Later swimsuit designs like the tankini and <unk> further cemented this false assumption . Over time the " – <unk> family " ( as dubbed by author William Safire ) , including the " – ini sisters " ( as dubbed by designer Anne Cole ) , expanded into a variety of swimwear , often with an innovative lexicon , including the monokini ( also <unk> or <unk> ) , <unk> , tankini , <unk> , <unk> ( also <unk> ) , <unk> , and <unk> . The Language Report , compiled by lexicographer Susie Dent and published by the Oxford University Press ( <unk> ) in 2003 , considers lexicographic inventions like bandeaukini and <unk> , two variants of the tankini , important to observe . Although " bikini " was originally a registered trademark of Réard , it has since become genericized . 
 Variations of the term are used to describe stylistic variations for promotional purposes and industry classifications , including monokini , <unk> , tankini , <unk> , <unk> , bandeaukini and <unk> . A man 's brief swimsuit may also be referred to as a bikini . Similarly , a variety of men 's and women 's underwear types are described as bikini underwear .

 Archaeologist James <unk> described the earliest bikini @-@ like costume in Çatalhöyük , Anatolia in the Chalcolithic era ( around 5600 BC ) , where a mother goddess is depicted astride two leopards wearing a costume somewhat like a bikini . The two @-@ piece swimsuit can be traced back to the Greco @-@ Roman world , where bikini @-@ like garments worn by women athletes are depicted on urns and paintings dating back to 1400 BC . 
 In Coronation of the Winner , a mosaic in the floor of a Roman villa in Sicily that dates from the Diocletian period ( 286 – 305 AD ) , young women participate in weightlifting , discus throwing , and running ball games dressed in bikini @-@ like garments ( technically <unk> in modern lexicon ) . The mosaic , found in the Sicilian Villa Romana del Casale , features ten maidens who have been anachronistically dubbed the " Bikini Girls " . Other Roman archaeological finds depict the goddess Venus in a similar garment . In Pompeii , depictions of Venus wearing a bikini were discovered in the Casa della Venere , in the <unk> of the House of Julia Felix , and in an atrium garden of Via Dell <unk> .

 Swimming or bathing outdoors was discouraged in the Christian West , so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century . The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle @-@ length full @-@ sleeve chemise @-@ type gown made of wool or flannel that retained coverage and modesty . 
 In 1907 , Australian swimmer and performer Annette Kellerman was arrested on a Boston beach for wearing form @-@ fitting sleeveless one @-@ piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe , a costume she adopted from England , although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910 . In 1913 , designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two @-@ piece swimwear . Inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming he designed a close @-@ fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , people began to shift from " taking in the water " to " taking in the sun " , at bathhouses and spas , and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features . Rayon was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight @-@ fitting swimsuits , but its durability , especially when wet , proved problematic . Jersey and silk were also sometimes used . By the 1930s , manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back , removed sleeves , and tightened the sides . With the development of new clothing materials , particularly latex and nylon , swimsuits gradually began hugging the body through the 1930s , with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning . 
 Women 's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of midriff exposure . Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff @-@ baring suits and tops . However , midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public . Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like Neptune 's Daughter in which Esther Williams wore provocatively named costumes such as " Double Entendre " and " Honey Child " . 
 Wartime production during World War II required vast amounts of cotton , silk , nylon , wool , leather , and rubber . In 1942 , the United States War Production Board issued Regulation L @-@ 85 , cutting the use of natural fibers in clothing and mandating a 10 % reduction in the amount of fabric in women 's beachwear . To comply with the regulations , swimsuit manufacturers removed skirt panels and other attachments , while increasing production of the two @-@ piece swimsuit with bare midriffs . At the same time , demand for all swimwear declined as there was not much interest in going to the beach , especially in Europe . 
 = = = Modern bikini = = = 
 With the fabric shortage still in place and in an endeavour to resurrect swimwear sales , two French designers – Jacques Heim and Louis Réard – almost simultaneously launched their new two @-@ piece swimsuit ranges in 1946 . Heim launched his two @-@ piece swimsuit in Paris which he called the atome , after the smallest known particle of matter . He advertised the Atome as the world 's " smallest bathing suit " . At about the same time , Louis Réard created a competing two @-@ piece swimsuit design , which he called the bikini . 
 Although briefer than the two @-@ piece swimsuits of the 1930s , the bottom of Heim 's new two @-@ piece beach costume still covered the wearer 's navel . Réard 's bikini undercut Heim 's atome in its brevity . His initial design consisted of a bra and two triangular pieces of newspaper @-@ type print fabric connected by strips of material . He sliced the top off Heim 's bottoms . The Bikini , with a total area of 30 square inches ( 200 cm2 ) of cloth , was advertised as " smaller than the smallest swimsuit " . When he was unable to find a model willing to showcase his revealing design , Réard hired Micheline Bernardini , a 19 @-@ year old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris . Bernardini received 50 @,@ 000 fan letters , many of them from men . 
 Réard said that " like the [ atom ] bomb , the bikini is small and devastating " . Fashion writer Diana Vreeland described the bikini as the " atom bomb of fashion " . In advertisements he declared the swimsuit could not be a genuine bikini " unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring . " French newspaper Le Figaro wrote , " People were craving the simple pleasures of the sea and the sun . For women , wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation . There was really nothing sexual about this . It was instead a celebration of freedom and a return to the joys in life . " 
 Heim 's atome was more attuned to the sense of propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard 's design but Réard 's was the design that won the public 's imagination over time . Though Heim 's design was the first worn on the beach and sold more swimsuits , it was Réard 's description of the two @-@ piece swimsuit as a bikini that stuck . Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey . 
 = = = Social resistance = = = 
 Despite the garment 's initial success in France , worldwide women still stuck to traditional one @-@ piece swimsuits , and , his sales stalling , Réard went back to designing and selling orthodox knickers . In 1950 , American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole , owner of mass market swimwear firm Cole of California , told Time that he had " little but scorn for France 's famed Bikinis . " Réard himself would later describe it as a " two @-@ piece bathing suit which reveals everything about a girl except for her mother 's maiden name . " Fashion magazine Modern Girl Magazine in 1957 stated that " it is hardly necessary to waste words over the so @-@ called bikini since it is inconceivable that any girl with tact and decency would ever wear such a thing " . 
 In 1951 , Eric Morley organized the Festival Bikini Contest , a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year 's Festival of Britain . The press , welcoming the spectacle , referred to it as Miss World , a name Morley registered as a trademark . The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden , who was crowned in a bikini . After the crowning , Håkansson was condemned by the Pope , while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant . In 1952 , bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns . As a result of the controversy , the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide . Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women , they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body . 
 The bikini was banned on the French Atlantic coastline , Spain , Italy , Portugal and Australia , and was prohibited or discouraged in a number of US states . The United States Motion Picture Production Code , also known as the Hays Code , enforced from 1934 , allowed two @-@ piece gowns but prohibited the display of navels in Hollywood films . The National Legion of Decency , a Roman Catholic body guarding over American media content , also pressured Hollywood and foreign film producers to keep bikinis from being featured in Hollywood movies . As late as 1959 , Anne Cole , one of the United States ' largest swimsuit designers , said , " It 's nothing more than a G @-@ string . It 's at the razor 's edge of decency . " The Hays Code was abandoned by the mid @-@ 1960s , and with it the prohibition of female navel exposure , as well as other restrictions . The influence of the National Legion of Decency also waned by the 1960s .

 Increasingly common glamour shots of popular actresses and models on either side of the Atlantic played a large part in bringing the bikini into the mainstream . During the 1950s , Hollywood stars such as Ava Gardner , Rita Hayworth , Lana Turner , Elizabeth Taylor , Tina Louise , Marilyn Monroe , Esther Williams , and Betty Grable took advantage of the risqué publicity associated with the bikini by posing for photographs wearing them — pin @-@ ups of Hayworth and Williams in costume were especially widely distributed in the United States . In 1950 , Elvira <unk> walked at the Rio Carnival , Brazil in a golden bikini , starting the bikini tradition of the carnival . 
 In Europe , 17 @-@ year @-@ old Brigitte Bardot wore scanty bikinis ( by contemporary standards ) in the French film Manina , la fille sans voiles ( " Manina , the girl unveiled " ) . The promotion for the film , released in France in March 1953 , drew more attention to Bardot 's bikinis than to the film itself . By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re @-@ titled Manina , the Girl in the Bikini . Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival . Working with her husband and agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France . 
 Similar photographs were taken of Anita Ekberg and Sophia Loren , among others . According to The Guardian , Bardot 's photographs in particular turned Saint @-@ Tropez into the beachwear capital of the world , with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty . Bardot 's photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival , and Cannes in turn played a crucial role in her career . 
 Brian Hyland 's novelty @-@ song hit " Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini " became a Billboard No. 1 hit during the summer of 1960 : the song tells a story about a young girl who is too shy to wear her new bikini on the beach , thinking it too risqué . Playboy first featured a bikini on its cover in 1962 ; the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue debut two years later featured Babette March in a white bikini on the cover . 
 Ursula Andress , appearing as Honey Rider in the 1962 British James Bond film , Dr. No , wore a white bikini , which became known as the " Dr. No bikini " . It became one of the most famous bikinis of all time and an iconic moment in cinematic and fashion history . Andress said that she owed her career to that white bikini , remarking , " This bikini made me into a success . As a result of starring in Dr. No as the first Bond girl , I was given the freedom to take my pick of future roles and to become financially independent . " 
 The bikini finally caught on , and by 1963 , the movie Beach Party , starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon , led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop @-@ culture symbol , though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard 's bikini unlike the other young females in the films . In 1965 , a woman told Time that it was " almost square " not to wear a bikini ; the magazine wrote two years later that " 65 % of the young set had already gone over " . Raquel Welch 's deer skin bikini in One Million Years B.C. , advertised as " mankind 's first bikini " , ( 1966 ) was later described as a " definitive look of the 1960s " . Her role wearing the leather bikini raised Welch to a fashion icon and the photo of her in the bikini became a best @-@ selling pinup poster . 
 Stretch nylon bikini briefs and bras complemented the adolescent boutique fashions of the 1960s , allowing those to be minimal . DuPont introduced lycra ( DuPont 's name for spandex ) in the same decade . Spandex expanded the range of novelty fabrics available to designers which meant suits could be made to fit like a second skin without heavy linings . " The advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini , " wrote Kelly Killoren Bensimon , a former model and author of The Bikini Book , " It didn 't sag , it didn 't bag , and it concealed and revealed . It wasn 't so much like lingerie anymore . " Increased reliance on stretch fabric led to simplified construction . It allowed designers to create the string bikini , and allowed Rudi Gernreich to create the topless monokini . Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet , leather , and crocheted squares surfaced in the early ' 70s .

 Réard 's company folded in 1988 , four years after his death . By the end of the century , the bikini had become the most popular beachwear around the globe . According to French fashion historian Olivier Saillard , this was due to " the power of women , and not the power of fashion " . As he explains , " The emancipation of swimwear has always been linked to the emancipation of women " , though one survey indicates 85 % of all bikinis never touch the water . By 1988 the bikini made up nearly 20 % of swimsuit sales , more than any other model in the US , though one @-@ piece suits made a comeback during the 1980s and early 1990s . 
 In 1997 , Miss Maryland Jamie Fox became the first contestant in 50 years to compete in a two @-@ piece swimsuit at the Miss America Pageant . Actresses in action films like Blue Crush ( 2002 ) and Charlie 's Angels : Full Throttle ( 2003 ) made the two @-@ piece " the millennial equivalent of the power suit " , according to Gina Bellafonte of The New York Times , 
 According to Beth <unk> Charleston , research associate at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , " The bikini represents a social leap involving body consciousness , moral concerns , and sexual attitudes . " By the early 2000s , bikinis had become a $ 811 million business annually , according to the NPD Group , a consumer and retail information company , and had boosted spin @-@ off services like bikini waxing and the sun tanning industries .

 The 1967 film An Evening in Paris is mostly remembered because it featured Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore as the first Indian actress to wear a bikini on film . She also posed in a bikini for the glossy Filmfare magazine . The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience , but it also set in motion a trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna ( 1973 ) and <unk> ( 1980 ) , Dimple Kapadia in Bobby ( 1973 ) , and Parveen Babi in Yeh <unk> ( 1982 ) . 
 Indian women wear bikinis when they vacation abroad or in Goa without the family . Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India , bikinis have become more popular . In summer , when women take up swimming , often in a public space , a lot of <unk> , shorts and single @-@ piece swimsuits are sold . The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter , the honeymoon season .

 While the name " bikini " was at first applied only to beachwear that revealed the wearer 's navel , today the fashion industry considers any two @-@ piece swimsuit a bikini . Modern bikini fashions are characterized by a simple , brief design : two triangles of fabric that form a bra and cover the woman 's breasts and a third that forms a panty cut below the navel that covers the groin and the buttocks . 
 Bikinis can and have been made out of almost every possible clothing material , and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are an essential element of their design . Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey . DuPont 's introduction of Lycra ( spandex ) in the 1960s completely changed how bikinis were designed and worn , as according to Kelly Killoren Bensimon , a former model and author of The Bikini Book , " the advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini ... it didn 't sag , it didn 't bag , and it concealed and revealed .

 Bikinis have become a major component of marketing various women 's sports . It is an official uniform for beach volleyball and is widely worn in athletics and other sports . Sports bikinis have gained popularity since the 1990s . However , the trend has raised some criticism as an attempt to sell sex . Female swimmers do not normally wear bikinis in competitive swimming . The International Swimming Federation ( FINA ) voted to prohibit female swimmers from racing in bikinis in its meeting at Rome in 1960 .

 In 1994 , the bikini became the official uniform of women 's Olympic beach volleyball . In 1999 , the International Volleyball Federation ( FIVB ) standardized beach volleyball uniforms , with the bikini becoming the required uniform for women . That regulation bottom is called a " bun @-@ hugger " , and players names are often written on the back of the bottom . 
 The uniform made its Olympic debut at Sydney 's Bondi Beach in the 2000 Summer Olympics amid some criticism . It was the fifth largest television audience of all the sports at the 2000 Games . Much of the interest was because of the sex appeal of bikini @-@ clad players along with their athletic ability . Bikini @-@ clad dancers and cheerleaders entertain the audience during match breaks in many beach volleyball tournaments , including the Olympics . Even indoor volleyball costumes followed suit to become smaller and tighter . 
 However , the FIVB 's mandating of the bikini ran into problems . Some sports officials consider it exploitative and impractical in colder weather . It also drew the ire of some athletes . At the 2006 Asian Games at Doha , Qatar , only one Muslim country – Iraq – fielded a team in the beach volleyball competition because of concerns that the uniform was inappropriate . They refused to wear bikinis . The weather during the evening games in 2012 London Olympics was so cold that the players sometimes had to wear shirts and leggings . Earlier in 2012 , FIVB had announced it would allow shorts ( maximum length 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) above the knee ) and sleeved tops at the games . Richard Baker , the federation spokesperson , said that " many of these countries have religious and cultural requirements so the uniform needed to be more flexible " . 
 The bikini remains preferred by most players and corporate sponsors . Competitors Natalie Cook and Holly McPeak support the bikini as a practical uniform for a sport played on sand during the heat of summer . Olympic gold medal winner Kerry Walsh said , " I love our uniforms . " According to fellow gold medalist Misty May @-@ Treanor and Walsh it does not restrict movement . 
 A feminist viewpoint sees the bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes . US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant " yanking and fiddling . " Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over @-@ straining the abdominal muscles while many others have gone through augmentation <unk> to look appealing in their uniforms . Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that " it 's kind of disrespectful to the female players . I 'm sure the male spectators love it , but I find it a little bit offensive . " 
 Sports journalism expert Dr. Kimberly Bissell conducted a study on the camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games . Bissell found that 20 % of the camera angles were focused on the women 's chests , and 17 % on their buttocks . Bissell theorized that the appearance of the players draws fans attention more than their actual athleticism . Sports commentator Jeanne <unk> commented , " Beach volleyball has now joined go @-@ go girl dancing as perhaps the only two professions where a bikini is the required uniform . " British Olympian Denise Johns argues that the regulation uniform is intended to be " sexy " and to attract attention . Rubén Acosta , president of the FIVB , says that it makes the game more appealing to spectators .

 From the 1950s to mid @-@ 1970s , men 's contest formats were often supplemented with women 's beauty contests or bikini shows . The winners earned titles like Miss Body Beautiful , Miss Physical Fitness and Miss Americana , and also presented trophies to the winners of the men 's contest . In the 1980s , the Ms Olympia competition started in the USA and in the UK the <unk> ( National Amateur Body Building Association ) renamed Miss Bikini International to Ms Universe . In 1986 , the Ms Universe competition was divided into two sections – " physique " ( for a more muscular physique ) and " figure " ( traditional feminine presentation in high heels ) . In November 2010 the <unk> ( International Federation of <unk> & Fitness ) introduced a women 's bikini contest for women who do not wish to build their muscles to figure competition levels . 
 Costumes are regulation " posing trunks " ( bikini briefs ) for both men and women . Female bodybuilders in America are prohibited from wearing thongs or T @-@ back swimsuits in contests filmed for television , though they are allowed to do so by certain fitness organizations in closed events . For men , the dress code specifies " swim trunks only ( no shorts , cut @-@ off pants , or <unk> ) . "

 Women in athletics often wear bikinis of similar size as those worn in beach volleyball .

In the 2007 South Pacific Games , the rules were adjusted to allow players to wear less revealing shorts and cropped sports tops instead of bikinis . At the West Asian Games in 2006 , organizers banned bikini @-@ bottoms for female athletes and asked them to wear long shorts . 
 String bikinis and other revealing clothes are common in surfing , though most surfing bikinis are more robust with more coverage than sunning bikinis . Surfing Magazine printed a pictorial of <unk> <unk> , Playboy Playmate March 1981 , surfing in a revealing bikini , and eventually started its annual bikini issue . The Association of Surfing Professionals often pairs female surf meets with bikini contests , an issue that divides the female pro @-@ surfing community into two parts . It has often been more profitable to win the bikini contest than the female surfing event .

 In 1950 , American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole , owner of Cole of California , told Time that bikinis were designed for " diminutive Gallic women " , as because " French girls have short legs ... swimsuits have to be hiked up at the sides to make their legs look longer . " In 1961 , The New York Times reported the opinion that the bikini is permissible for people are not " too fat or too thin " . In the 1960s etiquette writer Emily Post decreed that " [ A bikini ] is for perfect figures only , and for the very young . " In The Bikini Book by Kelly Killoren Bensimon , swimwear designer Norma Kamali says , " Anyone with a tummy " should not wear a bikini . Since then , a number of bikini designers including Malia Mills have encouraged women of all ages and body types to take up the style . The 1970s saw the rise of the lean ideal of female body and figures like Cheryl Tiegs . Her figure remained in vogue in the 21st century . 
 The fitness boom of the 1980s led to one of the biggest leaps in the evolution of the bikini . According to Mills , " The leg line became <unk> , the front was <unk> , and the straps were <unk> . " Women 's magazines used terms like " Bikini Belly " , and workout programs were launched to develop a " bikini @-@ worthy body " . The tiny " fitness @-@ bikinis " made of lycra were launched to cater to this <unk> ideal . Movies like Blue Crush and TV reality shows like Surf Girls have merged the concepts of bikini models and athletes together , further accentuating the toned body ideal . 
 One survey commissioned by Diet Chef , a UK home delivery service , reported by Daily Mail and The Today Show and ridiculed by More magazine , showed that women should stop wearing bikinis by the age of 47 . Yearly Spring Break festivities , which mark the start of the bikini season in North America , trigger many with eating disorders because of the over @-@ promotion of the bikini body ideal . 
 In 1993 , Suzy Menkes , then Fashion Editor of the International Herald Tribune , suggested that women had begun to " revolt " against the " body ideal " and bikini " exposure . " She wrote , " Significantly , on the beaches as on the streets , some of the youngest and prettiest women ( who were once the only ones who dared to bare ) seem to have decided that exposure is over . " Nevertheless , professional beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece , who competes in a bikini , claims that " confidence " alone can make a bikini sexy . 
 = = Bikini underwear = = 
 Certain types of underwear are described as bikini underwear and designed for men and women . For women , bikini or bikini @-@ style underwear is underwear that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini . It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional underwear , panties or knickers , especially suited to clothing such as crop tops . For men , bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men 's regular briefs . Men 's bikini briefs can be low- or high @-@ side that are usually lower than true waist , often at hips , and usually have no access pouch or flap , legs bands at tops of thighs . String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband , with no fabric on the side of the legs . 
 Swimwear and underwear have similar design considerations , both being form @-@ fitting garments . The main difference is that , unlike underwear , swimwear is open to public view . The swimsuit was , and is , following underwear styles , and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change , underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal , <unk> design that emphasized comfort first . 
 = = = History = = = 
 As the swimsuit was evolving , the underwear started to change . Between 1900 and 1940 , swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs . In the 1920s women started discarding the corset , while the <unk> company of Paris started developing something they called the " breast girdle " . During the Great Depression , panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various <unk> yarns making underwear fit like a second skin . By 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe . Although the waistband was still above the navel , the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint . The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties for the rest of the century . Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935 . The first underwire bra was developed in 1938 . Beginning in the late thirties <unk> , a type of <unk> men 's briefs , were introduced , featuring very high @-@ cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband . Howard Hughes designed the push @-@ up bra worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943 . In 1950 <unk> introduced the first official bust enhancing bra . 
 By the 1960s , the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants . In the seventies , with the emergence of skintight jeans , thong versions of the panty became mainstream , since the open , stringed back eliminated any tell @-@ tale panty lines across the rear and hips . By the 1980s the design of the French @-@ cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high ( French Cut panties come up to the waist , has a high cut leg , and usually are full in the rear ) . As with the bra and other type of lingerie , manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure . From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise . The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein , particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts . Male bodies and men 's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption , and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness . Over time , swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high @-@ tech skin @-@ tight garments , eventually cross @-@ breeding with sportswear , underwear and exercise wear , resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s . 
 = = Men 's bikini = = 
 The term men 's bikini is sometimes used to describe swim briefs . Men 's bikinis can have high or low side panels , and string sides or tie sides . Most lack a button or flap front . Unlike swim briefs , bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband . Suits less than 1 @.@ 5 inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation , fashion , and sun tanning . The posing brief standard to bodybuilding competitions is an example of this style . Male punk rock musicians have performed on the stage wearing women 's bikini briefs . Former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott was a fitness fanatic noted for wearing " <unk> " or " budgie smugglers " . The 2000 Bollywood film Hera <unk> shows men sunbathing in bikinis , who were mistakenly believed to be women from a distance . 
 <unk> shown in men 's wear collections by Giorgio Armani , Dolce & Gabbana and Paul Smith have tended to be throwbacks to the designs of the 1930s and ' 40s . Gianni Versace 's ads contain heroic depictions of Miami bathers . The Greek designer Nikos <unk> makes his bathing suits ( for both sexes , but with the focus on the male ) anatomical creations , cut and stitched to outline the body . Male bikini tops , a visual gag , also exist . A <unk> is a type of sling swimsuit worn by men . The term is inspired by the word bikini . It was popularized by Sacha Baron Cohen when he donned one in the film Borat .

 Bikini waxing is the <unk> of pubic hair beyond the bikini line by use of waxing . The bikini line delineates the part of the pubic area covered by a swimsuit bottom . In the context of waxing , it is generally understood to describe any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit .

 The tan lines created by the wearing of a bikini while tanning are known as a bikini tan .

 As bikinis leave most of the body exposed to potentially dangerous UV radiation , overexposure can cause sunburn , skin cancer , as well as other acute and chronic health effects on the skin , eyes , and immune system . As a result , medical organizations recommend that bikini wearers protect themselves from UV radiation by using broad @-@ spectrum sunscreen , which has been shown to protect against sunburn , skin cancer , wrinkling and sagging skin .

 Solomon Creek is a tributary of the Susquehanna River in Luzerne County , Pennsylvania , in the United States . It is approximately 8 @.@ 8 miles ( 14 @.@ 2 km ) long and flows through Fairview Township , Hanover Township , and Wilkes @-@ Barre . The creek is affected by acid mine drainage and has significant loads of iron , aluminum , and manganese . The creek 's named tributaries are Spring Run , Sugar Notch Run , and Pine Creek . The Solomon Creek watershed is located in the Anthracite Valley section of the ridge @-@ and @-@ valley geographical province . Major rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation , the Spechty Kopf Formation , and the Catskill Formation . 
 Solomon Creek was first settled by Native Americans around 8000 to 6000 B.C.E. A settler arrived at the confluence of the creek with the Susquehanna River by 1774 . In the 1800s , more people began arriving in the watershed to exploit its natural resources . Anthracite mining was especially prevalent in the watershed in the 19th and 20th centuries , to the point that numerous streams were altered or destroyed and the Laurel Run mine fire started . 
 Solomon Creek was devoid of fish in the 1970s . However , since then several fish species , including brook trout , have inhabited the creek and its tributaries . A number of varieties of aquatic insects are also present .

 Solomon Creek starts on western Penobscot Mountain in northern Fairview Township and flows west down the mountain for a short distance before turning northwards , paralleling Pennsylvania Route 309 and briefly Pennsylvania Route 437 . The creek then enters Hanover Township . It picks up Pine Creek and cuts a gap through Wilkes @-@ Barre Mountain and then through Ashley . Upon leaving Ashley , it heads into Wilkes @-@ Barre , picking up Sugar Notch Run and Spring Run .

Spring Run is an intermittent stream . There are two other ephemeral tributaries that are not officially named , but are known locally as Sulfur Run and the Lee Park tributary . 
 Historically , Solomon Creek had at least seven tributaries , including one named Buttonwood Creek . However , several tributaries largely disappeared by the late 1890s due to mining in the watershed .

 There are six locations in the Solomon Creek watershed where mine drainage is discharged . Ten miles ( sixteen kilometers ) of the streams on the creek 's watershed are rendered devoid of life by mine drainage . 
 According to Robert Hughes , the Eastern Pennsylvania Coalition for Abandoned Mine Reclamation 's executive director , the water level of Solomon Creek has risen since the middle of the 19th century .

 There are 14 coal seams in the Solomon Creek watershed . The deepest seam is the Bottom Red Ash . Other seams included the Middle Red Ash , the Top Red Ash , the Checker Bed , the Pittston Bed , the Ross Bed , the Skidmore Bed , the Kidney Bed , the Snake Island Bed , the Hillman Bed , and the Abbott Bed . There are also three numbered beds called the # 2 , # 3 , and # 4 beds . Historically , parts of the seams were within 50 feet ( 15 m ) of the surface , but they were completely mined . Areas along the banks of the creek are covered in coal ash , coal silt , sand , and gravel . There are gravel bars and point bars in the lower reaches of the creek . The lower reaches of Solomon Creek have a 0 @.@ 2 % grade . 
 In the Solomon Gap , there are piles coal ash that is pink and orange due to oxidation . These piles rise as high as 60 feet ( 18 m ) to 100 feet ( 30 m ) . Similarly @-@ colored coal is found in sediment and gravel bars in the creek .

 = = History = = 
 Native Americans settled in the Solomon Creek watershed by approximately 8000 B.C. to 6000 B.C. Ebenezer Hibbard was an early European settler on the creek , living there by 1772 . The creek is named after a person with the surname of Solomon , who settled at the mouth of the creek in 1774 . In the early 1800s , Europeans first realized the natural resources of the watershed . In the early 1800s , there was a tavern called Inman 's Tavern and several cabins in the Solomon Gap . In the mid @-@ 1800s , the population of the watershed increased significantly due to coal mining and timbering opportunities . The first road in Fairview Township , the Wilkes @-@ Barre and Hazleton Turnpike , started at Solomon Creek . 
 There are waterfalls called Solomon 's Falls on Solomon Creek . They were called a " beautiful cascade " by Philadelphia 's Portfolio in 1809 , although a 1909 book stated that the waterfalls were no longer " picturesque " or " delightful " . The falls were between 50 feet ( 15 m ) and 60 feet ( 18 m ) . 
 In 1809 , Richard and Israel Inman constructed a gristmill at the foot of Solomon 's Falls . It was converted to a house in 1833 and destroyed in 1850 . A gristmill on the creek in Hanover Township had been built by 1812 and was run by George <unk> . It was destroyed in 1840 . In 1845 , William Petty constructed the gristmill called Petty Mill in Hanover Township . This mill burned down in 1887 . The Wyoming Division Canal , which was constructed in the 1830s , started at Solomon Creek . Construction of the Ashley Planes in the Solomon Creek gap began in 1837 . They were used until 1848 . An iron @-@ producing forge operated on the creek in Ashley until 1839 . There was also a sawmill on it until 1839 . A powder mill operated on Solomon Creek , but was replaced with a brewery by 1885 . A slaughterhouse discharged its waste into the creek in the early 20th century . The creek was used as the water supply for the Huber Breaker from the 1930s to the 1970s . The Wilkes @-@ Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Solomon Creek . 
 Mining has been done in the Solomon Creek watershed in the past , causing considerable environmental damage . The mining began in the beginning of the 1800s and continued until the 1970s . However , there was one strip mining permit in the watershed in the late 1990s . Starting in 1967 , the mine pools under the creek stopped having water pumped out of them . This led to them flooding and damaging buildings in the watershed in 1972 during Hurricane Agnes . To remedy the problem of the flooding , the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes @-@ Barre Boreholes were created . The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation <unk> . A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed , although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining . A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012 . 
 A mine fire known as the Laurel Run mine fire started burning in the watershed of Solomon Creek since 1915 , when a miner accidentally left a carbide lamp hanging from a timber support in the Red Ash Coal Mine . The lamp caused the support to catch fire . The fire may continue into the 22nd century . The fire was contained in 1973 , but was not extinguished . Had the fire not been contained , it would have eventually spread under the entirety of the Wyoming Valley . The fire burns between 200 feet ( 61 m ) and 300 feet ( 91 m ) underground at a temperature of approximately 1 @,@ 000 ° F ( 538 ° C ) . 
 The creek flooded in September 1850 . It was the most severe flood of the creek up to that time . In January 1996 , 400 buildings along Solomon Creek flooded by it due to melting snow . This was one of numerous floods on that area of the creek .

 In 1975 , a study found no fish species on the creek . However , brook trout have been observed at seven locations on Solomon Creek . Brook trout are especially common on the tributary Sugar Notch Run . Trout reproduce everywhere in the tributary Pine Creek and reproduce in the main stem as far downstream as southern Wilkes @-@ Barre . Above of the South Wilkes @-@ Barre borehole , a number of other fish species have been observed . These include blacknose dace , bluegill , creek chub , fallfish , minnows , northern hog sucker , and white sucker . However , there are no species of fish downstream of the borehole . Out of 46 sites on the creek , 30 had sufficient macroinvertebrate concentrations to support trout . 2 @.@ 6 stream miles in the watershed are home to brook trout fisheries . This area is in Hanover Township , Laurel Run , and Bear Creek Township . 
 The most common aquatic insects at the headwaters of unimpaired streams in the watershed of Solomon Creek are <unk> , caddis flies , dragonflies , mayflies , and stoneflies . Three sites in the watershed are considered " suboptimal " according to the <unk> system . 20 sites are considered " marginal " and the remainder are " poor " .

 After Madonna gave birth to her daughter Lourdes , in 1996 , she enrolled in Kabbalah and started studying Hinduism and yoga , all of which helped her " step outside [ myself ] and see the world from a different perspective . " The singer was inspired by these activities , as she began <unk> herself . " That was a big catalyst for me . It took me on a search for answers to questions I 'd never asked myself before " , she said to Q magazine . During the same year , Madonna began writing and producing Ray of Light with British electronic musician William Orbit . " I was a huge fan of William 's earlier records . [ ... ] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that , and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time " , Madonna said . When asked about its producing process , she said , 
 I was so obsessed with the movie The Sheltering Sky and that whole Moroccan / orchestral / super @-@ romantic / man @-@ carrying @-@ the @-@ woman @-@ he @-@ loves @-@ across @-@ the @-@ desert vibe .

 A low quality snippet of " Frozen " was leaked by fans on January 23 , 1998 , after it debuted on radio in Singapore , and posted it on the Internet . They said they knew what they were doing was wrong , but that they hoped it would simply generate interest from Madonna . The song was played on the US radios , including the WKTU New York radio . Warner Bros. Records enlisted the Recording Industry Association of America 's Anti @-@ Piracy Unit to delete the Internet downloads to the song . Erik Bradley , musical director of Chicago B96 , classified " Frozen " as a " the mark of a smash . Clearly , American pop radio needs Madonna " , after his station leaked it in the United States . According to Jon Uren , marketing director of Warner Music Europe , the song also had " fantastic " early support across Europe . Shortly after the song leaked , a remix version of " Frozen " was broadcast by the BBC website , and also was previewed on the soundtrack at the 1998 Versace fashion spring parade . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Frozen " is a mid @-@ tempo electronic ballad which has a layered sound enhanced by synthesizers and strings , arranged by Craig Armstrong . It was composed using common time in the key of F minor , with a moderate tempo of 102 beats per minute . " Frozen " has a basic sequence of Fm – E ♭ – D ♭ – E ♭ as its chord progression . The chorus , however , has the chord progression of Fm – B ♭ m – D ♭ – A ♭ . Madonna 's vocals range from the lower octave of F3 to the higher note of A ♭ 4 . 
 The song begins with austere , classical strings while the chord progression emphasizes tonic , submediant and flattened leading @-@ tone chords . For the second phrase , which includes a dramatic crescendo , rhythm and ambient electronic effects are added gradually . Santiago Fouz @-@ Hernández and Freya Jarman @-@ Ivens , authors from Madonna 's Drowned Worlds , commented that the song is strongly inspired by different forms of classical music , notably contemporary classical music such as <unk> , as well as Italian opera composers and pieces such as Puccini 's Madama Butterfly and Verdi 's <unk> . Madonna 's vocals throughout the song lack vibrato , and have drawn comparisons to medieval music . 
 Lyrically , the song is about a cold and emotionless man . In the first verse , Madonna enters in a medium range , ' You only see what your eyes want to see ' . In the chorus , dance rhythm and ambient sounds are added . In the second verse , more visceral lyrics are added , like ' Love is a bird , she needs to fly ' . During the bridge , a broad , string lines provide instrumental commentary on the lyrics . The song ends with a string ostinato that simply fades away , without fully resolving to the tonic chord . In an interview with The New York Times , Madonna commented that the lyrics to " Frozen " is built around " Retaliation , revenge , hate , regret , that 's what I deal with in " Frozen " . Everyone 's going to say , ' That 's a song about Carlos ' [ her ex @-@ boyfriend ] , but it 's not really ; it 's just about people in general " .

 In November 2005 , a Belgian judge seated in Mons ruled that the opening four @-@ bar theme to " Frozen " was plagiarized from the song " Ma vie fout le camp " ( " My Life 's Getting Nowhere " ) , composed by Salvatore Acquaviva . The judge subsequently ordered the withdrawal from sales of all remaining discs , and forbade any further playing of the song on Belgian TV and radio . The judge also ordered Warner Bros. , EMI and Sony to spread the decision within fifteen days to media outlets on pain of a penalty of € 125 @,@ 000 for non @-@ compliance with the court order . Acquaviva 's lawyer , Victor <unk> <unk> , said : " We tried to reach a friendly agreement ... but they didn 't want to negotiate so I sued for plagiarism . They have stolen a song , so they have to pay the value of the song . " No award damages for the song were granted . Salvatore Acquaviva had explained to the court that Madonna heard " Ma vie fout l <unk> " during a trip to <unk> in the late 1970s . She had been recruited to be a dancer during a tour with French singer Patrick Hernandez , whose discs were produced in <unk> . <unk> also stated that the lawsuit was just the first step , and the next discussion would be about the copyright gains Madonna obtained with " Frozen " . Subsequently , the song was omitted from the track listing on the Belgian pressings of Celebration in 2009 . However , Madonna performed the song during the Sticky & Sweet Tour in Werchter , with Bert <unk> , marketing manager of Belgian branch of Warner Bros. stating that " Madonna is not afraid of a more or less riot " . Acquaviva commented about the case : 
 Madonna planning to perform " Frozen " in Werchter ? I didn 't expect anything else , you know . I don 't even mind . It just would be nice because I would finally get some money after all these years , because the case is still going on . I 'm certainly not going to the concert . My lawyer is following the case . I 'm really going to follow Madonna 's concert with interest , because she really can 't perform the song . Yet , I think we won 't immediately take steps . The court 's decision is subject to various interpretations . The song can 't be played on the radio or be sold , but have we arguments enough for the concert to be over ? We won 't bring additional spectacle to the show . Unnecessary scandals , with Madonna it 's guaranteed . 
 In February 2014 , a Belgian court revealed the verdict on the case and proclaimed that Madonna did not plagiarize Acquaviva 's work for " Frozen " . The court spoke of a " new capital offense " in the file : composer Edouard Scotto Di <unk> and societies Tabata Atoll Music and Music in Paris had also filed a complaint for plagiarism . According to them , both " Ma vie fout le camp " and " Frozen " originated in the song " Blood Night " which they composed in 1983 . After all three tracks in the case were compared , the final ruling was that the songs were " not sufficiently ' original ' to claim " that any plagiarism had taken place . This ruling ended the eight @-@ year ban of the song that was in place in Belgium since 2005 .

 = = Music video = = 
 Directed by British artist Chris Cunningham , the music video for " Frozen " was filmed at <unk> Lake within the Mojave Desert in California during January 7 – 11 , 1998 . Madonna thought that there are a lot of magical , mystical powers in the desert and that it is a magical place to be . It was inspired by the film The English Patient and Martha Graham 's work . The music video premiered on February 16 , 1998 on MTV at 4 p.m. The black goth gown outfit Madonna wears on the video was designed by Olivier <unk> , and provided by then @-@ new collaborator , designer Arianne Phillips . In an interview with MTV News , Cunningham stated about his work with Madonna , saying that he thought Madonna became interested to work with him after seeing his Aphex Twin @-@ directed music video , " Come to Daddy " ( 1997 ) . Madonna stated that she and her team thought of filming the video in Iceland , as the idea to the video was to go someplace cold and where there is snow , but declined the idea . She thought : 
 'You know what , I 'm going to be freezing . I 'm going to be miserable , I 'll be complaining all day , I 'll be sorry that I ever chose a cold place . So I said , ' Let 's do it in the desert , it 'll be warm , ' and it would be sort of the opposite , because even though you think of deserts as being hot , they 're still sort of frozen in terms of there 's no vegetation and they 're very desolate . I thought that that would still work as a visual , but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero , it was bitterly cold , and I was barefoot . I was barefoot for the entire video , and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick , and it just actually turned out to be a really miserable experience . 
 The video introduces a sober , contemplative side of Madonna , revealing a mature mysticism . It begins with the camera skimming along a cracked , desiccated desert floor , and within seconds Madonna appears , sprawled on the ground wearing a black dress . Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm . In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the sky in the video , desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song . At one point Madonna falls , and as she hits the ground , she transforms into a flock of large , dark birds . Later , she transforms into a black dog . Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video . As the song progresses , the sky darkens , and Madonna levitates from the ground . Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid , which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna , who is curled up on the crenellated ground . The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna . 
 Jim <unk> from MTV News commented that from the first scene from the video , the viewer discovers that this is not " Holiday " ( 1983 ) . Matthias Groß of Madonna On the Couch : A psychoanalytic view on Madonna 's music videos , <unk> that it is interesting to look at the video as a dream , and noted that in the video , Madonna was presented as a witch or an uncanny creature , by the technique of the central perspective . He concluded that the viewers find themselves in control of their view , of the situation in general , and are conveyed the impression to follow a realistic depiction of a mere melancholic woman in the desert , according to him . Henry <unk> and Thorsten <unk> of Rewind , Play , Fast Forward : The Past , Present and Future of the Music Video said that the large panels of cloth that gather and wind around Madonna gain an even more obvious independent movement quality . Billboard considered it Madonna 's third best video noting that it " conveys the song 's bleak heartbreak perfectly " with Madonna 's persona in the video .

 " Strawberry Fields Forever " is a song by the English rock band the Beatles . The song was written by John Lennon and credited to the Lennon – McCartney songwriting partnership . It was inspired by Lennon 's memories of playing in the garden of Strawberry Field , a Salvation Army children 's home near where he grew up in Liverpool . 
 The song was the first track recorded during the sessions for the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( 1967 ) , and was intended for inclusion on the album . Instead , with the group under record @-@ company pressure to release a single , it was issued in February 1967 as a double A @-@ side with " Penny Lane " . The combination reached number two in the United Kingdom , breaking the band 's four @-@ year run of chart @-@ topping singles there , while " Strawberry Fields Forever " peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 in America . 
 Lennon considered the song his greatest accomplishment . The track incorporates reverse @-@ recorded instrumentation and tape loops , and was created from the editing together of two separate versions of the song – each one entirely different in tempo , mood and musical key . The song was later included on the US Magical Mystery Tour LP ( although not on the British double EP package of the same name ) . 
 " Strawberry Fields Forever " is one of the defining works of the psychedelic rock genre and has been covered by many artists . The Beatles made a promotional film clip for the song that is similarly recognised for its influence in the medium of music video . The Strawberry Fields memorial in New York 's Central Park is named after the song .

 Strawberry Field was the name of a Salvation Army children 's home just around the corner from Lennon 's childhood home in Woolton , a suburb of Liverpool . Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton , Nigel Walley , and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home . One of Lennon 's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in <unk> Park , near the home , where a Salvation Army band played . Lennon 's aunt Mimi Smith recalled : " As soon as we could hear the Salvation Army band starting , John would jump up and down shouting , ' Mimi , come on . We 're going to be late . ' " 
 Lennon 's " Strawberry Fields Forever " and McCartney 's " Penny Lane " shared the theme of nostalgia for their early years in Liverpool . Although both referred to actual locations , the two songs also had strong surrealistic and psychedelic overtones . Producer George Martin said that when he first heard " Strawberry Fields Forever " , he thought it conjured up a " hazy , impressionistic dreamworld " . 
 The Beatles had just retired from touring after one of the most difficult periods of their career , including the " more popular than Jesus " controversy and the band 's unintentional snubbing of Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos . Lennon talked about the song in 1980 : " I was different all my life . The second verse goes , ' No one I think is in my tree . ' Well , I was too shy and self @-@ doubting . Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying . Therefore , I must be crazy or a genius – ' I mean it must be high or low ' " , and explaining that the song was " psycho @-@ analysis set to music " . 
 Lennon began writing the song in Almería , Spain , during the filming of Richard Lester 's How I Won the War in September – October 1966 . The earliest demo of the song , recorded in Almería , had no refrain and only one verse : " There 's no one on my wavelength / I mean , it 's either too high or too low / That is you can 't you know tune in but it 's all right / I mean it 's not too bad " . He revised the words to this verse to make them more obscure , then wrote the melody and part of the lyrics to the refrain ( which then functioned as a bridge and did not yet include a reference to Strawberry Fields ) . He then added another verse and the mention of Strawberry Fields . The first verse on the released version was the last to be written , close to the time of the song 's recording . For the refrain , Lennon was again inspired by his childhood memories : the words " nothing to get hung about " were inspired by Aunt Mimi 's strict order not to play in the grounds of Strawberry Field , to which Lennon replied , " They can 't hang you for it . " The first verse Lennon wrote became the second in the released version , and the second verse Lennon wrote became the last in the release . 
 = = Musical structure = = 
 The song was originally written on acoustic guitar in the key of C major . The recorded version is approximately in B @-@ flat major ; owing to manipulation of the recording speed , the finished version is not in standard pitch ( some , for instance consider that the tonic is A ) . The introduction was played by McCartney on a Mellotron , and involves a I – ii – I – ♭ VII – IV progression . The vocals enter with the chorus instead of a verse . In fact we are not " taken down " to the tonic key , but to " non @-@ diatonic chords and secondary dominants " combining with " chromatic melodic tension intensified through outrageous harmonisation and root movement " . The phrase " to Strawberry " for example begins with a somewhat dissonant G melody note against a prevailing F minor key , then uses the semi @-@ tone dissonance B ♭ and B notes ( the natural and sharpened 11th degrees against the Fm chord ) until the consonant F note is reached on " Fields " . The same series of mostly dissonant melody notes cover the phrase " nothing is real " against the prevailing F # 7 chord ( in A key ) . 
 A half @-@ measure complicates the meter of the verses , as well as the fact that the vocals begin in the middle of the first measure . The first verse comes after the refrain , and is eight measures long . The verse ( for example " Always , no sometimes ... " ) starts with an F major chord in the key of B ♭ ( or E chord in the key of A ) ( V ) , which progresses to G minor , the submediant , a deceptive cadence . According to Alan Pollack , the " approach @-@ avoidance tactic " ( i.e. , the deceptive cadence ) is encountered in the verse , as the leading @-@ tone , A , appearing on the words " Always know " , " I know when " " I think a No " and " I think I disagree " , never resolves into a I chord ( A in A key ) directly as expected . Instead , at the end of the verse , the leading note , harmonized as part of the dominant chord , resolves to the prevailing tonic ( B ♭ ) at the end of the verse , after <unk> the subdominant ( IV ) E ♭ chord , on " disagree " . 
 In the middle of the second chorus , the " funereal brass " is introduced , stressing the ominous lyrics . After three verses and four choruses , the line " Strawberry Fields Forever " is repeated three times , and the song fades out with guitar , cello , and swarmandal instrumentation . The song fades back in after a few seconds into the " nightmarish " ending , with the Mellotron playing in a haunting tone – one achieved by recording the Mellotron " Swinging Flutes " setting in reverse – scattered drumming , and Lennon murmuring , after which the song completes .

 The working title was " It 's Not Too Bad " , and Geoff Emerick , the sound engineer , remembered it being " just a great , great song , that was apparent from the first time John sang it for all of us , playing an acoustic guitar . " Recording began on 24 November 1966 , in Abbey Road 's Studio Two on a 4 @-@ track machine . It took 45 hours to record , spread over five weeks . The song was meant to be on the band 's 1967 album Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , but was released as a single instead . 
 The band recorded three distinct versions of the song . After Lennon played the song for the other Beatles on his acoustic guitar , the band recorded the first take . Lennon played an Epiphone Casino ; McCartney played a Mellotron , a new home instrument purchased by Lennon on 12 August 1965 ( with another model hired in after encouragement from Mike Pinder of The Moody Blues ) ; George Harrison played electric guitar , and Ringo Starr played drums . The first recorded take began with the verse , " Living is easy … " , instead of the chorus , " Let me take you down " , which starts the released version . The first verse also led directly to the second , with no chorus between . Lennon 's vocals were automatically double @-@ tracked from the words " Strawberry Fields Forever " through the end of the last verse . The last verse , beginning " Always , no sometimes " , has three @-@ part harmonies , with McCartney and Harrison singing " dreamy background vocals " . This version was soon abandoned and went unreleased until the Anthology 2 compilation in 1996 . 
 Four days later the band reassembled to try a different arrangement . The second version of the song featured McCartney 's Mellotron introduction followed by the refrain . They recorded five takes of the basic tracks for this arrangement ( two of which were false starts ) with the last being chosen as best and subjected to further overdubs . Lennon 's final vocal was recorded with the tape running fast so that when played back at normal speed the tonality would be altered , giving his voice a slurred sound . This version was used for the first minute of the released recording .
