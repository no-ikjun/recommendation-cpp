 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Dean = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Dean began in the second week of August 2007 when a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa into the North Atlantic ocean . Although the wave initially experienced strong easterly wind shear , it quickly moved into an environment better suited for tropical development and gained organization . On the morning of August 13 , the National Hurricane Center recognized the system 's organization and designated it Tropical Depression Four while it was still more than 1 @,@ 500 mi ( 2 @,@ 400 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . 
 A deep layered ridge to its north steered the system west as it moved rapidly towards the Caribbean and into warmer waters . On August 14 the depression gained strength and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean . By August 16 , the storm had intensified further and attained hurricane status . Hurricane Dean continued to intensify as it tracked westward through the Lesser Antilles . Once in the Caribbean Sea , the storm rapidly intensified to a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . Weakening slightly , it brushed the southern coast of Jamaica on August 19 as a Category 4 hurricane and continued towards the Yucatán Peninsula through even warmer waters . The favorable conditions of the western Caribbean Sea allowed the storm to intensify and it regained Category 5 status the next day before making landfall in southern Quintana Roo . 
 Hurricane Dean was one of two storms in the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane and was the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded , tied with Camille and Mitch . After its first landfall , Hurricane Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula and emerged , weakened , into the Bay of Campeche . It briefly restrengthened in the warm waters of the bay before making a second landfall in Veracruz . Dean progressed to the northwest , weakening into a remnant low which finally dissipated over the southwestern United States . 
 = = Formation = = 
 On August 11 , 2007 , a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa , producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms . It encountered conditions favorable for gradual development , and on August 12 it gained organization and became a low . Strong upper @-@ level easterly winds slowed development , but on August 13 the tropical wave gained enough organization that the National Hurricane Center designated it Tropical Depression Four . At this time it was centered about 520 mi ( 835 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . 
 The depression was already exhibiting persistent deep convection in the western portion of its circulation . It moved quickly westward , south of a deep layered ridge , escaping the easterly wind shear that had been slowing its development and moving over warmer waters . At 1500 UTC on August 14 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Dean while still 1450 mi ( 2300 km ) east of Barbados . Even as its convection waned slightly that afternoon , its intensity grew , and convection flared in the center that night . Dry air and cooler air inflow from the north slowed structural development ; nevertheless , ragged bands began to form on August 15 . By mid @-@ morning , a rough banding eye had formed , and by the next morning a full eye developed . The storm was upgraded to Hurricane Dean at 0900 UTC August 16 , 550 mi ( 890 km ) east of Barbados . 
 A strong ridge of high pressure continued to push the system west , towards the Caribbean Sea . That afternoon , convective banding and increasing upper @-@ level outflow strengthened the storm to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The eye disappeared briefly overnight , possibly as part of a diurnal fluctuation , but returned by the morning of August 17 . 
 = = Caribbean Sea and first landfall = = 
 At 0930 UTC on August 17 , the center of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia . The northern eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island 's capital of Fort @-@ de @-@ France reported 13 in ( 33 cm ) of rainfall . By this time the eyewall had closed , forming a distinct eye , and in an environment of low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly . Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane by the evening of August 17 . Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles . That evening , another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane , and by 0600 UTC on August 18 , Dean reached Category 5 intensity for the first time with 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) winds . The storm 's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size . At 0800 UTC August 18 , Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy <unk> which reported a significant wave height ( average size of the largest 33 % of waves ) of 33 ft ( 10 m ) . On August 18 , Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall , indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane . That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow , and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation . Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August 19 with some <unk> wobbles . 
 On the morning of August 19 , the storm remained slightly weakened from its peak strength . As a Category 4 hurricane with wind speeds between 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) and 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) , the center of Hurricane Dean passed 90 mi ( 150 km ) south of Haiti , and that evening passed 25 mi ( 40 km ) south of Jamaica . Two weather stations on the island of Jamaica , one at Ingleside and the other at Morant Bay , both reported in excess of 13 in ( 33 cm ) of rainfall . In contrast , the weather station at Les Cayes , Haiti recorded only 1 @.@ 18 in ( 3 cm ) of rainfall . 
 Hurricane Dean intensified through the night of August 19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single @-@ walled eye . At 0100 UTC August 20 , the storm passed 120 mi ( 190 km ) to the south of Sea Buoy <unk> , which recorded a significant wave height of 36 ft ( 11 m ) . A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August 20 , but it did not last long . In conditions of low wind shear , Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content , and the storm exhibited a classic upper @-@ tropospheric outflow pattern . The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula . The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day . The cloud tops cooled , the minimum central pressure fell , and its winds increased to 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) , making Hurricane Dean a Category 5 hurricane once again . This time , it was less than 210 mi ( 335 km ) from its first landfall . 
 Although many of the convective bands were already located over the Yucatán Peninsula , Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall . As the eye moved over Mexico near the town of Majahual in the Costa Maya area , the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) , making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . At the same time , a dropsonde reading from the hurricane 's eye estimated a central pressure of 905 mbar , making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history ( after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 ) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin . The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18 @.@ 7 N 87 @.@ 8 W at 0900 UTC August 21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12 – 18 ft ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 m ) . A weather station at Chetumal ( the capital of Quintana Roo , Mexico ) reported 6 @.@ 65 in ( 17 cm ) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean 's landfall . As expected , the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm ; the eye filled and the cold cloud @-@ tops warmed . The land severely disrupted the storm 's organization , and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category 1 hurricane . 
 = = Gulf of Mexico and demise = = 
 Hurricane Dean emerged into the Bay of Campeche as a Category 1 hurricane on the afternoon of August 21 . Its inner core was largely disrupted , so although a ragged eye reformed over the warm waters of the bay , the hurricane no longer had the structure to support its previous strength . Nevertheless , the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight , indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure . With better structure came stronger winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , and the storm was re @-@ categorized as a Category 2 hurricane . 
 The storm 's strengthening pattern continued until Hurricane Dean made its second and final landfall at 1630 UTC August 22 near Tecolutla , Veracruz , just east of Gutiérrez Zamora and about 40 mi ( 65 km ) south @-@ southeast of Tuxpan . A weather station at <unk> , San Luis Potosí , recorded 15 @.@ 4 in ( 39 cm ) of rainfall during the storm 's second landfall . Dean weakened rapidly , losing its low level circulation within hours and its mid @-@ level circulation the next day as it encountered the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range . Its remnants passed over the mountains and into the eastern Pacific Ocean as a broad area of low pressure . Hurricane Dean 's remnant low pressure system then drifted north into southern California , bringing thunderstorms to northern San Diego County , and more than 2 in ( 5 cm ) of rain to Lake Wohlford . In Escondido almost 2 in ( 5 cm ) of rain fell in 90 minutes . The remnant low pressure system weakened over western Arizona and southern California before finally dissipating on August 30 . 
 = Kentrosaurus = 
 Kentrosaurus ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ SAWR @-@ əs ) is a genus of stegosaurian dinosaur from the Late Jurassic of Tanzania . The type species is K. aethiopicus , named and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915 . Often thought to be a " primitive " member of the Stegosauria , several recent cladistic analyses find it as more derived than many other stegosaurs , and a close relative of Stegosaurus from the North American Morrison Formation within the Stegosauridae . 
 Fossils of K. aethiopicus have been found only in the Tendaguru Formation , dated to the late Kimmeridgian and early Tithonian ages , about 152 million years ago . Hundreds of bones were unearthed by German expeditions to German East Africa between 1909 and 1912 . Although no complete skeletons are known , the remains provided a nearly complete picture of the build of the animal . 
 Kentrosaurus generally measured around 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) in length as an adult , and weighed about one tonne ( 1 @.@ 1 tons ) . It walked on all fours with straight hindlimbs . It had a small , elongated head with a beak used to bite off plant material that would be digested in a large gut . It had a , probably double , row of small plates running down its neck and back . These plates gradually merged into spikes on the hip and tail . The longest spikes were on the tail end and were used to actively defend the animal . There also was a long spine on each shoulder . The thigh bones come in two different types , suggesting that one sex was larger and more stout than the other . 
 = = Description = = 
 Kentrosaurus was a small stegosaur . It had the typical dinosaurian body bauplan , characterised by a small head , a long neck , short forelimbs and long hindlimbs , and a long , horizontal and muscular tail . Typical stegosaurid traits included the elongation and flatness of the head , the powerful build of the forelimbs , erect and pillar @-@ like hindlimbs and an array of plates and spikes running along both sides of the top mid @-@ line of the animal . Only a single complete tooth was known when Hennig published his monography in 1925 . Later , a part of a dentary , the tooth @-@ bearing bone of the front lower jaw , was found , which bears a just emerging tooth , and some tooth fragments were recovered from matrix sticking to other bones . The deep dentary is almost identical in shape to that of Stegosaurus , albeit much smaller . Similarly , the tooth is a typical stegosaurian tooth , small with a widened base and vertical grooves creating five ridges . 
 = = = Size and posture = = = 
 Kentrosaurus aethiopicus was smaller than Stegosaurus armatus , Hesperosaurus mjosi , Dacentrurus armatus and Tuojiangosaurus <unk> , and about as large as Huayangosaurus <unk> . The total length of a composite skeletal mount in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin , Germany , from the tip of the snout to the tip of the tail is 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) . Slightly more than half of this length is made up by the tail . Larger single elements were found , so that the animal could probably attain a total length of 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) . In 2010 , Gregory S. Paul estimated the weight of a 4 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 13 ft ) Kentrosaurus at seven hundred kilograms ( 1 @,@ 500 lb ) . An estimate for the 4 @.@ 5 m long composite mount in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin by Mallison , on the basis of a virtual 3D skeleton and 3D model , varied between 1073 L and 1267 L , and a body mass between 1 and 1 @.@ 5 tonnes ( 1 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 7 short tons ) , depending on the amount of musculature reconstructed for the tail . 
 The long tail of Kentrosaurus results in a position of the center of mass that is unusually far back for a quadrupedal animal . It rests just in front of the hip , a position usually seen in bipedal dinosaurs . However , the femora are straight in Kentrosaurus , as opposed to typical bipeds , indicating a straight and vertical limb position . Thus , the hindlimbs , though powered by massive thigh muscles attached to a long ilium , did not support the animal alone , and the very robust forelimbs took up 10 to 15 % of the bodyweight . 
 = = = Distinguishing features = = = 
 Kentrosaurus can be distinguished from other members of the Stegosauria by a number of osteological characters . Mallison ( 2011 ) provided a revised diagnosis , an updated list of distinguishing traits or autapomorphies . Most notably , the neural spines , the blade @-@ like upper extensions of the vertebrae , in the tail do not run sub @-@ parallel , as in most dinosaurs . In the front third of the tail , they point backwards , the usual direction . In the middle tail , however , they are almost vertical , and further back they are hook @-@ shaped and point obliquely forward . Also typical is that the dorsal ( back ) vertebrae have a neural arch more than twice as high as the centrum , the vertebral body , and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal . The <unk> process , front blade , of the ilium widens laterally , to the front outer side , and does not taper . 
 Furthermore , there is a unique combination of traits not in themselves unique . The transverse processes , the side extensions , of the tail are present up to the twenty @-@ eighth vertebra of the series . The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod @-@ shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae . The chevrons , bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae , have the shape of an inverted T. The length of the ilium equals , or is greater than , that of the thighbone . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Typically for a stegosaur , Kentrosaurus had extensive osteoderm ( bony structures in the skin ) covering , including small plates ( probably located on the neck and anterior trunk ) , and spikes of various shapes . The spikes of Kentrosaurus are very elongated , with one specimen having a bone core length of 731 millimetres . The plates have a thickened section in the middle , as if they were modified spines . The spikes and plates were likely covered by horn . Aside from a few exceptions they were not found in close association with other skeletal remains . Thus , the exact position of most osteoderms is uncertain . A pair of closely spaced spikes was found articulated with a tail tip , and a number of spikes were found apparently regularly spaced in pairs along the path of an articulated tail . 
 Hennig and Janensch , while grouping the dermal armour elements into four distinct types , recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them , shorter and flatter plates at the front gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear , suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body , in fifteen pairs . Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions , it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows along the back of the animal , a marked contrast to the better @-@ known North American Stegosaurus , which had one row of plates on the neck , trunk and tail , and two rows of spikes on the tail tip . There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly , and not only slightly , asymmetrical , and having a very broad base . Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on the hips , at the iliac blade , while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder , because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs <unk> and Huayangosaurus . 
 = = Discovery and species = = 
 The first fossils of Kentrosaurus were discovered by the German Tendaguru Expedition in 1909 , recognised as belonging to a stegosaur by expedition leader Werner Janensch on 24 July 1910 , and described by German palaeontologist Edwin Hennig in 1915 . The name Kentrosaurus was coined by Henning and comes from the Greek <unk> / <unk> , meaning " sharp point " or " prickle " , and sauros / σαῦρος meaning " lizard " , Hennig added the specific name aethiopicus to denote the provenance from Africa . 
 From 1909 onwards , Kentrosaurus remains were uncovered in four quarries in the <unk> <unk> ( Middle Saurian Beds ) and one quarry in the <unk> <unk> ( Upper Saurian Beds ) . During four field seasons , the German Expedition found over 1200 bones of Kentrosaurus , belonging to about fifty individuals , many of which were destroyed during the Second World War . Today , almost all remaining material is housed in the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin ( roughly 350 remaining specimens ) , while the museum of the Institute for Geosciences of the Eberhard @-@ Karls @-@ University Tübingen houses a composite mount , roughly 50 % of it being original bones . 
 Although no complete individuals were found , some material was discovered in association , including a nearly complete tail , hip , several dorsal vertebrae and some limb elements of one individual . These form the core of a mount in the Museum für Naturkunde by Janensch . The mount was dismantled during the museum renovation in 2006 / 2007 , and re @-@ mounted in an improved pose by Research Casting International . Some other material , including a braincase and spine , was thought to have been misplaced or destroyed during World War II . However , all the supposedly lost cranial material was later found in a drawer of a basement cupboard . 
 The type and sole accepted species of Kentrosaurus is Kentrosaurus aethiopicus , named by Hennig in 1915 . Fragmentary fossil material from Wyoming , named Stegosaurus longispinus by Charles Gilmore in 1914 , was in 1993 classified as a North American species of Kentrosaurus , as K. longispinus . However , this action was not accepted by the paleontological community , and S. longispinus has been assigned to its own genus , <unk> , differing from Kentrosaurus in having more elongated tail spikes and the structure of the pelvis and vertebrae . 
 = = = Type specimens and type locality = = = 
 In the original description , Hennig did not designate a holotype specimen . However , in a detailed monography on the osteology , systematic position and <unk> of Kentrosaurus in 1925 , Hennig picked the most complete partial skeleton , today <unk> as <unk> through <unk> , as a lectotype ( see syntype ) . This material includes a nearly complete series of tail vertebrae , several vertebrae of the back , a sacrum with five sacral vertebrae and both ilia , both femora and an ulna , and is included in the mounted skeleton at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin , Germany . The type locality is <unk> , Tanzania , near the Tendaguru hill . 
 Unaware that Hennig had already defined a lectotype , Peter Galton selected two dorsal vertebrae , specimens <unk> and <unk> , from the material figured in Hennig 's 1915 description , as ' holotypes ' . This definition of a holotype is not valid , because Hennig 's selection has priority . In 2011 , Heinrich Mallison clarified that all the material known to Hennig in 1915 , i.e. all the bones discovered before 1912 , when Hermann Heck concluded the last German excavations , are <unk> , and that <unk> is the correct lectotype . 
 = = = Naming controversy = = = 
 Soon after its description , a controversy arose over the stegosaur 's name , which is very similar to the ceratopsian Centrosaurus . Under the rules of biological nomenclature , forbidding <unk> , two animals may not be given the same name . Hennig renamed his stegosaur Kentrurosaurus , " pointed @-@ tail saurian " , in 1916 , while Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa renamed the genus Doryphorosaurus , " lance @-@ bearing saurian " , the same year . If a renaming had been necessary , Hennig 's would have had priority . However , because both the spellings and the pronunciations are different ( Centrosaurus is pronounced with a soft C ) , both Doryphorosaurus and Kentrurosaurus are unneeded replacement names ; Kentrosaurus remains the valid name for the genus with Kentrurosaurus and Doryphorosaurus being its junior objective synonyms . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 Kentrosaurus was by Hennig assigned to the Stegosauridae in 1915 . This is confirmed by modern cladistic analyses , although it should be noted that in 1915 Stegosauridae was a far more inclusive concept . A consecutive narrowing down of this concept caused Kentrosaurus , until the 1980s to be seen as a typical " primitive " stegosaurian , to be placed in a more derived , higher , position in the stegosaur evolutionary tree . Derived traits include a sacral yoke , a long <unk> process , a long thighbone and two rows of plates or spikes . A study by Octávio Mateus e.a. in 2009 recovered Kentrosaurus in a basal position in the Stegosauridae as shown by this cladogram : 
 Earlier analyses had shown Kentrosaurus closer in the tree to Stegosaurus . Basal traits include a prominent <unk> foramen at the quadrate in the skull ; maxillary teeth with only seven denticles at the margin ; and a shoulder spine . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Like all ornithischians , Kentrosaurus was a herbivore . The fodder was barely chewed and swallowed in large chunks . One theory on stegosaurid diet holds that they were low @-@ level browsers , eating foliage and low @-@ growing fruit from various non @-@ flowering plants . Kentrosaurus was capable of eating at heights of up to 1 @.@ 7 m ( 5 ft 7 in ) when on all fours . It may also have been possible for it to rear up on its hindlegs to reach vegetation higher in trees . With its centre of mass close to the hind @-@ limbs , the animal could potentially support itself as it stood up . The hips were likely capable of allowing a vertical trunk rotation of about 60 degrees and the tail probably would either have been fully lifted , not blocking this movement or have enough curvature to rest on the ground ; thus it could have provided additional support , though precisely because of this flexibility it is not certain whether much support was actually provided : it was not stiff enough to function as a " third leg " as had been suggested by Robert Thomas Bakker . In this pose , Kentrosaurus could have fed at heights of 3 @.@ 3 m ( 11 ft ) . 
 = = = Defense = = = 
 Because the tail had at least forty caudal vertebrae , it was highly mobile . It could possibly swing at an arc of 180 degrees , covering the entire half circle behind it . Swing speeds at the tail end may have been as high as 50 km / h . Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones . More directed blows would have resulted in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma . These attacks would have crippled small and medium @-@ sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones . Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear , to run through attackers with its spines , in the way of modern porcupines . 
 Though Kentrosaurus likely stood with forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs , it is hypothesised that the animal adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself . Its neck was flexible enough to allow it to keep sight of predators , as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back . In addition , the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion , but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms , keeping the tail pointed at the attacker . Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable . A quick predator could have made it to the tail base ( where the impact speed would be much lower ) when the tail passed and the neck and upper @-@ part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings . A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting . Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus , the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 In 2013 , a study by Ragna <unk> e.a. concluded that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated that it had a higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus , in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone . As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus , this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew quicker than smaller ones . 
 = = = Sexual dimorphism = = = 
 Differences in the proportions , not the size , of the femurs ( thighbones ) led Holly Barden and Susannah Maidment to realize that Kentrosaurus probably showed sexual dimorphism . This dimorphism of the femurs consisted in them being either more or less robust than the other . The occurrence ratio of the robust morph to the gracile one was 2 : 1 , and it is likely that the higher percentage of animals were females . Because of this ratio , it was considered reasonable to assume that in their society , Kentrosaurus males mated with more than one female , a behaviour also found in other vertebrates . 
 The problem posed by the ratio is that the multiple specimens studied , died in the same place , but probably not in a sudden mass @-@ death and so do not represent a single herd or contemporary population . The results may have been distorted by a greater chance for robust animals of getting fossilised or discovered . In an earlier study by Galton in 1982 , it was suggested that individual difference in the sacral rib count of both Kentrosaurus and Dacentrurus might be an indication of dimorphism : females would have had an extra pair of sacral ribs , having also the first sacral vertebra connected to the ilium , in addition to the subsequent four sacrals .

 Kentrosaurus lived in what is now Tanzania in the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation . The main Kentrosaurus quarries were located in the Middle Saurian Beds dating from the upper Kimmeridgian . Some remains were found in the Upper Saurian Beds dating from the Tithonian . Since 2012 , the boundary between the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian is dated at 152 @.@ 1 million year ago . The Tendaguru ecosystem primarily consisted of three types of environment : shallow , lagoon @-@ like marine environments , tidal flats and low coastal environments ; and vegetated inland environments . The marine environment existed above the fair weather wave base and behind <unk> and <unk> barriers . It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms . The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes , ponds and pools . These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts . The well vegetated <unk> were dominated by conifers . Overall , the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods . During the Early Cretaceous , the Tendaguru became more humid . The Tendaguru Beds are similar to the Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine <unk> . 
 Kentrosaurus would have coexisted with fellow ornithischians like <unk> <unk> ; the sauropods Giraffatitan <unk> , Dicraeosaurus <unk> and D. <unk> , <unk> africana , <unk> <unk> and Tornieria africanus ; theropods " Allosaurus " tendagurensis , " Ceratosaurus " <unk> , " Ceratosaurus " ingens , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ; and the pterosaur <unk> <unk> . Other organisms that inhabited the Tendaguru included corals , echinoderms , cephalopods , bivalves , gastropods , decapods , sharks , neopterygian fish , crocodilians and small mammals like <unk> tendagurensis . 
 = Quenya = 
 Quenya ( pronounced [ <unk> ] ) is a fictional language devised by J. R. R. Tolkien and used by the Elves in his legendarium . 
 Tolkien began devising the language around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state . The vocabulary remained relatively stable throughout the creation process . Also , the name of the language was repeatedly changed by Tolkien from Elfin and Qenya to the eventual Quenya . The Finnish language had been a major source of inspiration , but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin , Greek , and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya . Another notable feature of Tolkien 's Elvish languages was his development of a complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe . He felt that his languages changed and developed over time , as with the historical languages which he studied professionally — not in a vacuum , but as a result of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them . 
 Within Tolkien 's legendarium , Quenya is one of the many Elvish languages spoken by the immortal Elves , called Quendi ( ' speakers ' ) in Quenya . Quenya translates as simply " language " or , in contrast to other tongues that the Elves met later in their long history , " elf @-@ language " . After the Elves divided , Quenya originated as the speech of two clans of " High Elves " or Eldar , the Noldor and the Vanyar , who left Middle @-@ earth to live in Eldamar ( " <unk> " ) , in Valinor , the land of the immortal and God @-@ like Valar . Of these two groups of Elves , the Noldor returned to Middle @-@ earth where they met the Sindarin @-@ speaking Grey @-@ elves . The Noldor eventually adopted Sindarin and used Quenya primarily as a ritual or poetic language , whereas the Vanyar who stayed behind in Eldamar retained the use of Quenya . In this way , the Quenya language was symbolic of the high status of the Elves , the firstborn of the races of Middle @-@ earth , because of their close connection to Valinor , and its decreasing use also became symbolic for the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle @-@ earth . In the Second Age of Middle @-@ earth 's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue . In the Third Age , the time of the setting of The Lord of the Rings , Quenya was learnt as a second language by all Elves of Noldorin origin , and it continued to be used in spoken and written form , but their mother @-@ tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey @-@ elves . As the Noldor remained in Middle @-@ earth , their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor , undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes . 
 The language featured prominently in Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings trilogy , as well as in his posthumously published history of Middle @-@ earth The Silmarillion . The longest text in Quenya published by Tolkien during his lifetime is the poem " Namárië " , and other published texts are generally no longer than a few sentences . At his death , Tolkien left behind a number of unpublished writings on Quenya , and later Tolkien scholars have prepared his notes and unpublished manuscripts for publication in the journals Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar , also publishing scholarly and linguistic analyses of the language . Tolkien never created enough vocabulary to make it possible to converse in Quenya , although fans have been writing poetry and prose in Quenya since the 1970s . This has required conjecture and the need to devise new words , in effect developing a kind of neo @-@ Quenya language . 
 = = External history = = 
 J. R. R. Tolkien began to construct his first Elven tongue c . 1910 – 1911 while he was at the King Edward 's School , Birmingham . He later called it Qenya ( c . 1915 ) , and later changed the spelling to Quenya . He was then already familiar with Latin , Greek , Spanish , and several ancient Germanic languages , such as Gothic , Old Norse , and Old English . He had invented several cryptographic codes , and two or three constructed languages . Tolkien took an interest in the Finnish mythology of the Kalevala , then became acquainted with the Finnish language , which he found to provide an aesthetically pleasing inspiration for his High @-@ elven language . Many years later , he wrote : " It was like discovering a complete wine @-@ cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before . It quite intoxicated me . " Regarding the inspiration for Quenya he wrote that : 
 The ingredients in Quenya are various , but worked out into a self @-@ consistent character not precisely like any language that I know . Finnish , which I came across when I had first begun to construct a ' mythology ' was a dominant influence , but that has been much reduced [ now in late Quenya ] . It survives in some features : such as the absence of any consonant combinations initially , the absence of the voiced stops b , d , g ( except in mb , nd , ng , ld , rd , which are favoured ) and the fondness for the ending <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , also in some points of grammar , such as the <unk> endings <unk> ( rest at or in ) , <unk> ( movement to , towards ) , and <unk> ( movement from ) ; the personal <unk> are also expressed by suffixes ; there is no gender . 
 Tolkien never intended Quenya or any of his constructed languages to be used in everyday life as an international auxiliary language , although he was in favour of the idea of Esperanto as an auxiliary language within Europe . With his Quenya , Tolkien pursued a double aesthetic goal : " classical and inflected " . This urge , in fact , was the motivation for his creation of a ' mythology ' . While the language developed , Tolkien felt that it needed speakers , including their own history and mythology , which he thought would give a language its ' individual flavour ' . He wrote : " It was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of ' history ' for Elvish tongues " . This process of first inventing a language and then creating a background setting for its fictional speakers has been described as unique . <unk> Fimi , a Tolkien scholar , argues that Tolkien 's invention of Qenya started as a quest for the ideal language , to match the moral and aesthetic objectives that were part of his project of creating " a mythology for England " . Fimi argues that Tolkien deliberately used sound symbolism to unify sound and meaning and make the language appear as an ideal language , fit to be spoken in the utopian realm of the Elves and fairies of Valinor . Tolkien considered Quenya to be " the one language which has been designed to give play to my own most normal phonetic taste " . 
 From the onset , Tolkien used comparative philology and the tree model as his major tools in his constructed languages . He usually started with the phonological system of the proto @-@ language and then proceeded by inventing for each daughter language the necessary sequence of sound changes . " I find the construction and the interrelation of the languages an aesthetic pleasure in itself , quite apart from The Lord of the Rings , of which it was / is in fact independent . " 
 = = = Development = = = 
 In his lifetime , J. R. R. Tolkien never ceased to experiment on his constructed languages , and they were subjected to many revisions . Therefore , Quenya had many grammars with substantial differences between the different stages of its development . During the first conceptual stage of early Quenya c . 1910 to c . 1920 , the language was called Elfin in English and <unk> in Qenya proper . While its development was a continuous process , Quenya underwent a number of major revisions in its grammar , mostly in conjugation and the pronominal system . The vocabulary , however , was not subject to sudden or extreme change . Tolkien sometimes changed the meaning of a word , but he almost never discarded it once invented , and he kept on refining its meaning , and <unk> forged new synonyms . Moreover , Elvish etymology was in constant flux . Tolkien delighted in inventing new <unk> for his Quenya vocabulary . But after the publication of The Lord of the Rings ( finished c . 1949 @-@ 1950 , published in 1954 @-@ 1955 ) , the grammar rules of Quenya went through very few changes and this version was then defined as late Quenya ( c . 1950 – 1973 ) . 
 The spelling Qenya is sometimes used to distinguish early Quenya from later versions . Qenya differs from late Quenya by having different internal history , vocabulary , and grammar rules as described in the " <unk> " . Examples include a different accusative or the abolition of final consonant clusters in later Quenya . Fimi suggests that Qenya as it appears in the " <unk> " was supposed to be a mystic language , as the Lexicon contains a number of words with clear Christian religious connotations , such as <unk> " crucifixion " and <unk> " gospel " – these words were not part of late Quenya . 
 In the early 1930s , Tolkien decided that the proto @-@ language of the Elves was Valarin , the tongue of the gods or Valar as he called them : " The language of the Elves derived in the beginning from the Valar , but they changed it even in the learning , and moreover modified and enriched it constantly at all times by their own invention . " In the Comparative Tables the mechanisms of sound change were described by Tolkien for the following daughter languages : Qenya , <unk> ( a dialect of Qenya ) , Telerin , Old Noldorin ( or <unk> ) , Noldorin ( or <unk> ) , <unk> ( especially of <unk> ) , Danian of <unk> , East Danian , <unk> , West Lemberin , North Lemberin , and East Lemberin . For this proto @-@ language of the Elves , Tolkien appears to have borrowed the five @-@ part plosive system of Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European , the ancestor of Latin , Greek , Sanskrit , and others ; namely , one labial , one coronal , and three velar plosives ( palatal , plain , and labial ) . The first table below provides some of the " Primary Initial Combinations " from the Comparative Tables . 
 Another characteristic of Quenya reminiscent of ancient natural languages like Old Greek , Old English or Sanskrit is the dual grammatical number which is used in addition to singular and plural . It has been suggested that Tolkien used the dual to give Quenya an " archaic feel " in its role as an ancient language of the Elves . 
 About ten years later , Tolkien changed his mind about the origin of the Elvish proto @-@ language . Instead of learning from the Valar , the Elves had created an original language Quenderin which had become the proto @-@ language of the Elven language family . For this new language , Tolkien kept the many roots he had invented for Valarin in the 1930s , which then became " Quenderin roots " . The Eldarin family of languages comprises Quenya , Telerin , Sindarin and <unk> . The evolution in Quenya and Telerin of the nasalized initial groups of Quenderin is described thus in Tolkien 's Outline of Phonology : 
 These groups in Quenya normally became simplified to nasals initially . ( In Telerin they became b , d , g . ) 
 Thus : 
 <unk> > m , as in * <unk> > Q. már ' habitation ' . 
 <unk> > n , as in * <unk> > Q. <unk> ' country ' . 
 <unk> > ñ , as in * <unk> > Q. <unk> ' Noldo , Gnome ' . 
 <unk> > ny , as in * <unk> > Q. <unk> ' recites ' . 
 <unk> > ñw , as in * <unk> > Q. <unk> ( pronounced [ <unk> ] ) ' frets , wears away ' . 
 In contrast to early Qenya , the grammar of Quenya was influenced by Finnish , an agglutinative language , but much more by Latin , a synthetic and fusional language , and also Greek , from which he probably took the idea of the diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety : the Parmaquesta , used only in certain situations such as literature . Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish , but this is not easily recognized . 
 Tolkien almost never borrowed words directly from real languages into Quenya . The major exception is the name <unk> / Eärendil , which he found in an Old English poem by Cynewulf . Yet the Finnish influence extended sometimes also to the vocabulary . A few Quenya words , such as <unk> " come " and <unk> " give " , clearly have a Finnish origin . Other forms that appear to have been borrowed are actually coincidental , such as Finnish <unk> " book " , and Quenya <unk> " ship " . Tolkien invented the Valarin / Quenderin root <unk> from which sprang his Quenya word <unk> . The Latin <unk> " dawn " , and Quenya <unk> " moment of special meaning , special day , festival day " are unrelated . Instead , Quenya aurë comes from the Valarin / Quenderin root <unk> . Germanic influence can more be seen in grammar ( the -r nominative plural ending is reminiscent of the Scandinavian languages ) or phonology , than in words : Arda , the Quenya name for " region " , just happened to resemble Germanic Erde " earth " , while it actually comes from the Valarin / Quenderin root <unk> . According to Tom DuBois and Scott Mellor , the name of Quenya itself may have been influenced by the name <unk> , a language closely related to Finnish , but Tolkien never mentioned this . 
 Some linguists have argued that Quenya can be understood as an example of a particular kind of artificial language that helps to create a fictional world . Other such languages would include Robert Jordan 's Old Tongue and the Klingon language of the Star Trek series invented by Marc Okrand . It was observed that they form " a sociolinguistic context within which group and individual identities can be created . " 
 = = = Publication of linguistic papers = = = 
 Two journals , Vinyar Tengwar from issue No. 39 ( July 1998 ) , and Parma Eldalamberon from issue No. 11 ( 1995 ) , are today exclusively devoted to the editing and publishing of J. R. R. Tolkien 's mass of unpublished linguistic papers . Important grammatical texts , alluded to by Christopher Tolkien in his History of Middle @-@ earth series and described as almost unreadable or quite incomprehensible , have been published in these two journals . The " Early Qenya Grammar " , written by J. R. R. Tolkien c . 1925 , was successfully edited and published in Parma Eldalamberon No. 14 . 
 The editors have not published a comprehensive catalogue of the linguistic papers they are working on and that were not published by Christopher Tolkien in the History of Middle @-@ earth ; new <unk> linguistic material continues to emerge , although the pace of publication is irregular . 
 = = = Use of Quenya = = = 
 Attempts by fans to write in Quenya began in the 1970s , when the total corpus of published Elvish comprised only a few hundred words . Since then , the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts , phrases and names , and even tattoos . But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation . As a result , newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words . The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created , forming a Neo @-@ Quenya language that is based on Tolkien 's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements . 
 = = Internal history of late Quenya = = 
 The Elvish languages are a language family of several related languages and dialects . The following is a brief overview of the fictional internal history of late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien . Tolkien imagined a diglossic Elven society with a vernacular language for every @-@ day use , Tarquesta , and a more educated language for use in ceremonies and lore , Parmaquesta . 
 It has been observed that the " degree of proximity " to the light of the Valar affects the development of both languages in terms of phonology , morphology and semantics . The division between Light Elves and Dark Elves that took place during the Sundering of the Elves is reflected in their respective languages . 
 The Elves at first shared a common language , Primitive <unk> , called Quenderin in Quenya . Among the Eldar , i.e. those Elves who undertook the Great March to Valinor and Eldamar , Primitive <unk> developed into Common Eldarin . Some of the Eldar remained in Beleriand and became the Grey Elves ; their language developed into Sindarin . Most of the other Eldar continued to Eldamar ( ' <unk> ' ) and founded the great city of <unk> , where they developed Quenya . 
 Quenya 's older form , first recorded in the sarati of <unk> , is called Old or Ancient Quenya ( <unk> @-@ Quenya in Quenya ) . In Eldamar , the Noldor and Vanyar spoke two slightly different though mutually intelligible dialects of Tarquesta : Noldorin Quenya and Vanyarin Quenya . Later Noldorin Quenya became Exilic Quenya , when most of the Noldor Elves followed their leader Fëanor into exile from Eldamar and back to Middle @-@ earth , where the immortal Elves first awoke . 
 Quenya was also used by the gods or Valar . The Elves even derived some loanwords from the Valar 's language , which was called Valarin in Quenya , although these were more numerous in the Vanyarin dialect than in Noldorin . This was probably because of the enduringly close relationship the Vanyarin Elves had with the Valar . The Quenya as used by the Vanyar also incorporated several words from Valarin that were not found in the Noldorin dialect , such as <unk> ( " yellow " , from Valarin <unk> ( n ) ) , <unk> ( " blue " , presumably from the same root as Valarin ul ( l ) u meaning " water " ) , and <unk> ( " red " , original Valarin not given ) . 
 According to " Quendi and Eldar : <unk> <unk> " , <unk> was the usual Vanyarin name given to the Quenya language , since in Vanyarin , the consonant groups <unk> and ny remained quite distinct . In Noldorin , <unk> eventually became ny . Tolkien explained that " the word Quenya itself has been cited as an <unk> ( e.g. by Ælfwine ) , but this is a mistake due to supposition that <unk> was properly <unk> and directly derived from the name Quendi ' Elves ' . This appears not to be the case . The word is Quenya in Vanyarin , and always so in Parmaquesta . " 
 The Elves of the Third Clan , or <unk> , who reached Eldamar later than the Noldor and the Vanyar , spoke a different but closely related tongue , usually called Telerin . It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya . This was not the case with the <unk> for whom their tongue was distinct from Quenya . After the Vanyar left the city of <unk> , Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer . 
 The rebellious Noldor , who followed their leader Fëanor to Middle @-@ earth , spoke only Quenya . But <unk> <unk> , King of the Sindar of Beleriand , forbade the use of Quenya in his realm when he learned of the slaying of Telerin Elves by the Noldor ( The Silmarillion , chapter 15 ) . By doing so , he both restricted the possibility of the Sindar to enhance and brighten their language with influences from Quenya and accelerated the " <unk> and spiritual impoverishment " of the Noldorin culture . The Noldor at this time had fully mastered Sindarin , while the Sindar were slow to learn Quenya . Quenya in Middle @-@ earth became known as Exilic Quenya when the Noldor eventually adopted the Sindarin language as their native speech after <unk> 's ruling . It differed from <unk> Quenya mostly in vocabulary , having some loanwords from Sindarin . It differed also in pronunciation , representing the recognition of sound @-@ changes which had begun among the Noldor before the exile and had caused Noldorin Quenya to diverge from Vanyarin Quenya . The change of z ( < old <unk> s ) to r was the latest in Noldorin , belonging to early Exilic Quenya . The grammatical changes were only small though since the features of their " old language " were carefully taught . 
 From the Second Age on , Quenya was also used ceremonially by the Men of <unk> and their descendants in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens ; this practice was resumed by Aragorn when he took the crown as <unk> <unk> . Quenya in the Third Age had almost the same status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe , and was called Elven @-@ latin by Tolkien . 
 = = Registers = = 
 Quenya has a variety of language registers : 
 Parmaquesta ( " book @-@ language " ) : the literary style in which the Elven @-@ scriptures , the " <unk> " , and other classical Elvish works were written . 
 Tarquesta ( " high @-@ language " ) : the vernacular speech with two dialects : Vanyarin Quenya and Noldorin Quenya . 
 Exilic Quenya or " Low Quenya " : the spoken style of the Exiled Noldor in Middle @-@ earth . 
 = = Phonology = = 
 The pronunciation of the Elvish languages by Elves , Men and Hobbits has been described in a variety of sources by J.R.R. Tolkien . The documentation about late Quenya phonology is contained in the Appendix E of the Lord of the Rings and the " Outline of Phonology " , a text written by J.R.R. Tolkien and published in Parma <unk> No. 19 . 
 Tolkien based Quenya pronunciation more on Latin than on Finnish . Thus , Quenya lacks the vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish , and accent is not always on the first syllable of a word . Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö , ä and y are lacking in Quenya , but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or the development of the syllables ti > si in both languages . The combination of a Latin basis with Finnish phonological rules resulted in a product that resembles Italian in many respects , which was Tolkien 's favorite modern Romance language . 
 The tables below list the consonants ( Q. <unk> ) and vowels of late colloquial Noldorin Quenya , i.e. Quenya as spoken among the Exiled Noldor in Middle @-@ earth . They are written using the International Phonetic Alphabet , unless otherwise noted . 
 = = = Consonants = = = 
 The Quenya consonant system has 6 major places of articulation : labial ( involving the lips ) , dental ( involving the tongue and the back of the teeth ) , alveolar ( involving the tongue and the alveolar ridge of the jaw ) , palatal ( involving the tongue and the middle part of the roof of the mouth ) , velar ( involving the back of the tongue and the back part of the roof of the mouth ) , and glottal ( involving the vocal folds ) . The dental fricative ( / θ / ) and the voiced alveolar fricative ( / z / ) occur in the Vanyarin varieties , but were gradually replaced with / s / and / r / respectively in Noldorin Quenya . Notably , voiced plosives only occur after nasals and liquids , i.e. there is no simple / b , d , ɡ / but only the clusters / mb , ( lb , ) nd , ld , rd , <unk> / , and these occur only between vowels . ( This may not be true in Vanyarin Quenya , given the word <unk> , the name of a lament for the death of the Two Trees of Valinor composed by <unk> of the Vanyar . ) The following table presents the inventory of classic Noldorin consonants . Grouping of consonants occurs only in the central parts of a word , except for combinations with the <unk> / w / and / j / . 
 Quenya orthography ( using the Latin script ) follows the IPA , but uses 〈 c 〉 as an alternative to 〈 k 〉 , writes [ ŋ ] not followed by another velar as 〈 ñ 〉 ( in early Quenya when this still can occur ; otherwise it is written 〈 n 〉 ) , and represents the consonants [ ç ʍ x ] using the digraphs 〈 hy hw ch 〉 . In addition , 〈 h 〉 in the cluster 〈 ht 〉 represents [ ç ] after 〈 e 〉 or 〈 i 〉 and [ x ] after other vowels . 
 = = = <unk> and allophony = = = 
 A number of consonants are realized differently when they occur in clusters with certain other consonants . This particularly concerns clusters that involve the approximants / w , j / or the glottal fricative / h / . Clusters where the second consonant was / j / are realized as palatalized consonants , and clusters where the second consonant was / w / are realized as labialized . Consonants clusters where the initial consonant is / h / are realized as <unk> and devoiced . 
 <unk> clusters The pronunciation of the consonant cluster 〈 hy 〉 is [ ç ] in Noldorin Quenya , which is a " strong voiceless y , similar to , but more frictional than the initial sound in English huge " . In Vanyarin Quenya , 〈 hy 〉 is pronounced [ ʃ ] . 
 According to Tolkien , the cluster / <unk> / 〈 ty 〉 is pronounced as " a ' front explosive ' [ c ] , as e.g. Hungarian ty , but it is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced y @-@ offglide " . 
 Tolkien stated that the cluster 〈 ny 〉 is pronounced as in English " new " ( presumably British English [ njuː ] , as opposed to American English [ <unk> ] ) . In the Vanyarin dialect , 〈 ty 〉 , 〈 dy 〉 , and 〈 hy 〉 were realised as [ tʃ ] , [ dʒ ] , and [ ʃ ] respectively . Tolkien wrote about 〈 py 〉 : " In Vanyarin Quenya and among some <unk> the cluster 〈 py 〉 was sounded with voiceless y , <unk> as [ <unk> ] , which later in Vanyarin became [ <unk> ] " ; cf . Hungarian <unk> [ <unk> ] ' steal ' . Labial clusters The cluster 〈 hw 〉 is realized as [ ʍ ] , a " <unk> voiceless w . It has more tense with closer lip @-@ aperture and more friction than the voiceless wh of English " . According to Tolkien , the graphs 〈 q 〉 or 〈 qu 〉 is pronounced as " a lip @-@ rounded ' k ' followed by a partly unvoiced w @-@ offglide " , that is / <unk> / . 
 <unk> clusters The clusters 〈 hl 〉 and 〈 hr 〉 are realized as ɬ and r ̥ , the same as 〈 lh 〉 and 〈 rh 〉 in Sindarin . These , like their Sindarin equivalents , derived from Primitive Elvish <unk> and <unk> . The primitive consonant clusters <unk> and <unk> came out in Quenya as 〈 m 〉 and 〈 n 〉 ; it has been suggested that there was an intermediate stage of 〈 <unk> 〉 and 〈 hn 〉 , the voiceless versions [ m ̥ ] and [ n ̥ ] , in Common Eldarin ; these soon merged with the voiced 〈 m 〉 and 〈 n 〉 . Voiceless hl and hr have a complex history which Tolkien describes thus : " Among the Noldor hr , hl became voiced to r , l before the Exile , and the use of r , l in these cases was normal in Tarquesta , as spoken , tho ' the spelling was usually maintained . Since later the Exiles were familiar with voiceless hr , hl in their Sindarin speech many of them restored this sound in Tarquesta , according to the traditional spelling . The learned had , of course , at all times retained hr , hl in reading or reciting Parmaquesta . " 
 Simplification of clusters In the late Ancient Quenya period , when vowels were lost in long compound words , the clusters thus created , or the consonants that became final , were as a rule changed or reduced : 
 -m > -n ; 
 all stops > -t ; 
 <unk> > -r ; 
 -th > -t ; 
 <unk> > -n ; 
 <unk> , -ng > -n ; 
 <unk> > -n ; 
 any combination with s ( as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) > -s ; 
 any combination with <unk> > -t . 
 = = = Vowels = = = 
 Quenya has five vowels ( Quenya <unk> ) , and a distinction of length . The short vowels are / a , e , i , o , u / and the long ones are written with an acute accent as / á , é , í , ó , ú / . The precise quality of the vowels is not known , but their pronunciation is likely closer to the " pure " vowels of Italian and Spanish than to the diphthongized English ones . According to Pesch , for the vowels / a , i , u / the short and long forms have the same vowel quality , similar to the vowels of German . But for the vowels / e , o / , the short vowels are pronounced slightly lower and closer to [ ɛ ] and [ ɔ ] , respectively , whereas the long ones are pronounced as high @-@ mid vowels [ eː ] and [ oː ] . This interpretation is based on a statement by Tolkien , saying that é and ó , when correctly pronounced by Elves , were just a little " tenser and ' closer ' " than their short counterparts : " neither very tense and close , nor very slack and open " . 
 This interpretation results in a vowel system with 7 different vowel qualities and a length distinction in the high and low vowels only ; this system is depicted in table 3 . 
 = = = = Diphthongs = = = = 
 Late Noldorin Quenya has 6 diphthongs ( Quenya <unk> ) : / iu , eu , ai , au , <unk> , ui / . All of these are falling , except for / iu / ( [ ju ] ) which is rising . In Old Quenya , all diphthongs were falling . Tolkien wrote : " It is probable that before the Exile Vanyarin and Noldorin [ Quenya ] in common shifted iu , ui to rising diphthongs , ... but only / iu / is reported as a rising diphthong [ ju ] similar to the beginning of English yule [ <unk> ] . On the other hand , ui remained in Exilic Quenya a falling diphthong as reported " . 
 = = = Syllables and stress = = = 
 In Quenya , the stressing of a syllable is predictable and non @-@ phonemic ( i.e. the meaning of a word never changes depending on the stress ) , but it is partly determined by syllable weight . Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable . In words of three or more syllables , the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy , otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable , i.e. the third @-@ to @-@ last syllable . In Quenya , heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel , a diphthong , or a cluster of two consonants ( ll , ld , mm , ss , etc . ) . Certain combinations of consonants , e.g. ny , ry , are also regarded as heavy . <unk> hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta ( not colloquially in Tarquesta ) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable . Quenya has also a secondary accent . The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse . 
 = = = Phonotactics = = = 
 Tolkien also devised phonotactical rules for late Quenya , governing the way in which the sounds could be combined to form words : 
 Only the following consonants have phonemically geminated forms , i.e. elongated consonants : pp , tt , cc ( kk ) ; mm , nn ; ss , ll , rr . These occur only medially . The geminated occlusives are aspirated . 
 Tolkien wrote that in Common Eldarin as final consonants only the " <unk> t , s , d , th , n , r , l ( all frequent except th ) and the labial nasal m ( frequent ) . In addition the combination <unk> ( though usually a coalescence of more than one <unk> element ) seems also to have been permitted ; possibly also st . No other consonant groups were <unk> y , w are not included , since they naturally took the syllabic forms i , u as suffixed elements . " These evolved from Common Eldarin to Quenya Tolkien explains on the same page thus : m > n ; t , n , r and s remained without change ; final C.E. th became Quenya t and final d > r , and so : " the list of ' permissible finals ' : n , r , l , s , t and nt remained constant in Quenya speech @-@ feeling " . 
 Quenya tolerates only the following initial consonants : p , t , c ( k ) ; f , þ , s , h , hy , hw ; m , n , ñ ; v , l ( and hl ) , r ( and hr ) , y , w . 
 Quenya tolerates only the following initial groups : x ( ks ) , ps ; ty , ny , ly ; qu ( kw ) , ñw ( became nw in Noldorin Quenya ) 
 Quenya tolerates only the following medial <unk> groups ( those especially common are bolded ) : ht , lc , ld , <unk> , lm , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ly , mb , mn , mp , my , nc ( <unk> ) , nd , ng ( <unk> ) , nt , nw ( not ñw , which only occurs initially ) , ny , ps , pt , qu ( kw ) , rc , rd , rm , rn , rp , rt , rs , <unk> , <unk> , ry , sc , st , <unk> , ts , tw , ty , x ( ks ) . 
 Quenya does not tolerate triconsonantal ( or longer ) combinations , except c ( k ) , h , g followed by w , or h , t , þ , d followed by y . So , Quenya permits the following 12 triconsonantal groups only : <unk> ( <unk> ) [ <unk> ] , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) [ <unk> ] , <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> , <unk> [ <unk> ] in Noldorin Quenya , [ <unk> ͡ ʃ ] in Vanyarin Quenya , <unk> , sty [ sc ] in Noldorin Quenya , [ <unk> ͡ ʃ ] in Vanyarin Quenya ( cf. <unk> vs. <unk> in Polish ) , and <unk> . In all other cases y , and w became syllabic i , u after the consonant groups . 
 Quenya does not tolerate the combination of two different occlusives . " Where these anciently occurred , as in pt , kt , one of the two , or both , became opened and <unk> . " 
 As in Sindarin , the combination ft is avoided . 
 = = Grammar = = 
 The grammar of Quenya is agglutinative and mostly suffixing , i.e. different word particles are joined by appending them . It has basic word classes of verbs , nouns and pronouns / determiners , adjectives and prepositions . Nouns are inflected for case and number . Verbs are inflected for tense and aspect , and for agreement with subject and object . In early Quenya , adjectives agree with the noun they modify in case and number , but not in later Quenya , where this agreement disappears . The basic word order is Subject @-@ Object @-@ Verb . Unless otherwise noted , samples in this section refer to Late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien after 1951 . 
 = = = Nouns = = = 
 Quenya nouns can have up to four numbers : singular , general plural ( " plural 1 " ) , particular / <unk> plural ( " plural 2 " ) , and dual . However , not all Quenya nouns can have all four numbers since some of them are <unk> tantum having no singular variant for referring to a single object , such as <unk> " goods ( things for sale , or the things that you own ) " ; some other nouns , especially monosyllabic ones , use only one of the two plurals judged the most aesthetic by Elves ( i. e . Tolkien ) . 
 In late Quenya Tarquesta , the plural is formed by a suffix to the subjective form of the noun . 
 For plural 1 the suffix is -i or -r ( depending of the type of the noun ) . In Parmaquesta , the <unk> is ( not always ) long ( the precise rules have not yet been published ) . 
 For plural 2 the suffix is -li ( <unk> in Parmaquesta ) . 
 Quenya nouns are declined for case . Parmaquesta Quenya has ten cases . These include the four primary cases : nominative , accusative , genitive , and instrumental ; three adverbial cases : allative ( of which the dative is a shortened form ) , locative ( also with a shortened form ) , and ablative ; and a possessive or adjectival case . The accusative was however only used for Parmaquesta and had been replaced by nominative in late colloquial Quenya . 
 = = = Adjectives = = = 
 In late Quenya , the singular endings are -a , -e , <unk> , and a rare form -in that may be seen as a shortened form of <unk> . The corresponding plural forms are -e , , -i , <unk> , and possibly <unk> . The latter version is however not attested . Quenya adjectives may be freely used as nouns , in which case they are also inflected like a noun : e.g. <unk> , " new " , may be used as <unk> , " news " . 
 = = = Prepositions and adverbs = = = 
 In Quenya , there are many similarities in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines the relation of verb and object . Many Quenya prepositions have adverb @-@ like uses with no complement . In Common Eldarin , these prepositions were postpositions instead , and later became inflectional endings . Case markings combine primarily with nouns , whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories . This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case . 
 an i <unk> = i <unk> ( r ) " upon the many waves " 
 The preposition an is related to the <unk> case ending . 
 = = = Pronouns = = = 
 As with all parts of Quenya grammar , the pronominal system was subject to many revisions throughout Tolkien 's life , and the available corpus was not systematic until a list of endings was published in Vinyar Tengwar No. 49 in 2007 . In late Quenya , pronouns have both separate or independent forms , and suffix forms , 
 The separate pronouns have both a short and long form that are used for emphatic and normal pronouns respectively . Examples of the emphatic form include : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ( 1st to 3rd person plural ) . Such emphatic disjunctive pronouns , were already present in early Qenya but differed from the later versions ( e.g. plural : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 " I love him " ( or " her " ) can be expressed in Quenya as <unk> or Melin sé , . " I love them " would be then <unk> or Melin <unk> ( these two forms are reconstructed ) . If a pronoun is the subject of a sentence , it becomes tied to the verb either as separate word directly before the verb , or as a suffix after the inflected verb . In the suffixed form , an -s ( singular ) and a -t ( plural and dual ) may be added to the long subjective pronouns as objectives of the 3rd person : 
 utúvie @-@ <unk> @-@ s , literally " have found @-@ I @-@ it " , " I have found it " ( cf . Aragorn 's outcry when he finds the sapling of the White Tree . ) 
 utúvie @-@ lye @-@ s , " You have found it / him / her " . 
 utúvie @-@ lye @-@ t , " You have found them " . 
 It is debated whether certain attested special male and female pronouns that were exclusively used for the description of persons are still applicable to late Quenya as found in The Lord of the Rings . 
 = = = Possessive determiners = = = 
 The possessive determiners ( analogous to English my , his , etc . ) are used to indicate the possessor of the noun they determine . They mark the person and number of the possessor , and are inflected to agree with the noun they are attached in number and case . While the English language distinguishes between masculine and feminine singular possessors ( his vs. her ) , late Quenya generally does not . 
 " Since by Quenya idiom in describing the parts of body of several persons the number proper to each individual is used , the plural of parts existing in pairs ( as hands , eyes , ears , feet ) is seldom required . Thus mánta " their hand " would be used , ( they raised ) their hands ( one each ) , <unk> , ( they raised ) their hands ( each both ) , and <unk> could not occur " . 
 <unk> mánta . They raised their hands . 
 <unk> mánta . They raised their hands . 
 Varda <unk> <unk> . Varda has uplifted her ( two ) hands . 
 The usual plural ending is -r , <unk> , " my heirs " . 
 = = = Demonstrative = = = 
 The demonstrative makes a three @-@ way distinction between entities the speaker is referring to : 
 sina , " this " ; 
 <unk> , " that ( over there ) " ; 
 enta , " that ( over there , away from both of us ) " . 
 A fourth demonstrative , <unk> , may possibly be used with reference to a past time period , as in " that [ past ] year " . The word enta may be preferred with reference to a future year . 
 Yet another word for " that " is sana , Tolkien in one poem expressing " that maiden " as sana <unk> . Possibly this means " that particular one " without any spatial reference . 
 = = = Verbs = = = 
 According to Tolkien , " the inflections of [ Qenya ] verbs are always pretty regular " , and Quenya verbs are either in a personal form or an impersonal form . Usually in linguistics , an impersonal verb is a verb that cannot take a true subject , because it does not represent an action , occurrence , or state @-@ of @-@ being of any specific person , place , or thing . This is not how Tolkien intended the use of " impersonal . " An impersonal verb form is a verb to which no pronoun has been attached , as <unk> ( sg . ) or <unk> ( pl . ) ; <unk> , " I do ( habitually ) " , is a personal form ( with -n , a short suffix for " I , me " ) . As explained by Tolkien , verbs in Quenya are negated by using a " negative verb " <unk> in front of the proper verb in the impersonal tense form . 
 Tolkien noted that " when the emphatic pronoun is used separately the verb has no <unk> ( save for number ) . " 
 <unk> <unk> . " <unk> is making ( right now ) " . 
 Quendi <unk> . " The Elves are making " . 
 <unk> . " I am making " . 
 <unk> . " We are making " . 
 <unk> <unk> . " He / She is ( really ) making " . 
 <unk> <unk> . " We are ( really ) making " . 
 Late Quenya verbs have also a dual agreement morpheme -t : 
 Nai <unk> <unk> <unk> . " May two stars shine . " 
 In the imperative mood , plurality and duality are not expressed . There is no agreement . The verb stays singular . If a plural verb is used as in <unk> <unk> it means " let them do it " referring to persons not present or at any rate not addressed directly . 
 The copula in late Quenya is the verb <unk> . Tolkien stated that it was used only in joining adjectives , nouns , and pronouns in statements ( or wishes ) asserting ( or desiring ) a thing to have certain quality , or to be same as another , and also that the copula was not used when the meaning was clear . Otherwise , the copula is left out , which may provide for ambiguous tenses when there is no further context : 
 Eldar <unk> , can be translated in English either as " Elves are <unk> " , or " Elves were <unk> " . 
 A <unk> . " A is good " , or " A was good " . 
 = = = Syntax = = = 
 Quenya allows for a very flexible word order because it is an inflectional language like Latin . Nevertheless , it has word order rules . The usual syntax structure is subject @-@ verb @-@ object . The adjective can be placed before or after the noun that it modifies . 
 = = Vocabulary = = 
 Because much of Tolkien 's writings on the Elvish languages remain unpublished it is difficult to know how large a vocabulary he devised . As of 2008 , about 25 @,@ 000 Elvish words have been published . 
 = = = Proper nouns = = = 
 The lexicon of Quenya is rich in proper nouns . 
 <unk> " Rest " ; Indis " Bride " ; <unk> " He who <unk> in Might " ; Nessa " Youth " ; Varda " Sublime " ; <unk> " Steadfast one . " 
 <unk> " Fell Fire " ; <unk> " Most Bright Lady " ; <unk> " Cunning Man " ; <unk> " Spirit of Fire " ; <unk> " ( ? ) Dreamer " ; Sauron " The <unk> . " 
 <unk> " Music of the <unk> " ; Eldamar " Home of the Eldar " ; <unk> " Jaws of Ice " ; <unk> " Father of All " ; Oron <unk> " Ever Snow @-@ white Peak " ; <unk> " Rock of Song " ; Turambar " Master of Doom " ; Valinor " land of the Vali " , sc .

 = = = Greetings = = = 
 Elvish greetings can be expressed both by voice and by hand , and often involve a combination of the two . Elvish greetings are often , but not always , used just prior to a conversation . From the Lord of the Rings it appears that Elves do not have a very elaborate greeting ritual . 
 The word used as a form of polite address to an Elf ( male or female ) is : Tar . Among the <unk> it became " King / Queen " and used as a form of address for a superior , especially a King or a Queen ; cf . <unk> , used by Prince <unk> to address his father , King Tar @-@ <unk> . 
 Namárië [ <unk> ] is a reduced form of Quenya á na <unk> , literally " be well " . It is a formula used in Tarquesta for greetings and also for farewell . 
 The most usual formula used by the Noldor for greeting each other is ( Hara ) <unk> ! " ( Stay ) in happiness ! " . 
 In The Lord of the Rings , the hobbit Frodo Baggins used another address of welcome : Elen síla lúmenn ' <unk> ! which was corrected by Tolkien in the Second Edition to Elen síla lúmenn ' <unk> ! It was a traditional formula in an elevated style and used between two people ( or two companies of many people ) each going on a path that crosses that of the other : " A star shines upon the hour of the meeting of our ways " . 
 The most usual formula used by the Noldor in farewells is <unk> <unk> ! " Go happily ! " , or <unk> ! " To happiness ! " . 
 = = = Numerals = = = 
 According to Christopher Tolkien : " the Eldar used two systems of numerals one of sixes ( or twelves ) , and one of fives . ( or tens ) . " That is a duodecimal counting ( base 12 ) , and a decimal system . J.R.R. Tolkien coined a word for the ' decimal system of counting ' <unk> . 
 The known numbers for 1 – 20 are presented below ; those from early Quenya ( " Early Qenya Grammar " ) are in bold . 
 Other attested number words include esta and inga for ' first ' . Tolkien was dissatisfied with esta , the definition is marked with a query in the " Etymologies " . , and inga means not just ' first ' but also ' high ' , it appears in the compound <unk> , a title bore by <unk> , the King of all Elves . A word <unk> , meaning " a hand full " , " ten fingers " , was presented in Vinyar Tengwar . 
 Rasta , <unk> , and <unk> are special words for " twelve " , " eighteen " , and " twenty @-@ four " only used in duodecimal counting . 
 <unk> means specifically a group of five objects , like the English word " pentad " ; similarly <unk> refers to a group of ten . The word <unk> for thirteen literally means " 12 and one more " . The words for numbers above two come after the noun they describe . 
 If no large numbers are still known in late Quenya , in early Quenya " twenty @-@ one " is <unk> <unk> , 30 nel ( de ) kainen , 40 kan ( ta ) kainen , 50 <unk> , 60 <unk> , 70 <unk> , 80 <unk> ( to ) kainen and 90 <unk> . The word <unk> is used in early Quenya as a counter like " million " . The <unk> form <unk> appears in the " Qenya Lexicon " meaning 144 , in the " Early Qenya Grammar " it stands for 100 . The expression for 1000 is <unk> kainen or <unk> . Finally <unk> " century " may be related to the as yet unpublished late Quenya word for 100 . 
 = = Writing systems = = 
 Most of the times , Tolkien wrote his invented languages using the Latin script , but he devised a number of original writing systems to match the internal histories of his languages . 
 = = = Elvish writing systems = = = 
 Tolkien imagined many writing systems for his Elves . The most well @-@ known is the " Tengwar of Fëanor " but the first one he created c . 1919 was the " Tengwar of <unk> " , also called the sarati . He decided that , prior to their Exile , the Noldorin Elves first used the sarati of <unk> to record Ancient Quenya . In Middle @-@ earth , Quenya appears to have been rarely written using the " Elvish runes " or <unk> , named <unk> in Quenya . 
 = = = Latin script = = = 
 Tolkien 's spelling in Latin letters of Quenya was largely phonemic , with each letter corresponding to a specific phoneme in the language , save for some exceptions . In particular , the vowels varied in pronunciation depending upon their vowel length . Specific rules for consonants were provided in Appendix E of The Lord of the Rings , e.g. the letter c is always pronounced k , qu stands for kw , <unk> is <unk> . Tolkien 's standard orthography for Quenya uses all the letters of the Latin script except j , k , and z , together with the acute and diaeresis marks on vowels ; the letters ñ , þ and z only appear in early Quenya . Occasionally , Tolkien wrote Quenya with a " Finnish @-@ style " orthography ( rather than the standard Latin @-@ Romance version ) , in which c is replaced by k , y with j , and long vowels written double ; . The acute accent marks long vowels , while the diaeresis indicates that a vowel is not part of a diphthong , for example in <unk> or <unk> , while final e is marked with a diaeresis to remind English @-@ speakers that it is not silent . Since either use is superfluous , the diaeresis was frequently omitted by Tolkien . 
 = = Corpus = = 
 The poem " Namárië " is the longest piece of Quenya found in The Lord of the Rings , yet the first sentence in Quenya is uttered by a Hobbit ; namely Frodo 's greeting to the Elves : <unk> síla lúmenn ' <unk> . Other examples include <unk> 's words spoken upon reaching Middle @-@ earth , and repeated by Aragorn at his coronation : Et <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> ar <unk> <unk> ' Ambar @-@ <unk> ! " Out of the Great Sea to Middle @-@ earth I am come . In this place I will abide , and my heirs , unto the ending of the world ! " Treebeard 's greeting to <unk> and Galadriel is also spoken in Quenya : A <unk> , <unk> <unk> " O beautiful ones , parents of beautiful children " . Another fragment is Sam 's cry when he uses Galadriel 's phial against Shelob : <unk> Eärendil <unk> <unk> ! " Hail Eärendil , brightest of stars ! " And in The Silmarillion , the phrase <unk> 'n aurë ! <unk> <unk> ar <unk> , <unk> 'n aurë ! " The day has come ! Behold , people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men , the day has come ! " , is cried by <unk> before the Battle of Unnumbered Tears . 
 Other Quenya poems spoken by Tolkien in public but never published in his lifetime are <unk> <unk> ( " The Last Ark " ) , <unk> , and <unk> contained in his lecture A Secret Vice and published for the first time in 1983 in The Monsters and the Critics . A faulty fragment of the poem " <unk> " , written in early Quenya or Elfin between November 1915 and March 1916 , was published by Humphrey Carpenter in his Biography . A facsimile of the entire poem was published only in April 1999 in Vinyar Tengwar No. 40 . 
 = Spider @-@ Man ( 2002 film ) = 
 Spider @-@ Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi . Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name , the film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker , a high school student living in New York City , who turns to crimefighting after developing spider @-@ like super powers . Spider @-@ Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn ( a.k.a. the Green Goblin ) , Kirsten Dunst as Peter 's love interest Mary Jane Watson , Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben , and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn . 
 After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years , it was licensed for a worldwide release by Sony Pictures Entertainment in 1999 after it acquired options from MGM on all previous scripts developed by Cannon Films , Carolco and New Cannon . Exercising its option on just two elements from this multi @-@ script acquisition ( a screenplay credited to James Cameron , Ted Newsom , John Brancato , Barney Cohen , and " Joseph Goldman " ( the pen name of Menahem Golan ) and a later treatment credited solely to Cameron ) , Sony hired David Koepp to create a working screenplay from this " Cameron material " . Directors Roland Emmerich , Ang Lee , Chris Columbus , Jan de Bont , M. Night Shyamalan , Tony Scott and David Fincher were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000 . The Koepp script was rewritten by Scott Rosenberg during preproduction and received a dialogue polish from Alvin Sargent during production . 
 Filming took place in Los Angeles , and New York City from January 8 to June 30 , 2001 . Spider @-@ Man premiered in the Philippines on April 30 , 2002 , and had its general release in the United States on May 3 , 2002 . It became a critical and financial success . For its time , it was the only film to reach $ 100 million in its first weekend , had the largest opening weekend gross of all time , and was the most successful film based on a comic book . With $ 821 @.@ 7 million worldwide , it was 2002 's third @-@ highest @-@ grossing film and is the 50th @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of all time ( 7th at the time of release ) . 
 The film was nominated at the 75th Academy Awards ceremony for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mixing . Due to the success of the film , Columbia Pictures and Marvel released two sequels , Spider @-@ Man 2 in 2004 , and Spider @-@ Man 3 in 2007 .

 = = Cast = = 
 Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider @-@ Man 
 Peter is an academically brilliant but socially inept boy who is bitten by a genetically modified spider and gains spider @-@ like abilities . Maguire was cast as Peter in July 2000 , having been Raimi 's primary choice for the role after he saw The Cider House Rules . The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who did not seem to fit the ranks of " adrenaline @-@ pumping , tail @-@ kicking titans " , but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition . The actor was signed for a deal in the range of $ 3 to $ 4 million with higher salary options for two sequels . To prepare , Maguire was trained by a physical trainer , a yoga instructor , a martial arts expert , and a climbing expert , taking several months to improve his physique . Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the <unk> motion , and had a special diet . The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio , Edward Furlong , and Freddie Prinze , Jr . , Chris Klein , Wes Bentley , and Heath Ledger . Edward Furlong had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1996 , while Raimi joked of Prinze that " [ he ] won 't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film . " In addition , actors Scott Speedman , Jay Rodan , and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role with Franco later being cast as Harry Osborn . 
 Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin 
 Scientist , engineer , billionaire , founder & owner of Oscorp who tests an unstable strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful Green Goblin .

 In April 1999 , although Sony Pictures optioned from Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer all preceding script versions of Spider @-@ Man , it only exercised the options on " the Cameron material , " which contractually included a multi @-@ author screenplay and a forty @-@ five page " scriptment " credited only to James Cameron . The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script . The studio lined up Roland Emmerich , Tony Scott , Chris Columbus , Ang Lee , David Fincher , Jan de Bont and M. Night Shyamalan as potential directors . Fincher did not want to depict the origin story , pitching the film as being based on The Night Gwen Stacy Died storyline , but the studio disagreed . Sam Raimi was attached to direct in January 2000 , for a summer 2001 release . He had been a big fan of the comic book during his youth , and his passion for Spider @-@ Man earned him the job . 
 Cameron 's work became the basis of David Koepp 's first draft screenplay , often word for word . Cameron 's versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists . Koepp 's rewrite substituted the Green Goblin as the main antagonist and added Doctor Octopus as the secondary antagonist . Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father @-@ son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting , thus , he dropped out Doctor Octopus from the film . In June , Columbia hired Scott Rosenberg to rewrite Koepp 's material . Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the " organic <unk> " idea from the Cameron " scriptment " . Raimi felt he would stretch the audience 's suspension of disbelief too far to have Peter invent mechanical webshooters . 
 Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences . Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex . Sequences removed from the final film had Spider @-@ Man protecting Fargas , the wheelchair @-@ using Oscorp executive from the Goblin , and Spider @-@ Man defusing a hostage situation on a train . As production neared , producer Laura Ziskin hired her husband , award @-@ winning writer Alvin Sargent , to polish the dialogue , primarily between Peter and Mary Jane . Columbia offered David Koepp 's name to the WGA as sole screenwriter , despite the fact that it had acquired Cameron 's script and hired two subsequent writers . Without reading and comparing any of the material , the Writers Guild approved sole credit to Koepp .

 With Spider @-@ Man cast , filming was set to begin the following November in New York City and on Sony soundstages . The film was set for release a year later , but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3 , 2002 , filming officially began on January 8 , 2001 in Culver City , California . After the terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 , certain sequences were re @-@ filmed , and images of the Twin Towers were digitally erased from the film . Sony 's Stage 29 was used for Peter 's Forest Hills home , and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw ( Randy Savage ) . Stage 27 was also used for the complex Times Square sequence where Spider @-@ Man and the Goblin battle for the first time , where a three @-@ story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built . The scene also required shooting in Downey , California . On March 6 , forty @-@ five @-@ year @-@ old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in . The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $ 58 @,@ 805 . 
 In Los Angeles , locations included the Natural History Museum ( for the Columbia University lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers ) , the Pacific Electricity Building ( the Daily Bugle offices ) and Greystone Mansion ( for the interiors of Norman Osborn 's home ) . In April , 4 of the Spider @-@ Man costumes were stolen , and Sony put up a $ 25 @,@ 000 reward for their return . They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested . Production moved to New York City for two weeks , taking in locations such as the Queensboro Bridge , the exteriors of Columbia University 's Low Memorial Library and the New York Public Library , and a rooftop garden in the Rockefeller Center . The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June . The Flatiron Building was used for the Daily Bugle .

 Although it wound up being faithful to the comics , many designs were made for Spider @-@ Man 's costumes : one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond of the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume . To create Spider @-@ Man 's costume , Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit , being covered with layers of substance to create the suit 's shape . It was designed as a single piece , except for the mask . The webbing , which accented the costume , was cut by computer . The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look .

 Visual effects supervisor John Dykstra was hired to produce the film 's visual effects in May 2000 . He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts computer generated , as they would have been physically impossible . Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production . Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider @-@ Man swinging from buildings , which he described as , " ballet in the sky . " The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $ 70 million to around $ 100 million . Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters ' individual color schemes , so Spider @-@ Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots : Spider @-@ Man was shot in front of a greenscreen , while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen . Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot . 
 Saki said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider @-@ Man was that as the character was masked , it immediately lost a lot of characterization . Without the context of eyes or mouth , a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content . Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider @-@ Man as being , " the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero . " Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider @-@ Man feel like a human being . When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character , they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts . In addition , Dykstra 's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models . Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation , so none of the shots were 100 % computer generated .

 After the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11 , 2001 , Sony recalled teaser posters which showed a close @-@ up of Spider @-@ Man 's face with the New York skyline ( including , prominently , the World Trade Center towers ) reflected in his eyes . The film 's original teaser trailer , released in 2001 and shown before Atlantis : The Lost Empire , American Pie 2 , Planet of the Apes and Jurassic Park III , was featured a mini @-@ film plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a Eurocopter <unk> Twin Squirrel helicopter , which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net , then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the World Trade Center towers . According to Sony , the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself and is consequently one of the most popular " Special Shoot " trailers since Terminator 2 : Judgment Day . The trailer and poster were pulled after the events of the attacks , but can be found on the internet on websites such as YouTube . 
 Before the film 's British theatrical release in June 2002 , the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) gave the film a " 12 " certificate . Due to Spider @-@ Man 's popularity with younger children , this prompted much controversy . The BBFC defended their decision , arguing that the film could have been given a " 15 " . Despite this , North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils , in East Anglia , changed it to a " PG " , and Tameside council , Manchester , denoted it a " PG @-@ 12 " . The U.S. rated it " PG @-@ 13 " for " stylized violence and action " . In late August , the BBFC relaxed their policy to " 12A " , leading Sony to re @-@ release the film .

 Spider @-@ Man was a critical success .

" The casting , mainly Tobey Maguire , is often cited as one of the film 's high points . Eric Harrison , of the Houston Chronicle , was initially skeptical of the casting of Tobey Maguire , but , after seeing the film , he stated , " within seconds , however , it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role . " USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978 's Superman . Owen Gleiberman , of Entertainment Weekly , had mixed feelings about the casting , particularly Tobey Maguire . " Maguire , winning as he is , never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey – the boy and the man , the romantic and the avenger – together . " The Hollywood Reporter 's Kirk Honeycutt thought , " the filmmakers ' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider @-@ Man and M.J. ' s upside down kiss – after one of his many rescues of her – to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures . " 
 Conversely , LA Weekly 's Manohla Dargis wrote , " It isn 't that Spider @-@ Man is inherently unsuited for live @-@ action translation ; it 's just that he 's not particularly interesting or , well , animated . " Giving it 2 @.@ 5 / 4 stars , Roger Ebert felt the film lacked a decent action element ; " Consider the scene where Spider @-@ Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids . He tries to save both , so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose . The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved , but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea . " Stylistically , there was heavy criticism of the Green Goblin 's costume , which led IGN 's Richard George to comment years later , " We 're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling , but the Goblin armor ( the helmet in particular ) from Spider @-@ Man is almost comically bad ... Not only is it not frightening , it prohibits expression . "

 = Transit of Venus , 1639 = 
 The first known observations and recording of a transit of Venus were made in 1639 by the English astronomers Jeremiah Horrocks and his friend and correspondent William Crabtree . The pair made their observations independently on 4 December that year ( 24 November under the Julian calendar then used in England ) ; Horrocks from Carr House , then in the village of Much Hoole , Lancashire , and Crabtree from his home in Broughton , near Manchester . 
 The friends , followers of the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler , were self @-@ taught mathematical astronomers who had worked methodically to correct and improve Kepler 's Rudolphine tables by observation and measurement . In 1639 , Horrocks was the only astronomer to realise that a transit of Venus was imminent ; others became aware of it only after the event when Horrocks 's report of it was circulated . Although the friends both died within five years of making their observations , their ground @-@ breaking work was influential in establishing the size of the Solar System ; for this and their other achievements Horrocks and Crabtree , along with their correspondent William Gascoigne , are considered to be the founding fathers of British research astronomy . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the 17th century , two developments allowed for the transits of planets across the face of the Sun to be predicted and observed : the telescope and the new astronomy of Johannes Kepler , which assumed elliptical , rather than circular , planetary orbits . 
 In 1627 , Kepler published his Rudolphine Tables . Two years later he published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De <unk> <unk> Anni 1631 which included an <unk> ad <unk> ( warning to astronomers ) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761 . The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist <unk> in Innsbruck , Johannes Remus <unk> in <unk> and Pierre Gassendi in Paris , vindicating the Keplerian approach . But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown to be much smaller than expected . 
 Although Kepler 's calculations indicated that the 1631 transit of Venus would best be visible from the American continent , he was not fully confident of his prediction , and advised that European astronomers should be prepared to observe the event . Gassendi and others in Europe watched for it but , as predicted , the Sun was below the horizon during the transit . According to modern calculations , observers in much of Italy and along the eastern Mediterranean should have been able to view the last stage of the transit , but no such observations were recorded . Kepler had predicted a near miss for a Venus transit in 1639 and , as the next full transit was not expected for another 121 years , Gassendi and the other astronomers concentrated their efforts in other areas . 
 = = = Jeremiah Horrocks = = = 
 Jeremiah Horrocks ( 1618 – 3 January 1641 ) was born in Lower Lodge , Toxteth Park , now part of Liverpool ; his father , James was a watchmaker , and his mother Mary ( née Aspinwall ) was from a notable Toxteth Park family . Several members of the Aspinwall family were also in the watchmaking trade , and it is said that a watchmaker uncle first interested Jeremiah in astronomy . Jeremiah joined Emmanuel College on 11 May 1632 and matriculated as a member of the University of Cambridge on 5 July 1632 as a sizar , which meant he did not have the means to fully support himself and was given specific duties to compensate for a reduction in fees . At Cambridge , he would have studied the arts , classical languages , a little geometry , and some traditional astronomy , but not the latest work of Galileo , Tycho Brahe and Kepler . He used his spare time to teach himself the more demanding mathematical astronomy and familiarise himself with the latest thinking . Horrocks read most of the astronomical treatises of his day , found the weaknesses in them , and was suggesting new lines of research by the age of 17 . In 1635 , he left Cambridge without formally graduating , presumably owing to the cost of graduation . 
 After leaving Cambridge , Horrocks returned to his home in Lancashire and began collecting books and instruments in order to pursue his main interest , the study of astronomy . In the summer of 1639 , he left home and moved about 18 miles along the coast to the village of Much Hoole , where it is thought he took up a post as a tutor for the children of the Stones family , who were prosperous <unk> living at Carr House , within the Bank Hall Estate , Bretherton . 
 Horrocks was the first to demonstrate that the Moon moved in an elliptical path around the Earth . He also wrote a treatise on Keplerian astronomy and began to explore mathematically the properties of the force that became known as gravity ; Isaac Newton in the Principia acknowledged Horrocks 's work in relation to his theory of the Moon . 
 = = = William Crabtree = = = 
 William Crabtree ( 1610 – 1644 ) was a cloth merchant from Broughton Spout , a hamlet in the township of Broughton near Manchester , which is now part of Salford . The son of John Crabtree , a Lancashire farmer of comfortable means , and Isabel Crabtree ( née Pendleton ) , he was educated at a grammar school in Manchester – probably the forerunner of Manchester Grammar School , which was then situated between the Collegiate Church and what is now Chetham 's School of Music . He worked in Manchester , married into a wealthy family and in his spare time studied mathematics and astronomy . He carefully measured the movements of the planets , undertook precise astronomical calculations and rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables with improved accuracy . He maintained an active correspondence , much of it now lost , with Horrocks , two other young astronomers – William Gascoigne and Christopher Towneley – and Samuel Foster , Professor of astronomy at Gresham College , London and alumnus of Emmanuel College . It is not known whether Horrocks and Crabtree ever met in person but from 1636 they corresponded regularly , and , because of their shared interest in the work of Johannes Kepler , referred to themselves , along with William Gascoigne , as nos <unk> ( we <unk> ) . 
 Crabtree ’ s observations had convinced him that , despite their errors , Kepler ’ s Rudolphine Tables were superior to the commonly used <unk> 's tables , and he became one of the first converts to Kepler ’ s new astronomy . By 1637 , he had convinced Horrocks of the superiority of the Keplerian system , and , using their own planetary observations , both men made many corrections to Kepler 's tables , which Crabtree converted to decimal form . 
 = = = Transit of Mercury = = = 
 On 29 September 1638 , Horrocks wrote to Crabtree about a likely forthcoming transit of Mercury on 21 October 1638 ( Old Style ) which Kepler had not predicted . He explained that he intended to construct what would later be called a <unk> by attaching his telescope to an " oblong stick , carrying a plane surface at right angles to itself on which to receive the Sun ’ s image " , and that he would draw a circle with numerical markings on a sheet of paper on which to project the image of the Sun . In the event , no such transit took place as Mercury passed over the Sun well outside the limit for a transit , but the exercise proved to be an important dry @-@ run for the later observation of the transit of Venus . 
 In October 1639 , Horrocks had calculated that transits of Venus occur not singly , but in pairs eight years apart , and realised that the second transit would occur in less than four weeks . He was convinced that a measurement could be made of the apparent diameter of the planet to within a fraction of a second of arc when it was seen as a dull black disk on the face of the Sun , compared to an accuracy of around one minute of arc when seen in its normal position as the bright morning star close to the Sun . He wrote to his younger brother and to Crabtree in Broughton , advising them to observe the event on Sunday , 24 November ( 4 December New Style ) . To quote Horrocks : " The more accurate calculations of Rudolphi very much confirmed my expectations ; and I rejoiced exceedingly in the prospect of seeing Venus " . 
 = = Observation of the transit = = 
 Horrocks was concerned that the weather would be unfavourable for the transit as he believed the rare planetary conjunction would produce severe weather : 
 The chance of a clouded atmosphere caused me much anxiety ; for Jupiter and Mercury were in conjunction with the Sun almost at the same time as Venus . This remarkable assemblage of the planets ( as if they were desirous of beholding , in common with ourselves , the wonders of the heavens , and of adding to the splendour of the scene ) , seemed to <unk> great severity of weather . Mercury , whose conjunction with the Sun is invariably attended with storm and tempest , was especially to be feared . In this apprehension I coincide with the opinion of the astrologers , because it is confirmed by experience ; but in other respects I cannot help despising their more puerile vanities . 
 At around midday on 23 November Horrocks darkened his room and focused the rays of sunlight coming through the window onto the paper where the image could be observed safely . At his location in Much Hoole ( the latitude of which he determined to be 53 ° 35 ' ) , he calculated that the transit should begin at about 3 : 00 pm on Sunday the 24th , but he began his observations the previous day fearing that he might miss the event if his calculations proved to be inaccurate . On the Sunday he began observing at sunrise , the weather was cloudy , but he first saw the tiny black shadow of Venus crossing the Sun at about 3 : 15 pm , and observed for half an hour until sunset at 3 : 53 pm . 
 When the time of the observation approached , I retired to my apartment , and having closed the windows against the light , I directed my telescope , previously adjusted to a focus , through the aperture towards the Sun and received his rays at right angles upon the paper ... I watched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o 'clock , and from a little before ten until noon , and at one in the afternoon , being called away in the intervals by business of the highest importance which , for these ornamental pursuits , I could not with propriety neglect ... About fifteen minutes past three in the afternoon , when I was again at liberty to continue my labours , the clouds , as if by divine interposition , were entirely dispersed ... I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle , the object of my sanguine wishes , a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly circular shape , which had already fully entered upon the Sun 's disk on the left ... Not doubting that this was really the shadow of the planet , I immediately applied myself <unk> to observe it ... although Venus continued on the disk for several hours , she was not visible to me longer than half @-@ an @-@ hour , on account of [ the Sun ] so quickly setting ... The inclination was the only point upon which I failed to attain the utmost precision ; for , owing to the rapid motion of the Sun , it was difficult to observe with certainty to a single degree ... But all the rest is sufficiently accurate , and as exact as I could desire . 
 Crabtree made his observations using a similar set @-@ up but had insufficient time to make any measurements , as it was cloudy in Broughton , and thus he only saw the transit briefly . According to Horrocks : " Rapt in contemplation he stood for some time , scarcely trusting his own senses , through excess of joy ... In a little while , the clouds again obscured the face of the Sun , so that he could observe nothing more than that Venus was certainly on the disc at the time . " Afterwards , he made " so rapid a sketch " of Venus as it had passed across the Sun 's disc , allowing Crabtree to estimate the angular size of Venus to be 1 ' 3 " , accurate to within 1 second of arc of its actual size ; Horrocks 's estimate of 1 ' 12 " was less accurate . 
 = = Results = = 
 Kepler had found that the distance between the planets increased in proportion to their distance from the Sun , and this led him to assume that the universe was created with a divine harmony , and that the size of the planets would increase in the same way . He had written in 1618 , " Nothing is more in concord with nature than that the order of magnitude should be the same as the order of the spheres " . When Horrocks 's measurements of Venus , coupled with some erroneous measurements by Kepler and Gassendi , seemed to confirm this , Horrocks tentatively proposed a law which stated that all planets ( with the exception of Mars ) would be the same angular size when viewed from the Sun , this being 28 arc seconds . This meant that the assumption Kepler had made about the sizes of the planets held true , and led Horrocks to the false conclusion that the distance between each planet and the Sun was about 15 @,@ 000 times its radius . Thus he estimated the average distance from the Earth to the Sun to be approximately 60 million miles ( 97 million km ) , suggesting that the Solar System was ten times larger than traditionally believed . His figure was much lower than the 93 million miles ( 150 million km ) that the Astronomical Unit is known to be today , but , despite being based on a false premise , was more accurate than any suggested up to that time . 
 By 1640 , Gascoigne had developed a reticle and a micrometer for his telescope , both of which would have been invaluable to Horrocks . He showed them to Crabtree , who told Horrocks about them , and reported back to Gascoigne saying : " My friend Mr Horrox <unk> , that little Touch I gave him , hath ravished his mind quite from itself , and left him in an <unk> between <unk> and <unk> . I beseech you , Sir , slack not your Intentions for the Perfection of your begun Wonders . " 
 Horrocks produced several drafts of a Latin treatise Venus in sole visa ( Venus seen on the Sun ) based on his observations , which he presumably intended to publish , but he died suddenly from unknown causes on 3 January 1641 , aged 22 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Some of the drafts of Venus in Sole Visa were kept by Crabtree , who died in 1644 , three years after Horrocks . Their other correspondent , William Gascoigne , died the same year in the Battle of Marston Moor . Horrocks 's papers remained with his family for a short time ; some were destroyed during the civil war , some were taken to Ireland by a brother , Jonas , and never seen again , and others passed into the collection of antiquarian and astronomer , Christopher Towneley , where they were consulted by Jeremy Shakerley , who wrote three books on astronomy in the mid @-@ 17th century . Others were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 . The manuscripts were widely circulated from the late 1650s although they remained unpublished for many years . 
 The coronation of King Charles II took place on 23 April 1661 ( 3 May , New Style ) , the day of a Mercury transit across the Sun . Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens attended the coronation , during which he heard about the Horrocks 's manuscript , found in 1659 by John Worthington ( Master of Jesus College , Cambridge and alumnus of Emmanuel College , where he was a contemporary of Horrocks ) , together with some fragments of correspondence with Crabtree . Huygens knew the eminent Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius , and gave him the manuscript copy . Hevelius appended it to his report on the Mercury transit , Mercurius in sole <unk> <unk> , published in 1662 . The publication of Venus in Sole Visa by Hevelius caused great consternation at the newly founded Royal Society when it was realised that such an elegant and important paper by an Englishman had been neglected in his own country for so long . The mathematician John Wallis , who was a friend of Horrocks at Emmanuel College , and a founder member and leading light of the society , summed up the view of its members when he wrote : 
 I cannot help being displeased , that this valuable observation , purchasable with no money , elegantly described and prepared for the press , should have laid for two @-@ and @-@ twenty years , and that no @-@ one should have been found to take charge of so fair an offspring at its father 's death , to bring to light a treatise of such importance to astronomy and to preserve a work for our country 's credit and for the advantage of mankind . 
 The Royal Society assumed responsibility for publication of most of the remainder of Horrocks 's work as Jeremiae <unk> Opera Posthuma in 1672 – 73 . 
 The recording of the transit is seen by many as the birth of modern astronomy in Britain . John Flamsteed later said he regarded Horrocks , Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and <unk> and began his three folio volume , Historia Coelestis Britannica ( 1745 ) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643 . 
 = = Commemorations = = 
 During the 19th century there was a revival of interest in Horrocks 's and Crabtree 's achievement . Rev. A. B. Whatton , who translated Venus in sole visa from Latin , assumed that Horrocks 's comment about " business of the highest importance which , for these ornamental pursuits , I could not with propriety neglect " must have referred to the duties of a curate . It seems more probable they were his duties as tutor at the house , or perhaps his " business " was merely to attend the church . The notion of the impoverished curate gained popular traction and in 1874 , after much lobbying , a memorial was mounted in Westminster Abbey opposite to that of Newton which reads : 
 In memory of Jeremiah Horrocks , Curate of Hoole in Lancashire who died on 3rd of Jan , 1641 in or near his 22nd year . 
 Having in so short a life detected the long inequality in the mean motion of Jupiter and Saturn discovered the orbit of the moon to be an ellipse determined the motion of the lunar apse suggested the physical cause of its revolution and of Venus which was seen by himself and his friend William Crabtree on Sunday the 24th of November ( O.S. ) 1639 . This tablet facing the monument of Newton was raised after the lapse of more than two centuries . Dec. 9 , 1874 . 
 The Rev. Robert <unk> , Rector of St. Michael 's Church , Hoole from 1848 – 1881 , raised money by public subscription in Lancashire , Oxford and Cambridge to fund the creation of a new chancel and sanctuary to the church to be named " The Horrocks Chapel " . The chancel was completed by 1824 , and the sanctuary by 1858 . The vestry was extended in 1998 – 1999 , and the first window in the north wall , originally installed in 1872 , has stained glass roundels commemorating the transits of Venus of 1874 and 2004 . There is also a marble tablet commemorating Horrocks . The church clock , contributed by the parishioners as their commemoration of Horrocks , was installed in 1859 ; the sundial , installed in 1875 , has a quotation from Horrocks ( " Sine Sole Sileo " ) that translates as " Without the sun I am silent " . 
 In 1903 the artist Ford Madox Brown was commissioned to produce the murals known as The Manchester Murals for Manchester Town Hall . The painting entitled Crabtree watching the transit of Venus AD 1639 is a romanticised depiction of Crabtree 's observation of the event . 
 On 9 June 2004 , the day after the first of a 21st @-@ century pair of Venus transits occurred as predicted by Horrocks , a commemorative street nameplate in memory of William Crabtree was unveiled at the junction of Lower Broughton Road and Priory Grove , which marks the northern boundary of Crabtree Croft . In December 2005 , a commemorative plaque was unveiled a few yards away near Ivy Cottage on Lower Broughton Road , which is thought to have been the home of Crabtree and his family at the time he was collaborating with Horrocks . The second transit of the pair occurred on 5 and 6 June 2012 , and was marked by a celebration held in the church at Much Hoole , which was streamed live worldwide on the NASA website . A celebration was also held at Crabtree 's former home in Broughton when NASA broadcast a re @-@ creation of the observation at Ivy Cottage , inspired by the Ford Madox Brown mural , to millions of viewers , and projected a live video stream of the transit from Hawaii onto the side of the house .

 " Anomaly " is the 54th episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the second episode of the third season . The episode was written by co @-@ producer Mike Sussman and directed by David Straiton , his fifth for the show . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi . In this episode , the Enterprise is attacked by an Osaarian vessel , and in pursuit they discover that the aliens have information on the Xindi which they must retrieve to help them on their mission . 
 The guest cast included Robert Rusler , who had previously appeared in Babylon 5 , and Julia Rose , who wore a costume originally created for Hilary Swank in the 2003 film The Core . The episode received ratings of 2 @.@ 6 / 5 percent according to Nielsen Media Research , which was the same as previous episode " The Xindi " . It was watched by 4 @.@ 29 million viewers which was an increase and the fourth highest so far in 2003 . The actions of Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) received criticism in this episode , but the special effects and action sequences were praised . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As Enterprise travels through the Delphic Expanse , the ship is damaged by destructive spatial anomalies . With most of the primary systems off @-@ line , Ensign Mayweather notices another ship nearby but no life @-@ signs are detected . Captain Archer leads Lieutenant Reed and several MACOs on an away mission , and discover the crew are all dead . Taking what they can , they return and resume their mission . 
 Soon another vessel approaches Enterprise , and a group of aliens beam on board , stealing weapons , food and equipment . The crew finally prevails , and one of the aliens , an Osaarian called Orgoth , is captured . Archer hopes to recover the stolen items , but the <unk> have masked their ion trail . He then confronts Orgoth in the brig . He explains they were traders attempting to find new trade routes , but after being hit by the spatial anomalies they were unable to leave and resorted to piracy . 
 The crew are able to track the Osaarian vessel , finding a large 1 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old sphere constructed out of a single alloy . Archer and his away team discover a series of habitat modules containing most of the stolen items . The crew also finds a cargo manifest , and Ensign Sato soon learns they had also recently attacked a Xindi ship . Archer once again confronts Orgoth , demanding to know everything about the Xindi . He then drags the Osaarian to an airlock , initiating the decompression cycle . Orgoth soon relents , revealing they downloaded the Xindi database , while providing the access codes to their computer . When the alien ship returns , Mayweather maneuvers Enterprise close enough for Sato to download the bulk of it . Archer sends Orgoth back to his people . 
 = = Production = = 
 Writer and co @-@ producer Mike Sussman , wrote the script the episode , originally intending for it to show the origins of the Orion species . But this was changed to a new species , the <unk> , during rewrites . The episode was shot over seven days , with the majority of filming taking place on standing ship sets for the Enterprise . The Command Centre set was used for the second time , having previously appeared in the first episode of the season . It had been introduced as a new set for the third season as an area on the Enterprise where the crew would plan their next move in the mission against the Xindi . A new set was created for the brig , where the Osaarian Orgoth was held prisoner . One day of filming was on sets to represent the Osaarian base , with the majority of those made up using green screens that would allow the sets to be digitally inserted in post production . 
 Julia Rose made her debut as MACO Corporal McKenzie , having beaten between 25 to 40 other actors to get the part . The spacesuit costume that she wore in the episode was reused , having been created originally for the 2003 Paramount Pictures film The Core where it was worn by Hilary Swank . Rose was a fan of Bakula from his time on Quantum Leap and described him as the " Dad " on set . Nathan Anderson returned as Sergeant Kemper for the second time . Robert Rusler , who appeared as Orgoth , had previously appeared in the cast of the second season of Babylon 5 as Warren Keffer . " Anomaly " was the fifth episode to be directed by David Straiton . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Anomaly " was first aired in the United States on UPN on September 17 , 2003 . According to Nielsen Media Research , it received a 2 @.@ 6 / 5 percent share among adults . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 6 percent of all households , and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . It was estimated that " Anomaly " was watched by 4 @.@ 29 million viewers , which was the highest since " Future Tense " in February 2003 was watched by 4 @.@ 62 million and the fourth highest of 2003 so far . 
 Michelle Erica Green , writing for TrekNation , compared the actions of Archer in this episode to those of Kathryn Janeway in the second part of the Star Trek : Voyager episode " Equinox , but felt that here it came across as " callous and horrific " . She felt that Archer 's actions were typical of a " Hollywood fantasy ( or nightmare ) post @-@ 9 / 11 leader " but thought that they were realistic . She also praised other elements such as the special effects such as the derelict ship , calling it " creepy , vivid , [ and ] entirely believable . " Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " , called the episode " proof that action @-@ centric Trek can indeed work , and work well . " He thought it was a vast improvement on the previous episode and found the stronger version of Archer interesting . He praised the soundtrack by Jay Chattaway which he felt suggested that the typical Star Trek music was being revised . He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four . 
 The only home media release of " Anomaly " has been as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The Blu @-@ ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013 and season three is expected to be released in January 2014 . 
 = French cruiser Latouche @-@ Tréville = 
 Latouche @-@ Tréville was one of four Amiral Charner @-@ class armored cruisers built for the French Navy in the 1890s . The ship spent the bulk of her career in the Mediterranean and was assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco @-@ Turkish War of 1897 , to protect French interests and citizens . Latouche @-@ Tréville spent most of the first decade of the 20th century as a training ship or in reserve . The ship was recommissioned before World War I began in 1914 , and escorted convoys for several months before she was assigned to the eastern Mediterranean to support Allied operations and bombard the Ottoman @-@ controlled coast . She was lightly damaged in 1915 by an Ottoman shell while providing naval gunfire support during the Gallipoli Campaign . Latouche @-@ Tréville became a training ship in late 1917 and was decommissioned in 1919 . She was stricken from the navy list the following year and was sold for scrap in 1926 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Amiral Charner @-@ class ships were designed to be smaller and cheaper than the preceding armored cruiser design , the Dupuy de Lôme . Like the older ship , they were intended to fill the commerce @-@ raiding strategy of the Jeune École . 
 The ship measured 110 @.@ 2 meters ( 361 ft 7 in ) long overall , with a beam of 14 @.@ 04 meters ( 46 ft 1 in ) . Latouche @-@ Tréville had a forward draft of 5 @.@ 55 meters ( 18 ft 3 in ) and drew 6 @.@ 06 meters ( 19 ft 11 in ) aft . She displaced 4 @,@ 748 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 673 long tons ) at normal load and 4 @,@ 990 metric tons ( 4 @,@ 910 long tons ) at deep load . 
 The Amiral Charner class had two triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 16 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of 8 @,@ 300 metric horsepower ( 6 @,@ 100 kW ) using forced draught . Latouche @-@ Tréville had a designed speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but during sea trials on 28 December 1894 the engines produced 8 @,@ 276 metric horsepower ( 6 @,@ 087 kW ) , although the ship only reached a maximum speed of 18 @.@ 16 knots ( 33 @.@ 63 km / h ; 20 @.@ 90 mph ) . She carried up to 535 metric tons ( 527 long tons ; 590 short tons ) of coal and could steam for 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 400 km ; 4 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ships of the Amiral Charner class had a main armament that consisted of two Canon de 194 mm Modèle 1887 guns that were mounted in single gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Their secondary armament comprised six Canon de 138 @.@ 6 mm Modèle 1887 guns , each in single gun turrets on each broadside . For anti @-@ torpedo boat defense , they carried four 65 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) guns , four 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) and eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) five @-@ barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns . They were also armed with four 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) pivoting torpedo tubes ; two mounted on each broadside above water . 
 Unlike her sister ships , Latouche @-@ Tréville 's gun turrets were electrically powered by two dynamos , each rated at 20 @.@ 8 kilowatts ( 27 @.@ 9 hp ) . While they performed well during trials , the electrical installation proved to be unreliable in service . The electromagnetically operated friction clutch tended to burn out at normal operating voltages , the direct current components often caused arcing and the mechanical components wore out more quickly than anticipated . In addition the system was not water resistant and often malfunctioned when water entered the turrets , a not uncommon occurrence . It was replaced by a more reliable system in 1905 . 
 The side of the Amiral Charner class was generally protected by 92 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 6 in ) of steel armor , from 1 @.@ 3 meters ( 4 ft 3 in ) below the waterline to 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 ft 2 in ) above it . The bottom 20 centimeters ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) tapered in thickness and the armor at the ends of the ships thinned to 60 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) . The curved protective deck of mild steel had a thickness of 40 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) along its centerline that increased to 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) at its outer edges . Protecting the boiler rooms , engine rooms , and magazines below it was a thin splinter deck . A watertight internal cofferdam , filled with cellulose , ran the length of the ship from the protective deck to a height of 1 @.@ 2 meters ( 4 ft ) above the waterline . Below the protective deck the ship was divided by 13 watertight transverse bulkheads , with five more above it . The ship 's conning tower and turrets were protected by 92 millimeters of armor . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Latouche @-@ Tréville , named in honor of Vice Admiral comte de Latouche @-@ Tréville , was laid down on 26 April 1890 at the Granville shipyard of Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée . She was launched on 5 November 1893 and commissioned for sea trials on 16 October . While initial trials were successful , further testing revealed multiple problems that required over a year and a half of work before she was commissioned for service on 6 May 1895 . 
 Latouche @-@ Tréville was initially assigned to the Northern Squadron ( Escadre du Nord ) , and participated in a fleet review by President Félix Faure on 6 August 1895 , before she was transferred to the 2nd Light Division of the Mediterranean Squadron on 11 January 1896 . The ship was briefly assigned to the Higher Naval War College ( École supérieure de guerre de la marine ) , with her sister Amiral Charner and the protected cruiser Suchet until she was transferred to the Reserve Squadron on 20 October . Latouche @-@ Tréville was sent to Souda Bay , Crete , on 17 March 1897 , at the outbreak of the Greco @-@ Turkish War , and stayed there until 24 June . On 18 October the ship rejoined the light division and remained with the Mediterranean Fleet until 22 July 1904 . During this time , she participated in a fleet review by King Umberto I of Italy at Cagliari , Sardinia , in April 1899 , the combined fleet maneuvers with the Northern Squadron during June – July 1900 and another Presidential fleet review on 19 July . During gunnery training on 24 January 1901 , her forward turret was damaged . While under repair from 1 February to 1 May , bilge keels were installed . In October 1901 , Latouche @-@ Tréville was one of the ships ordered to proceed to the port of Mytilene . After landing two companies of marines that occupied the major ports of the island on 7 November , Sultan Abdul Hamid II agreed to enforce contracts made with French companies and to repay loans made by French banks . 
 During a gale on 18 December 1902 in Toulon , the small cargo liner SS Médoc was blown onto the ram of Latouche @-@ Tréville and had to be run aground lest she sink , although the cruiser was barely damaged in the incident . The ship was based at <unk> in the Cyclades for duty in the eastern Mediterranean from 7 May to 16 December 1903 , and then visited Naples in April 1904 together with the entire Mediterranean Squadron . Latouche @-@ Tréville participated in the spring cruise to the eastern Mediterranean shortly thereafter , before she was placed in reserve on 22 July when the new armored cruiser Kléber replaced her in the light division . During this time , all of her 37 mm guns were removed and the number of her 47 mm guns was increased from four to eight . In addition , the electrical system for her turrets was upgraded and various other minor modifications were made . 
 Latouche @-@ Tréville was recommissioned on 15 February 1907 and assigned to the gunnery school . The following month , her torpedo tubes were removed . On 22 September 1908 , her aft turret was badly damaged when one of her loaded guns misfired when the breech was opened . The ignition of the propellant blew the breechblock through the turret door and threw the sighting hood onto the ship 's deck . The ship was saved from being lost by a crewman who closed the door between the magazine and the ammunition hoist . Fourteen crewmen were killed and five were wounded in the incident . Repairs took until the end of the year to complete , and she resumed her duties until she was again placed in reserve on 1 January 1912 . Latouche @-@ Tréville was recommissioned on 20 November for service in the Levant ; she departed Toulon on 10 December and arrived in Port Said , Egypt on 16 December . The ship was refitted in Bizerta , Tunisia , from 8 November 1913 to 26 December , during which time her military masts were replaced by light pole masts . She arrived back in Egypt on 30 December and resumed her duties . 
 Latouche @-@ Tréville was recalled to Bizerta on 29 July 1914 , where she unloaded surplus equipment as tensions rose shortly before the outbreak of the First World War . The ship was assigned to escort convoys between Morocco and France together with her sisters Amiral Charner and Bruix , and then blockaded the Strait of Otranto until 5 February 1915 , when she was transferred to the Dardanelles . She was then transferred to the Syrian squadron on 20 March , and later bombarded Ottoman installations at Gaza and a railroad bridge at Acre in Palestine . Latouche @-@ Tréville rejoined the Dardanelles squadron on 25 April and was providing fire support there on 4 June when her aft turret was struck by a 210 @-@ millimeter ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) shell . It killed two men and wounded five others . She was transferred to the Aegean to conduct anti @-@ submarine patrols from 17 June to 20 August before repairs were made at Toulon from 27 August to 21 September . The ship was then returned to the Aegean to support Allied forces near Salonica , Greece until she was ordered home on 5 January 1916 to be disinfected and refitted . After its completion on 9 February , Latouche @-@ Tréville spent most of the next year and a half in the central and eastern Mediterranean performing a variety of missions . The ship was placed in reserve on 18 December 1917 , and served as a gunnery training ship until she returned to Toulon on 31 December 1918 . Latouche @-@ Tréville was decommissioned on 1 May 1919 and condemned on 21 June 1920 . Her hulk was used by the company salvaging the wreck of the battleship Liberté as accommodations and a workshop from 4 September 1920 to 1925 . She was sold for scrap in 1926 .

 = Winston tastes good like a cigarette should = 
 " Winston tastes good like a cigarette should " is an enduring slogan that appeared in newspaper , magazine , radio , and television advertisements for Winston cigarettes from the brand 's introduction in 1954 until 1972 . It is one of the best @-@ known American tobacco advertising campaigns . In 1999 , Advertising Age ranked the jingle eighth @-@ best out of all the radio and television jingles that aired in the United States in the 20th century . 
 The deliberate use of " like " rather than " as " was provided by advertising agency William Esty Co . , and the overall campaign was directed by Esty executives Wendell Adams and <unk> Lunny , Lunny serving as producer / director of most of the visual and recording production related to the campaign in its initial years . Adams was a classically trained musician in his own right , but singer / model / pianist Margaret Johnson ghost wrote the jingle and , along with her husband , Travis Johnson , recorded it with their group , the Song Spinners . Johnson 's insertion of the two quick hand claps before the word " cigarette " caught America 's ear by surprise and had much to do with the jingle 's success . ( A second Winston jingle by Johnson , using the folk tune " Skip to My Lou " , has faded into obscurity . ) 
 In a departure for the time , the advertising campaign was also used to target distinct niche groups apart from its core clientele of " WASP " smokers , such as American Jews and African Americans . 
 A catchy jingle and ad campaign , it has come to embody a piece of Americana , and has even seeped into the consciousness of people who were too young ( or not even alive ) to remember the campaign when it occurred . The slogan was so well @-@ remembered that it was added to Simpson 's Contemporary Quotations in 1988 . 
 = = Beginnings = = 
 Future R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company president Bowman Gray Jr. was in charge of marketing Winstons , which were a new addition to the R.J. Reynolds line in 1954 . Gray listened to advertising employees from the William Esty Co . , and the slogan " Winston tastes good like a cigarette ought to " was considered , then replaced by the more succinct " Winston tastes good like a cigarette should . " 
 The first print ad appeared in the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette in September 1954 , with an ad in Life following the next month . In 1955 , Winston would take over as the sponsor of Walter Cronkite 's news show , as well as Garry Moore 's variety show ; it was at this time that the first television advertisements aired . 
 = = Radio and television = = 
 In the radio and television advertisements , the slogan is presented in a singsong fashion with a noticeable two @-@ beat clap near the end , so the jingle would sound like Win @-@ <unk> tastes good like a ( clap clap ) cigarette should . The " clap " noise was sometimes substituted for actors in the commercials knocking twice against a truck carrying Winston cigarettes , or an actor flicking his lighter twice to the same conceit . 
 Winston cigarettes were sponsors of such television series as The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones . The former series would show stars Buddy Ebsen , Irene Ryan , and Nancy Kulp extolling the virtues of Winstons while smoking them and reciting the jingle . The latter series would later come under fire for advertising cigarettes on an animated series watched by many children , but Winston pulled their involvement with the series after the Pebbles Flintstone character was born in 1963 . 
 = = Grammar controversy = = 
 During the campaign 's long run in the media , many criticized the slogan as grammatically incorrect and that it should say , " Winston tastes good as a cigarette should . " Ogden Nash , in The New Yorker , published a poem that ran " Like goes Madison Avenue , like so goes the nation . " Walter Cronkite , then hosting The Morning Show , refused to say the line as written , and an announcer was used instead . 
 Malcolm Gladwell , in The Tipping Point , says that this " ungrammatical and somehow provocative use of ' like ' instead of ' as ' created a minor sensation " in 1954 and implies that the phrase itself was responsible for vaulting the brand to second place in the U.S. market . Winston overtook Pall Mall cigarettes as the # 1 cigarette in the United States in 1966 , while the advertising campaign continued to make an impression on the mass media . 
 In the fall of 1961 , a small furor enveloped the literary and journalistic communities in the United States when Merriam @-@ Webster published its Third New International Dictionary . In the dictionary , the editors refused to condemn the use of " like " as a conjunction , and cited " Winston tastes good like a cigarette should " as an example of popular colloquial use . After publication of Webster 's Third , The New York Times called the edition " <unk> , " and the Chicago Daily News wrote that the transgression signified " a general decay in values . " 
 When the players in The Beverly Hillbillies spoke the line , they stretched the grammatical boundaries further : 
 Jed : Winston tastes good ... 
 Granny : Like a cigarette had ought @-@ a ! 
 In 1970 and 1971 , Winston sought to revamp its image and chose to respond to many grammarians ' qualms with the slogan , " What do you want , good grammar or good taste ? " Mad magazine published a parody of this on the back cover of its January 1971 issue ; set in a cemetery , it featured four tombstones with epitaphs written in the past tense ( " Winston tasted good like a cigarette should 've " " You mean ' as a cigarette should 've ' " " What did you want , good grammar or good taste ? " " I wanted to live a lot longer than this ! " ) . With the new slogan in wide use , " Winston tastes good like a cigarette should " was retired permanently in 1972 . 
 In 1981 , actor James Garner claimed responsibility for the wording of the slogan during an interview with Playboy magazine . Garner , who narrated the original commercial , stated that his first action ever to be captured on film was to misread the line that had been provided to him . However , as noted above , the advertisements first appeared in print before their debut on television , which would cast doubt on Garner 's claim . 
 = Manganese = 
 Manganese is a chemical element with symbol Mn and atomic number 25 . It is not found as a free element in nature ; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron . Manganese is a metal with important industrial metal alloy uses , particularly in stainless steels . 
 Historically , manganese is named for various black minerals ( such as pyrolusite ) from the same region of Magnesia in Greece which gave names to similar @-@ sounding magnesium , Mg , and magnetite , an ore of the element iron , Fe . By the mid @-@ 18th century , Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele had used pyrolusite to produce chlorine . Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite ( now known to be manganese dioxide ) contained a new element , but they were unable to isolate it . Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774 , which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon . 
 Manganese <unk> is used for rust and corrosion prevention on steel . <unk> manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors , which depend on the oxidation state of the ions . The <unk> of alkali and alkaline earth metals are powerful oxidizers . Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode ( electron acceptor ) material in zinc @-@ carbon and alkaline batteries . 
 In biology , manganese ( II ) ions function as cofactors for a large variety of enzymes with many functions . Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen . Manganese also functions in the oxygen @-@ evolving complex of photosynthetic plants . The element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms but is a neurotoxin . In larger amounts , and apparently with far greater effectiveness through inhalation , it can cause a poisoning in mammals with neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible .

 Manganese is a silvery @-@ gray metal that resembles iron . It is hard and very brittle , difficult to fuse , but easy to oxidize . Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic . Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes ( " rusts " ) like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen . 
 = = = Isotopes = = = 
 Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope , 55Mn . Eighteen radioisotopes have been isolated and described , the most stable being 53Mn with a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 7 million years , <unk> with a half @-@ life of 312 @.@ 3 days , and <unk> with a half @-@ life of 5 @.@ 591 days . All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half @-@ lives of less than three hours , and the majority of less than one minute . 
 Manganese also has three meta states . Manganese is part of the iron group of elements , which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion . 53Mn decays to 53Cr with a half @-@ life of 3 @.@ 7 million years . Because of its relatively short half @-@ life , 53Mn is relatively rare , produced by cosmic rays impact on iron . Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating . Mn – Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from 26Al and 107Pd for the early history of the solar system . Variations in 53Cr / 52Cr and Mn / Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial 53Mn / 55Mn ratio , which indicates that Mn – Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of 53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies . Hence , 53Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the solar system . The isotopes of manganese range in atomic weight from 46 u ( <unk> ) to 65 u ( <unk> ) . The primary decay mode before the most abundant stable isotope , 55Mn , is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta decay .

 The most common oxidation states of manganese are + 2 , + 3 , + 4 , + 6 , and + 7 , though all oxidation states from − 3 to + 7 have been observed . Mn2 + often competes with Mg2 + in biological systems . Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state + 7 , which are restricted to the unstable oxide <unk> and compounds of the intensely purple permanganate anion <unk> − , are powerful oxidizing agents . Compounds with oxidation states + 5 ( blue ) and + 6 ( green ) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation . 
 The most stable oxidation state for manganese is + 2 , which has a pale pink color , and many manganese ( II ) compounds are known , such as manganese ( II ) sulfate ( <unk> ) and manganese ( II ) chloride ( <unk> ) . This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite ( manganese ( II ) carbonate ) . Manganese ( II ) most commonly exists with a high spin , S

 1 / 2 manganese ( II ) . There are no spin @-@ allowed d – d transitions in manganese ( II ) , explaining why manganese ( II ) compounds are typically pale to colorless . 
 The + 3 oxidation state is known in compounds like manganese ( III ) acetate , but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution , forming manganese ( II ) and manganese ( IV ) . Solid compounds of manganese ( III ) are characterized by its strong purple @-@ red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn @-@ Teller effect . 
 The oxidation state 5 + can be produced by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium nitrite . <unk> ( VI ) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds , such as manganese dioxide , in molten alkali while exposed to air . <unk> ( + 7 oxidation state ) compounds are purple , and can give glass a violet color . Potassium permanganate , sodium permanganate , and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers . Potassium permanganate , also called <unk> 's crystals , is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties ; it is used as a topical medicine ( for example , in the treatment of fish diseases ) . Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy . 
 = = History = = 
 The origin of the name manganese is complex . In ancient times , two black minerals from Magnesia ( located within modern Greece ) were both called magnes from their place of origin , but were thought to differ in gender . The male magnes attracted iron , and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite , and which probably gave us the term magnet . The female magnes ore did not attract iron , but was used to <unk> glass . This feminine magnes was later called magnesia , known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide . Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic . In the 16th century , manganese dioxide was called <unk> ( note the two n 's instead of one ) by glassmakers , possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words , since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia negra ( the black ore ) from magnesia alba ( a white ore , also from Magnesia , also useful in glassmaking ) . Michele <unk> called magnesia negra <unk> , and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese ( German : Mangan ) . The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba ( magnesium oxide ) , which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later . 
 Several colorful oxides of manganese , for example manganese dioxide , are abundant in nature have been used as pigments since the Stone Age . The cave paintings in <unk> that 30 @,@ 000 to 24 @,@ 000 years old contain manganese pigments . 
 Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers , either to add to , or remove color from glass . Use as " glassmakers soap " continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in 14th @-@ century glass from Venice . 
 Because it was used in glassmaking , manganese dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists , the first chemists . Ignatius Gottfried Kaim ( 1770 ) and Johann Glauber ( 17th century ) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate , a useful laboratory reagent . By the mid @-@ 18th century , the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine . First , hydrochloric acid , or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide , later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process . The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores . 
 Scheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element , but they were not able to isolate it . Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774 , by reducing the dioxide with carbon . 
 The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese , making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard . Around the beginning of the 19th century , manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted . In 1816 , it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle . In 1837 , British academic James Couper noted an association between miners ' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson 's disease . In 1912 , United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings , and the process has seen widespread use ever since . 
 The invention of the <unk> cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic <unk> increased the demand of manganese dioxide . Until the development batteries with nickel @-@ cadmium and lithium , most batteries contained manganese . The zinc @-@ carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities . In the 20th century , manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard ( zinc @-@ carbon ) and alkaline types . 
 = = Occurrence and production = = 
 Manganese comprises about 1000 ppm ( 1 % ) of the Earth 's crust , the 12th most abundant of the crust 's elements . Soil contains 7 – 9000 ppm of manganese with an average of 440 ppm . Seawater has only 10 ppm manganese and the atmosphere contains 0 @.@ 01 µg / m3 . Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite ( MnO2 ) , <unk> , ( Mn2 + <unk> + 6 ) ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Ba , H2O ) <unk> , and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite ( <unk> ) . 
 The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite ( MnO2 ) . Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores . Land @-@ based resources are large but irregularly distributed . About 80 % of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa ; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine , Australia , India , China , Gabon and Brazil . According to 1978 estimate , the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules . Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s . 
 In South Africa , most identified deposits are located near <unk> in the Northern Cape Province , with a 2011 estimate of 15 billion tons . In 2011 South Africa produced 3 @.@ 4 million tons , topping all other nations . 
 Manganese is mined in South Africa , Australia , China , Brazil , Gabon , Ukraine , India , Fiji and Ghana and Kazakhstan . US Import Sources ( 1998 – 2001 ) : Manganese ore : Gabon , 70 % ; South Africa , 10 % ; Australia , 9 % ; Mexico , 5 % ; and other , 6 % . <unk> : South Africa , 47 % ; France , 22 % ; Mexico , 8 % ; Australia , 8 % ; and other , 15 % . Manganese contained in all manganese imports : South Africa , 31 % ; Gabon , 21 % ; Australia , 13 % ; Mexico , 8 % ; and other , 27 % . 
 For the production of <unk> , the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon , and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace . The resulting <unk> has a manganese content of 30 to 80 % . Pure manganese used for the production of iron @-@ free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process . 
 A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach . This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap ; the natural gas provides the heat ( needs to be at least 850 ° C ) and the reducing agent ( carbon monoxide ) . This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide ( MnO ) , which is a <unk> form . The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 – 250 μm , increasing the surface area to aid leaching . The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron ( Fe2 + ) in a 1 @.@ 6 : 1 ratio . The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese . This process yields approximately 92 % recovery of the manganese . For further purification , the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility . 
 In 1972 the CIA 's Project <unk> , through billionaire Howard Hughes , commissioned the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor . That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules , which was not actually practical . The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine , the K @-@ 129 , with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books .

 Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in its major applications in metallurgy . In minor applications , ( e.g. , manganese <unk> ) , zinc and sometimes vanadium are viable substitutes .

 Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur @-@ fixing , <unk> , and alloying properties . Steelmaking , including its ironmaking component , has accounted for most manganese demand , presently in the range of 85 % to 90 % of the total <unk> other uses , manganese is a key component of low @-@ cost stainless steel . 
 Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high @-@ melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries . If the manganese content reaches 4 % , the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature . The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at 8 % . Steel containing 8 to 15 % of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to 863 MPa . Steel with 12 % manganese was discovered in 1882 by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel . It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U.S. military . 
 = = = Aluminium alloys = = = 
 The second largest application for manganese is in aluminum alloys . Aluminium with roughly 1 @.@ 5 % manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion . The corrosion @-@ resistant aluminium alloys 3004 and <unk> ( 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 5 % manganese ) are used for most beverage cans . Before year 2000 , more than 1 @.@ 6 million tonnes of those alloys were used ; at 1 % manganese , this consumed 16 @,@ 000 tonnes of manganese .

 <unk> manganese <unk> is used as an additive in unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking . The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the + 1 oxidation state . 
 Manganese ( IV ) oxide ( manganese dioxide , MnO2 ) is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols ( where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring ) . Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination . MnO2 is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints . In some preparations , it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber . 
 Manganese ( IV ) oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc , and is the blackish material in carbon – zinc type flashlight cells . The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide @-@ hydroxide MnO ( OH ) during discharging , preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery . 
 MnO2 + H2O + e − → MnO ( OH ) + OH − 
 The same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries ( usually battery cells ) , which use the same basic reaction , but a different electrolyte mixture . In 2002 , more than 230 @,@ 000 tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose . 
 The metal is occasionally used in coins ; until 2000 , the only United States coin to use manganese was the " wartime " nickel from 1942 to 1945 . An alloy of 75 % copper and 25 % nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins . However , because of shortage of nickel metal during the war , it was substituted by more available silver and manganese , thus resulting in an alloy of 56 % copper , 35 % silver and 9 % manganese . Since 2000 , dollar coins , for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential $ 1 coins , are made from a brass containing 7 % of manganese with a pure copper core . In both cases of nickel and dollar , the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines . In the case of the later U.S. dollar coins , the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper / nickel alloy used in the previous Susan B. Anthony dollar . 
 Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass . The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds . In the glass industry , manganese compounds are used for two effects . Manganese ( III ) reacts with iron ( II ) to induce a strong green color in glass by forming less @-@ colored iron ( III ) and slightly pink manganese ( II ) , compensating for the residual color of the iron ( III ) . Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass . 
 = = Biological role = = 
 Manganese is an important element for human health , essential for development , metabolism , and the antioxidant system . Nevertheless , excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism , a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson 's disease . The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases , transferases , hydrolases , <unk> , <unk> , ligases , lectins , and <unk> . The reverse <unk> of many retroviruses ( though not lentiviruses such as HIV ) contain manganese . The best @-@ known manganese @-@ containing polypeptides may be <unk> , the diphtheria toxin , and Mn @-@ containing superoxide dismutase ( Mn @-@ SOD ) . 
 Mn @-@ SOD is the type of SOD present in eukaryotic mitochondria , and also in most bacteria ( this fact is in keeping with the bacterial @-@ origin theory of mitochondria ) . The Mn @-@ SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient , for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide ( O − 
 2 ) , formed from the 1 @-@ electron reduction of dioxygen . The exceptions , which are all bacteria , include Lactobacillus plantarum and related <unk> , which use a different <unk> mechanism with manganese ( Mn2 + ) ions complexed with polyphosphate , suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life . 
 The manganese dietary reference intake for a 44 year old human male is 2 @.@ 3 mg per day from food , with 11 mg estimated as the tolerable upper limit for daily intake to avoid toxicity . Estimates for females and children are generally less . The essential minimum intake is unknown since manganese deficiency is so rare . The human body contains about 12 mg of manganese , mostly in the bones . The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys . In the human brain , the manganese is bound to manganese <unk> , most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes . 
 Manganese is also important in photosynthetic oxygen evolution in chloroplasts in plants . The oxygen @-@ evolving complex ( <unk> ) is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts ; it is responsible for the terminal <unk> of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis , and has a <unk> core containing four atoms of manganese . To fulfill this requirement , most broad @-@ spectrum plant fertilizers contain manganese . 
 = = Precautions = = 
 Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals , such as nickel and copper . However , exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of 5 mg / m3 even for short periods because of its toxicity level . Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders . 
 The permanganate exhibits a higher toxicity than the manganese ( II ) compounds . The fatal dose is about 10 g , and several fatal intoxications have occurred . The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane . For example , the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed . Only a limited amount is absorbed by the intestines , but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver . 
 In 2005 , a study suggested a possible link between manganese inhalation and central nervous system toxicity in rats . 
 Manganese exposure in United States is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) . People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it . OSHA has set the legal limit ( permissible exposure limit ) for manganese exposure in the workplace as 5 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday . The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ) has set a recommended exposure limit ( REL ) of 1 mg / m3 over an 8 @-@ hour workday and a short term limit of 3 mg / m3 . At levels of 500 mg / m3 , manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health . 
 Generally , exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 μg Mn / m3 can lead to Mn @-@ induced symptoms . Increased <unk> protein expression in human embryonic kidney ( <unk> ) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity , characterized by the reversal of Mn @-@ reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage .

 Waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese . According to results from a 2010 study , higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school @-@ age children . It is hypothesized that long @-@ term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8 @.@ 7 million Americans at risk . However , data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess . 
 = = = Manganese in gasoline = = = 
 <unk> manganese <unk> ( MMT ) is a gasoline additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded <unk> to improve the octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates . It reduces engine knock agent through the action of the carbonyl groups . Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides , which damage exhaust valves . The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with an increased octane ratings . Such fuels , directly or in mixture with non @-@ reformed distillates , are universal in developed countries ( <unk> , Japan , etc . ) . In the USA , the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate , combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000 , encouraged refineries to use MMT . Compared to 1953 , levels of manganese in air have dropped . Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and <unk> . MMT contains 24 @.@ 4 – 25 @.@ 2 % manganese . Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density .

 Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with manganism , a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation . Historically , persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism ; however , current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations . The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper , who studied two patients who were manganese grinders . 
 <unk> is a biphasic disorder . In its early stages , an intoxicated person may experience depression , mood swings , compulsive behaviors , and psychosis . Early neurological symptoms give way to late @-@ stage manganism , which resembles Parkinson 's disease . Symptoms include weakness , monotone and slowed speech , an expressionless face , tremor , forward @-@ leaning gait , inability to walk backwards without falling , rigidity , and general problems with dexterity , gait and balance . Unlike Parkinson 's disease , manganism is not associated with loss of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L @-@ DOPA . Symptoms of late @-@ stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal .

 Several recent studies attempt to examine the effects of chronic low @-@ dose manganese overexposure on child development . The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi . Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240 – 350 µg Mn / L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300 µg Mn / L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400 µg Mn / L by the World Health Organization , the 92 children sampled ( between 11 and 13 years of age ) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity , short @-@ term memory , and visual identification , compared to children from an uncontaminated area . More recently , a study of 10 @-@ year @-@ old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores . A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610 µg Mn / L ; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160 µg Mn / L well . Children in the experimental group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior . 
 The current maximum safe concentration under EPA rules is 50 µg Mn / L.

 Tom <unk> ( Alan Autry ) , an old friend and baseball teammate of bartender Sam Malone ( Ted Danson ) , announces in his forthcoming autobiography that he is homosexual . At a press conference held at the bar , Sam is shocked about Tom 's revelation . Diane Chambers ( Shelley Long ) helps Sam to calm down , and they discuss Tom . Moments later , Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality , which local newspapers report on their front pages . The next day , as they read the newspaper , the bar 's regular patrons — including Norm ( George Wendt ) — express their disdain toward homosexuals and their worries that Sam 's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar . Diane criticizes their homophobia and says that there are actually two gay men in the bar . 
 The regulars conclude that three male newcomers are homosexual and try to persuade Sam to escort them from the bar . Sam becomes concerned about dividing his loyalties between his regular customers and potential gay customers . Employees and regulars — pulled in by Diane — argue over the three newcomers in the billiard room . When three newcomers congratulate Sam for his support of Tom , Sam decides to not eject them and to avoid discriminating between his customers . Norm and the other regulars trick the three men into assuming that 7 : 00 pm is the last call for drinks at and escort them from the bar . Diane tells the regulars that the men they escorted out are not homosexual and that the two gay men are still present . The two men in question kiss Norm on his cheeks .

 Ben Shapiro , author of Primetime Propaganda , called " The Boys in the Bar " an episode that pushes a liberal agenda " in a soft and funny manner [ that ] peppered the first season " . Shapiro said the episode 's ending shows " how wrong and silly [ Norm ] is " about homosexuality , and it is " simply too awkward for the general public " . Cory Barker from the website TV Surveillance disdained Norm 's comments about homosexuals but called them " honest for the time and circumstances " . 
 According to the book , What 's Good on TV , Sam 's concerns about losing regular , anti @-@ homosexual bar customers if Cheers were to become a gay bar is depicted as sympathetic towards regulars and " a practical argument " instead of a " strong moral argument " . Stephen Tropiano called this episode " the definite highlight of Season One " in PopMatters and , in the 2002 book The Prime Time Closet , Tropiano called it a moral lesson about judging a person based on appearances . Nevertheless , Tropiano said that the fictional baseball player Tom <unk> is typical of gay characters who are related to a series regular , appear just once , are exploited for delivering a message about homosexuality to the audience , and are then discarded , never to be " seen , heard , or mentioned again " . 
 The A.V. Club critics discussed this episode in 2012 . Phil Nugent found this episode unfunny and intended as a message to tolerate homosexuals by making Norm and other regulars appear " ridiculous " . Noel Murray said that the episode 's " bifurcated structure " prevented more development for Sam 's old baseball team mate , and Murray found " stereotypes " of gay men dated .

 = Transformation playing card = 
 A transformation playing card ( sometimes referred to as a transformation deck when assembled into a complete set ) is a type of playing card where an artist incorporates the pips of the non @-@ face cards into an artistic design . In a classical transformation playing card , the pips retain their standard position and coloration on the card . In some variations , the pips may be different in size , location or color . There is some debate as to whether these cards , often referred to as semi @-@ transformed , should be considered true transformation playing cards . 
 = = History = = 
 By the 19th century , the standard form for playing cards had become fixed in most of Europe and America . French cards used hearts , diamonds , spades and clubs . German cards used acorns , leaves , hearts and bells . It was at this time that designers in Germany , France and England began to draw small figures around the pips . 
 The first transformation playing cards were created by D.W. Soltan and D. Berger in 1801 as illustrations for a German edition of <unk> . The cards illustrated were the 2 of hearts , 3 of hearts , 5 of hearts and 8 of hearts . In 1803 , John Nixon published the first complete set ( 52 cards ) of transformed cards . Titled Metastasis , this collection was also published as illustrations on sheets of paper . In 1804 , J.C. Cotta , a publisher and bookseller in Tübingen , Germany , produced the first set of transformation cards that was published as an actual deck of playing cards . These decks were published as almanacs , in which each of the 52 cards corresponded to one of the 52 weeks of the year . 
 In 1865 Dean and Son published a deck in which the pips have been changed in both size and location , being placed at the artist 's whim . Collectors debate as to whether or not this deck should be considered a transformation deck , due to these differences . The Dean and Son deck remained the only deck to <unk> the pips until the 1970s , when the practice gained some popularity . Today , cards that do not strictly adhere to standard pip placement , size and color are referred to as semi @-@ transformation playing cards . 
 An article entitled " Playing Card <unk> . " was published in the December 1910 issue of Strand Magazine . Several Cotta cards were pictured , erroneously attributed to an unnamed French artist . Strand subsequently asked its readers to submit their own designs for card squiggles , which the magazine periodically published . John Butler Yeats was one of the first to contribute a card design to the magazine . The feature remained popular for some time .

 Transformation playing cards like Art for the Earth by The Friends of the Earth and Under the Sea by the Marine Stewardship Counsel , are created for charity purposes , with different artists contributing art for each card . Similarly , other collective projects like Ultimate Deck from Dan & Dave and Stranger & Stranger or the series from Black Rock Collective brings multiple artists together to create semi @-@ transformation decks . 
 One of the more notable contemporary sets is the award winning The Key to the Kingdom , a semi @-@ transformation deck commissioned by London 's V & A Museum of Childhood and created by Tony <unk> . It won the WH Smith Literary Award for best illustration and The Designers and Art Directory Association of London gold award . This set of cards was created around the theme of nursery rhymes and poems . The cards were sold with a book containing each poem and a picture of the corresponding card on the opposite page . Additionally , the deck was constructed as a puzzle contest laid out in the form of an original poem . The poem gave clues to pick certain cards , which then could be decrypted into a secret message . The prize of $ 10 @,@ 000 and a golden key was won by Susan Kavanagh of Essex . 
 With the advent of Kickstarter and other crowdfunded websites , individual artists are more easily able to bring transformation and semi @-@ transformation decks to the public . Notable examples include the series of semi @-@ transformation decks from Emmanuel Jose ( including Curator and <unk> Wings ) and Dave Ufford 's traditional transformation <unk> . 
 = Eaten Alive ( TV special ) = 
 Eaten Alive is an American nature documentary special which aired on Discovery Channel on December 7 , 2014 . The special focused on an expedition by wildlife author and entertainer Paul Rosolie to locate a green anaconda named " Chumana " , which he believed to be the world 's longest , in a remote location of the Amazon rainforest . The special was also purportedly to feature Rosolie being " eaten " by an anaconda , protected by a suit designed specifically for this purpose . 
 Though Rosolie stated that the special was intended to draw attention to wildlife conservation and the destruction of the Amazon , the special was condemned prior to its premiere by critics and the animal rights group PETA as an inhumane publicity stunt oriented towards shock value , resulting in calls for Discovery Channel to pull the special . After its premiere , Eaten Alive was widely criticized for false advertising . It did feature Rosolie attempting to feed himself to an anaconda , and the snake did attack , but did not swallow Rosolie as the title of the special implied . The stunt itself was called off due to safety concerns . One critic compared the special to The Mystery of Al Capone 's Vaults — a television event that ended with a similarly disappointing outcome that did not meet promoted expectations .

 A teaser for Eaten Alive was first broadcast during Discovery Channel 's telecast of Nik <unk> 's high wire crossings in Chicago on November 2 , 2014 . The special purported to feature Paul Rosolie being " eaten " by , and retrieved from , a live anaconda . Shortly afterward , Discovery Channel released further information surrounding the special , including a statement by Rosolie . He explained that Eaten Alive was intended to draw attention to wildlife conservation , stating : 
 I 've seen first @-@ hand how the Amazon Rainforest is being destroyed . It is so rampant that we may be the last generation with the opportunity to save it . People need to wake up to what is going on . What better way is there to shock people than to put my life on the line with the largest snake on the planet , the Green Anaconda ? 
 The statements also implied his survival of the stunt , as the special had already been filmed . 
 Rosolie wore a " custom @-@ built snake @-@ proof suit " whilst performing the stunt to keep both him and the snake safe , and to counter threats that would be encountered during the stunt . The suit consisted of multiple layers of equipment , including a cooling vest to control his body temperature , a <unk> suit to protect against stomach acid , a mix of carbon fiber and chainmail armor to protect against impact and bites , and an externally supplied oxygen mask covered by a carbon fiber helmet . The suit was designed to withstand up to 300 psi of pressure , about three times stronger than the grip of an anaconda , which is estimated to only be around 90 psi . Rosolie also ingested a wireless device which allowed his crew to monitor his vital signs . 
 Eaten Alive proved to be controversial even before its premiere , attracting criticism from animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) , who argued that Rosolie 's stunt was an example of animal cruelty , while an online petition on Change.org urging Discovery Channel to pull the special reached over 25 @,@ 000 signatures . PETA objected to the use of an animal for " entertainment " , and went on to say that " making this snake use up energy by swallowing this fool and then possibly regurgitating him would have left the poor animal exhausted and deprived of the energy that he or she needs . Shame on this pseudo ' wildlife expert ' for tormenting this animal , and shame on the Discovery Channel for giving him the incentive to do so . " 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Eaten Alive focused primarily on Rosolie 's expedition to the " Floating Forest " , a remote area of the Amazon rainforest , to search for and capture a large green anaconda named " Chumana " , which he believed was longer than 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) , the length of the world 's longest known anaconda . His eventual goal was to be " eaten " by the snake in an effort to promote wildlife conservation . Rosolie and his crew were unable to find Chumana , but he continued with his goal of being " eaten " by an anaconda . Rosolie was supplied with a captive , 20 foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) anaconda for use in the stunt , and he equipped himself with a specially designed protective suit , which was doused in pig blood as bait . As it had affected his range of motion , Rosolie removed some of the padding from his suit that protected his arms . While the snake would constrict him and attempt to bite his head , Rosolie halted the stunt after an hour , showing concern that the anaconda 's wrap would break his arm . 
 In regards to the outcome , Rosolie explained that the anaconda " [ got ] my arm into a position where her force was fully on my exposed arm . I started to feel the blood drain out of my hand , and I felt the bone flex . And when I got to the point where I felt like it was going to snap , I had to tap out . " 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 Eaten Alive premiered on December 7 , 2014 , kicking off a special week of programming on Discovery Channel known as " Mega Week " , which the network promoted as a " weeklong celebration of all things Discovery . " The special was seen by 4 @.@ 1 million viewers , making it Discovery Channel 's highest @-@ rated nature program since Life in 2010 . It was also the second @-@ most popular television program of the night on social media , behind Sunday Night Football . 
 Prior to the broadcast , alongside similar concerns for the well @-@ being of the snake , Laura Bradley of Slate argued that Eaten Alive was a further example of Discovery Channel 's recent uses of sensationalism and pseudoscience to attract viewers , as opposed to airing content that is legitimately educational . She compared the special to Shark Week ( which she described as the network 's " biggest pieces of viewer bait " for " capitalizing on people 's fear of sharks while simultaneously <unk> the public about an animal that is actually in danger " ) , the aforementioned Nik <unk> specials , and fictitious mermaid documentaries broadcast by sister network Animal Planet . 
 Following its broadcast , Eaten Alive was widely criticized by viewers and the media for false advertising , as the majority of the two @-@ hour special dealt with the search for Chumana , and as the anaconda did not swallow him as was advertised . Although promotional material on Discovery Channel 's website claimed that Rosolie would enter the anaconda , its press release for the special stated that there was only a possibility that he would . Reaction to the special on social media was negative , with comparisons being drawn to the online practice of <unk> , a Twitter user remarking that " calling this ' Getting Squeezed Really Hard ' didn 't sound as enticing " , and others making references to a line from Sir Mix @-@ a @-@ Lot 's song " Baby Got Back " referencing an " anaconda " in connection to the special . 
 Writing for The Guardian , Brian Moylan compared Eaten Alive to The Mystery of Al Capone 's Vaults — Geraldo Riviera 's infamous live television special that featured the 1986 opening of a secret vault once owned by Al Capone , which was purported to contain valuable items but ended up only containing debris . Moylan believed that much like the vault , " Rosolie is also nothing more than a lot of dust and a few empty Coke bottles . " However , he did praise the style of the remainder of the special , comparing it to a horror movie and describing it as being " much more dramatic and much better than it needed to be , which is a considerable accomplishment . " 
 PETA made further remarks criticizing Discovery Channel 's decision to go on with the special despite its earlier objections , arguing that " study after study has shown that entertainment features such as this one that show humans interfering with and handling wild animals are detrimental to species conservation . Rosolie knows this . Discovery knows this . Yet they chose to contrive and air this shameful stunt for ratings anyway . " In a statement following the broadcast , Discovery Channel re @-@ affirmed that the safety of Rosolie and the anaconda were a top priority , and that he " created this challenge to get maximum attention for one of the most beautiful and threatened parts of the world , the Amazon Rainforest and its wildlife . He went to great lengths to send this message and it was his absolute intention to be eaten alive . " 
 1 @-@ 800 Contacts broadcast a new commercial , featuring a character having been eaten by a snake , during Eaten Alive . The commercial 's similar theming was coincidental , as it was produced prior to the announcement of the special . However , after learning of the special , the company 's agency Pereira & O 'Dell moved up the premiere of the ad , which was originally scheduled for January 2015 , so it could air during Eaten Alive . The advert itself was also amended in reference to the special , with the character remarking that he hoped his predicament would " make [ him ] famous . " In a posting about the ad on Twitter following the special , the company noted that unlike the show itself , " someone was actually inside the snake . " 
 = Spencer Tracy = 
 Spencer Bonaventure Tracy ( April 5 , 1900 – June 10 , 1967 ) was an American actor , noted for his natural style and versatility . One of the major stars of Hollywood 's Golden Age , Tracy was nominated for nine Academy Awards for Best Actor and won two , sharing the record for nominations in that category with Laurence Olivier . 
 Tracy first discovered his talent for acting while attending Ripon College , and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts . He spent seven years in the theatre , working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway . Tracy 's breakthrough came in 1930 , when his lead performance in The Last Mile caught the attention of Hollywood . After a successful film debut in Up the River , Tracy was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation . His five years with Fox were unremarkable , and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films . 
 In 1935 Tracy joined Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , at the time Hollywood 's most prestigious studio . His career flourished with a series of hit films , and in 1937 and 1938 he won consecutive Oscars for Captains Courageous and Boys Town . By the 1940s , Tracy was one of the studio 's top stars . In 1942 he appeared with Katharine Hepburn in Woman of the Year , beginning a popular partnership that produced nine movies over 25 years . Tracy left MGM in 1955 and continued to work regularly as a freelance star , despite an increasing weariness as he aged . His personal life was troubled , with a lifelong struggle against alcoholism and guilt over his son 's deafness . Tracy became estranged from his wife in the 1930s , but never divorced , conducting a long @-@ term relationship with Katharine Hepburn in private . Towards the end of his life , Tracy worked almost exclusively for director Stanley Kramer . It was for Kramer that he made his last film , Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner in 1967 , completed just 17 days before Tracy 's death . 
 During his career , Tracy appeared in 75 films and developed a reputation among his peers as one of the screen 's greatest actors . In 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Tracy as the 9th greatest male star of Classic Hollywood Cinema . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tracy was born on April 5 , 1900 , in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . He was the second son of Caroline Brown ( 1874 – 1942 ) and John Edward Tracy ( 1873 – 1928 ) , a truck salesman . His mother was a Presbyterian from a wealthy Midwestern family , and his father was of Irish Catholic background . His one brother , Carroll , was four years older . 
 Spencer was a difficult and hyperactive child with poor school attendance . Raised as a Catholic , at nine years old he was placed in the care of Dominican nuns in the hope of transforming his behavior . Later in life he remarked , " I never would have gone back to school if there had been any other way of learning to read the subtitles in the movies . " He became fascinated with motion pictures , watching the same ones repeatedly and then re @-@ enacting scenes to his friends and neighbors . Tracy attended several Jesuit academies in his teenage years , which he claimed took the " badness " out of him and helped him improve his grades . At Marquette Academy he met future actor Pat O 'Brien , and the pair began attending plays together , awakening Tracy 's interest in the theatre . 
 With little care for his studies and " itching for a chance to go and see some excitement " , Tracy enlisted in the United States Navy when he turned 18 . He was sent to the Naval Training Station in North Chicago , where he was still a student when World War I came to an end . He achieved the rank of seaman second class , but never went to sea , and was discharged in February 1919 . John Tracy 's desire to see one of his sons gain a college degree drove Tracy back to high school to finish his diploma . Studies at two more institutions , plus the additional allowance of " war credits " , won Tracy a place at Ripon College . He entered Ripon in February 1921 , declaring his intention to major in medicine . 
 Tracy was a popular student at Ripon , where he served as president of his hall and was involved in a number of college activities . He made his stage debut in June 1921 , playing the male lead in The Truth . Tracy was very well received in this role and he quickly developed a passion for the stage . He formed an acting company with friends , which they called " The Campus Players " and took on tour . As a member of the college debate team , Tracy excelled in arguing and public speaking . It was during a tour with his debate team that Tracy auditioned for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts ( AADA ) in New York City . He was offered a scholarship to attend the school after performing a scene from one of his earlier roles . 
 Tracy left Ripon , and began classes at AADA in April 1922 . He was deemed fit to progress to the senior class , allowing him to join the academy stock company . Tracy made his New York debut in October 1922 , in a play called The Wedding Guests , and then his Broadway debut three months later playing a wordless robot in R.U.R. He graduated from AADA in March 1923 .

 Immediately following graduation , Tracy joined a new stock company based in White Plains , New York where he was given periphery roles . Unhappy there , he moved to a company in Cincinnati , but failed to make an impact . In November 1923 he landed a small part on Broadway in the comedy A Royal Fandango , starring Ethel Barrymore . Reviews for the show were poor and it closed after 25 performances ; Tracy later said of the failure , " My ego took an awful beating . " When he took a position with a struggling company in New Jersey , Tracy was living on an allowance of 35 cents a day . In January 1924 he played his first leading role with a company in Winnipeg , but the organization soon closed . 
 Tracy finally achieved some success by joining forces with the notable stock manager William H. Wright in the spring of 1924 . A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle , who had already made her name on Broadway . It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received . One of these shows brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer , who offered him the lead in a new play . The <unk> previewed in October 1925 , but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut . Dejected , Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit . 
 In the fall of 1926 , Tracy was offered his third shot at Broadway : a role in a new George M. Cohan play called Yellow . Tracy swore that if the play failed to be a hit he would leave stock and work in a " regular " business instead . Tracy was nervous about working with Cohan — one of the most important figures in American theatre — but during rehearsals Cohan announced , " Tracy , you 're the best goddamned actor I 've ever seen ! " Yellow opened on September 21 ; reviews were mixed but it ran for 135 performances . It was the beginning of an important collaboration for Tracy : " I 'd have quit the stage completely , " he later commented , " if it hadn 't been for George M. Cohan . " Cohan wrote a part specifically for Tracy in his next play , The Baby Cyclone . It opened on Broadway in September 1927 and proved to be a hit . 
 Tracy followed this success with another Cohan play , Whispering Friends , and in 1929 took over from Clark Gable in Conflict , a Broadway drama . A variety of other roles followed , but it was the lead in Dread , written by Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning dramatist Owen Davis that gave Tracy high hopes for success . The story of a man 's descent into madness , Dread previewed in Brooklyn to an excellent reception , but the very next day — October 29 — the New York stock market crashed . Unable to attain funding , Dread did not open on Broadway . Following this disappointment , Tracy considered leaving the theatre and returning to Milwaukee for a more stable life . 
 In January 1930 , Tracy was approached about a new play called The Last Mile . Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row , producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy , and later recounted : " beneath the surface , here was a man of passion , violence , sensitivity and desperation : no ordinary man , and just the man for the part . " The Last Mile opened on Broadway in February , where Tracy 's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls . The Commonweal described him as " one of our best and most versatile young actors " . The play was a hit with critics , and ran for 289 performances . 
 = = = Fox ( 1930 – 35 ) = = = 
 In 1930 , Broadway was being heavily scouted for actors to work in the " talkies " , the new medium of sound film . Tracy was cast in two Vitaphone short movies ( Taxi Talks and The Hard Guy ) , but he had not considered becoming a film actor : " I had no ambition in that direction and I was perfectly happy on the stage " , he later explained in an interview . One of the scouts who saw Tracy in The Last Mile was director John Ford . Ford wanted Tracy for the lead role in his next picture , a prison movie . Production company Fox Film Corporation were unsure about Tracy , saying that he did not photograph well , but Ford convinced them that he was right for the role . Up the River ( 1930 ) marked the film debut of both Tracy and Humphrey Bogart . After seeing the rushes , Fox immediately offered Tracy a long @-@ term contract . Knowing that he needed the money for his family — his young son was deaf and recovering from polio — Tracy signed with Fox and moved to California . He appeared on the stage again only once more in his life . 
 Winfield Sheehan , the head of Fox , committed to making Tracy a bankable commodity . The studio went to efforts to promote the actor , releasing adverts for his second film Quick Millions ( 1931 ) with the headline " A New Star Shines . " Three films were made in quick succession , all of which were unsuccessful at the box office . Tracy found himself typecast in comedies , usually playing a crook or a con man . The mold was broken with his seventh picture , Disorderly Conduct ( 1932 ) , and it was the first of his films since Up the River to make a profit . 
 In mid @-@ 1932 , after nine pictures , Tracy remained virtually unknown to the public . He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal , but a rise in his weekly rate to $ 1 @,@ 500 convinced him to stay . He continued to appear in unpopular films , with Me and My Gal ( 1932 ) setting an all @-@ time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City . He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20 @,@ 000 Years in Sing Sing ( 1932 ) , a prison drama co @-@ starring Bette Davis . Tracy was hopeful that it would be his break @-@ out role , but despite good reviews this failed to materialize . 
 Critics began to notice Tracy with The Power and the Glory ( 1933 ) . The story of a man 's rise to prosperity , written by Preston Sturges , Tracy 's performance as railroad tycoon Tom Garner received uniformly strong reviews . William Wilkerson of The Hollywood Reporter wrote : " This sterling performer has finally been given an opportunity to show an ability that has been boxed in by gangster roles ... [ the film ] has introduced Mr. Tracy as one of the screen 's best performers " . Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times stated : " No more convincing performance has been given on the screen than Spencer Tracy 's impersonation of Tom Garner . " Shanghai Madness ( 1933 ) , meanwhile , gave Tracy a previously unseen sex appeal and served to advance his standing . Despite this attention , Tracy 's next two movies went largely unnoticed . Man 's Castle ( 1933 ) with Loretta Young was anticipated to be a hit , but made only a small profit . The Show Off ( 1934 ) , for which he was lent to Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , proved popular , but his subsequent outings continued to be unsuccessful . 
 Tracy drank heavily during his years with Fox , and gained a reputation as an alcoholic . He failed to report for filming on Marie Galante in June 1934 , and was found in his hotel room , virtually unconscious after a two @-@ week binge . Tracy was removed from the Fox payroll while he recovered in a hospital , and then sued for $ 125 @,@ 000 for delaying the production . He completed only two more pictures with the studio . 
 The details on how Tracy 's relationship with Fox ended are unclear : later in life Tracy maintained that he was fired for his drunken behavior , but the Fox records do not support such an account . He was still under contract with the studio when MGM expressed their interest in the actor . They were in need of a new male star , and contacted Tracy on April 2 , 1935 , offering him a seven @-@ year deal . That afternoon , the contract between Tracy and Fox was terminated " by mutual consent " . Tracy made a total of 25 pictures in the five years he was with Fox Film Corporation , most of which lost money at the box office .

 = = = = Growing reputation = = = = 
 In the 1930s , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer was the most respected movie production studio in Hollywood . When Tracy arrived there , his own reputation was not strong . Biographer James Curtis writes : " Tracy was scarcely a blip on the box office barometer in 1935 , a critics ' darling and little more " . He was , however , well known for being a troublemaker . Producer Irving G. Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor , telling journalist Louella Parsons : " Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM 's most valuable stars . " 
 Curtis notes that the studio managed Tracy with care , a welcome change from the ineptitude he had known at Fox , which was like " a shot of adrenaline " for the actor . His first film under the new contract was the quickly produced The Murder Man ( 1935 ) , which included the feature film debut of James Stewart . Thalberg then began a strategy of pairing Tracy with the studio 's top actresses : <unk> ( 1935 ) co @-@ starred Myrna Loy and was a commercial success . <unk> ( 1936 ) put Tracy opposite Jean Harlow . Both films were , however , designed and promoted to showcase their leading ladies , thus continuing Tracy 's reputation as a secondary star . 
 Fury ( 1936 ) was the first film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit . Directed by Fritz Lang , Tracy played a man who swears revenge after narrowly escaping death by a lynch mob . The film and performance received excellent reviews . It was popular with the public , going on to make $ 1 @.@ 3 million worldwide . Curtis writes : " audiences who , just a year earlier , had no clear handle on him , were suddenly turning out to see him . It was a transition that was nothing short of miraculous ... [ and showed ] a willingness on the part of the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life . " 
 Fury was followed one month later with the release of the big @-@ budget disaster movie San Francisco ( 1936 ) . Tracy played a supporting role alongside Clark Gable in the film , allowing audiences to see him with the top male star in Hollywood . Taking on the role of a priest , Tracy reportedly felt a heavy responsibility in representing the church . Despite having only 17 minutes of screen time , Tracy was highly praised for his performance and received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor . San Francisco became the highest grossing picture of 1936 . Donald Deschner , in his book on Tracy , credits Fury and San Francisco as the " two films that changed his career and gave him the status of a major star . " 
 By this point , Tracy entered a period of self @-@ imposed sobriety and MGM expressed pleasure with Tracy 's professionalism . His public reputation continued to grow with <unk> Lady ( 1936 ) , a screwball comedy that cast him with William Powell , Loy and Harlow . According to Curtis , " Powell , Harlow and Loy were among the biggest draws in the industry , and equal billing in such a powerhouse company could only serve to advance Tracy 's standing " . <unk> Lady was his third hit picture in the space of six months . 
 = = = = Oscar wins = = = = 
 Tracy appeared in four movies in 1937 . They Gave Him a Gun went largely unnoticed , but Captains Courageous was one of the major film events of the year . Tracy played a Portuguese fisherman in the adventure movie , based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling . He was uncomfortable feigning a foreign accent , and resented having his hair curled , but the role was a hit with audiences and Tracy won the Academy Award for Best Actor . Captains Courageous was followed by Big City with Luise Rainer and Mannequin with Joan Crawford , the latter of which took good billings at the box office . With two years of hit movies and industry recognition , Tracy became a star in the United States . A 1937 poll of 20 million people to find the " King and Queen of Hollywood " ranked Tracy sixth among males . Tracy was reunited with Gable and Loy for 1938 's Test Pilot . The film was another commercial and critical success , permanently cementing the notion of Gable and Tracy as a team . 
 Based on the positive response he had received in San Francisco , MGM again cast Tracy as a priest in Boys Town ( 1938 ) . Portraying Edward J. Flanagan , a Catholic priest and founder of Boys Town , was a role Tracy took seriously : " I 'm so anxious to do a good job as Father Flanagan that it worries me , keeps me awake at night . " Tracy received strong reviews for his performance , and the movie grossed $ 4 million worldwide . For the second year running , Tracy received an Academy Award for Best Actor . He was humble about the recognition , saying in his acceptance speech : " I honestly do not feel that I can accept this award ... I can accept it only as it was meant to be for a great man — Father Flanagan " . He immediately sent the Academy Award statuette to Flanagan . Tracy was listed as the fifth biggest money @-@ making star of 1938 . 
 Tracy was absent from screens for almost a year before returning to Twentieth Century @-@ Fox on loan and appearing as Henry M. Stanley in Stanley and Livingstone , his only film of 1939 . Curtis maintains that Tracy 's non @-@ visibility did little to affect his standing with the public or exhibitors . In October of that year , a Fortune magazine survey to find the nation 's favorite movie actor listed Tracy in first place . 
 = = = = Established star = = = = 
 MGM capitalized on Tracy 's popularity , casting him in four movies for 1940 . I Take This Woman with Hedy Lamarr was a critical and commercial failure , but the historical drama Northwest Passage — Tracy 's first film in Technicolor — proved popular . He then portrayed Thomas Edison in Edison , the Man . Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune was not charmed by the story , but wrote that Tracy , " by sheer persuasion of his acting " , made the film worthy . Boom Town was the third and final Gable @-@ Tracy picture , also featuring Claudette Colbert and Hedy Lamarr , making it one of the most anticipated films of the year . The film opened to the biggest crowd since Gone With the Wind . 
 Tracy signed a new contract with MGM in April 1941 , which paid $ 5 @,@ 000 a week and limited him to three pictures a year ( Tracy had previously expressed a need to reduce his workload ) . The contract also stated for the first time that his billing was to be " that of a star " . Contrary to popular belief , the contract did not include a clause that he receive top billing , but from this point onward , every film Tracy appeared in featured his name in pole position . 
 In 1941 , Tracy returned to the role of Father Flanagan in Men of Boys Town . It was followed later that year by Tracy 's only venture into the horror genre , an adaptation of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , co @-@ starring Ingrid Bergman and Lana Turner . Tracy was unhappy with the film , disliking the heavy make @-@ up he needed to portray Hyde . Critical response to the film was mixed . Theodore Strauss of The New York Times wrote that " Mr. Tracy 's portrait of Hyde is not so much evil incarnate as it is the ham rampant . " The film was popular with audiences , however , taking in more than $ 2 million at the box office . 
 Tracy was set to star in a film version of The Yearling for 1942 , but on @-@ set difficulties and bad weather forced the production to close . With the end of that project , he became available for the new Katharine Hepburn movie , Woman of the Year ( 1942 ) . Hepburn greatly admired Tracy , calling him " the best movie actor there was " . She had wanted him for her comeback vehicle , The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) . Hepburn was delighted that Tracy was available for Woman of the Year , saying " I was just damned grateful he was willing to work with me . " The romantic comedy performed well at the box office and received strong reviews . William Boehnel wrote in the New York World @-@ Telegram , " To begin with , it has Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy in the leading roles . This in itself would be enough to make any film memorable . But when you get Tracy and Hepburn turning in brilliant performances to boot , you 've got something to cheer about . " 
 Woman of the Year was followed by an adaptation of John Steinbeck 's Tortilla Flat ( 1942 ) which met with a tepid response . MGM did not hesitate to repeat the teaming of Tracy and Hepburn and cast them in the dark mystery Keeper of the Flame ( 1942 ) . Despite a weak critical reception the film was a popular success , outgrossing its predecessor and confirming the strength of the partnership . 
 Tracy 's next three appearances were all war @-@ based . A Guy Named Joe ( 1943 ) with Irene Dunne surpassed San Francisco to become his highest @-@ grossing film to date . The Seventh Cross ( 1944 ) , about an escape from a Nazi concentration camp , met with critical acclaim . It was followed by the aviation film Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo ( 1944 ) . On the strength of these three releases , the annual Quigley poll revealed Tracy was MGM 's biggest money @-@ making star of 1944 . His only film the following year was Without Love ( 1945 ) , a third film with Hepburn that performed well at the box office despite muted enthusiasm from critics .

 In 1945 , Tracy returned to the stage for the first time in 15 years . He had been through a dark patch personally — culminating with a stay in hospital — and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus . Tracy told a journalist in April , " I 'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act . " The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood . It first previewed in Providence on September 28 , to a sold out crowd and tepid response . It was a difficult production ; director Garson Kanin later wrote : " In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated . Spencer was tense and unbending , could not , or would not , take direction " . Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway , and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show . It closed on January 19 , 1946 , after 81 performances . Tracy later explained to a friend : " I couldn 't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night ... At least every day is a new day for me in films ... But this thing — every day , every day , over and over again . " 
 Tracy was absent from screens in 1946 , the first year since his motion picture debut that there was no Spencer Tracy release . His next film was The Sea of Grass ( 1947 ) a drama set in the American Old West with Hepburn . Similarly to Keeper of the Flame and Without Love , a lukewarm response from critics did not stop it from being a financial success both at home and abroad . He followed it later that year with Cass <unk> , in which he played a judge . It was a commercial success , but Curtis notes that co @-@ star Lana Turner overshadowed Tracy in most of the reviews . 
 A fifth film with Hepburn came in 1948 , Frank Capra 's political drama State of the Union . Tracy played a presidential candidate in the movie , which was warmly received . He then appeared in Edward , My Son ( 1949 ) with Deborah Kerr . Tracy disliked the role , and told director George Cukor , " It 's rather disconcerting to me to find how easily I play a heel . " Upon its release , The New Yorker wrote of the " hopeless <unk> of Mr. Tracy " . The film became Tracy 's biggest money @-@ loser at MGM . 
 Tracy finished off the 1940s with Malaya ( 1949 ) , an adventure film with James Stewart , and Adam 's Rib ( 1949 ) , a comedy with Tracy and Hepburn playing married lawyers who oppose each other in court . Tracy and Hepburn 's friends , Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon , wrote the parts specifically for the duo . The film received strong reviews and became the highest grossing Tracy @-@ Hepburn picture to date . Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote , " Mr. Tracy and Miss Hepburn are the stellar performers in this show and their perfect compatibility in comic capers is delightful to see . "

 Tracy received his first Academy Award nomination in 12 years for playing the role of Stanley Banks in Father of the Bride ( 1950 ) . In the comedy film , Banks attempts to handle preparations for his daughter 's ( played by Elizabeth Taylor ) upcoming wedding . " It 's the second strong comedy in a row for Spencer Tracy , doing the title role , and he socks it " , Variety noted . The film was the biggest commercial success of Tracy 's career to date , earning $ 6 million worldwide . MGM wanted a sequel , and while Tracy was unsure , he accepted . Father 's Little Dividend ( 1951 ) was released ten months later and performed well at the box office . On the strength of the two movies , Tracy polled as one of the nation 's top stars once again . 
 In 1951 , Tracy portrayed a lawyer in The People Against O 'Hara . The next year he re @-@ teamed with Hepburn for the sports comedy Pat and Mike ( 1952 ) , the second feature written expressly for the pair by Kanin and Gordon . Pat and Mike became one of the duo 's most popular and critically acclaimed films . Tracy followed it with Plymouth Adventure ( 1952 ) , a historical drama set abroad the Mayflower , co @-@ starring Gene Tierney . It met with a poor response and posted a loss of $ 1 @.@ 8 million . In 1953 , Tracy returned to the role of a concerned father in The Actress . " That film ... got more [ acclaim ] from the critics than any film I ever made in all the years , and we didn 't make enough to pay for the ushers in the theatre , " recalled producer Lawrence Weingarten . For his performance in The Actress , Tracy won a Golden Globe Award and received a nomination for the British Academy Film Award ( BAFTA ) . 
 MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century @-@ Fox for the Western film Broken Lance , his only appearance of 1954 . The picture was well received . In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler 's The Desperate Hours because he refused to take second @-@ billing to Humphrey Bogart . Instead , Tracy appeared as a one @-@ armed protagonist who faces the hostility of a small town in Bad Day at Black Rock ( 1955 ) , a film directed by John Sturges . For his work , Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival . He had personally been unhappy with the picture , and threatened to leave it during production . This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy , who was increasingly lethargic and cynical . He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955 , but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness . The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy 's relationship with MGM . In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio 's heyday , but with his contract up for renewal — Tracy opted to go independent for the first time in his movie career .

 Tracy 's first post @-@ MGM appearance was in The Mountain ( 1956 ) with Robert Wagner , who played his much younger brother ( Wagner had earlier played his son in Broken Lance ) . The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience , and he threatened to leave the project . His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor . Tracy and Hepburn then paired together for the eighth time in the office @-@ based comedy Desk Set ( 1957 ) . He again had to be convinced to stay with the film which met with a weak response . 
 In 1958 , Tracy appeared in The Old Man and the Sea , a project that had been in development for five years . An adaptation of Ernest Hemingway 's novella of the same name , Hemingway 's agent , Leland Hayward , had previously written to the author : " Of all Hollywood people , the one that comes the closest to me in quality , in personality and voice , in personal dignity and ability , is Spencer Tracy . " Tracy was delighted to be offered the role . He was told to lose some of his 210 pounds before filming began , but failed to do so . Hemingway thus reported that Tracy was a " terrible liability to the picture " , and had to be reassured that the star was being carefully photographed to disguise his weight . Appearing alone on screen for the majority of the film , Tracy considered The Old Man and the Sea the toughest part he ever played . In reviewing the performance , Jack Moffitt of the Hollywood Reporter said it was " so intimate and revealing of universal human experience that , to me , it almost transcended acting and became reality . " Tracy received Oscar and BAFTA Award nominations for the work . 
 After abandoning two projects , including a proposed remake of The Blue Angel with Marilyn Monroe , Tracy 's next feature was The Last Hurrah ( 1958 ) . It reunited him with his debut director , John Ford , after 28 years . Tracy took a year to commit to the project , in which he played an Irish @-@ American mayor seeking re @-@ election . The movie was favorably reviewed , but not commercially successful . At the end of 1958 , the National Board of Review named Tracy the year 's Best Actor . He nevertheless began to ponder retirement , with Curtis writing that he was " chronically tired , unhappy , ill , and uninterested in work . "

 Tracy did not appear on the screen again until October 1960 , with the release of Inherit the Wind , a film based on the 1925 Scopes " Monkey Trial " which debated the right to teach evolution in schools . Director Stanley Kramer sought Tracy for the role of lawyer Clarence Darrow from the outset . Starring opposite Tracy was Fredric March , a pairing Variety described as " a stroke of casting genius ... Both men are <unk> in the most laudatory sense of the word . " The film garnered Tracy some of the strongest reviews of his career — he was nominated for an Academy Award , BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award for the performance — but it was not a commercial hit . 
 In the volcano disaster movie The Devil at 4 O 'Clock ( 1961 ) , Tracy played a priest for the fourth time in his career . His co @-@ star , Frank Sinatra , ceded top @-@ billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture . Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness , Tracy briefly pulled out of the production before <unk> . Critics were unenthusiastic about the film , which was nevertheless Tracy 's most successful box office outing since Father of the Bride . 
 Inherit the Wind began an enduring collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy — Kramer directed Tracy 's three final films . Judgment at Nuremberg , released at the end of 1961 , was their second feature together . The film depicts the " Judges ' Trial " , the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust . Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind ; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read . At the end of the film , Tracy delivered a 13 @-@ minute speech . He recorded it in one take , and received a round of applause from the cast and crew . Upon seeing the film , Mann wrote to Tracy : " Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines . There is nothing in the world quite like it . " The film met with positive reviews and a large audience ; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance . 
 Tracy turned down roles in Long Days Journey Into Night ( 1962 ) and The Leopard ( 1963 ) , and had to pull out of MGM 's all @-@ star How the West Was Won ( 1962 ) when it clashed with Judgment at Nuremberg . He was , however , able to record the film 's narration track . Tracy was in very poor health by this time , and working became a challenge . He took the role of Captain T. G. Culpeper in Kramer 's comedy It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World ( 1963 ) , a small but key part that he was able to complete in nine days . Tracy 's name topped the list of performers , and the comedy became the highest grossing American film of the year . As his health worsened he had to cancel commitments to Cheyenne Autumn ( 1964 ) and The Cincinnati Kid ( 1965 ) . Offers continued to come , but Tracy did not work again until Kramer 's Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , Tracy 's ninth and final film with Hepburn . 
 Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner explored the topic of interracial marriage , with Tracy playing a liberal @-@ minded newspaper publisher whose values are challenged when his daughter wishes to marry a black man , played by Sidney Poitier . Tracy was happy to be working again , but told the press the movie would be his last . To commence filming , Tracy had to be insured for the high premium of $ 71 @,@ 000 ; Hepburn and Kramer both put their salaries in escrow until Tracy completed his scenes . In poor health , Tracy could only work for two or three hours each day . He completed his last scene on May 24 , 1967 . Tracy died 17 days later from a heart attack on June 10 . 
 The film was released in December , and although reviews were mixed , Curtis notes that " Tracy 's performance was singled out for praise in nearly every instance . " Brendan Gill of The New Yorker wrote that Tracy gave " a faultless and , under the circumstances , heartbreaking performance . " The movie became Tracy 's highest grossing picture . He received a posthumous nomination for Best Actor — his ninth — at the 40th Academy Awards , along with a Golden Globe Award nomination and a BAFTA win for Best Actor .

 Tracy met actress Louise Treadwell while they were both members of the Wood Players in White Plains , New York — the first stock company Tracy joined after graduating . The couple were engaged in May 1923 , and married on September 10 of that year between the matinee and evening performances of his show . 
 Their son , John Ten Broeck Tracy , was born in June 1924 . When John was 10 months old , Louise discovered that the boy was deaf . She resisted telling Tracy for three months . Tracy was devastated by the news and felt a lifelong guilt over his son 's deafness . He was convinced that John 's hearing impairment was a punishment for his own sins . As a result , Tracy had trouble connecting with his son and distanced himself from his family . Joseph L. Mankiewicz , a friend of Tracy 's , later theorized : " [ Tracy ] didn 't leave Louise . He left the scene of his guilt . " A second child , Louise " Susie " Treadwell Tracy , was born in July 1932 . The children were raised in their mother 's Episcopalian faith . 
 Tracy left the family home in 1933 , and he and Louise openly discussed the separation with the media , maintaining that they were still friends and had not taken divorce action . From September 1933 to June 1934 , Tracy had a public affair with Loretta Young , his co @-@ star in Man 's Castle . He reconciled with Louise in 1935 . There was never again an official separation between Tracy and his wife , but the marriage continued to be troubled . Tracy increasingly lived in hotels and by the 1940s , the two were effectively living separate lives . Tracy frequently engaged in extramarital affairs , including with co @-@ stars Joan Crawford in 1937 and Ingrid Bergman in 1941 .

 While making Woman of the Year in September 1941 , Tracy began what was to become a lifelong relationship with Katharine Hepburn . The actress became devoted to him , and their relationship lasted until his death 26 years later . Tracy never returned to live in the family home , although he visited regularly . 
 The MGM moguls were careful to protect their contract big stars from controversy , and Tracy wished to conceal his relationship with Hepburn from his wife , so it was hidden from the public . The couple did not live together until the final years of Tracy 's life , when they shared a cottage on George Cukor 's estate in Beverly Hills . In Hollywood , however , the intimate nature of the Tracy @-@ Hepburn partnership was an open secret . Angela Lansbury , who worked with the pair on State of the Union , later said : " We all knew , but nobody ever said anything . In those days it wasn 't discussed . " Tracy was not someone to express his emotions , but friend Betsy Drake believed he " was utterly dependent upon Hepburn . " Tracy 's infidelity apparently continued , however , and Tracy is reported to have had an affair with Gene Tierney during the making of Plymouth Adventure in 1952 . 
 Neither Tracy nor his wife ever pursued a divorce , despite their estrangement . He told Joan Fontaine , " I can get a divorce whenever I want to , but my wife and Kate like things just as they are . " Louise , meanwhile , reportedly commented : " I will be Mrs. Spencer Tracy until the day I die . " Hepburn did not interfere and never fought for marriage . 
 = = = Character = = = 
 Tracy was an avowed Catholic , but his cousin , Jane Feely , said that he did not devoutly follow the religion : " he was often not a practical Catholic either . I would call him a spiritual Catholic . " Garson Kanin , a friend of Tracy 's for 25 years , described him as " a true believer " who respected his religion . At periods in his life , Tracy attended Mass regularly . Tracy did not believe actors should publicize their political views , but in 1940 lent his name to the " Hollywood for Roosevelt " committee and personally identified as a Democrat . 
 Tracy struggled with alcoholism throughout his adult life , an ailment that ran in his father 's side of the family . Rather than being a steady drinker , as commonly thought , he was prone to periods of binging on alcohol . Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was " awful " when he was drunk , and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated . Because of this bad reaction to alcohol , Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety , and developed an all @-@ or @-@ nothing routine . Hepburn commented that he could stop drinking for " months , even years at a time " . 
 Tracy was prone to bouts of depression and anxiety : he was described by Mrs. Tracy as having " the most volatile disposition I 've ever seen — up in the clouds one minute and down in the depths the next . And when he 's low , he 's very , very low . " He was plagued by insomnia throughout his life . As a result , Tracy became dependent on barbiturates to sleep , followed by <unk> to function . Hepburn , who adopted a nursing role towards Tracy , was unable to understand her partner 's unhappiness . She wrote in her autobiography : " What was it ? ... Never at peace ... Tortured by some sort of guilt . Some terrible misery . " 
 = = = Illness and death = = = 
 As he entered his sixties , years of drinking , smoking , taking pills , and being overweight left Tracy in poor health . On July 21 , 1963 , he was hospitalized after a severe attack of breathlessness . Doctors found that he was suffering from pulmonary edema , where fluid accumulates in the lungs due to an inability of the heart to pump properly . They also declared his blood pressure as dangerously high . From this point on Tracy remained very weak , and Hepburn moved into his home to provide constant care . In January 1965 , he was diagnosed with hypertensive heart disease and began treatment for a previously ignored diagnosis of diabetes . Tracy almost died in September 1965 : a stay in the hospital following a prostatectomy resulted in his kidneys failing , and he spent the night in a coma . His recovery was described by his doctor as " a kind of miracle " . 
 Tracy spent the majority of the next two years at home with Hepburn , living what she described as a quiet life : reading , painting , and listening to music . On June 10 , 1967 , 17 days after completing Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner , Tracy awakened at 3 : 00 am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills , California . Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen : " Just as I was about to give [ the door ] a push , there was a sound of a cup smashing to the floor — then clump — a loud clump . " She entered the room to find Tracy dead from a heart attack . Hepburn recalled , " He looked so happy to be done with living , which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him . " MGM publicist Howard <unk> told the media that Tracy had been alone when he died and was found by his housekeeper . 
 A Requiem Mass was held for Tracy on June 12 at the Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church in East Hollywood . Active pallbearers included George Cukor , Stanley Kramer , Frank Sinatra , James Stewart , and John Ford . Out of consideration for Tracy 's family , Hepburn did not attend the funeral . Tracy was interred in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale , California . 
 = = Reputation and acting style = = 
 Tracy had a high reputation among his peers and received considerable praise from the film industry . After his death , Dore Schary , head of Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , said , " There can be no question that he was the best and most protean actor of our screen . " Humphrey Bogart , Clark Gable , James Cagney , John Ford , Garson Kanin and Katharine Hepburn also called Tracy the greatest actor of his generation . Richard Widmark , who idolized Tracy , said : " He 's the greatest movie actor there ever was ... I 've learned more about acting from watching Tracy than in any other way . " 
 Tracy was particularly respected for his naturalism on screen . Hume Cronyn , who worked with Tracy on The Seventh Cross , admired his co @-@ star 's screen presence : " His method appeared to be as simple as it is difficult to achieve . He appeared to do nothing . He listened , he felt , he said the words without forcing anything . " Joan Crawford likewise expressed her admiration for Tracy 's seemingly effortless performances . His four @-@ time co @-@ star Joan Bennett said , " One never had the feeling he was ' acting ' in a scene , but the truth of the situation was actually happening , spontaneously , at the moment he spoke his lines . " James Cagney noted that Tracy was rarely the target of impressionists , because " You can 't mimic reserve and control very well " and " there 's nothing to imitate except his genius and that can 't be mimicked . " Specifically , Tracy was praised for his listening and reacting skills . Barry Nelson said that Tracy " brought the art of reacting to a new height " ; Stanley Kramer declared that Tracy " thought and listened better than anyone in the history of motion pictures " . Millard Kaufman noted that " [ Tracy ] listened with every fiber of his entire body " . 
 Despite the perception of being able to perform effortlessly , acquaintances of Tracy said that he would carefully prepare for each role . Joseph L. Mankiewicz lived with Tracy during the production of Test Pilot , and recounted that the actor would lock himself in his bedroom " working extremely hard " each night . Many co @-@ workers commented on his strong work @-@ ethic and professionalism . Tracy did not like to rehearse , however , and would lose his effectiveness after two or three takes . Kanin described him as " an instinctive player , who trusted the moment of creation . " Tracy 's close friend Chester Erskine pinpointed his acting style as one of " selection " — he strove to give as little as was needed to be effective — reaching " a minimum to make the maximum . " 
 Tracy disliked when he was asked about his technique , or about what advice he would give to others . He often belittled the profession , for instance saying to Kanin , " Why do actors think they 're so God damn important ? They 're not . Acting is not an important job in the scheme of things . Plumbing is . " Tracy was humble about his abilities , telling a journalist , " it 's just that I try no tricks . No profile . No ' great lover ' act ... I just project myself as I am — plain , trying to be honest . " He was known to have enjoyed the quip once made by Alfred Lunt : " The art of acting is — learn your lines ! " Katharine Hepburn , in an interview six years after Tracy 's death , suggested that Tracy wished he had held a different profession . 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 In the 21st century , Tracy is best known to general audiences for his association with Katharine Hepburn . He continues to receive praise from film scholars : critic Leonard Maltin calls Tracy " one of the 20th century ’ s finest actors " , while film historian Jeanine Basinger describes his career as a " golden record of movie achievement " . Charles Matthews , writing for The Washington Post , argues that " Tracy deserves to be remembered for himself , as a master of acting technique " . 
 Preserving Tracy 's legacy , an award for excellence in film acting is bestowed in his name at the University of California , Los Angeles . Past recipients of the UCLA Spencer Tracy Award include James Stewart , Michael Douglas , Denzel Washington , Tom Hanks , Anthony Hopkins , Kirk Douglas and Morgan Freeman . 
 A 1986 PBS documentary titled The Spencer Tracy Legacy was hosted by Hepburn . It includes clips from Tracy 's films , and behind @-@ the @-@ scenes archival footage and home movies of Tracy 's private life and career , as well as newly filmed interviews with many of his former co @-@ stars , and with his daughter Susie Tracy . In 2009 , Tracy provided inspiration for the character Carl in Pixar 's Oscar @-@ winning film Up . Director Pete Docter explained that there is " something sweet about these grumpy old guys " . In 2014 , a film about Tracy 's relationship with Katharine Hepburn was announced to be in development . 
 Several of Tracy 's films , particularly his comedies , are regarded as classics of American cinema . He starred in four of the titles on the American Film Institute 's list of " 100 Years ... 100 Laughs " : Adam 's Rib , It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World , Father of the Bride and Woman of the Year . Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner was included on AFI 's list of the 100 greatest American movies , while Captains Courageous was featured on their list of America 's most inspiring movies .

 PNC Park is a baseball park located on the North Shore of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . It is the fifth home of the Pittsburgh Pirates , the city 's Major League Baseball ( MLB ) franchise . It opened during the 2001 MLB season , after the controlled implosion of the Pirates ' previous home , Three Rivers Stadium . The ballpark is sponsored by PNC Financial Services , which purchased the naming rights in 1998 . PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and seats 38 @,@ 362 people for baseball . 
 Funded in conjunction with Heinz Field and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center , the $ 216 million park stands along the Allegheny River , on the North Shore of Pittsburgh with a view of Downtown Pittsburgh . Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991 , but did not come to fruition for 5 years . Built in the style of " classic " stadiums , such as Pittsburgh 's Forbes Field , PNC Park also introduced unique features , such as the use of limestone in the building 's facade . The park also features a riverside concourse , steel truss work , an extensive out @-@ of @-@ town scoreboard , and many local eateries . Constructed faster than most modern stadiums , PNC Park was built in a 24 @-@ month span .

 On September 5 , 1991 , Pittsburgh mayor Sophie <unk> proposed a new 44 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stadium for the Pittsburgh Pirates on the city 's Northside . Three Rivers Stadium , the Pirates ' home at the time , had been designed for functionality rather than " architecture and aesthetics " . The location of Three Rivers Stadium came to be criticized for being in a hard @-@ to @-@ access portion of the city , where traffic congestion occurred before and after games . Discussions about a new ballpark took place , but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur Kevin McClatchy purchased the team in February 1996 . Until McClatchy 's purchase , plans about the team remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain . In 1996 , <unk> 's successor , Tom Murphy , created the " Forbes Field II Task Force " . Made up of 29 political and business leaders , the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark . Their final report , published on June 26 , 1996 , evaluated 13 possible locations . The " North Side site " was recommended due to its affordable cost , potential to develop the surrounding area , and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium 's design . The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field Exposition Park . 
 After a political debate , public money was used to fund PNC Park . Originally , a sales tax increase was proposed to fund three projects : PNC Park , Heinz Field , and an expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center . However , after the proposal was soundly rejected in a referendum , the city developed Plan B. Similarly controversial , the alternative proposal was labeled Scam B by opponents . Some members of the Allegheny Regional Asset District felt that the Pirates ' pledge of $ 40 million toward the new stadium was too little , while others criticized the amount of public money allocated for Plan B. One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars " corporate welfare " . The plan , totaling $ 809 million , was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9 , 1998 — with $ 228 million allotted for PNC Park . Shortly after Plan B was approved , the Pirates made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to remain in the city until at least 2031 . 
 There was popular sentiment by fans for the Pirates to name the stadium after former outfielder Roberto Clemente . However , locally based PNC Financial Services purchased the stadium 's naming rights in August 1998 . As per the agreement , PNC Bank will pay the Pirates approximately $ 2 million each year through 2020 , and also has a full @-@ service PNC branch at the stadium . The total cost of PNC Park was $ 216 million . Shortly after the naming rights deal was announced , the city of Pittsburgh renamed the 6th Street Bridge near the southeast corner of the site of the park the Roberto Clemente Bridge as a compromise to fans who had wanted the park named after Clemente . 
 = = = Design and construction = = = 
 Kansas City @-@ based Populous ( then HOK Sport ) , which designed many other major league ballparks of the late 20th and early 21st century , designed the ballpark . The design and construction management team consisted of the Dick Corporation and Barton <unk> . An effort was made in the design of PNC Park to salute other " classic style " ballparks , such as Fenway Park , Wrigley Field , and Pittsburgh 's Forbes Field ; the design of the ballpark 's archways , steel truss work , and light standards are results of this goal . PNC Park was the first two @-@ deck ballpark to be built in the United States since Milwaukee County Stadium opened in 1953 . The park features a 24 by 42 foot ( 7 @.@ 3 by 12 @.@ 8 m ) Sony JumboTron , which is accompanied by the first @-@ ever LED video boards in an outdoor MLB stadium . PNC Park is the first stadium to feature an out @-@ of @-@ town scoreboard with the score , inning , number of outs , and base runners for every other game being played around the league . 
 Ground was broken for PNC Park on April 7 , 1999 , after a ceremony to rename the Sixth Street Bridge as the " Roberto Clemente Bridge " in honor of the late Pirate Roberto Clemente . As part of original plans to create an enjoyable experience for fans , the bridge is closed to vehicular traffic on game days to allow spectators to park in Pittsburgh 's Golden Triangle and walk across the bridge to the stadium . PNC Park was built with Kasota limestone shipped from a Minnesota river valley , to contrast the brick bases of other modern stadiums . The stadium was constructed over a 24 @-@ month span — at the time of construction , three months faster than any other modern major league ballpark — and the Pirates played their first game less than two years after groundbreaking . The quick construction was accomplished with the use of special computers , which relayed building plans to builders 24 hours per day . In addition , all 23 labor unions involved in the construction signed a pact that they would not strike during the building process . As a result of union involvement and attention to safety regulations , the construction manager , the Dick Corporation , received a merit award for its safety practices from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration . 
 Statues of Pirates ' Hall of Famers Honus Wagner , Roberto Clemente , Willie Stargell and Bill Mazeroski are positioned at various points outside of PNC Park . Wagner and Clemente 's statues were previously located outside of Three Rivers Stadium , and after the venue was imploded , the two statues were removed from their locations , refurbished , and relocated outside PNC Park . Wagner 's statue was originally unveiled at Forbes Field in 1955 . The base of Clemente 's statue is shaped like a baseball diamond , with dirt from three of the fields Clemente played at — Santurce Field in Carolina , Puerto Rico , Forbes Field , and Three Rivers Stadium — at each base . On October 1 , 2000 , after the final game at Three Rivers Stadium , Stargell threw out the ceremonial last pitch . He was presented with a model of a statue that was to be erected in his honor outside of PNC Park . The statue was officially unveiled on April 7 , 2001 ; however , Stargell did not attend due to health problems and died of a stroke two days later . A statue for Bill Mazeroski was added at the right field entrance , at the south end of Mazeroski Way , during the 2010 season . This was the 50th anniversary of the Pirates ' 1960 World Series championship , which Mazeroski clinched with a Game 7 walk @-@ off home run at Forbes Field . The statue itself was designed based on that event .

 The Pirates opened PNC Park with two exhibition games against the New York Mets — the first of which was played on March 31 , 2001 . The first official baseball game played in PNC Park was between the Cincinnati Reds and the Pirates , on April 9 , 2001 . The Reds won the game by the final score of 8 – 2 . The first pitch — a ball — was thrown from Pittsburgh 's Todd Ritchie to Barry Larkin . In the top of the first inning , Pittsburgh native Sean Casey 's two @-@ run home run was the first hit in the park . The first Pirates ' batter , Adrian Brown , struck out ; however , later in the inning Jason Kendall singled — the first hit by a Pirate in their new stadium . 
 PNC Park had an average attendance of 30 @,@ 742 people per game throughout its inaugural season , though it would drop approximately 27 % the following season to 22 @,@ 594 spectators per game . Throughout the 2001 season , businesses in downtown and on the Northside of Pittsburgh showed a 20 – 25 % increase in business on Pirate game days . 
 Pirates ' vice @-@ president Steve Greenberg said , " We said when construction began that we would build the best ballpark in baseball , and we believe we 've done that . " Major League Baseball executive Paul Beeston said the park was " the best he 's seen so far in baseball " . Many of the workers who built the park said that it was the nicest that they had seen . Jason Kendall , Pittsburgh 's catcher at the opening of the park , called PNC Park " the most beautiful ballpark in the game " . Different elements of PNC Park were used in the design of New York 's Citi Field . 
 Upon opening in 2001 , PNC Park was praised by fans and media alike . ESPN.com writer Jim Caple ranked PNC Park as the best stadium in Major League Baseball , with a score of 95 out of 100 . Caple compared the park to Frank Lloyd Wright 's <unk> , calling the stadium itself " perfect " , and citing high ticket prices as the only negative aspect of visiting the park . Jay <unk> , author of Fields of Dreams : A Guide to Visiting and Enjoying All 30 Major League Ballparks , called PNC Park one of the " top ten places to watch the game " . Eric Enders , author of Ballparks Then and Now and co @-@ author of Big League Ballparks : The Complete Illustrated History , said it was " everything a baseball stadium could hope to be " and " an immediate contender for the title of best baseball park ever built " . In 2008 , Men 's Fitness named the park one of " 10 big league parks worth seeing this summer " . A 2010 unranked list of " America 's 7 Best Ballparks " published by ABC News noted that PNC Park " combines the best features of yesterday 's ballparks — rhythmic archways , steel <unk> and a natural grass playing field — with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort " .

 An exhibit honoring Pittsburgh 's Negro league baseball teams was introduced in 2006 .

The exhibit also includes the Legacy Theatre , a 25 @-@ seat facility that plays a film about Pittsburgh 's history with the Negro leagues . 
 In 2007 , Allegheny County passed a ban on smoking in most public places , thus making PNC Park completely smoke @-@ free . Prior to the 2008 season , the Pirates made multiple alterations to PNC Park .

The section includes ticketed seats along with areas for groups and the general public . This addition was expected to cost about $ 1 million . For the 2015 season , many additions to the park took place for better fan experience . One of the additions to the park is the left field terrace . It has 2 levels for standing room , with 250 feet of drink rails . The terrace fills the gap between the left field bleachers and the <unk> Brewing Hall of Fame Club and is open to any fan with a ticket . Another addition includes a new outdoor patio that overlooks center field , right next to the terraces . The patio is now known as " The Porch . " The Porch features bar tables and outdoor sofa @-@ style seating , and accommodates groups of 25 people .
