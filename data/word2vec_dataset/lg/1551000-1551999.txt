 Each player begins the game with 16 pieces : one king , one queen , two rooks , two knights , two bishops , and eight pawns . Each of the six piece types moves differently . The most powerful piece is the queen and the least powerful piece is the pawn . The objective is to ' checkmate ' the opponent 's king by placing it under an inescapable threat of capture . To this end , a player 's pieces are used to attack and capture the opponent 's pieces , while supporting their own . In addition to checkmate , the game can be won by voluntary resignation by the opponent , which typically occurs when too much material is lost , or if checkmate appears unavoidable . A game may also result in a draw in several ways . 
 Chess is believed to have originated in India , some time before the 7th century , being derived from the Indian game of <unk> . <unk> is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern strategy games xiangqi , <unk> and shogi . The pieces took on their current powers in Spain in the late 15th century ; the rules were finally standardized in the 19th century . The first generally recognized World Chess Champion , Wilhelm Steinitz , claimed his title in 1886 . Since 1948 , the World Championship has been controlled by FIDE , the game 's international governing body ; the current World Champion is the Norwegian Magnus Carlsen . FIDE also organizes the Women 's World Championship , the World Junior Championship , the World Senior Championship , the Blitz and Rapid World Championships and the Chess Olympiad , a popular competition among teams from different nations . There is also a Correspondence Chess World Championship and a World Computer Chess Championship . Online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players . There are also many chess variants , with different rules , different pieces , and different boards . 
 FIDE awards titles to skilled players , the highest of which is grandmaster . Many national chess organizations also have a title system . However , these are not recognised by FIDE . The term " master " may refer to a formal title or may be used more loosely for any skilled player . 
 Chess is a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee ; some national sporting bodies such as the Spanish Consejo Superior de Deportes also recognize chess as a sport . Chess was included in the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games . 
 Since the second half of the 20th century , computers have been programmed to play chess with increasing success , to the point where the strongest home computers play chess at a higher level than the best human players . Since the 1990s , computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory , particularly in the endgame . The computer IBM Deep Blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning World Chess Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997 . The rise of strong computer programs ( known as " engines " ) that can be run on hand @-@ held devices has led to increasing concerns about cheating during tournaments . 
 = = Rules = = 
 The official rules of chess are maintained by FIDE ( Fédération Internationale des Échecs ) , chess 's international governing body . Along with information on official chess tournaments , the rules are described in the FIDE Handbook , Laws of Chess section . 
 = = = Setup = = = 
 Chess is played on a square board of eight rows ( called ranks and denoted with numbers 1 to 8 ) and eight columns ( called files and denoted with letters a to h ) . The colors of the 64 squares alternate and are referred to as " light " and " dark " squares . The chessboard is placed with a light square at the right @-@ hand end of the rank nearest to each player . 
 By convention , the game pieces are divided into white and black sets , and the players are referred to as " White " and " Black " respectively . Each player begins the game with 16 pieces of the specified color , which consist of one king , one queen , two rooks , two bishops , two knights , and eight pawns . The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo , with each queen on a square of its own color , the white queen on a light square and the black queen on a dark . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 The player with the white pieces always moves first . After the first move , players alternately move one piece per turn ( except for castling , when two pieces are moved ) . Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent 's piece , which is captured and removed from play . With the sole exception of en passant , all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent 's piece occupies . A player may not make any move that would put or leave his or her king under attack . A player cannot " pass " ; at each turn they have to make a legal move ( this is the basis for the finesse called zugzwang ) . 
 If the player to move has no legal move , the game is over ; it is either a checkmate ( a loss for the player with no legal moves ) if the king is under attack , or a stalemate ( a draw ) if the king is not . 
 Each chess piece has its own style of moving . In the diagrams , the dots mark the squares where the piece can move if no other pieces ( including one 's own piece ) are on the squares between the piece 's initial position and its destination . 
 The king moves one square in any direction . The king has also a special move which is called castling and involves also moving a rook . 
 The rook can move any number of squares along any rank or file , but may not leap over other pieces . Along with the king , the rook is involved during the king 's castling move . 
 The bishop can move any number of squares diagonally , but may not leap over other pieces . 
 The queen combines the power of the rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank , file , or diagonal , but it may not leap over other pieces . 
 The knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank , file , or diagonal , thus the move forms an " L " -shape : two squares vertically and one square horizontally , or two squares horizontally and one square vertically . The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces . 
 The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file , or on its first move it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied ( black " <unk> " s in the diagram ) ; or the pawn may capture an opponent 's piece on a square diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file , by moving to that square ( black " x " s ) . The pawn has two special moves : the en passant capture and pawn promotion . 
 = = = Castling = = = 
 Once in every game , each king is allowed to make a special move , known as castling . Castling consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook ( which is on the player 's first rank ) and then placing the rook on the last square the king has just crossed . Castling is permissible under the following conditions : 
 Neither the king nor the rook may have been previously moved during the game . 
 There must be no pieces between the king and the rook . 
 The king may not be in check , nor may the king pass through squares that are under attack by enemy pieces , nor move to a square where it is in check . 
 Note that castling is permissible if the rook is attacked , or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked . 
 = = = En passant = = = 
 When a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and there is an opponent 's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square , then the opponent 's pawn can capture it en passant ( in passing ) , and move to the square the pawn passed over . However , this can only be done on the very next move , otherwise the right to do so is forfeit . For example , if the black pawn has just advanced two squares from g7 ( initial starting position ) to g5 , then the white pawn on f5 may take it via en passant on g6 ( but only on white 's next move ) . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 When a pawn advances to the eighth rank , as a part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player 's choice of queen , rook , bishop , or knight of the same color . Usually , the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen , but in some cases another piece is chosen ; this is called <unk> . In the diagram on the right , the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece . There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion , so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game ( for example , two queens ) . 
 = = = Check = = = 
 When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent 's pieces , it is said to be in check . A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack ( that is , not in check ) . This can involve capturing the checking piece ; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king ( which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen , rook , or bishop and there is a square between it and the king ) ; or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack . Castling is not a permissible response to a check . The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent ; this occurs when the opponent 's king is in check , and there is no legal way to remove it from attack . It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave his own king in check . 
 In casual games it is common to announce " check " when putting the opponent 's king in check , however this is not required by the rules of the game , and is not usually done in tournaments . 
 = = = End of the game = = = 
 = = = = Win = = = = 
 Games may be won in the following ways : 
 Checkmate 
 Resignation – either player may resign , conceding the game to the other player . It is usually considered poor etiquette to play on in a truly hopeless position , and for this reason high level games rarely end with a checkmate . 
 Loss on time – in games with a time control , a player may also lose by running out of time , even with a much superior position . 
 Forfeit – a player who cheats , or violates the laws of the game , or violates the rules specified for the particular tournament may be forfeited . In high level tournaments , players have been forfeited for such things as arriving late for the game ( even by a matter of seconds ) , receiving a call or text on a cell phone , refusing to undergo a drug test , refusing to undergo a body search for electronic devices and unsporting behavior ( such as refusing to shake the opponent 's hand ) . 
 = = = = Draw = = = = 
 Games may end in a draw in several ways : 
 Draw by agreement – draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players . The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw , make a move , then start the opponent 's clock . Traditionally players have been allowed to agree a draw at any time in the game , occasionally even without playing a move ; in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws , for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty . 
 Stalemate – the player whose turn it is to move is not in check , but has no legal move . 
 Threefold repetition of a position – this most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring a disadvantage . In this situation , either player may claim a draw ; this requires the players to keep a valid written record of the game so that the claim may be verified by the arbiter if challenged . The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for a claim to be valid . FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check ; this is merely a specific type of draw by threefold repetition . 
 The fifty @-@ move rule – if during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made , either player may claim a draw , as for the threefold @-@ repetition rule . There are in fact several known endgames where it is theoretically possible to force a mate but which require more than 50 moves before the pawn move or capture is made ; examples include some endgames with two knights against a pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops . These endings are rare , however , and few players study them in detail , so the fifty @-@ move rule is considered practical for over the board play . Some correspondence chess organizations allow exceptions to the fifty @-@ move rule . 
 Fivefold repetition of a position , similar to the threefold @-@ repetition rule , but in this case no player needs to claim the draw for the game to be drawn . This rule took effect on 1 July 2014 . It establishes that there is a theoretical upper bound on the length of lawful chess games . 
 The seventy @-@ five @-@ move rule , similar to the fifty @-@ move rule ; however , if the final move in the sequence resulted in checkmate , this takes precedence . As for the fivefold @-@ repetition rule , this applies independently of claims by the players . The rule also took effect on 1 July 2014 and also establishes , independently , an upper bound on the game length 
 Insufficient material – a player may claim a draw if their opponent has insufficient material to checkmate , for example if the player has only the king left and the opponent has only the king and a bishop . Such a claim is only valid if checkmate is impossible . Under the revised rule that took effect on 1 July 2009 , which only refers to the impossibility of reaching checkmate without explicitly relating this to the players ' material , the game is ended immediately in a draw , not requiring a claim by a player . 
 = = = Time control = = = 
 Chess games may also be played with a time control , mostly by club and professional players . If a player 's time runs out before the game is completed , the game is automatically lost ( provided his opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate ) . The duration of a game ranges from long games played up to seven hours to shorter rapid chess games , usually lasting 30 minutes or one hour per game . Even shorter is blitz chess , with a time control of three to 15 minutes for each player , and bullet chess ( under three minutes ) . In tournament play , time is controlled using a game clock that has two displays , one for each player 's remaining time . 
 = = Notation for recording moves = = 
 Chess games and positions are recorded using a special notation , most often algebraic chess notation . Abbreviated ( or short ) algebraic notation generally records moves in the format " abbreviation of the piece moved – file where it moved – rank where it moved " . For example , Qg5 means " queen moves to the g @-@ file and 5th rank " ( that is , to the square g5 ) . If there are two pieces of the same type that can move to the same square , one more letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved , e.g. <unk> means " knight from the g @-@ file moves to the square f3 " . The letter P indicating a pawn is not used , so that e4 means " pawn moves to the square e4 " . 
 If the piece makes a capture , " x " is inserted before the destination square . Thus Bxf3 means " bishop captures on f3 " . When a pawn makes a capture , the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial , and ranks may be omitted if unambiguous . For example , exd5 ( pawn on the e @-@ file captures the piece on d5 ) or <unk> ( pawn on the e @-@ file captures a piece somewhere on the d @-@ file ) . 
 If a pawn moves to its last rank , achieving promotion , the piece chosen is indicated after the move , for example <unk> or e1 = Q. Castling is indicated by the special notations 0 @-@ 0 for kingside castling and 0 @-@ 0 @-@ 0 for queenside castling . An en passant capture is sometimes marked with the notation " e.p. " A move that places the opponent 's king in check usually has the notation " + " added . ( The notation " + + " for a double check is considered obsolete ) . Checkmate can be indicated by " # " . At the end of the game , " 1 – 0 " means " White won " , " 0 – 1 " means " Black won " , and " ½ – ½ " indicates a draw . 
 Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols . For example , " ! " indicates a good move , " ! ! " an excellent move , " ? " a mistake , " ? ? " a blunder , " ! ? " an interesting move that may not be best , or " ? ! " a dubious move not easily refuted . 
 For example , one variant of a simple trap known as the Scholar 's mate ( see animated diagram ) can be recorded : 
 1 @.@ e4 e5 
 2 . <unk> ? ! Nc6 
 3 . Bc4 Nf6 ? ? 
 4 . Qxf7 # 1 – 0 
 Until about 1980 , the majority of English language chess literature used a form of descriptive notation , whereby files are named according to the piece which occupies the back rank at the start of the game , and each square has two different names depending on whether it is from White 's or Black 's point of view . For example , the square known as " e3 " in algebraic notation is " K3 " ( King 's 3rd ) from White 's point of view , and " K6 " ( King 's 6th ) from Black 's point of view . The " Scholar 's mate " is rendered thus in descriptive notation : 
 1 . P @-@ K4 P @-@ K4 
 2 . Q @-@ R5 ? ! N @-@ <unk> 
 3 . B @-@ B4 N @-@ B3 ? ? 
 4 . <unk> # 1 @-@ 0 
 A few mostly older players still prefer descriptive notation ; however , it is no longer recognized by FIDE . 
 = = Strategy and tactics = = 
 Chess strategy consists of setting and achieving long @-@ term positioning advantages during the game – for example , where to place different pieces – while tactics concentrate on immediate maneuver . These two parts of the chess @-@ playing process cannot be completely separated , because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics , while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play . A game of chess is normally divided into three phases : opening , typically the first 10 moves , when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle ; then middlegame ; and last the endgame , when most of the pieces are gone , kings typically take a more active part in the struggle , and pawn promotion is often decisive . 
 = = = Fundamentals of tactics = = = 
 In chess , tactics in general concentrate on short @-@ term actions – so short @-@ term that they can be calculated in advance by a human player or by a computer . The possible depth of calculation depends on the player 's ability . In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides , a deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical , while in " tactical " positions with a limited number of forced variations , strong players can calculate long sequences of moves . 
 Simple one @-@ move or two @-@ move tactical actions – threats , exchanges of material , and double attacks – can be combined into more complicated combinations , sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players . <unk> describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers ; for example , pins , forks , skewers , batteries , discovered attacks ( especially discovered checks ) , <unk> , deflections , decoys , sacrifices , <unk> , <unk> , and interferences . 
 A forced variation that involves a sacrifice and usually results in a tangible gain is called a combination . Brilliant combinations – such as those in the Immortal Game – are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers . A common type of chess exercise , aimed at developing players ' skills , is showing players a position where a decisive combination is available and challenging them to find it . 
 = = = Fundamentals of strategy = = = 
 Chess strategy is concerned with evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long @-@ term plans for the future play . During the evaluation , players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board , control of the center and centralization , the pawn structure , king safety , and the control of key squares or groups of squares ( for example , diagonals , open files , and dark or light squares ) . 
 The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides . The point values used for this purpose are based on experience ; usually pawns are considered worth one point , knights and bishops about three points each , rooks about five points ( the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange ) , and queens about nine points . The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined , since its checkmate loses the game . But in practical terms , in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook . These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece ( for example , advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares ) , coordination between pieces ( for example , a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight ) , or the type of position ( knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions ) . 
 Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure ( sometimes known as the pawn skeleton ) , or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard . Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces , the pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position . Weaknesses in the pawn structure , such as isolated , doubled , or backward pawns and holes , once created , are often permanent . Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset ( for example , by the possibility of developing an attack ) . 
 = = Phases = = 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 A chess opening is the group of initial moves of a game ( the " opening moves " ) . Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defence . They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings . There are dozens of different openings , varying widely in character from quiet positional play ( for example , the Réti Opening ) to very aggressive ( the Latvian Gambit ) . In some opening lines , the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves . Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers , as opening theory continues to evolve . 
 The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar : 
 Development : This is the technique of placing the pieces ( particularly bishops and knights ) on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game . 
 Control of the center : Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily , and can also have a cramping effect on the opponent . 
 King safety : It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities . A correctly timed castling can often enhance this . 
 Pawn structure : Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated , doubled , or backward pawns , and pawn islands – and to force such weaknesses in the opponent 's position . 
 Most players and theoreticians consider that White , by virtue of the first move , begins the game with a small advantage . This initially gives White the initiative . Black usually strives to neutralize White 's advantage and achieve equality , or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening . There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame , but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed . ( Similarly , there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame ; see start of the endgame . ) Because the opening theory has ended , players have to form plans based on the features of the position , and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position . The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur . Combinations are a series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain . <unk> combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent 's king ; some typical patterns have their own names ; for example , the Boden 's Mate or the Lasker – Bauer combination . 
 Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in a specific type of pawn structure . An example is the minority attack , which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside . The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting <unk> . 
 Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame ( i.e. simplify ) . Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame , and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending . Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose ; for example , if one side keeps a light @-@ squared bishop and the opponent has a dark @-@ squared one , the transformation into a bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only , because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be a draw , even with an advantage of a pawn , or sometimes even with a two @-@ pawn advantage . 
 = = = Endgame = = = 
 The endgame ( or end game or ending ) is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board . There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and endgame : 
 During the endgame , pawns become more important ; endgames often revolve around attempting to promote a pawn by advancing it to the eighth rank . 
 The king , which has to be protected in the middlegame owing to the threat of checkmate , becomes a strong piece in the endgame . It is often brought to the center of the board where it can protect its own pawns , attack the pawns of opposite color , and hinder movement of the opponent 's king . 
 Zugzwang , a disadvantage because the player has to make a move , is often a factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game . For example , the diagram on the right is zugzwang for both sides , as with Black to move he must play 1 ... Kb7 and let White promote a pawn after <unk> ; and with White to move he must allow a draw , either by <unk> stalemate , or by losing his last pawn after any other legal move . 
 <unk> can be classified according to the type of pieces that remain on board . Basic <unk> are positions in which one side has only a king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king , with the pieces working together with their king . For example , king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns . Other more complicated endings are classified according to the pieces on board other than kings , such as the " rook and pawn versus rook endgame . " 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Predecessors = = = 
 Chess is believed to have originated in Eastern India , c . 280 – 550 , in the Gupta Empire , where its early form in the 6th century was known as <unk> ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् ग ) , literally four divisions [ of the military ] – infantry , cavalry , elephants , and <unk> , represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn , knight , bishop , and rook , respectively . Thence it spread eastward and westward along the silk road . The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sassanid Persia around 600 , where the game came to be known by the name <unk> . <unk> was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia ( 633 – 44 ) , where it was then named shatranj , with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names . In Spanish " shatranj " was rendered as <unk> ( " al @-@ shatranj " ) , in Portuguese as <unk> , and in Greek as <unk> ( <unk> , which comes directly from the Persian <unk> ) , but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian <unk> ( " king " ) , which was familiar as an exclamation and became the English words " check " and " chess " . 
 The oldest archaeological artifacts , ivory chess pieces , were excavated in ancient <unk> , today 's Samarkand , in Uzbekistan , central Asia , and date to about 760 , with some of them possibly older . The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to 840 @-@ 850 , written by al @-@ <unk> ar @-@ Rumi ( 800 @-@ 870 ) , a renowned Arab chess player , titled Kitab ash @-@ shatranj ( Book of the chess ) . This is a lost manuscript , but referenced in later works . The eastern migration of chess , into China and Southeast Asia , has even less documentation than its migration west . The first reference to chess , called Xiang Qi , in China comes in the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , record of the mysterious and strange ) dating to about 800 . Alternately , some contend that chess arose from Chinese chess or one of its predecessors , although this has been contested . 
 The game reached Western Europe and Russia by at least three routes , the earliest being in the 9th century . By the year 1000 , it had spread throughout Europe . Introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors in the 10th century , it was described in a famous 13th @-@ century manuscript covering shatranj , backgammon , and dice named the Libro de los juegos . 
 = = = Origins of the modern game ( 1200 – 1700 ) = = = 
 Around 1200 , the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern Europe , and around 1475 , several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today . These modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in Italy and Spain . Pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move , while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities . The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece ; consequently modern chess was referred to as " Queen 's Chess " or " Mad Queen Chess " . Castling , derived from the ' kings leap ' usually in combination with a pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety , was introduced . These new rules quickly spread throughout western Europe . The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century . Also in the 19th century , the convention that White moves first was established ( formerly either White or Black could move first ) . Finally the rules around castling were standardized – variations in the castling rules had persisted in Italy until the late 19th century . The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess , particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent . Since the 19th century , the only rule changes have been technical in nature , for example establishing the correct procedure for claiming a draw by repetition . 
 Writings about the theory of how to play chess began to appear in the 15th century . The <unk> de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez ( Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess ) by Spanish churchman Luis Ramirez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497 . Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano , Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona , Giulio Cesare <unk> and Gioachino Greco , and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of openings and started to analyze simple endgames . 
 = = = The Romantic Era in Chess ( 1700 @-@ 1873 ) = = = 
 The romantic era was characterized by opening gambits ( sacrificing pawns or even pieces ) , daring attacks , and brazen sacrifices . Many elaborate and beautiful but unsound move sequences called ' combinations ' were played by the masters of the time . The game was played more for art than theory . A profound belief that chess merit resided in the players ' genius rather than inherent in the position on the board pervaded chess practice . 
 In the 18th century , the center of European chess life moved from the Southern European countries to France . The two most important French masters were François @-@ André Danican Philidor , a musician by profession , who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy , and later Louis @-@ Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais , who won a famous series of matches with the Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834 . Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in big European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson 's Divan in London . 
 As the 19th century progressed , chess organization developed quickly . Many chess clubs , chess books , and chess journals appeared . There were correspondence matches between cities ; for example , the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824 . Chess problems became a regular part of 19th @-@ century newspapers ; Bernhard Horwitz , Josef Kling , and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems . In 1843 , von der Lasa published his and Bilguer 's Handbuch des Schachspiels ( Handbook of Chess ) , the first comprehensive manual of chess theory . 
 The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton , a leading English chess player , and was held in London in 1851 . It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen , who was hailed as the leading chess master . His brilliant , energetic attacking style was typical for the time . Sparkling games like Anderssen 's Immortal game and Evergreen game or Morphy 's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art . 
 Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with two younger players . American Paul Morphy , an extraordinary chess prodigy , won against all important competitors ( except Howard Staunton , who refused to play ) , including Anderssen , during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863 . Morphy 's success stemmed from a combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy ; he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks . 
 = = = Birth of a sport ( 1873 – 1945 ) = = = 
 Prague @-@ born Wilhelm Steinitz beginning in 1873 described how to avoid weaknesses in one 's own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponent 's position . The scientific approach and positional understanding of Steinitz revolutionized the game . Steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components . Before Steinitz , players brought their queen out early , did not completely develop their other pieces , and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king , which either succeeded or failed . The level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan . In addition to his theoretical achievements , Steinitz founded an important tradition : his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship . Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player , the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker , who maintained this title for 27 years , the longest tenure of all World Champions . 
 After the end of the 19th century , the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew . Some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker , Capablanca , Alekhine , Tarrasch , and Marshall , but this is a disputed claim . The tradition of awarding such titles was continued by the World Chess Federation ( FIDE ) , founded in 1924 in Paris . In 1927 , the Women 's World Chess Championship was established ; the first to hold the title was Czech @-@ English master Vera <unk> . It took a prodigy from Cuba , José Raúl Capablanca ( World Champion 1921 – 27 ) , who loved simple positions and endgames , to end the German @-@ speaking dominance in chess ; he was undefeated in tournament play for eight years , until 1924 . His successor was Russian @-@ French Alexander Alekhine , a strong attacking player who died as the World champion in 1946 . He briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later . 
 Between the world wars , chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so @-@ called <unk> like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti . They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns , which invited opponents to occupy the center with pawns , which become objects of attack . 
 = = = Post @-@ war era ( 1945 and later ) = = = 
 After the death of Alekhine , a new World Champion was sought . FIDE , which has controlled the title since then ( except for one interruption ) , ran a tournament of elite players . The winner of the 1948 tournament , Russian Mikhail Botvinnik , started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world . Until the end of the Soviet Union , there was only one non @-@ Soviet champion , American Bobby Fischer ( champion 1972 – 75 ) . Botvinnik revolutionized opening theory . Previously Black strove for equality , to neutralize White 's first @-@ move advantage . As Black , Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning . In the previous informal system of World Championships , the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match . FIDE set up a new system of qualifying tournaments and matches . The world 's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments , where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments . The leading finishers in these <unk> would go on the " Candidates " stage , which was initially a tournament , and later a series of knockout matches . The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title . A champion defeated in a match had a right to play a rematch a year later . This system operated on a three @-@ year cycle . Botvinnik participated in championship matches over a period of fifteen years . He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954 . In 1957 , he lost to Vasily Smyslov , but regained the title in a rematch in 1958 . In 1960 , he lost the title to the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal , an accomplished tactician and attacking player . Botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961 . 
 Following the 1961 event , FIDE abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch , and the next champion , Armenian Tigran Petrosian , a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills , held the title for two cycles , 1963 – 69 . His successor , Boris Spassky from Russia ( champion 1969 – 72 ) , won games in both positional and sharp tactical style . The next championship , the so @-@ called Match of the Century , saw the first non @-@ Soviet challenger since World War II , American Bobby Fischer , who defeated his Candidates opponents by unheard @-@ of margins and clearly won the world championship match . In 1975 , however , Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when FIDE did not meet his demands , and Karpov obtained the title by default . Fischer modernized many aspects of chess , especially by extensively preparing openings . 
 Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with a string of tournament successes . Karpov 's reign finally ended in 1985 at the hands of Garry Kasparov , another Soviet player from Baku , Azerbaijan . Kasparov and Karpov contested five world title matches between 1984 and 1990 ; Karpov never won his title back . In 1993 , Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed a competing Professional Chess Association ( PCA ) . From then until 2006 , there were two simultaneous World Champions and World Championships : the PCA or Classical champion extending the <unk> tradition in which the current champion plays a challenger in a series of many games , and the other following FIDE 's new format of many players competing in a tournament to determine the champion . Kasparov lost his Classical title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia . The World Chess Championship 2006 , in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov , reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion . In September 2007 , he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India , who won the championship tournament in Mexico City . Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 , 2010 and 2012 . In 2013 , Magnus Carlsen beat Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship . He defended his title the following year , again against Anand , and is the reigning world champion . 
 Chess remains a highly popular pastime among the general populace . A 2012 survey found that " chess players now make up one of the largest communities in the world : 605 million adults play chess regularly " . Chess is played at least once a year by 12 % of British people , 15 % of Americans , 23 % of Germans , 43 % of Russians , and 70 % of Indian people .

 In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance , chess was a part of noble culture ; it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the " King 's Game " . Gentlemen are " to be meanly seene in the play at <unk> " , says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione 's The Book of the Courtier ( 1528 , English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby ) , but chess should not be a gentleman 's main passion . Castiglione explains it further : 
 And what say you to the game at <unk> ? It is <unk> an honest <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , quoth Syr <unk> . But me think it hath a fault , <unk> is , that a man may be to <unk> at it , for who ever will be excellent in the <unk> of <unk> , I <unk> he must <unk> much tyme about it , and <unk> it with so much study , that a man may <unk> <unk> some noble <unk> , or <unk> any other matter of <unk> , and yet in the ende in <unk> all that <unk> , he knoweth no more but a game . <unk> in this I <unk> there <unk> a very rare thing , namely , that the <unk> is more commendable , then the excellency . 
 Many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost , but others partially survive , such as the Lewis chessmen . 
 Chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality . An example is Liber de <unk> hominum et <unk> <unk> sive super ludo <unk> ( ' Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess ' ) , written by an Italian Dominican monk Jacobus de <unk> c . 1300 . This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages . The work was translated into many other languages ( the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473 ) and was the basis for William Caxton 's The Game and <unk> of the <unk> ( 1474 ) , one of the first books printed in English . Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people , and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces : 
 The <unk> ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in <unk> <unk> that he haue an <unk> on his heed and a spere in his <unk> <unk> / and <unk> wyth his <unk> / a <unk> and a mace on his <unk> <unk> / <unk> wyth an <unk> and plates to fore his <unk> / <unk> <unk> on his <unk> / Spores on his <unk> on his <unk> his <unk> / his hors well broken and taught and <unk> to <unk> and <unk> with his armes / <unk> the knyghtes ben <unk> they ben <unk> or bathed / that is the signe that they <unk> lede a newe <unk> and newe <unk> / also they wake alle the <unk> in prayers and <unk> vnto god that he <unk> <unk> hem grace that they may <unk> that <unk> that they may not <unk> by nature / The kynge or <unk> <unk> a <unk> them a <unk> in signe / that they <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of whom they take <unk> dispenses and <unk> . 
 Known in the circles of clerics , students , and merchants , chess entered into the popular culture of Middle Ages . An example is the 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13th century , which starts with the names of chess pieces , Roch , <unk> , regina ...

 During the Age of Enlightenment , chess was viewed as a means of self @-@ improvement . Benjamin Franklin , in his article " The Morals of Chess " ( 1750 ) , wrote : 
 The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement ; several very valuable qualities of the mind , useful in the course of human life , are to be acquired and strengthened by it , so as to become habits ready on all occasions ; for life is a kind of Chess , in which we have often points to gain , and competitors or adversaries to contend with , and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events , that are , in some degree , the effect of prudence , or the want of it . By playing at Chess then , we may learn : 
 I. Foresight , which looks a little into futurity , and considers the consequences that may attend an action [ ... ] 
 II . <unk> , which surveys the whole Chess @-@ board , or scene of action : – the relation of the several Pieces , and their situations [ ... ] 
 III . Caution , not to make our moves too hastily [ ... ] 
 With these or similar hopes , chess is taught to children in schools around the world today . Many schools host chess clubs , and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children . Tournaments are held regularly in many countries , hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation . 
 Chess is often depicted in the arts ; significant works where chess plays a key role range from Thomas Middleton 's A Game at Chess to Through the Looking @-@ Glass by Lewis Carroll to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig and Vladimir Nabokov 's The Defense . The thriller film Knight Moves is about a chess grandmaster who is accused of being a serial killer . Chess is featured in films like Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal and Satyajit Ray 's The Chess Players . Chess is also present in the contemporary popular culture . For example , J. K. Rowling 's Harry Potter plays " Wizard 's Chess " , while the characters of Star Trek prefer " Tri @-@ Dimensional Chess " . The hero of Searching for Bobby Fischer struggles against adopting the aggressive and misanthropic views of a world chess champion . Chess has been used as the core theme of a musical , Chess , by Tim Rice , Björn Ulvaeus , and Benny Andersson . Pawn Sacrifice starring Tobey Maguire as Bobby Fischer and Liev Schreiber as Boris Spassky depicts the 1972 World Chess Championship in Iceland during the Cold War and Fischer 's subsequent descent into madness . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems ( the problems themselves are sometimes also called chess compositions ) . A person who creates such problems is known as a chess composer . There are many types of chess problems . The two most important are : 
 <unk> : white to move first and checkmate black within a specified number of moves against any defense . These are often referred to as " mate in n " – for example " mate in three " ( a three @-@ mover ) ; two and three move problems are the most common . These usually involve positions which would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game , and are intended to illustrate a particular " theme " , usually requiring a surprising or counter @-@ intuitive " key move " . 
 Studies : orthodox problems in which the stipulation is that white to play must win or draw . Almost all studies are endgame positions . 
 Chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport , and tournaments ( or tourneys ) exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems . 
 = = = Example = = = 
 This is one of the most famous chess studies ; it was published by Richard Réti in 1921 . It seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn , while the black king can easily stop the white pawn . The solution is a diagonal advance , which brings the king to both pawns simultaneously : 
 1 . Kg7 ! h4 2 . Kf6 ! <unk> 
 Or 2 ... h3 <unk> and the white king can support its pawn . 
 3 . Ke5 ! ! 
 Now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn , or catch the black one . 
 3 ... h3 4 . Kd6 ½ – ½

 = = = Organization of competitions = = = 
 Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues , tournaments , and congresses . Chess 's international governing body is FIDE ( Fédération Internationale des Échecs ) . Most countries have a national chess organization as well ( such as the US Chess Federation and English Chess Federation ) which in turn is a member of FIDE . FIDE is a member of the International Olympic Committee , but the game of chess has never been part of the Olympic Games ; chess does have its own Olympiad , held every two years as a team event . 
 The current World Chess Champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway . The reigning Women 's World Champion is Hou <unk> from China . The world 's highest rated female player , Judit Polgár , has never participated in the Women 's World Chess Championship , instead preferring to compete with the leading men and maintaining a ranking among the top male players . 
 Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship , the European Individual Chess Championship , and the National Chess Championships . Invitation @-@ only tournaments regularly attract the world 's strongest players . Examples include Spain 's Linares event , Monte Carlo 's Melody Amber tournament , the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting , Sofia 's M @-@ tel Masters , and Wijk aan Zee 's Tata Steel tournament . 
 Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship . The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championships include both team and individual events . 
 Besides these prestigious competitions , there are thousands of other chess tournaments , matches , and festivals held around the world every year catering to players of all levels . Chess is promoted as a " mind sport " by the Mind Sports Organisation , alongside other mental @-@ skill games such as Contract Bridge , Go , and Scrabble . 
 = = = Titles and rankings = = = 
 The best players can be awarded specific lifetime titles by the world chess organization FIDE : 
 Grandmaster ( shortened as GM ; sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used ) is awarded to world @-@ class chess masters . Apart from World Champion , Grandmaster is the highest title a chess player can attain . Before FIDE will confer the title on a player , the player must have an Elo chess rating ( see below ) of at least 2500 at one time and three favorable results ( called norms ) in tournaments involving other grandmasters , including some from countries other than the applicant 's . There are other milestones a player can achieve to attain the title , such as winning the World Junior Championship . 
 International Master ( shortened as IM ) . The conditions are similar to GM , but less demanding . The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400 . 
 FIDE Master ( shortened as FM ) . The usual way for a player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving a FIDE rating of 2300 or more . 
 Candidate Master ( shortened as CM ) . Similar to FM , but with a FIDE rating of at least 2200 . 
 All the titles are open to men and women . Separate women @-@ only titles , such as Woman Grandmaster ( <unk> ) , are available . Beginning with Nona <unk> in 1978 , a number of women have earned the GM title , and most of the top ten women in 2006 hold the unrestricted GM title . 
 As of August 2011 , there are 1363 active grandmasters and <unk> international masters in the world . Top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmasters are Russia , Ukraine , and Germany , with 208 , 78 , and 76 . The country with most grandmasters per capita is Iceland , with 11 GMs and 13 IMs among the population of 310 @,@ 000 . 
 International titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players ( by the International Correspondence Chess Federation ) . National chess organizations may also award titles , usually to the advanced players still under the level needed for international titles ; an example is the Chess expert title used in the United States . 
 In order to rank players , FIDE , ICCF , and national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo . Elo is a statistical system based on the assumption that the chess performance of each player in their games is a random variable . Arpad Elo thought of a player 's true skill as the average of that player 's performance random variable , and showed how to estimate the average from results of player 's games . The US Chess Federation implemented Elo 's suggestions in 1960 , and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems ; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970 . The highest FIDE rating of all time , <unk> , was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list .

 Chess has a very extensive literature . In 1913 , the chess historian H. J. R. Murray estimated the total number of books , magazines , and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5 @,@ 000 . B.H.

David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that , " Since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications . No one knows how many have been printed . " There are two significant public chess libraries : the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library , with over 32 @,@ 000 chess books and over 6 @,@ 000 bound volumes of chess periodicals ; and the Chess & <unk> collection at the National Library of the Netherlands , with about 30 @,@ 000 books . Grandmaster Lothar Schmid owned the world 's largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia . David <unk> 's chess library contains 7 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 chess books , a similar number of autographs ( letters , score sheets , manuscripts ) , and about 1 @,@ 000 items of " ephemera " . Dirk Jan ten <unk> opines that <unk> 's collection " is arguably the finest chess collection in the world " .

 The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be about 1043 , and is <unk> less than 1047 , with a game @-@ tree complexity of approximately <unk> . The game @-@ tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as <unk> , a number known as the Shannon number . Typically an average position has thirty to forty possible moves , but there may be as few as zero ( in the case of checkmate or stalemate ) or as many as 218 . 
 Chess has inspired many combinatorial puzzles , such as the knight 's tour and the eight queens puzzle . 
 = = = Computer chess = = = 
 One of the most important mathematical challenges of chess is the development of algorithms that can play chess . The idea of creating a chess @-@ playing machine dates to the 18th century ; around 1769 , the chess @-@ playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as a hoax . Serious trials based on automata , such as El <unk> , were too complex and limited to be useful . 
 Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s , chess enthusiasts , computer engineers and computer scientists have built , with increasing degrees of seriousness and success , chess @-@ playing machines and computer programs . The groundbreaking paper on computer chess , " Programming a Computer for Playing Chess " , was published in 1950 by Shannon . He wrote : 
 The chess machine is an ideal one to start with , since : ( 1 ) the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations ( the moves ) and in the ultimate goal ( checkmate ) ; ( 2 ) it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution ; ( 3 ) chess is generally considered to require " thinking " for skillful play ; a solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of a mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of " thinking " ; ( 4 ) the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers . 
 The Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) held the first major chess tournament for computers , the North American Computer Chess Championship , in September 1970 . <unk> 3 @.@ 0 , a chess program from Northwestern University , won the championship . Nowadays , chess programs compete in the World Computer Chess Championship , held annually since 1974 . At first considered only a curiosity , the best chess playing programs , for example Rybka , have become extremely strong . In 1997 , a computer won a chess match against a reigning World Champion for the first time : IBM 's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3 ½ – 2 ½ ( it scored two wins , one loss , and three draws ) . In 2009 , a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating <unk> : chess engine <unk> 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw . The best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players , to the extent that human @-@ computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media . 
 With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability , computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches . Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents all over the world . The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games , most notably the " bathroom controversy " during the 2006 World Championship . 
 = = = Relation to game theory = = = 
 In 1913 , Ernst Zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies , which is considered as one of the predecessors of game theory . Zermelo 's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess , i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game ( either white can force a win , or black can force a win , or both sides can force at least a draw ) . However , according to Claude Shannon , there are 1043 legal positions in chess , so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology . 
 The 11 @-@ category , game theoretical taxonomy of chess includes : two player , no @-@ chance , combinatorial , Markov state ( present state is all a player needs to move ; although past state led up to that point , knowledge of the sequence of past moves is not required to make the next move , except to take into account of en passant and castling , which do depend on the past moves ) , zero sum , symmetric , perfect information , non @-@ cooperative , discrete , extensive form ( tree decisions , not payoff matrices ) , sequential .

 Generalized chess ( played on n x n board , without 50 @-@ move drawing rule ) is <unk> @-@ complete .

 Some applications of combinatorial game theory to chess endgames was found by Elkies ( 1996 ) . 
 Some positions in infinite chess ( an infinite chessboard , with one king of each color , but unlimited number of other pieces ) with transfinite combinatorial game values were constructed in Evans and <unk> ( 2013 ) . 
 = = Psychology = = 
 There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology . Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal , rather than visuospatial , ability lies at the core of expertise . In his doctoral thesis , Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position . According to de Groot , this perception , made possible by years of practice and study , is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves . De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly . The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess @-@ playing skill , since masters and novices , when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces , had equivalent recall ( about half a dozen positions in each case ) . Rather , it is the ability to recognize patterns , which are then memorized , which distinguished the skilled players from the novices . When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game , the masters had almost total positional recall . 
 More recent research has focused on chess as mental training ; the respective roles of knowledge and look @-@ ahead search ; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices ; blindfold chess ; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill ; gender differences ; and computational models of chess expertise . The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to a lot of research recently . Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess . Recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important . For example , Fernand <unk> and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring . Chess players are more likely to be non @-@ right @-@ handed , though they found no correlation between handedness and skill . 
 = = = Chess and intelligence = = = 
 Although the link between performance in chess and general intelligence is often assumed , researchers have largely failed to confirm its existence . For example , a 2006 study found no differences in fluid intelligence , as measured by Raven 's Progressive Matrices , between strong adult chess players and regular people . There is some evidence towards a correlation between performance in chess and intelligence among beginning players . However , performance in chess also relies substantially on one 's experience playing the game , and the role of experience may overwhelm the role of intelligence . Chess experts are estimated to have in excess of 10 @,@ 000 and possibly as many as 300 @,@ 000 position patterns stored in their memory ; long training is necessary to acquire that amount of data . 
 A 2007 study of young chess players in the United Kingdom found that strong players tended to have above @-@ average IQ scores , but , within that group , the correlation between chess skill and IQ was moderately negative , meaning that smarter children tended to achieve a lower level of chess skill . This result was explained by a negative correlation between intelligence and practice in the elite <unk> , and by practice having a higher influence on chess skill . 
 = = Variants = = 
 There are more than two thousand published chess variants , most of them of relatively recent origin . Variants can include : 
 direct predecessors of chess such as <unk> and shatranj ; 
 traditional national or regional games which share common ancestors with Western chess such as xiangqi , shogi , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; 
 modern variations employing different rules ( e.g. Losing chess ) , or different forces ( e.g. Dunsany 's chess ) , or non @-@ standard pieces ( e.g. Grand Chess ) , or different board geometries ( e.g. hexagonal chess ) . One of the most popular modern variants is Chess960 , where the starting position is selected randomly , rendering the use of prepared opening lines impracticable . 
 In the context of chess variants , regular ( i.e. FIDE ) chess is sometimes referred to as Western chess , international chess , orthodox chess or <unk> .

 " Express " is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for the accompanying soundtrack album to her film Burlesque ( 2010 ) . Written by Aguilera , C. " Tricky " Stewart and Claude Kelly and was produced by Stewart , " Express " is an uptempo electropop number . The track premiered on November 3 , 2010 on On Air with Ryan Seacrest to promote the soundtrack . It was also released to Australian radio as a single on December 6 , 2010 . 
 " Express " received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who praised its both old @-@ school – and – contemporary sound . It attained moderate chart success , peaking at number two on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles and also charting in other territories . Aguilera performed the track at the American Music Awards of 2010 and on the seventh season of British television singing contest The X Factor . 
 = = Background and composition = = 
 In support of her sixth studio album , Bionic , Aguilera planned to embark on the Bionic Tour . However , on May 24 , 2010 , the singer and tour promoter Live Nation both posted messages on their websites stating that due to excessive promotion of Bionic and preparing for her upcoming film debut in Burlesque , she felt she would need more time to be able to put together a show that her fans deserve to see . Aguilera stated that this was not possible to do in less than one month between the release of the album and the start of the tour as she would need more time to rehearse . For the accompanying soundtrack for the film , Aguilera worked with Tricky Stewart ; he co @-@ wrote and produced two songs , " Show Me How You Burlesque " and " Express " , and produced several other tracks including " Something 's Got a Hold on Me " , " Tough Lover " and " But I Am a Good Girl " . " Express " was premiered on the On Air with Ryan Seacrest radio show ( KIIS @-@ FM ) on November 3 , 2010 as a promotional single from the album . 
 " Express " was written by Aguilera , Christopher Stewart and Claude Kelly , and was produced by Tricky Stewart . Aguilera 's vocals on the track span two octaves , from the low @-@ note of E3 to the high @-@ note of E5 . It is an electropop song ; the melody of " Express " is similar to the old @-@ school style of " Lady Marmalade " , and has a dance production . Thus , " Express " has an old @-@ school sound , but is also modern . Lyrically , the song evokes sexual theme , as she " seductively " sings , " Show a little leg , you gotta shimmy your chest " .

 " Express " received mainly positive reviews from music critics . Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine called the song " nasty , buzzing bump @-@ and @-@ grind " and " a bionic ' Lady Marmalade ' " . Blogcritics thought that " Express " , among with " Show Me How You Burlesque " are the two songs that " work better in the context of the movie , where the elaborate visuals help distract from their lack of melody and strong hooks " . An online website , Movie @-@ Moron was positive toward the track , saying that it is " the most modern sounding thing " in the soundtrack , also compared " Express " to Aguilera 's 2002 single " Dirrty " . 
 Commercially , " Express " charted on several music charts worldwide , despite not being released as an official single . In the United States , the song peaked at number two on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . In the United Kingdom , " Express " peaked at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart , and also charted on the UK R & B Chart at number 21 on December 25 , 2010 . On the Swiss Singles Chart , " Express " debuted and peaked at number 54 on January 21 , 2011 , and stayed there for 3 weeks . In Japan , the track also peaked at number 68 .

 To promote " Express " and Burlesque , Aguilera has performed the track on two shows . Aguilera performed " Express " for the first time at the American Music Awards of 2010 on November 21 , 2010 , held at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles , California . During an interview with MTV News about the performance , Aguilera stated that the performance would be " fantastic " and would " give a fitting look inside the movie " . Wearing a " black spangly bodysuit " with knee @-@ high boots and a bowler , Aguilera seated in a chair with her back to the audience in the beginning of the show . She began to snap her fingers and leaned into the " jazzy , skittery rhythms " of " Express " . Later , the scene revealed a set made up to mimic the backstage at a burlesque club , with the singer surrounded by a number of dancers . Gil Kaufman of MTV News said that the performance is a flash back to the " Dirrty @-@ era " of Aguilera . 
 On December 11 , 2010 , Aguilera performed " Express " again on the seventh series of British television singing contest The X Factor . During the show , the singer cavorted around the stage in her lingerie with her " army of scantily clad female dancers " . Aguilera 's performance , as well as Rihanna 's one of " What 's My Name ?

 BuzzSaw is a Maurer Söhne SkyLoop roller coaster located within the Town of Gold Rush section of the Dreamworld amusement park on the Gold Coast of Australia . The ride began operation on 17 September 2011 as part of Dreamworld 's 30th birthday celebrations . 
 BuzzSaw is one of Dreamworld 's " Big 9 " thrill rides and has a track length of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) . The steel ride consists of a single train which holds 12 riders and lasts approximately 50 seconds . BuzzSaw features the tallest inversion in the Southern Hemisphere and is currently the second @-@ highest inversion of its type in the world . 
 The ride is themed around a series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which date back to the late 1800s . The setting is based on encounters with the ghost of one Jack Darke , who was killed by a buzz saw at a sawmill built after the gold rush ended .

 In December 2009 , a Gold Coast Bulletin report detailed a variety of new attractions for the region 's theme parks and stated that Dreamworld was in negotiations with a manufacturer to add to its " Big 6 " thrill rides . In February 2011 , Dreamworld 's operator , Ardent Leisure , announced the addition of two new rides in 2011 as part of Dreamworld 's 30th Birthday . In April 2011 , it was announced that in addition to a family thrill ride ( Shockwave which opened in June 2011 ) , another major ride would be opened in time for the September school holidays . The name " BuzzSaw " was confirmed two months later by the park 's outgoing CEO , Noel Dempsey , who also confirmed plans to team up with DreamWorks Animation . Vertical construction for BuzzSaw started around the same time . 
 On 20 July 2011 , Dreamworld officially announced the addition of BuzzSaw to the Dreamworld park to the public . Testing for the ride began in early September 2011 , and BuzzSaw opened officially to the public on 17 September 2011 .

 Marketing for BuzzSaw began on 6 July 2011 when Dreamworld released a television commercial promoting their plans to open a " new bone @-@ chilling thrill ride " by September of that year . At this stage , the name BuzzSaw had not been officially announced . A second television marketing campaign was released for BuzzSaw on 8 September 2011 , just before its official opening on 17 September 2011 . The commercial stated " this September fear will reach new heights " . Banners around Dreamworld advertise BuzzSaw as a " ripper of a ride " .

 BuzzSaw is themed around a series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which date back to the late 1800s . In 1876 , the Town of Gold Rush was formed . It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush . Eleven years later , in 1887 , the town 's Gold supply was completely gone . The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber . On a clear moon @-@ lit night , a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire . The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the buzz saw . The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death .

 The entrance to BuzzSaw is located in the Town of Gold Rush where the Helicopter Joy Flights used to operate , opposite the former entrance of the Eureka Mountain Mine Ride . The station is themed to the abandoned sawmill in the town of Gold Rush and tells the story of Jack Darke . Within the building , guests are directed through a series of queue switchbacks and pathways . Several television screens are embedded in the walls and show burning timber . Parts of the theming are caged off with crime scene signs . Throughout the queue , guests are able to hear the sound of buzzsaws as well as several warnings to not go any further and to escape while they can . Large circular saws ( a.k.a. buzzsaws ) are located on the side and roof of the building .

 = Byzantine Greeks = 
 The Byzantine Greeks or Byzantines were the medieval Greek or Hellenised citizens of the Byzantine Empire ( Eastern Roman Empire ) , centered mainly in Constantinople , the southern Balkans , the Greek islands , Asia Minor ( modern Turkey ) , Cyprus and the large urban centres of the Levant and northern Egypt . Throughout the Middle Ages , the Byzantine Greeks self @-@ identified as <unk> ( Greek : <unk> pronounced [ <unk> ] , " Romans " ) and <unk> ( Γραικοί , " Greeks " ) , but are referred to as " Byzantines " and " Byzantine Greeks " in modern historiography . The terms " Byzantine Empire " and " Byzantine Greeks " were first coined in the English language by British historian George Finlay . 
 The social structure of the Byzantine Greeks was primarily supported by a rural , agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry , and a small fraction of the poor . These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements : the chorion or village , the <unk> or hamlet , and the <unk> or estate . Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base . Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis . As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century , more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men @-@ at @-@ arms or mercenaries . 
 Until the twelfth century , education within the Byzantine Greek population was more advanced than in the West , particularly at primary school level , resulting in comparatively high literacy rates . Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants , who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade . Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants , they held their own throughout the latter half of the Byzantine Empire 's existence . The clergy also held a special place , not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts , but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equal of the pope . This position of strength had built up over time , for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire , under Emperor Constantine the Great ( reigned 306 – 337 ) , only a small part , about 10 % , of the population was Christian . 
 The language of the Byzantine Greeks since the age of Constantine had been Greek , although Latin was the language of the administration . From the reign of Emperor Heraclius ( reigned 610 – 641 ) , Greek was the predominant language amongst the populace and also replaced Latin in administration . At first the Byzantine Empire had a multi @-@ ethnic character , but following the loss of the non @-@ Greek speaking provinces it came to be dominated by the Byzantine Greeks . Over time , the relationship between them and the West , particularly with Latin Europe , deteriorated . 
 Relations were further damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East that led to the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West . Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and particularly following the coronation of Charlemagne ( reigned as king of the Franks 768 – 814 ) in Rome in 800 , the Byzantine Greeks were not considered by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire , but rather as part of an Eastern kingdom made up of Greek peoples . However , the Byzantine Empire could claim to be the Roman Empire , continuing the unbroken line of succession of the Roman emperors . 
 = = Terminology = = 
 During most of the Middle Ages , the Byzantine Greeks identified themselves as <unk> ( <unk> , " Romans " , meaning citizens of the Roman Empire ) , a term which in the Greek language had become synonymous with Christian Greeks . They also identified themselves as <unk> ( Γραικοί , " Greeks " ) ; the ethnonym was used habitually for self @-@ referential purposes except in official Byzantine political correspondence prior to the Fourth Crusade of 1204 . The ancient name Hellene was in popular use synonymous to " pagan " and was revived as an ethnonym in the Middle Byzantine period ( 11th century ) . 
 While in the West the term " Roman " acquired a new meaning in connection with the Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome , the Greek form " Romaioi " remained attached to the Greeks of the Eastern Roman Empire . These people called themselves Romaioi ( Romans ) in their language , and the term " Byzantines " or " Byzantine Greeks " is an exonym applied by later historians like Hieronymus Wolf . However , the use of the term " Byzantine Greeks " for the Romaioi is not entirely uncontroversial . 
 Most historians agree that the defining features of their civilization were : 1 ) Greek language , culture , literature , and science , 2 ) Roman law and tradition , 3 ) Christian faith . The term " Byzantine " has been adopted by Western scholarship on the assumption that anything Roman is essentially " Western " , and also by modern Greek scholarship for nationalistic reasons of identification with ancient Greece . In modern times , the Greek people still use the ethnonyms " Romaioi " ( or rather " Romioi " ) and " Graikoi " to refer to themselves . In addition , the Eastern Roman Empire was in language and civilization a Greek society . 
 Byzantinist August Heisenberg ( 1869 – 1930 ) defined the Byzantine Empire as " the Christianised Roman empire of the Greek nation " . Byzantium was primarily known as the Empire of the Greeks by foreigners due to the predominance of Greek linguistic , cultural , and demographic elements . 
 = = Historic perspective = = 
 Byzantine Greeks , forming the majority of the Byzantine Empire proper at the height of its power , gradually came under the dominance of foreign powers with the decline of the Empire during the Middle Ages . Mostly coming under Arab Muslim rule , Byzantine Greeks either fled their former lands or subdued to the new Muslim rulers , receiving the status of <unk> . Over the centuries surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks evolved into Antiochian Greeks , <unk> or merged into the societies of Arab Christians , existing to this day . 
 On the other hand , other Byzantines converted to Islam and underwent Turkification over time , mainly those in Anatolia . 
 = = Society = = 
 While social mobility was not unknown in Byzantium the order of society was thought of as more enduring , with the average man regarding the court of Heaven to be the archetype of the imperial court in Constantinople . This society included various classes of people that were neither exclusive nor immutable . The most characteristic were the poor , the peasants , the soldiers , the teachers , entrepreneurs , and clergy . 
 = = = The poor = = = 
 According to a text dated to AD 533 , a man was termed " poor " if he did not have 50 gold coins ( <unk> ) , which was a modest though not negligible sum . The Byzantines were heirs to the Greek concepts of charity for the sake of the polis ; nevertheless it was the Christian concepts attested in the Bible that animated their giving habits , and specifically the examples of Basil of Caesarea ( who is the Greek equivalent of Santa Claus ) , Gregory of Nyssa , and John Chrysostom . The number of the poor fluctuated in the many centuries of Byzantium 's existence , but they provided a constant supply of muscle power for the building projects and rural work . Their numbers apparently increased in the late fourth and early fifth centuries as barbarian raids and a desire to avoid taxation pushed rural populations into cities . 
 Since Homeric times , there were several categories of poverty : the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> , " passive poor " ) was lower than the penes ( Greek : <unk> , " active poor " ) . They formed the majority of the infamous Constantinopolitan mob whose function was similar to the mob of the First Rome . However , while there are instances of riots attributed to the poor , the majority of civil disturbances were specifically attributable to the various factions of the Hippodrome like the Greens and Blues . The poor made up a non @-@ negligible percentage of the population , but they influenced the Christian society of Byzantium to create a large network of hospitals ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) and almshouses , and a religious and social model largely justified by the existence of the poor and born out of the Christian transformation of classical society . 
 = = = Peasantry = = = 
 There are no reliable figures as to the numbers of the peasantry , yet it is widely assumed that the vast majority of Byzantines lived in rural and agrarian areas . In the <unk> of Emperor Leo VI the Wise ( r . 886 – 912 ) , the two professions defined as the backbone of the state are the peasantry ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) and the soldiers ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) . The reason for this was that besides producing most of the Empire 's food the peasants also produced most of its taxes . 
 Peasants lived mostly in villages , whose name changed slowly from the classical <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) to the modern <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) . While agriculture and herding were the dominant occupations of villagers they were not the only ones . There are records for the small town of <unk> , situated on the eastern shore of the Hellespont , which out of 173 households classifies 113 as peasant and 60 as urban , which indicate other kinds of ancillary activities . 
 The Treatise on Taxation , preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice , distinguishes between three types of rural settlements , the chorion ( Greek : <unk> ) or village , the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or hamlet , and the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or estate . According to a 14th @-@ century survey of the village of <unk> , donated to the monastery of <unk> , the average size of a landholding is only 3 @.@ 5 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 08 ha ) . Taxes placed on rural populations included the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or hearth tax , the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or cash payment frequently affiliated with the <unk> , the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) or pasture tax , and the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> , meaning " of the air " ) which depended on the village 's population and ranged between 4 and 20 gold coins annually . 
 Their diet consisted of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat . Bread , wine , and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double @-@ baked and dried bread called <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) . As in antiquity and modern times , the most common cultivations in the <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) were olive groves and vineyards . While Liutprand of Cremona , a visitor from Italy , found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin ( <unk> ) most other Westerners admired Greek wines , Cretan in particular being famous . 
 While both hunting and fishing were common , the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops . <unk> , the keeping of bees , was as highly developed in Byzantium as it had been in Ancient Greece . Aside from agriculture , the peasants also laboured in the crafts , fiscal inventories mentioning smiths ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) , tailors ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) , and cobblers ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 = = = Soldiers = = = 
 During the Byzantine millennium , hardly a year passed without a military campaign . Soldiers were a normal part of everyday life , much more so than in modern Western societies . While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect , it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile . The military handbooks known as the <unk> continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition , and contain a wealth of information about the appearance , customs , habits , and life of the soldiers . 
 As with the peasantry , many soldiers performed ancillary activities , like medics and technicians . Selection for military duty was annual with yearly call @-@ ups and great stock was placed on military exercises , during the winter months , which formed a large part of a soldier 's life . 
 Until the 11th century , the majority of the conscripts were from rural areas , while the conscription of craftsmen and merchants is still an open question . From then on , professional recruiting replaced conscription , and the increasing use of mercenaries in the army was ruinous for the treasury . From the 10th century onwards , there were laws connecting land ownership and military service . While the state never allotted land for obligatory service , soldiers could and did use their pay to buy landed estates , and taxes would be decreased or waived in some cases . What the state did allocate to soldiers , however , from the 12th century onwards , were the tax revenues from some estates called <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) . As in antiquity , the basic food of the soldier remained the dried biscuit bread , though its name had changed from <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) to <unk> . 
 = = = Teachers = = = 
 Byzantine education was the product of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC . It comprised a tripartite system of education that , taking shape during the Hellenistic era , was maintained , with inevitable changes , up until the fall of Constantinople . The stages of education were the elementary school , where pupils ranged from six to ten years , secondary school , where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen , and higher education . 
 Elementary education was widely available throughout most of the Byzantine Empire 's existence , in towns and occasionally in the countryside . This , in turn , ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe , at least until the twelfth century . Secondary education was confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople . 
 Though not a society of modern mass literacy , Byzantine society was a profoundly literate one . Based on information from an extensive array of Byzantine documents from different periods ( i.e. homilies , Ecloga , etc . ) , Robert Browning concluded that functional literacy ( reading and writing ) , access to elementary education and even book ownership ( for those who could afford books ) were widespread in Byzantium ( i.e. cities , monasteries , countryside , etc . ) . Nikolaos <unk> , focusing on 13th @-@ century Byzantine literacy in Western Asia Minor , states that Byzantine society had " a completely literate church , an almost completely literate aristocracy , some literate horsemen , rare literate peasants and almost completely illiterate women . " Ioannis <unk> estimates that the percentage of the Empire 's population with some degree of literacy was at most 15 – 20 % based primarily on the mention of illiterate Byzantine tourmarchai in the Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise ( r . 886 – 912 ) . 
 In Byzantium , the elementary school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books ( Aesop 's Fables were often used ) . However , the grammarian and rhetorician , teachers responsible for the following two phases of education , were more respected . These used classical Greek texts like Homer 's Iliad or Odyssey and much of their time was taken with detailed word @-@ for @-@ word explication . Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students . 
 = = = Women = = = 
 Women have tended to be overlooked in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them . Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education , and limited in their freedom of movement . The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases : girlhood , motherhood , and widowhood . 
 Childhood was brief and perilous , even more so for girls than boys . Parents would celebrate the birth of a boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide ( i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation ) , though it was contrary to both civil and canon law . Educational opportunities for girls were few : they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors . With few exceptions , education was limited to literacy and the Bible ; a famous exception is the Princess Anna Comnena , whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition . The majority of a young girl 's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores , preparing herself for marriage . 
 For most girls , childhood came to an end with the onset of puberty , which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage . Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm , romantic love was not unknown . Most women bore many children but few survived infancy , and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life . The main form of birth control was abstinence , and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes . 
 Due to prevailing norms of modesty , women would wear clothing that covered the whole of their body except their hands . While women among the poor sometimes wore sleeveless tunics , most women were obliged to cover even their hair with the long <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) veil . Women of means , however , spared no expense in adorning their clothes with exquisite jewelry and fine silk fabrics . Divorces were hard to obtain even though there were laws permitting them . Husbands would often beat their wives , though the reverse was not unknown , as in Theodore Prodromos 's description of a battered husband in the <unk> poems . 
 Although female life expectancy in Byzantium was lower than that of men , due to death in childbirth , wars and the fact that men married younger , female widowhood was still fairly common . Still , some women were able to circumvent societal strictures and work as traders , artisans , abbots , entertainers , and scholars . 
 = = = Entrepreneurs = = = 
 The traditional image of Byzantine Greek merchants as <unk> benefactors of state aid is beginning to change for that of mobile , pro @-@ active agents . The merchant class , particularly that of Constantinople , became a force of its own that could , at times , even threaten the Emperor as it did in the eleventh and twelfth centuries . This was achieved through efficient use of credit and other monetary innovations . Merchants invested surplus funds in financial products called <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) , the equivalent and perhaps ancestor of the later Italian <unk> . 
 Eventually , the purchasing power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria . In reflection of their success , emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate , that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite . This had an end by the end of the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more . Following that phase , however , the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade . 
 The reason Byzantine Greek merchants have often been neglected in historiography is not that they were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade . It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium , which was often under the patronage of their competitors , the court , and land aristocracy . The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians . 
 = = = Clergy = = = 
 Unlike in Western Europe where priests were clearly demarcated from the laymen , the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire remained in close contact with the rest of society . Readers and <unk> were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30 . Unlike the Latin church , the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons , as long as they were married before ordination . Bishops , however , were required to be unmarried . 
 While the religious hierarchy mirrored the Empire 's administrative divisions , the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor 's servants . The issue of <unk> , while usually associated with the Byzantine Empire , is now understood to be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire . By the fifth century , the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome . 
 The ecclesiastical provinces were called eparchies and were headed by archbishops or metropolitans who supervised their subordinate bishops or <unk> . For most people , however , it was their parish priest or <unk> ( from the Greek word for " father " ) that was the most recognizable face of the clergy . 
 = = Culture = = 
 = = = Language = = = 
 Linguistically , Byzantine or medieval Greek is situated between the Hellenistic ( Koine ) and modern phases of the language . Since as early as the Hellenistic era , Greek had been the lingua franca of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean , spoken natively in the southern Balkans , the Greek islands , Asia Minor , and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy , the Black Sea , Western Asia and North Africa . At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium , the koine ( Greek : <unk> ) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings , while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators . 
 As Christianity became the dominant religion , Attic began to be used in Christian writings in addition to and often interspersed with koine Greek . Nonetheless , from the 6th at least until the 12th century , Attic remained entrenched in the educational system ; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods . 
 The population of the Byzantine Empire , at least in its early stages , had a variety of mother tongues including Greek . These included Latin , Aramaic , Coptic , and Caucasian languages , while Cyril Mango also cites evidence for bilingualism in the south and southeast . These influences , as well as an influx of people of Arabic , Celtic , Germanic , Turkic , and Slavic backgrounds , supplied medieval Greek with many loanwords that have survived in the modern Greek language . From the 11th century onward , there was also a steady rise in the literary use of the vernacular . 
 Following the Fourth Crusade , there was increased contact with the West ; and the lingua franca of commerce became Italian . In the areas of the Crusader kingdoms a classical education ( Greek : <unk> , paideia ) ceased to be a sine qua non of social status , leading to the rise of the vernacular . From this era many beautiful works in the vernacular , often written by people deeply steeped in classical education , are attested . A famous example is the four <unk> poems attributed to Theodoros Prodromos . From the 13th to the 15th centuries , the last centuries of the Empire , there arose several works , including laments , fables , romances , and chronicles , written outside Constantinople , which until then had been the seat of most literature , in an idiom termed by scholars as " Byzantine Koine " . 
 However , the diglossia of the Greek @-@ speaking world , which had already started in ancient Greece , continued under Ottoman rule and persisted in the modern Greek state until 1976 , although Koine Greek remains the official language of the Greek Orthodox Church . As shown in the poems of <unk> , an early stage of modern Greek had already been shaped by the 12th century and possibly earlier . Vernacular Greek continued to be known as " <unk> " until the 20th century . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 At the time of Constantine the Great ( r . 306 – 337 ) , barely 10 % of the Roman Empire 's population were Christians , with most of them being urban population and generally found in the eastern part of the Roman Empire . The majority of people still honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio . As Christianity became a complete philosophical system , whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word , this changed . In addition , Constantine , as Pontifex Maximus , was responsible for the correct cultus or <unk> of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice . The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as break with the past , though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal . 
 Christianity led to the development of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium . Namely , the intimate connection between Church and State , a legacy of Roman cultus . Also , the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives . And finally , the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out , however , since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it . These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others . 
 Christians at the time of Constantine 's conversion made up only 10 % of the population . This would rise to 50 % by the end of the fourth century and 90 % by the end of the fifth century . Emperor Justinian I ( r . 527 – 565 ) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans , highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other . A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction . 
 The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the emperor in the affairs of the Church . The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative and financial routine of organising religious affairs , and this routine was applied to the Christian Church . Following the pattern set by Eusebius of Caesarea , the Byzantines viewed the emperor as a representative or messenger of Christ , responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans , and for the " externals " of the religion , such as administration and finances . The imperial role in the affairs of the Church never developed into a fixed , legally defined system , however . 
 With the decline of Rome , and internal dissension in the other Eastern patriarchates , the church of Constantinople became , between the 6th and 11th centuries , the richest and most influential centre of Christendom . Even when the Byzantine Empire was reduced to only a shadow of its former self , the Church , as an institution , exercised so much influence both inside and outside the imperial frontiers as never before . As George Ostrogorsky points out : 
 " The Patriarchate of Constantinople remained the center of the Orthodox world , with subordinate metropolitan sees and archbishoprics in the territory of Asia Minor and the Balkans , now lost to Byzantium , as well as in Caucasus , Russia and Lithuania . The Church remained the most stable element in the Byzantine Empire . " 
 In terms of religion , Byzantine Greek Macedonia is also significant as being the home of Saints Cyril and Methodius , two Greek brothers from Thessaloniki ( Salonika ) who were sent on state @-@ sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east @-@ central Europe . This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs ' own language , for which they invented an alphabet that became known as Old Church Slavonic . In the process , this cemented the Greek brothers ' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization and Orthodox Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs .

 Within the Byzantine Empire , a Greek or Hellenised citizen was generally called a <unk> ( <unk> ) , which was first of all defined in opposition to a foreigner , <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) . The Byzantine Greeks were , and perceived themselves as , the descendants of their classical Greek forebears , the political heirs of imperial Rome , and followers of the Apostles . Thus , their sense of " <unk> " was different from that of their contemporaries in the West . " <unk> " was the name of the vulgar Greek language , as opposed to " Hellenic " which was its literary or doctrinal form . " Greek " ( <unk> ) had become synonymous with " Roman " ( <unk> ) and " Christian " ( <unk> ) to mean a Christian Greek citizen of the [ Eastern ] Roman Empire . There was always an element of indifference or neglect of everything non @-@ Greek , which was therefore " barbarian " . 
 = = = Official discourse = = = 
 In official discourse , " all inhabitants of the empire were subjects of the emperor , and therefore Romans . " Thus the primary definition of <unk> was " political or statist . " In order to succeed in being a full @-@ blown and unquestioned " Roman " it was best to be a Greek Orthodox Christian and a Greek @-@ speaker , at least in one 's public persona . Yet , the cultural uniformity which the Byzantine church and the state pursued through Orthodoxy and the Greek language was not sufficient to erase distinct identities , nor did it aim to . The highest compliment that could be paid to a foreigner was to call him <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , roughly " a Roman @-@ minded fellow " ) .

The terms <unk> ( Greek : ξένος ) and <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) denoted " people foreign to the local population , " regardless of whether they were from abroad or from elsewhere within the Byzantine Empire . " When a person was away from home he was a stranger and was often treated with suspicion . A monk from western Asia Minor who joined a monastery in Pontus was ' disparaged and mistreated by everyone as a stranger ' . The corollary to regional solidarity was regional hostility . " 
 = = = Revival of Hellenism = = = 
 From an evolutionary standpoint , Byzantium was a multi @-@ ethnic empire that emerged as a Christian empire , soon comprised the Hellenised empire of the East , and ended its thousand @-@ year history , in 1453 , as a Greek Orthodox state : an empire that became a nation , almost by the modern meaning of the word . The presence of a distinctive and historically rich literary culture was also very important in the division between " Greek " East and " Latin " West and thus the formation of both . It was a multi @-@ ethnic empire where the Hellenic element was predominant , especially in the later period . 
 Spoken language and state , the markers of identity that were to become a fundamental tenet of nineteenth @-@ century nationalism throughout Europe became , by accident , a reality during a formative period of medieval Greek history . Beginning in the twelfth century , certain Byzantine Greek intellectuals began to use the ancient Greek ethnonym <unk> ( Greek : <unk> ) in order to describe Byzantine civilisation . 
 During the later period of the Byzantine Empire , Emperor Theodore I Laskaris ( r . 1205 – 1222 ) tried to revive Hellenic tradition by fostering the study of philosophy , for in his opinion there was a danger that philosophy " might abandon the Greeks and seek refuge among the Latins " . In a letter to Pope Gregory IX , the Byzantine emperor John Vatatzes ( r . 1221 – 1254 ) claimed to have received the gift of royalty from Constantine the Great , and put emphasis on his " Hellenic " descent , exalting the wisdom of the Greek people . He was presenting Hellenic culture as an integral part of the Byzantine polity in defiance of Latin claims . 
 Byzantine Greeks had always felt superior for being the inheritors of a more ancient civilisation , but such ethnic identifications had not been politically popular up until then . Hence , in the context of increasing Venetian and Genoese power in the eastern Mediterranean , association with Hellenism took deeper root among the Byzantine elite , on account of a desire to distinguish themselves from the Latin West and to lay legitimate claims to Greek @-@ speaking lands . 
 Claims of association with Hellenism continued and increased throughout the Palaiologan dynasty . The scholar , teacher , and translator , John Argyropoulos , addressed Emperor John VIII Palaiologos ( r . 1425 – 1448 ) as " Sun King of Hellas " and urged the last Byzantine emperor , Constantine XI Palaiologos ( r . 1449 – 1453 ) , to proclaim himself " King of the Hellenes " . During the same period , the neo @-@ platonic philosopher George <unk> <unk> boasted " We are Hellenes by race and culture , " and proposed a reborn Byzantine Empire following a utopian Hellenic system of government centered in Mystras . According to the historian George Sphrantzes , on the eve of the Fall of Constantinople , the last Byzantine emperor urged his soldiers to remember that they were the descendants of Greeks and Romans . 
 = = = Western perception = = = 
 In the eyes of the West , after the coronation of Charlemagne , the Byzantines were not acknowledged as the inheritors of the Roman Empire . Byzantium was rather perceived to be a corrupted continuation of ancient Greece , and was often derided as the " Empire of the Greeks " or " Kingdom of Greece " . Such denials of Byzantium 's Roman heritage and ecumenical rights would instigate the first resentments between Greeks and " Latins " ( for the Latin liturgical rite ) or " Franks " ( for <unk> 's ethnicity ) , as they were called by the Greeks . 
 Popular Western opinion is reflected in the <unk> <unk> , whose anonymous Latin author states that the Greeks had lost their courage and their learning , and therefore did not join in the war against the infidels . In another passage , the ancient Greeks are praised for their military skill and their learning , by which means the author draws a contrast with contemporary Byzantine Greeks , who were generally viewed as a non @-@ warlike and schismatic people . While this reputation seems strange to modern eyes given the unceasing military operations of the Byzantines and their eight century struggle against Islam and Islamic states , it reflects the realpolitik sophistication of the Byzantines , who employed diplomacy and trade as well as armed force in foreign policy , and the high @-@ level of their culture in contrast to the zeal of the Crusaders and the ignorance and superstition of the medieval West . As historian Steven Runciman has put it : 
 " Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw Constantinople and met , to their contemptuous disgust , a society where everyone read and wrote , ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war , it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence " . 
 A turning point in how both sides viewed each other is probably the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 . The massacre followed the deposition of Maria of Antioch , a Norman @-@ Frankish ( therefore " Latin " ) princess who was ruling as regent to her infant son Emperor Alexios II Komnenos . Maria was deeply unpopular due to the heavy @-@ handed favoritism that had been shown the Italian merchants during the regency and popular celebrations of her downfall by the citizenry of Constantinople quickly turned to rioting and massacre . The event and the horrific reports of survivors inflamed religious tensions in the West , leading to the retaliatory sacking of Thessalonica , the empire 's second largest city , by William II of Sicily . An example of Western opinion at the time is the writings of William of Tyre , who described the " Greek nation " as " a brood of vipers , like a serpent in the bosom or a mouse in the wardrobe evilly <unk> their guests " . 
 = = = Modern scholarship = = = 
 In modern Byzantine scholarship , there are currently three main schools of thought on medieval Eastern Roman identity : one that treats it as the medieval manifestation of a perennial Greek national identity , one that considers " <unk> " the mode of self @-@ identification of the subjects of a multi @-@ ethnic empire and a third , recently promulgated by Anthony <unk> , that argues that Eastern Roman identity was a pre @-@ modern national identity .

 = Dumped = 
 Dumped is a British reality television programme which started on 2 September 2007 and aired nightly until 5 September 2007 on Channel 4 . It involved 11 contestants living for three weeks on a rubbish dump next to a landfill site near Croydon , Surrey . The contestants who " survived " the 21 days and used only what they found on the dump were awarded £ 20 @,@ 000 to share equally between them . The working title of the programme was Eco @-@ Challenge . One contestant , Darren Lumsden , voluntarily left the programme on Day 3 . The series was promoted with a large publicity campaign , which included advertisements on websites and a concert by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . The programme achieved a peak of 2 @.@ 4 million viewers , although this was marginally less than the number of people watching other channels at the same time . The programme was criticised because it was filmed on an artificial landfill and for its choice of " fame hungry " contestants .

 Dumped , which was filmed in June 2006 , was initially scheduled for Channel 4 's Spring 2007 line @-@ up . However , this did not occur and the programme was then postponed until the start the channel 's period of " creative renewal " , which was established due to the racism controversy that occurred during the fifth series of Celebrity Big Brother in January 2007 . 
 11 participants , who were not initially informed of their task , must live on a purpose @-@ made rubbish dump adjacent to a working landfill site for 21 days after being left equipped only with a sleeping bag , drinking can and one roll of lavatory paper each . However , food was delivered to the landfill on a weekly basis . A prize fund of £ 20 @,@ 000 was shared equally between those who participated for the entire three weeks . Rob <unk> , director of environmental consultancy Giraffe Innovation , presented the programme and set the contestants regular challenges . The participants had to wear Kevlar gloves , protective boots and face masks when working on the real landfill site . Every person working on the programme was given tetanus , polio and hepatitis vaccinations for their safety .

 The 11 contestants who participated " represented the complete spectrum of public opinion on environmental issues " . Potential participants were not told that the programme would involve living on a landfill , but were instead told that they would be part of " a unique eco @-@ challenge " . One participant , Darren Lumsden , voluntarily left the programme after just three days , claiming that the experience had taught him nothing .

 Described as Channel 4 's " biggest marketing campaigns of the year " , Dumped was promoted via various methods . Advertisements for the programme appeared on websites such as Yahoo , The Guardian , New Scientist , The Daily Telegraph and MSN . Television adverts , using the 1998 single " Delta Sun <unk> Stomp " by Mercury Rev , featured people performing everyday tasks such as bathing whilst on the landfill . Posters featuring the programme 's tagline , " Living off the landfill " , were displayed across Britain and others appeared on the London Underground . Some bus shelters within London featured posters which were made out of rubbish , and 2 September 2007 edition of The Sunday Times featured a biodegradable bag wrap to promote the programme . Eight members of the London Philharmonic Orchestra performed Land of Hope and Glory on the landfill site that the programme was filmed , using instruments that had been made out of waste .

 Dumped was met with a mixed reaction from critics . James Walton , of The Telegraph , was critical of the programme and its purpose ; on Darren 's departure , he said : " According to the narrator , this proved that Darren “ didn ’ t understand ” the experiment . Another interpretation , of course , would be that he did . " The Times criticised the programme for setting the programme in an artificial rubbish dump for health and safety reasons , comparing it to various fakery scandals that had taken place in the programme Blue Peter in the past year . However , Nigel Kendall of the same newspaper called the programme " entertaining " and its contestants " likeable " , while Paul Hoggart said that it gets its point across . Website TV Scoop said that the programme was " a great experiment " , but did not approve of the inclusion of " fame hungry " participants and compared the programme to the most recent series of Big Brother . The website Hecklerspray gave the programme a negative review , calling the participants " absolute fucking morons " , and Orange gave the programme 3 out of 5 stars . Channel 4 controller Julian Bellamy commented on the programme 's failure during Edinburgh Television Festival 2008 , saying that it " didn 't have the human narrative you need " and that it was " a little bit too like other reality shows " . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 It was initially alleged that the programme was staged , as the landfill that the contestants were living on was created especially for the filming . However , Channel 4 has dismissed these allegations , stating that the programme could not be filmed on the real landfill due to health and safety regulations and that they have been " careful not to mislead " . An argument started in the camp between Jermaine and Selena on Day 15 , which resulted in some participants stating that they felt intimidated by his actions . The programme 's producers had to enter the dump and discuss , along with the other members of the group , whether Jermaine should remain on the programme . Jermaine himself offered to voluntarily leave the programme , but the producers and the other participants decided to keep him . This was criticised in some reviews ; one of which called Jermaine " a loud mouthed moron " . 
 = Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in " The Curse of the Flying Hellfish " = 
 " Raging Abe Simpson and His Grumbling Grandson in ' The Curse of the Flying Hellfish ' " ( or also known as The Curse of the Flying Hellfish ) is the 22nd episode of The Simpsons ' seventh season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 28 , 1996 . 
 In the episode , one of Abraham " Grampa " Simpson 's fellow World War II veterans , Asa Phelps , dies , leaving him and Mr. Burns as the only living members of Grampa 's war squad , the Flying Hellfish . In the final days of the war , the unit had discovered several paintings and agreed on a tontine , placing the paintings in a crate , and the final surviving member would inherit the paintings . As Mr. Burns wants the paintings as soon as possible , he orders Grampa 's assassination . To escape death , Grampa moves into the Simpsons ' house , where the family lets him live in Bart 's room . Bart eventually joins Grampa in a daring mission to recover the paintings . 
 The episode was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Jeffrey Lynch . It was inspired by several stories about lost art surfacing . The animation of the episode has been praised for its action and underwater scenes . The staging in several scenes was based on DC Comics 's Sgt. Rock . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 3 , and was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The relationship between Grampa and Bart deteriorates after Grampa 's senility and abrasiveness embarrass Bart during Grandparents Day at Springfield Elementary School , where Grampa claims to have invented the toilet , to have turned cats and dogs against one another , and that Kaiser Wilhelm II stole the word " twenty " . 
 Back at the retirement home , Grampa receives word that Asa Phelps , one of the men who served under his command in the Army during World War II , has died . Their infantry squad – known as the " Flying Hellfish " ( despite not being an aviation unit ) – also included Chief Wiggum 's father Iggy , Seymour Skinner 's father Sheldon , Griff McDonald , Milton " Oxford " or " Ox " Newman @-@ Haas , Etch <unk> and Barney Gumble 's father Arnie . ( It is also mentioned that their field commander was a Flanders , though as his father is portrayed as beatnik in other episodes , this is perhaps Ned 's grandfather or uncle . ) Grampa and Mr. Burns are now the only two surviving members of their squad . Burns wants what he describes as the " Hellfish Bonanza " for himself ; not wanting to wait for Grampa 's natural death , he hires Fernando Vidal , " the world 's most devious assassin , " to kill him . Vidal tries several tricks ( including disguising himself as Homer , with Burns as Marge and Smithers as Bart ) , and as a last resort storms Grampa 's retirement home with a machine gun . Grampa evades the initial volleys by sheer luck and escapes when the attending nurse produces a shotgun and routs the surprised assassin . Fearing that Burns will not give up , Grampa takes shelter with the Simpsons . He moves into Bart 's room , putting further strain on their relationship , and reveals to Bart his reason Burns wants him dead . 
 In a flashback , it is revealed that during the final days of World War II , the Flying Hellfish discovered several priceless paintings in a German castle . To avoid being caught for theft , the soldiers set up a tontine and locked the paintings in a strongbox to be hidden away ; the one who outlived all the others would then inherit the collection . Each man was given a key , all of which would eventually be needed to trigger a mechanism that would reveal where the paintings were hidden . 
 After Grampa finishes his story , Bart dismisses it as fiction but is proven wrong when Burns suddenly breaks in to his room and tries to take Grampa 's key by force . However , Bart manages to steal both keys back and the two Simpsons go after the paintings . They hurry to the local cemetery , where a monument to the Hellfish is located . After activating the locator mechanism built into the monument , they discover that the paintings have been hidden at the bottom of a lake , so they steal a motorboat from Ned Flanders and head out onto the water . Bart brings up the strongbox , but just as he and Grampa open it , Burns shows up to take the paintings at gunpoint . When Bart calls him a coward and an embarrassment to the Hellfish , Burns kicks him into the empty strongbox , which topples back into the lake . Grampa dives in to save Bart , and the two chase Burns back to shore ; Grampa then overpowers Burns , gives him a dishonorable discharge for trying to kill his commanding officer and his grandson , and expels him from the tontine , much to Burns ' distress . 
 Before Grampa and Bart can go home with the paintings , representatives of the U.S. Department of State arrive on the scene . The government has been trying for 50 years to track down the paintings . Rather than arresting Grampa and Bart for the theft , the representatives instead turn over the paintings to a Euro @-@ trash heir of one of the original owners in order to avoid an international incident , and Bart and Grampa are left empty @-@ handed as the heir leaves for a Kraftwerk concert in Stuttgart . Grampa tells Bart that he did all of this to show that he used to be something besides a pathetic old man , and Bart says that he never thought of Grampa that way . The two hug , their relationship back on good terms . 
 = = Production = = 
 Jonathan Collier , who wrote the episode , got the idea after reading several then @-@ current stories about lost art surfacing . The story then evolved into one involving Grampa and Burns , and it gave the writers a chance to introduce the relatives of some of the recurring characters . The other members of the Flying Hellfish were based on stereotypical war movie characters . The idea of having a tontine came from Bill Oakley , who got the idea from " an old Barney Miller episode " . Collier originally named the unit the " Fighting Hellfish " but it was later changed to the " Flying Hellfish " . The logo for the unit ( and the letterhead on Grandpa 's message ) was designed using the original name and was not subsequently changed when the name was switched . 
 Supervising director David Silverman describes the directing in the episode as an " amazingly brilliant job " . Director Jeffrey Lynch received help from Brad Bird , with whom he worked on many complex staging shots . Lynch did not have any other episodes to work on at the time and was able to devote a lot of time to working on the episode . He storyboarded most of it by himself . The episode contains more effects shots than an average episode of The Simpsons , many of which were worked on by animator Dexter Reed . Other animators that worked on the episode include Chris Clements , Ely Lester , James Purdum , Tommy <unk> and Orlando Baeza . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Much of the staging in the flashback scenes is based on DC Comics 's Sgt. Rock and Marvel 's Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos . Many of the paintings in the episode are based on real paintings that went missing during World War II . The animators referenced a book of lost art for the designs . Other cultural references in the episode include Grampa 's recollection of his brush with death at the Retirement Castle , which is a reference to Dorothy 's return to Kansas in The Wizard of Oz . The sequence where Ox explains the concept of a tontine is similar to a scene in the M * A * S * H episode " Old Soldiers " . The Flying Hellfish raid on the castle recalls the attack on the chateau in The Dirty Dozen . The scene where Grampa tries to assassinate Hitler is based on The Day of the Jackal and references the 1968 science fiction film They Saved Hitler 's Brain .

 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote that the episode is " notable for Mr Burns ' impersonation of Marge , some spectacular action sequences , and some good underwater scenes – but [ it is ] not especially brilliant " . 
 Dave Foster of DVD Times said : " It 's easily the highlight of this season in terms of cinematic presence , with wonderful animation , staging and lighting which complements what is essentially a mini action adventure movie superbly realised via Grandpa and Bart. Like numerous episodes this season it also works as another example of family ties being reinforced though never at the sake of entertainment . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote that " many Grampa episodes tank , but “ Hellfish ” provides a very notable exception . It ’ s a lot of fun to see his wartime past , especially since we find precursors of series regulars . I also like the action swing the story takes , as it becomes clever and inventive . This comes out as a terrific show . " Adam Finley of TV Squad listed " Raging Abe " as one of the most touching episodes of The Simpsons , noting that it is " more " crazy action flick " than emotional , but I list it here because it shows Grandpa Simpson as someone other than a crazy old coot .

 = Maiden Castle , Dorset = 
 Maiden Castle is an Iron Age hill fort 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) south west of Dorchester , in the English county of Dorset . Hill forts were fortified hill @-@ top settlements constructed across Britain during the Iron Age . The name Maiden Castle may be a modern construction meaning that the hill fort looks impregnable , or it could derive from the British Celtic mai @-@ dun , meaning a " great hill . " 
 The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the site consists of a Neolithic causewayed enclosure and bank barrow . In about 1800 BC , during the Bronze Age , the site was used for growing crops before being abandoned . Maiden Castle itself was built in about 600 BC ; the early phase was a simple and unremarkable site , similar to many other hill forts in Britain and covering 6 @.@ 4 hectares ( 16 acres ) . Around 450 BC it underwent major expansion , during which the enclosed area was nearly tripled in size to 19 ha ( 47 acres ) , making it the largest hill fort in Britain and by some definitions the largest in Europe . At the same time , Maiden Castle 's defences were made more complex with the addition of further ramparts and ditches . Around 100 BC habitation at the hill fort went into decline and became focused at the eastern end of the site . It was occupied until at least the Roman period , by which time it was in the territory of the Durotriges , a Celtic tribe . 
 After the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD , Maiden Castle appears to have been abandoned , although the Romans may have had a military presence on the site . In the late 4th century AD , a temple and ancillary buildings were constructed . In the 6th century AD the hill top was entirely abandoned and was used only for agriculture during the medieval period . 
 Maiden Castle has provided inspiration for composer John Ireland and authors Thomas Hardy and John Cowper Powys . The study of hill forts was popularised in the 19th century by archaeologist Augustus Pitt Rivers . In the 1930s , archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler undertook the first archaeological excavations at Maiden Castle , raising its profile among the public . Further excavations were carried out under Niall Sharples , which added to an understanding of the site and repaired damage caused in part by the large number of visitors . Today the site is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and is maintained by English Heritage . 
 = = Before the fort = = 
 Before the hill fort was built , a Neolithic causewayed enclosure was constructed on the site . Dating from around 4000 BC , it was an oval area enclosed by two ditches , It is called a causewayed enclosure because the way the ditches were dug meant that there would originally have been gaps . These gaps , and the bank being only 17 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) high , indicate the site would not have been defensive . Instead the ditches may have been symbolic , separating the interior of the enclosure and its activities from the outside . Archaeologist Niall Sharples , who was involved in excavating the hill fort in the 1980s , has identified the hilltop views of the surrounding landscape as a likely factor for the enclosure 's position . Situated on the side of the hill , it would have been visible from several miles away , and when first cut the ditches would have exposed the underlying white chalk and stood out against the green hillside . The interior of the enclosure has been disturbed by later habitation and farming . The site does not appear to have been inhabited , although a grave containing the remains of two children , aged 6 – 7 , has been discovered . The enclosure is the earliest evidence of human activity on the site . 
 The purpose of Neolithic causewayed enclosures is unclear , and they probably had a variety of functions . As well as burials , indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death , pottery from the coast and areas to the east and west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances . Radiocarbon dating indicates that the enclosure was abandoned around 3 @,@ 400 BC . Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the enclosure met a violent end . 
 Within a period of about 50 years , a bank barrow was built over the enclosure . It was a 546 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 791 ft ) long mound of earth with a ditch on either side ; the parallel ditches were 19 @.@ 5 m ( 64 ft ) apart . Many barrows lie over graves and are monuments to the deceased , but as the barrow at Maiden Castle did not cover any burials , it has been suggested that it was a boundary marker , which would explain the limited human activity on the hilltop for the 500 years after the bank barrow 's construction . Around 1 @,@ 800 BC , during the early Bronze Age , the hill was cleared and used to grow crops , but the soil was quickly exhausted and the site abandoned . This period of abandonment lasted until the Iron Age , when the hill fort was built . The bank barrow survived into the Iron Age as a low mound , and throughout this period construction over it was avoided . 
 = = First hill fort = = 
 Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been defensive sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and resulting pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze . As a result , trading patterns shifted , and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated that " [ the forts ] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [ of an increasing population ] burst out into open warfare . But I wouldn 't see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction " . 
 There are around 31 hill forts in Dorset ; archaeologist Sharples , who undertook excavations at Maiden Castle , proposed that hill forts were used to control agricultural land to support a large community . Those in Dorset were situated near expanses of fertile land . Monumental defences such as the ditch at Maiden Castle indicate that the land was disputed and communities fought each other for control . This is supported by Cunliffe , who argues that the elaborate earthworks such as those around the entrances to Maiden Castle and Danebury were used to defend the weakest part of the hill fort . They increased the time the attackers took to reach the gateway , which would have left them vulnerable to defenders armed with slings . <unk> of carefully selected sling stones have been found at both sites . 
 Constructed on a territorial boundary in about 600 BC , the first hill fort at Maiden Castle was a 6 @.@ 4 @-@ hectare ( 16 @-@ acre ) area surrounded by a single ditch . The hill it sits on is part of a ridge on the north side of the South <unk> valley , which feeds the River Frome . At the eastern end of the ridge and rising 132 m ( 433 ft ) above sea level , the site of the first hill fort was not the highest point along the ridge , although the highest point is the neighbouring Hog Hill and is only 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) higher . The hill projects about 40 m ( 131 ft ) above the surrounding countryside which is about 90 m ( 295 ft ) above sea level . The defences were 8 @.@ 4 m ( 28 ft ) high and consisted of the V @-@ shaped ditch and a rampart . The rampart would probably have been timber @-@ faced around just the entrances . Elaborate timber facing would have been used to impress visitors . The site could be accessed by an entrance in the northwest and a double entrance in the east . The double entrance is unique in hill forts in the British Isles . The reason for a double entrance is unclear ; however , archaeologist Niall Sharples has suggested that it was a form of segregation . It is likely that several farming communities lived in the hill fort and wanted different entrances . 
 The defences of the first hill fort were rebuilt on at least one occasion ; the ditch was deepened by 1 @.@ 5 to 7 m ( 4 @.@ 9 to 23 @.@ 0 ft ) . The spoil from re @-@ digging the ditch was deposited on the back of the rampart . At the same time , the defences around the eastern entrances were made more complex . A bank and ditch were built outside the two entrances , and a bank was erected between them . The bank had a wall faced with limestone , which originated over 3 km ( 2 mi ) away . Sharples believes this would have created an impressive entrance and was a demonstration of the settlement 's high status . The Early Iron Age archaeology has been largely destroyed due to later activity on the site . However , nearby <unk> and <unk> date to the same period , so through comparison it is possible to infer the Early Iron Age activity at Maiden Castle . From parallels at these sites , Niall Sharples deduces that it was probably densely occupied , with separate areas for habitation and storage . Not much is known about the material culture and economy of the Early Iron Age , and the paucity of finds from this period at Maiden Castle makes it difficult to draw conclusions about activity on the site . 
 = = Developed hill fort = = 
 In the Early Iron Age , Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional ; it was one of over 100 hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , and Wiltshire . In the Middle Iron Age , Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain and one of the largest in Europe . According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is , by some definitions , in fact the largest in western Europe . In about 450 BC , Maiden Castle was expanded from 6 @.@ 4 to 19 ha ( 16 to 47 acres ) . The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing 2 @.@ 7 m ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) high although the ditch was shallow . The hill fort 's expansion was not unique ; it was one of a series of " developed hill forts " in southern England . As some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use , as was the case in Dorset . The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart . This , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important . The developed hill forts of Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water . 
 The emergence of developed hill forts has been attributed to Iron Age society becoming more complex . The emergence of one dominant hill fort in an area indicates that the inhabitants of a particular hill fort became more important than their contemporaries , possibly through warfare . However , a general dearth of evidence for destruction and an increase of artefacts associated with crafts and industry suggest that the reason for change was economic . Hill forts may have become important as centres of trade . This is supported by the possibility that the multiple rings of ditches often employed at developed hill forts ( the technical term for which is " multivallate " ) were likely to be not just defensive ; so many ditches and ramparts , such as those at Maiden Castle , were excessive for defence alone so were likely used as statements of power and authority . Developed hill forts were generally densely occupied ; this is best demonstrated at Danebury , where 57 % of the site has been excavated . While developed hill forts were of a higher status than their smaller predecessors , they were not all equal and Cunliffe states that the Maiden Castle 's monumental defences probably indicate that it was of higher status than other developed hill forts . 
 Maiden Castle expanded westwards , and the ditch was extended to enclose the neighbouring Hog Hill . The peaks of the two hills encompassed by the new , larger hill fort were separated by a dry valley . A shaft dug into the valley was possibly used as a water source . Almost immediately after the single ditch enclosure was expanded to 19 ha ( 47 acres ) , work began on making the defences more elaborate . The existing rampart was heightened to 3 @.@ 5 m ( 11 ft ) , and more ramparts and ditches were added . On the south of the fort , four ramparts and three ditches were added , but because of the steepness of the northern slope of the hill the fourth rampart did not extend all the way round , and only three ramparts were built on the northern side . At the same time , the eastern entrance was again made more complex through the addition of further earthworks , lengthening the approach to the site . 
 The four @-@ post structures common in hill forts throughout England are also found in Maiden Castle . Their purpose on this site is uncertain however , since at 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) square they have been considered by archaeologists to be too small for dwellings ; as a result , it has been concluded that these structures were probably granaries . The presence of granaries suggests that the fort was used to control the area 's food supply . Little evidence has been discovered for houses in Maiden Castle during the sites reconstruction in the 5th century BC ; this is probably because the site has not been fully excavated and a quarry used to provide material for the rampart may have obliterated the evidence . It appears that houses were not built near the ramparts until after the defences were complete . Maiden Castle was occupied throughout the Iron Age and its inhabitants lived in roundhouses . The later houses appear to be organised in rows , and to be roughly similar in size , a reorganisation which indicates the increasing power of the elites over Iron Age society . 
 Bronze objects such as pins , jewellery , and rivets have been found on the site , dating from the Middle Iron Age . As there was no local source of tin and copper ore , this demonstrates long distance trade , probably with the southwest . Although bronze was not produced at Maiden Castle , there is evidence of it being reworked . Good quality iron ore could be found in the surrounding area , but the hill fort does not appear to have been a centre for iron production in this period ; this is not unusual as very few hill forts in Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , and Wiltshire exhibit traces of iron production . Early in the Iron Age , most of the pottery found at Maiden Castle was produced locally – within about 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) – however later on sources further afield became more important , and by the Late Iron Age 95 % of the pottery came from the area around Poole Harbour over 35 mi ( 56 km ) away . This long @-@ range trade has been taken as evidence for increasing relationships with groups of people over large areas and the emergence of tribal identities . Although Sharples states that developed hill forts such as Maiden Castle are not towns and cannot be considered truly urban because they are so closely related to agriculture and storage , Cunliffe and fellow @-@ archaeologists Mark Corney and Andrew Payne describe developed hill forts as " town @-@ like settlements " , a form of proto @-@ urbanism . 
 = = Decline = = 
 Across Britain , many hill forts fell out of use in the 100 years around the turn of the millennium . It has been suggested that this , and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons ( such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries ) , was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire . The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites , whose power was based on agriculture . Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as it is in the rest of Britain , but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads , indicating a migration of the population . 
 Around 100 BC , Maiden Castle 's organised street pattern was replaced by more random habitation . At the same time , the western half of the site was abandoned and occupation was concentrated in the east of the fort . Also during the Late Iron Age , some of the earthworks around the eastern gateway were filled in and settlement expanded beyond the entrance , and into the areas between the banks . Excavations by archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler in this area revealed several houses , storage pits , an area used for iron working , and a cemetery . On the industrial site , more than 62 kg ( 137 lb ) of iron slag was discovered in an area of 30 m2 ( 320 sq ft ) , and it is believed the site produced around 200 kg ( 440 lb ) of iron . The amount of ore required could not have been supplied by local sources , so most likely originated from areas of specialist iron production such as the Weald , south west England , and Wales . Maiden Castle is one of the most important iron production sites from the Late Iron Age in southern Britain . 
 There is little evidence for burial in the Iron Age until late on in the period , and it is believed that the prevalent method of disposing of a body was by excarnation . Wheeler 's excavations on the cemetery in the eastern gateway revealed 52 burials , but only part of the cemetery was investigated , so the total number of burials is likely to be at least double this figure . One area of the cemetery featured burials of 14 people who had died in violent circumstances , including one body with a Roman catapult bolt in its back . Wheeler used the " war cemetery " , as he described it , as evidence of a Roman attack on Maiden Castle . 
 = = Roman activity and abandonment = = 
 In AD 43 , the Roman conquest of Britain began . Vespasian 's subsequent campaign to conquer the tribes of the Atrebates , Dumnonii , and Durotriges in the southwest of Britain took place in AD 43 – 47 . Based on the discovery of a group of bodies in the Late Iron Age formal cemetery that had met a violent death , archaeologist Mortimer Wheeler created a vivid story of the fall of Maiden Castle to Roman forces . He believed a legion wreaked destruction on the site , butchering men , women , and children , before setting fire to the site and slighting its defences . However , there is little archaeological evidence to support this version of events , or even that the hill fort was attacked by the Romans . Although there is a layer of charcoal , it is associated with the iron works , and the main evidence for slighting of defences comes from the collapse of an entranceway to the fort . Although 14 bodies in the cemetery exhibited signs of a violent death , there is no evidence that they died at Maiden Castle . The eastern part of the hill fort remained in use for at least the first few decades of the Roman occupation , although the duration and nature of habitation is uncertain . Many 1st @-@ century Roman artefacts have been discovered near the east entrance and in the centre of the hill fort . It has been suggested that Maiden Castle was occupied as a Roman military outpost or fort and the settlement discontinued , as there is no known fort in the area and it was not uncommon for hill forts in the southwest to have been occupied by Roman forces . This was a characteristic of Vespasian 's campaign in the region ; there was military occupation at Cadbury Castle in Somerset , Hembury in Devon , and <unk> Hill in Dorset . 
 Maiden Castle had been abandoned by the end of the 1st century , a time when Durnovaria ( Dorchester ) rose to prominence as the civitas , or regional capital , of the Durotriges , a Celtic tribe whose territory was in southwest England . However , in July 2015 archaeologists from Bournemouth University discovered the remains of the Iron Age settlement of <unk> and believe that the abandonment of the fort may be connected with the new site . According to the ancient geographer Ptolemy , writing in the 2nd century AD , Dunium was the main settlement of the Durotriges . Although Dunium has long been thought to refer to Maiden Castle , Hod Hill and Hengistbury have been identified as two other possible sites for Dunium . Dunium may have derived from British <unk> which meant " a fort " . Sometime after 367 , a Romano @-@ Celtic temple was built at Maiden Castle in the eastern half of the hill fort . The date was deduced from a hoard of coins discovered beneath a mosaic floor in the temple . A central room , measuring 6 m ( 20 ft ) square , was surrounded by a 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) passageway , similar to many Romano @-@ Celtic temples found in the south of England . Nearby were two other buildings : a rectangular building 7 @.@ 9 m × 5 @.@ 5 m ( 26 ft × 18 ft ) with two rooms that may have been a house for a priest , and a circular building that may have been a shrine . At the same time as the temple was built , the fort 's eastern gateway was refurbished ; there was possibly another shrine inside the gateway . 
 = = Later history = = 
 The 4th @-@ century temple gradually fell into disuse and Maiden Castle was used predominantly as pasture . There is evidence for activity on the site in the form of a few post @-@ Roman or Anglo Saxon burials , some possibly Christian , but the hill fort was not reused as a settlement . In the 16th and 17th centuries , a barn was built over the " war cemetery " . The only other significant activity on the hill top after the Romans was a short period of cultivation in the 17th century , as demonstrated by traces of ridge and furrow caused by ploughing . The modern name for the hill fort is first recorded in 1607 as <unk> Castell ; it is not unique to the site and occurs in several other places in Britain and probably means a " fortification that looks impregnable " or one that has never been taken in battle . Alternatively , the name may derive from the British mai @-@ dun , meaning a " great hill " . Over the following centuries , the site was abandoned completely and became open pasture , although it was of interest to antiquarians . Thomas Hardy , who built his house within sight of it , described the castle in a short story , " Ancient Earthworks and What Two Enthusiastic Scientists Found Therein " ( 1885 ) about a local antiquarian who spent much time investigating the site . In 1921 , composer John Ireland wrote Mai @-@ Dun , a symphonic rhapsody , about the hill fort in Dorset . John Cowper Powys wrote a novel titled Maiden Castle in 1936 , which was set in Dorset . 
 The first widespread investigation of hill forts was carried out in the second half of the 19th century under the direction of Augustus Pitt @-@ Rivers , but it was not until the 1930s that Maiden Castle was methodically investigated , the first large @-@ scale excavation of the interior of a hill fort . Between 1934 and 1937 , Mortimer Wheeler excavated both the interior and the defences , work that was funded almost entirely by donations from the public . Wheeler 's use of the media to disseminate information about the site resulted in Maiden Castle becoming well known . It was one of about 80 hill forts to have been excavated by 1940 , in a period known as " hill fort mania " during the 1920s and 1930s . 
 Between 1985 and 1986 further excavations under Niall Sharples were prompted by the hill fort 's deteriorating condition , partly caused by the large number of visitors to the site . Under the auspices of English Heritage , repair work and archaeological investigations were undertaken concurrently . Techniques such as radiocarbon dating were available to Sharples that were unavailable to Wheeler , allowing the site to be dated . The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1997 , giving Maiden Castle protection against unauthorised change ; it is now maintained by English Heritage . With parking facilities and information boards for visitors , Maiden Castle is open to the public all year round . Today , the site is in the civil parish of <unk> Monkton at grid reference <unk> .

 in 1921 , the English composer John Ireland ( 1879 – 1972 ) wrote the tone poem Mai @-@ Dun , A Symphonic Rhapsody about the place , adopting Hardy 's name for it . In 1931 , Ireland arranged his piece for piano four hands . 
 = Dor ( film ) = 
 Dor ( Hindi : <unk> , Urdu : <unk> , English : String ) is a 2006 Indian drama film written and directed by Nagesh Kukunoor that features Ayesha Takia , Gul Panag and Shreyas Talpade as the lead actors . It is a remake of the Malayalam film , Perumazhakkalam ( 2004 ) and was well received by the critics after its release on 22 September 2006 . Dor , which also released on a DVD , garnered rave reviews from critics and film buffs . 
 Dor , which was produced by <unk> <unk> , had cinematography by Sudeep Chatterjee and editing by <unk> Datta . For a film that had Hindi as the predominant language with a sporadic use of Urdu , Salim @-@ Sulaiman composed the background score . 
 The story is about two women who come from different backgrounds and how fate brings them together . Meera ( Ayesha Takia ) , a young woman who becomes a widow shortly after marriage , is trapped by tradition . Zeenat ( Gul Panag ) , on the other hand , faces the daunting task of saving the life of her husband , who is on trial for murder . A bahuroopiya ( Shreyas Talpade ) helps her reach Meera , who holds the " string " to Zeenat 's hope . The companionship that develops between Meera and Zeenat results in redemption for both . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Zeenat ( Gul Panag ) is an independent Muslim woman living in Himachal Pradesh . She agrees to marry Amir Khan , her boyfriend , despite his parents ' reservations . After their marriage , her husband leaves for Saudi Arabia to begin employment . 
 Meera ( Ayesha Takia ) , a simple Rajasthani Hindu woman , has everything in her life in accordance with customs and traditions : her formative years , her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores within the walls of her haveli . Coincidentally , her husband , Shankar , is in Saudi Arabia , his new workplace . Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch . Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father , Randhir Singh ( Girish Karnad ) , mother , Gowri Singh ( <unk> <unk> ) , his paternal grandmother ( Uttara <unk> ) and Meera . One day , Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar . Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband , Meera gets worried . When frantic inquiries are made , she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate . 
 When the news of Shankar 's death reaches the Singh haveli , everyone turns somber and the ceremonies towards rendering her into a widow emotionally drains Meera . Her vivaciousness and exuberance are thrust behind her black veil . The rest of the family vents their frustration of losing their only bread @-@ winner on Meera , by blaming her for bringing bad @-@ luck to their family . Meera , being her respectful self , bears the insults silently . 
 On the other side , Zeenat hears that her husband has been arrested for murdering his roommate in Saudi Arabia . She is convinced that it must have been an accident , but the Saudi law is unforgiving and Amir is scheduled to be executed . An Indian officer explains to her that Saudi law permits release of a criminal if the wife of the deceased forgives the guilt . Armed only with a photograph of Shankar and Amir , Zeenat sets out to find Meera . On route , she meets a <unk> ( Shreyas Talpade ) . The bahuroopiya introduces himself and his profession as being multi @-@ faceted and multi @-@ talented in arts and mimicry . This profession requires him to keep visiting different places to perform " tricks " for his income . He turns out to be a petty con @-@ man when he <unk> Zeenat and steals her belongings . However , when Zeenat is in trouble , he returns to rescue her with his artistic talent . He reveals his sympathetic view when Zeenat details her plight ; he offers to help her with whatever knowledge he has . After making a lot of educated guesses , they reach Jodhpur . With local help , they identify the Singh haveli . When Zeenat directly requests the Singh family to pardon Amir 's mistake , their anger drives her away . She feels that maybe talking through and befriending Meera might help her cause . The bahuroopiya takes leave of Zeenat and wishes her the best for her efforts . 
 At a temple , which Meera visits as her daily ritual , Zeenat makes her first contact . Zeenat is too afraid to tell Meera the truth about the situation , and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come . Over a few weeks , they become good friends and spend most of the time together . Their friendship brings out the missing part in each of their personalities . In the process , Zeenat realizes helplessness ; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking . Meera , on the other hand , gets a glimpse of freedom ; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life . 
 In the meanwhile , the Singh haveli is under a debt to Chopra ( Nagesh Kukunoor ) , a local factory owner . When Randhir requests him for more time to repay it , he is given an offer — pardoning the debt in exchange for Meera . Though initially set back by Chopra 's offer , Randhir prefers the haveli to Meera . 
 When the news of the imminent death sentence arrives , Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera . Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat 's words . The fact that her friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts her more . She immediately refuses to sign the <unk> ( statement of forgiveness ) . She makes it clear that she wants to hurt her husband 's murderer , even if it was an accident , because of how much she is hurting in her new , veiled life . She leaves for the haveli . Zeenat , initially , is deeply hurt from Meera 's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for her hometown . Meera later has a change of heart , perhaps because of her disillusionment at Randhir 's willingness to " sell " her to Chopra . She gets encouragement from her paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station , where she meets Zeenat and gives her the signed statement of forgiveness . Zeenat extends her hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard , presumably running away from the only life she has ever known , as the train speeds up into the distance .

 The story of Dor began when Nagesh Kukunoor was attending the International Film Festival of India in November 2005 . During the festival , he had hinted to a journalist that he began writing his next script . He confirmed this in another interview that after watching Perumazhakkalam ( 2005 ) , whose story is based on a newspaper article , at the Film Festival , he decided to make his own version of the film . After purchasing the story rights from Kamal , director of Perumazhakkalam , he wanted to remake it in a different way . Through his story , he wanted to emphasize the protagonists ' ordeal while in isolation in the form of a visual drama . However , acknowledgments to Perumazhakkalam or its makers were not provided in the credits . 
 Kukunoor announced the news about film making in early March 2006 and suggested of its release in August 2006 . He conceptualized the film in thirds : the first and third for the lead characters and the second for the supporting one . However , Kukunoor said that all his films , at the core , have " the human element — the simplicity of the basic emotions that bind us all . " 
 Since the backdrop of the film was to be Rajasthan , he had been there and did the necessary research so as to better portray the place and characters . 
 The CEO of Sahara One Motion Pictures , who produced Kukunoor 's Iqbal ( 2005 ) , while speaking about their motivation to continue the association with Kukunoor said , " we all look forward to Kukunoor 's films mainly because the subject and content is so out of the ordinary and captivating . " 
 = = = Locations and casting = = = 
 Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before , but he felt that he would find great locations there . <unk> in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh . In spite of this geographical inexperience , all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan . However , minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings . Though Panag had been in Rajasthan , she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times . She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance . In Himachal , it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly . On seeing the captured frames , they shifted all the interior shots to outside . 
 Filming was completed in 37 days in several locations of Rajasthan . Since most of the old palaces in Rajasthan have been converted into hotels , the crew stayed at a palace resort called <unk> . They resided at a palace resort in Pokhran , while filming was done at Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur . Kukunoor , after completion of the shooting , said that it was his most challenging film as it involved a real @-@ life story . 
 Gul Panag was impressed with Kukunoor 's previous film , Rockford ( 1999 ) and her constant correspondence with him fetched her the role of Zeenat . Kukunoor felt that Panag had characteristics of someone who was lean and fit , good height , large frame , and with an appropriate skin tone . After a successful audition , she was chosen for the character that she felt was a difficult one to portray . Critiquing the actress with " I see urgency , pain but no sadness " and " I see anger and vulnerability but no guilt " , the director pushed Panag to her limits . She felt that Kukunoor was such a man of conviction that he constantly forgot to eat and this once caused him a stomach infection . Gul Panag , on the other hand , said that her role was very multi @-@ dimensional , multi @-@ layered and hence it was quite tough to play the character . She said that Kukunoor helped her in defining her character with ease and said , " Nagesh looked at the minutest detail and was an immense support to me as an actor . " However , Dor 's executive producer , <unk> <unk> lent her voice for Panag in the film . 
 It was in Socha Na Tha ( 2004 ) that Kukunoor noticed Ayesha Takia and until then he assumed her to be a glamor doll . After getting convinced about her acting skills , she was roped in for the character of Meera . Takia said that though her character emotionally drained her , it was not tough to portray and that she could learn a lot about life . She further said that , " Dor was indeed an exciting challenge for the actor in me . I am happy that it was also a very exciting role , which not many actors get to portray at such a young age . " She said that with Dor , she was not only in the film industry for glamor , but also for her acting prowess . While filming , Kukunoor bonded so well with Takia that he requested her to be his sister . Since she did not have a brother in real life , she got quite emotional with Kukunoor 's brotherly proposal . This affection eventually solemnized in the form of a <unk> symbolically . 
 When Kukunoor was thinking of a character full of disguises , he first came up with an old man . When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up , he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert . He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade , whom he knew of knowing mimicry , could be used for bahuroopiya . Kukunoor , who worked previously with Girish Karnad , said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a good actor and a good human being . 
 Talpade , who previously featured as the title character of Kukunoor 's Iqbal ( 2005 ) , observed the <unk> in Rajasthan and incorporated their dialect , accent , and their body language for his character . About Kukunoor , he said that , " though one tends to go overboard as an actor most of the times , the way he handles the character as a director , Nagesh makes you feel that it is very simple for you to delineate the character . " Through his character of a bahuroopiya , Talpade was required to perform mimicry . While he was good at mimicry in college , it was during the filming of Iqbal , Kukunoor noted this talent of his and thus Dor came into Talpade 's hands . About his co @-@ actors , he said that it was refreshing to work with Panag and Takia despite the scorching heat of 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) . 
 According to the DVD extras , Nagesh Kukunoor first wrote the screenplay in English , then had it translated to Hindi .

 About the background score , Kukunoor said that " to put soaring music to give it a larger @-@ than @-@ life film image was pretty difficult " . Despite this worry , with Salim @-@ Sulaiman composing the music , he was happy with the way it was composed according to the sequence . <unk> <unk> , Sunidhi Chauhan and a Pakistani singer , <unk> Amanat Ali Khan were among those who sang the songs . While releasing the soundtrack , Kukunoor said that Salim @-@ Sulaiman and he tried make songs that " stood out from the clutter and something that was different from the item numbers or the boring love ballads .

 The Telegraph said in its review , " When you first watch Nagesh Kukunoor 's impressively shot Dor , you want to simply applaud it as good cinema . Whether it 's Ayesha 's award @-@ worthy performance or Shreyas ' amusing moments , the credit marks pile up in favor of the director who has made engaging cinema . " The Times of India said : 
 Dor makes a strong feminist statement without being strident or shouting slogans . And all along , the riveting friendship between the two polarized women and the events that bring them together , keep tugging at your heart . Shreyas Talpade proves that ( his previous film ) , Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives one of the most convincing portrayals of her career . But , it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away . Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in @-@ laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing . 
 About the technical department , The Hindu said : 
 " There is this one scene when the director cuts from Zeenat ( Gul Panag ) trying to fix her house literally from the outside , perched on a ladder , with a hammer in hand , to Meera ( Ayesha Takia ) inside the house and behind a veil . The play of such visual metaphors throughout gives the film a world @-@ class feel , the kind of stuff you usually see in Iranian cinema . " 
 Another review from The Telegraph says : 
 " Sudeep Chatterjee 's cinematography is excellent . He composes and constructs stylised but simple images which don 't scream for attention , but <unk> add up to create the film 's striking overall visual design . " 
 While writing about the plot and the <unk> , Rediff.com concluded : 
 " The script is engaging ; the dialogues entertaining , witty and yet quite profound . Every scene seems to have been well etched out . The character sketches are strong and the characters are inspiring but not patronizing . The script , the story and the characters take the spotlight and the sets , though picturesque add to the plot instead of overshadowing it . " 
 Taran Adarsh , while writing about the chances of its commercial success , said , " Dor is a well @-@ made film that caters to those with an appetite for qualitative cinema . Awards and glowing critical acclaim , yes , it has the power to win it . But , box @-@ office rewards and a mandate from the <unk> junta ( common man ) will elude it . The lethargic pacing will also go against it . " 
 = = = Reception and awards = = = 
 As per the reviews , the film could not capture much appeal at the theaters . In Kolkata , theater officials withdrew Dor from screening one week after its theatrical release . The reason cited for this withdrawal was due to many simultaneous releases such as the films Woh Lamhe and Snakes on a Plane . However , commercial success notwithstanding for these films , Dor was brought back to the screens . Following this , Dor was screened at the annual Indo @-@ American Arts Council Film Festival and the Atlanta Indo @-@ American Film Festival . 
 Along with nominations for cinematography , dialogues , lyrics and supporting actor ( for Shreyas Talpade ) , the film won the critics award for Ayesha Takia and Gul Panag at the 2007 Zee Cine Awards . At the annual Star Screen Awards , Talpade and Takia won the best actor in a comic role and critics choice for best actress awards respectively along with other nominations . At another such awards ceremony , Takia and Panag won awards for their performances . Takia further won the best actress award at the Bengal Film Journalists ' Association Awards .

But the shortcoming comes in the form that this is not the kind of music that 'll please every ear .

 = Gilli ( Hebridean earl ) = 
 Gilli was an eleventh @-@ century Hebridean chieftain whose career coincided with an era of Orcadian overlordship in the Kingdom of the Isles . According to mediaeval saga @-@ tradition , Gilli was a brother @-@ in @-@ law of Sigurðr <unk> , Earl of Orkney , having married the latter 's sister Hvarflǫð . Traditionally regarded as one of the most powerful Orcadian earls , Sigurðr appears to have extended his authority into the Isles in the late tenth century , and Gilli apparently acted as Sigurðr 's viceroy or tributary earl in this region . Gilli 's name is probably Gaelic in origin , and he seems to have seated himself on either Coll or Colonsay , islands in the Inner Hebrides . It is possible that Gilli is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn , an Uí Ímair dynast who was slain at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 . If not , another possibility is that he was the father of a certain Conamal / Conmáel who was killed in 980 . 
 = = Earl in the Hebrides = = 
 There is evidence to suggest that Sigurðr <unk> , Earl of Orkney ( died 1014 ) extended his authority from Orkney into the Isles in the late <unk> and early eleventh century . For instance , the thirteenth @-@ century Njáls saga — the only source that specifically refers to Gilli — states that one of Sigurðr 's followers , Kári <unk> , extracted taxes from the northern Hebrides , then controlled by Gilli himself . Whether these taxes were due to Norwegian overlords of Sigurðr , as the saga states , is uncertain . The saga further declares that Sigurðr and his men defeated Guðrøðr Haraldsson , King of the Isles ( died 989 ) , after which they plundered the Isles . Also noted are additional assaults conducted by accomplices of Sigurðr throughout the Hebrides , Kintyre , Mann ( against Guðrøðr ) , and Anglesey . The thirteenth @-@ century Orkneyinga saga also reports Sigurðr 's raids into the Isles , as does Eyrbyggja saga , a thirteenth @-@ century source which further notes his taxation of the kingdom . Contemporary Orcadian expansion may be perceptible in the evidence of the land @-@ assessment system of ouncelands in the Hebrides and along the western coast of Scotland . If Sigurðr 's authority indeed stretched over the Isles in the last decades of the tenth century , such an intrusion could account for the numbers of silver hoards dating to this time . 
 Various Irish annals also reveal that this was a period of strife in the Isles , as Danair ( literally " Danes " ) are recorded active in the region throughout 986 and 987 . Although it is not impossible that the Danair ( perhaps merely meaning " pirates " ) refer to Sigurðr 's forces , it is more likely that they are instead identical to the Vikings who are otherwise attested attacking England in the 990s . In fact , it seems that the Danair were active in the region against opponents of Guðrøðr . This could indicate that either the kin of the recently deceased Amlaíb Cuarán , King of Northumbria and Dublin ( died 980 / 981 ) , or perhaps an Orcadian @-@ aligned <unk> like Gilli himself , may have fallen target to an alliance between the Danair and Guðrøðr . This could in turn reveal that the aforesaid claims of continuous Orcadian conquests in the Isles — otherwise unrecorded outwith saga @-@ tradition — give a less than unbiased account of events . Whatever the case , Guðrøðr was slain in 989 , after which the political cohesion of Kingdom of the Isles — perhaps shaken by Orcadian encroachment in the 980s — seems to have diminished . 
 The extent of Guðrøðr 's authority in Hebrides is unknown due to his coexistence with Gilli , and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment . Guðrøðr 's successor is likewise uncertain . Although it is conceivable that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on the king 's death , and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann , possible after @-@ effects such as these are uncorroborated . According to Njáls saga , Gilli was seated on Kola or <unk> , an island that appears to refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay . The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr 's sister , Hvarflǫð . This marital alliance appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr 's influence . The latter 's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties , as Sigurðr 's own mother was the daughter of an Irish king , whilst his wife was the daughter of a Scottish king . In fact , the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother @-@ in @-@ law . Certainly , Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left <unk> ( " agents " ) in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann , whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that , at a later period in time , Sigurðr 's son and successor , Þórfinnr Sigurðarson , Earl of Orkney ( died c . 1065 ) , tasked a member of his own wife 's family , <unk> Árnason ( died 1051 ) , to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles . 
 = = Clontarf , Gilla Ciaráin , and Conamal / Conmáel = = 
 By the end of the first decade of the eleventh century , the principal ruler in Ireland was Brian Bóruma mac Cennétig , High King of Ireland ( died 1014 ) . Brian 's daughter , Sláine , was married to Sitriuc mac Amlaíb , King of Dublin ( died 1042 ) , whilst the latter 's mother , <unk> ingen Murchada ( died 1030 ) was a former wife of Brian . In 1013 , Sitriuc allied himself to Brian 's enemies , and revolted against Brian 's overlordship . Although Brian proceeded to lay siege to Dublin — the only Viking town that participated in the revolt against his supremacy — Sitriuc retained possession of the settlement , and Brian retired to Munster for Christmas . 
 According to Njáls saga , Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney , where Sitriuc convinced Sigurðr to ally himself against Brian on the condition that Sigurðr would gain <unk> in marriage . In April 1014 , the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf . Although Brian 's forces ultimately won the day , and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain , Brian lost his life as well . As for Gilli , he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict . In one instance , a <unk> is said to have witnessed valkyrie @-@ like apparitions singing songs for the slain , whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands . Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena , whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing off the face of the earth . As for Gilli , the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr . There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestations — arguably somewhat detached from the saga 's general narrative — are actually interpolations of separate material . Elsewhere in the narrative , however , there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs . For example , the episode concerning Gilli 's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man , the Icelander <unk> Þórðarson , is depicted dreaming of the burning of the saga 's eponym , <unk> <unk> . 
 If the account of Gilli in the aftermath of Clontarf has been constructed for dramatic effect , the passage may not be evidence of his floruit beyond this point in history . In fact , it is possible that he is identical to Gilla Ciaráin mac Glún Iairn ( died 1014 ) , a man who was amongst those slain at the battle . The Annals of Ulster , which records the latter 's fall , styles him <unk> Gall ( " heir @-@ designate of the Foreigners " ) , revealing that Gilla Ciaráin was indeed a prominent man . Sitriuc is known to have had an elder brother named Glún Iairn , a man who had reigned as King of Dublin until his death in 989 . If Gilla Ciaráin was a son of this king , his apparent tender age at the time of his father 's death could account for Sitriuc 's accession to the kingship . Furthermore , the aforesaid title accorded to Gilla Ciaráin appears to indicate that he was regarded as his uncle 's royal heir . If Gilli and Gilla Ciaráin are indeed identical , his pre @-@ eminent status in the Norse @-@ Gaelic world would help to explain his marital alliance with Sigurðr . 
 Gilla Ciaráin 's father bore a Gaelic name meaning " iron knee " . It may or may not be a Gaelicisation of <unk> , an identical @-@ meaning Old Norse name . Gilla Ciaráin 's own name is Gaelic , meaning " the servant of Saint Ciarán " . Gaelic names beginning with the initial name @-@ element <unk> first appear on record in last half of the tenth century . Such names were shortened to Gilli by Scandinavian settlers in Britain and Ireland . In fact , such a phenomenon may account for the name accorded to Gilli himself . Gilli 's name suggests that he was at least partly of Gaelic descent , perhaps either Irish or Hebridean . Although various names are attributed to Gilli 's wife in the numerous versions of Njáls saga , the best version of this source gives Hvarflǫð . This name appears to be an Old Norse form of <unk> , a relatively rare Gaelic name . 
 There may be further evidence concerning familial relations . In 980 , Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill , High King of Ireland utterly defeated Amlaíb Cuarán 's forces at the Battle of Tara . One of the casualties of this remarkable conflict was a man identified as " <unk> m. <unk> Gall " by the Annals of Ulster , and " <unk> mac Gilli Airi " by the Annals of Tigernach . It is possible that these annal @-@ entries refer to a man named Conamal or Conmáel , who was in turn the son of a man named Gilli , and that either the father or the son bore the title <unk> Gall ( " royal deputy of the Foreigners " ) . If correct , it is conceivable that that this father is identical to Gilli himself . Against this identification , however , is the fact that the aforesaid saga @-@ tradition depicts Gilli active at about the time of the Battle of Clontarf . The considerable span of time between the death of Conamal / Conmáel and this conflict may well be evidence that a paternal relationship between Conamal / Conmáel and Gilli is unlikely . Whatever the case , the sources appear to be confused as to whether the patronym refers to a personal name or a title . One possibility is that this confusion could indicate that the sources refer to both the personal name Gilla Maire and the epithet Gall . 
 = Mortal Kombat : Deception = 
 Mortal Kombat : Deception is a fighting game developed and published by Midway as the sixth installment of the Mortal Kombat ( MK ) series . It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox in October 2004 , and for the Nintendo GameCube in March 2005 . Mortal Kombat : Deception follows the storyline from the fifth installment , Deadly Alliance . Its story centers on the revival of the Dragon King Onaga , who attempts to conquer the realms featured in the series after defeating the sorcerers Quan Chi and Shang Tsung , the main antagonists in the previous game , and the Thunder God Raiden , defender of Earthrealm . The surviving warriors from the previous titles join forces to confront Onaga . 
 Twenty @-@ six characters are available to play in the game , with nine making their first appearance in the series . Deception contains several new features in the series , such as chess and puzzle games with the MK characters and an online mode . The Konquest Mode returns from Deadly Alliance , but follows the life of Shujinko , a warrior who is deceived by Onaga to search for artifacts to give Onaga more powers . In November 2006 , Midway released Mortal Kombat : Unchained , a port for the PlayStation Portable , which adds characters to the game from the previous title . 
 Series co @-@ creator Ed Boon designed Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game , and included new features such as the minigames as surprises . Several parts from Deadly Alliance such as combos and arenas were redesigned to be more realistic as well as more interactive . Deception has been well received by video game reviewers , who praised the fights and the new features . The Konquest Mode , however , received criticism for poor voice acting . Several publications have called Deception the best fighting game of 2004 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The game 's arenas are similar to those in Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance , but include new features such as unique weapons which players can use , and instant @-@ death traps which immediately kill a fighter who falls into them . The game also introduces the " Combo Breaker " , a system which allows players to interrupt combos up to three times per match . In contrast to Deadly Alliance , in which characters had only one Fatality , the Deception characters have two Fatalities and a hara @-@ kiri suicide move . The latter is used when the phrase " Finish Him / Her " is shown on the screen and the player is about to lose . 
 Deception introduces two minigames that use MK characters . " Chess Kombat " is a minigame similar to classical chess , but uses player @-@ selected characters as pieces that must best each other in combat to take a square . Some pieces have certain abilities , ranging from impersonating their opponents to instantly killing one of the opposing pieces . It also adds " Puzzle Kombat " , a puzzle game similar to Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo which features super deformed versions of the MK characters that attack each other once a player gains an advantage in the game . 
 The " Krypt " returns from Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance and serves as an interface to access extra content hidden in " koffins " ( actual coffins named with the series ' trademark misspelling ) . In Deception , the size of the Krypt was reduced from 676 koffins to 400 koffins . Some koffins also have locks that require keys which can only be found in the Konquest mode . The Krypt in Mortal Kombat : Deception includes twelve bonus characters ( which was cut down to six characters in the GameCube version ) . 
 = = = Konquest mode = = = 
 Deadly Alliance 's action role @-@ playing game @-@ style game called " Konquest " also appears in Deception . Deception 's Konquest mode explores the history of Shujinko , starting prior to his training with Bo ' Rai Cho and ending with the beginning of Deception 's main story . While mostly an adventure game , the combat elements take place in the normal Deception fighting mode . In Konquest , a young Shujinko meets Damashi , a being who requests his assistance in collecting six powerful items , the Kamidogu , to send to the Elder Gods . By the time he collects the six Kamidogu , Shujinko is an old man , having spent forty @-@ six years on his mission . However , Damashi is then revealed to be the Dragon King Onaga , who deceived Shujinko to obtain the six Kamidogu . Players seeking to unlock much of the bonus content in Deception are required to play through the Konquest mode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the final events of Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance , Raiden 's warriors , who were meant to protect the six fictional universes ( named " realms " ) , are killed by the Deadly Alliance ( Shang Tsung and Quan Chi ) , who attempted to conquer the realms . With Raiden defeated , the Deadly Alliance dissolves as the two sorcerers turn on each other for Shinnok 's amulet . When Quan Chi wins , the Dragon King Onaga , the former emperor of the realm of Outworld , appears to regain his power . Raiden awakes and then unleashes all his powers in a colossal explosion that , apart from destroying both members of the Deadly Alliance , the surrounding palace and himself , has little effect on Onaga . 
 Onaga now seeks to use six artifacts called Kamidogu ( literally " Tool of God " or " divine clay " ) , which are able to destroy the realms . Those fighters who survive the battle against the Deadly Alliance now stand against Onaga and his supporters . The latter include the forces of Edenia , now led by Mileena in the titular theme of deception as she masquerades as her sister , Princess Kitana . Other enemies include the former defenders from the realms , who were resurrected by Onaga and are under his control . 
 In the story explored in Konquest mode , a young man named Shujinko is deceived into spending his life collecting the Kamidogu for Onaga , who uses the guise of an emissary of the Elder Gods , the beings who created the realms , named Damashi . Onaga reveals his identity and intentions after Shujinko has gathered all the Kamidogu . Shujinko , led to believe he was working for the greater good , decides to continue training to defeat Onaga . 
 = = Characters = = 
 There are twenty @-@ eight characters in the game , nine new and nineteen returning . New characters include : <unk> , a demon searching for redemption by killing demons ; Darrius , the leader of the resistance in the realm of Order ; Hotaru , a warrior of Order , pledged to serve the Dragon King ; <unk> , a mercenary contracted by Darrius to assassinate Hotaru ; Havik , a cleric of Chaos who wishes to consume Onaga 's heart and revive Emperor Shao Kahn to ensure chaos reigns ; Kira and <unk> , new members of the Black Dragon organization ; Onaga , the Dragon King and former emperor of Outworld who appears as the unplayable boss character from the arcade mode ; and Shujinko , an old warrior who was deceived by Onaga when he was young . 
 Several of the returning characters have been redesigned and were given new moves , such as Liu Kang , who reappears as a zombie , having been killed by the Deadly Alliance . Noob Saibot and Smoke are sub @-@ bosses who fight together under the name of Noob @-@ Smoke . The GameCube version and PlayStation Portable have two more playable characters : the sub @-@ boss from the first MK game Goro , and the boss from the two following titles Shao Kahn , both of whom were previously thought to have died in the prologue of Deadly Alliance . 
 Character redesigns were generally accepted favorably , namely in the case of Sub @-@ Zero . Once again appearing youthful rather than his depiction as a septuagenarian in Deadly Alliance , Sub @-@ Zero sported a " grandmaster " armor set that was often likened to Shredder . Scorpion was redesigned to resemble a more classical ninja look , while characters like Ermac received a considerable makeover from the standard ninja fare , offering up a more sorcerer @-@ like appearance . 
 = = Development = = 
 Mortal Kombat co @-@ creator Ed Boon wanted Deception to be an unpredictable fighting game that gave players new features " they could never imagine " . In order to do so , the Midway staff listened to fans on bulletin boards to know what to work on for Deception , such as the playable characters . Wanting to surprise fans and make the game deeper , they added the puzzle and chess minigames ( the chess minigame had first been considered for Deadly Alliance , but the developers lacked time to implement it ) . Boon and John <unk> supervised the staff , which was divided into teams to work on different areas of the game . One of their concerns was to maintain the traditional feel of the MK series as they wanted the game 's violence to make it a more realistic fighting game , rather than " a fighting simulator " . 
 Character appearances were improved to make their moves " more responsive " to the player 's input . They also wanted to bring back several characters they felt were absent for too long — including Sindel , Nightwolf , Baraka , and Mileena — and an arena with several weapons which players could use to fight ; however , it was remade to become the Liu Kang 's Tomb arena . Characters ' combos were redesigned to be distinctive so that they would be more important ; as Boon noted , they were necessary for any move the player would use to inflict more damage on an opponent . The Midway staff focused on the designs and functions of the backgrounds , wanting to make them as influential to the outcome of the battle as the fighting between the characters . 
 Because of popular demand and favorable reception of Deadly Alliance , the number of finishing moves , known as Fatalities , increased to two per character . The Fatalities were developed by a group of animators led by Carlos Pesina ; they comically described Mileena 's Fatality in which she eats the opponents ' neck as the most disturbing due to how her " sexy moves " are modeled from Pesina . The Hara @-@ Kiri moves were added to allow the losers to perform a finishing move as well , creating a race between both players . The Death Traps , meant to be introduced in the previous game , were added to give the combat more strategy as well as to give more chances to players to win a fight if they are at a disadvantage . The game was originally meant to have other new finishing moves , such as tortures and falling cliffs similar to Fatalities . 
 One of the main features of Deception was the emphasis on online gameplay , which had yet to become common for console fighting games . A team of engineers took almost a full year to decide if the feature was viable . The MK team focused their energies solely on platforms that had strong online functionality available to the end consumer ; this led to a greater focus on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions . Because the GameCube games require some re @-@ engineering compared to the other platforms when porting , it was decided to exclude the GameCube from the work of the team until the online hurdles were cleared . Some time after the game 's release , Boon commented that he was disappointed that the GameCube version did not feature online gameplay as he regarded it as " the best in the business " . 
 Details about the game were first confirmed to the general public in the May 2003 issue of PlayStation : The Official Magazine , in which the game was called Mortal Kombat VI , and an online mode was confirmed . On February 6 , 2004 , Midway registered the domain names <unk> and <unk> When Midway Entertainment was asked if Mortal Kombat : Deception was the official title , the developers gave no answers at that time . Later that month , Midway released the first trailer from the game , confirming this title .

 Metacritic had 81 favourable reviews out of 100 for both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions ; the GameCube version received 77 favorable reviews . Louis Bedigian of GameZone praised the interaction with stages as one of the best parts of the game , commenting that it adds more strategy to the combat . He praised the return of " classic characters " , commenting on their new designs and how different their attacks are . Jeremy Dunham of IGN wrote that it was the best game of the Mortal Kombat series . He also stated that the removal of special move buttons , which caused too much damage to an opponent , was one of the developer 's best decisions . With the special moves removed from the fights , and the addition of Breakers , players are now able to stop any combo . However , he called character designs in Deception " robotic " in comparison to other fighting games such as the Dead or Alive series or Virtua Fighter 4 . The soundtrack was also criticized for having " basic sound effects " . GameSpot 's Greg Kasavin commented that the fights have been highly improved with the addition of new fighting styles which : " is clearly inspired by kung fu movies " . Although he stated the fights were not perfect and noted they could end in a few seconds due to the interaction with the arenas , he liked how painful and funny some moves looked . TeamXbox 's Dale <unk> praised the characters ' animations and movements , adding that the soundtrack : " sets the tone perfectly for your basic , <unk> , decapitations , and <unk> . " 
 The Konquest Mode received mixed opinions . Dunham liked how the Konquest Mode explains the storyline from the game . Conversely , Kasavin commented that the Konquest Mode " is the weak point from the game " and described it as " ugly " , lacking good voice acting and graphics . However , he noted that one of the " few nice touches " in Konquest was " hitting anybody you want " . He added that the mode had to be completed if he wanted to unlock characters . Bedigian complained that the Konquest is the biggest flaw of the game , criticizing the storyline , the trainings , and voice acting . However , <unk> found the mini @-@ games to be very entertaining if played online . 
 In contrast to the Xbox and PS2 versions , the GameCube port received lower scores from publications . It has been criticized for the lack of an online mode and pixelated picture quality on the unlockable videos & cutscenes , though 1UP.com still praised it . Although the addition of Goro and Shao Kahn was well received , GameSpot opined that the other ports were better , while also commenting on Goro 's appearance , which looks " anemic " . In his review , GameSpy 's Miguel Lopez wrote the GameCube version " is far from the best version of the game " and advised players to use another port to play .

 Mortal Kombat : Unchained is the title of the PlayStation Portable version of Mortal Kombat : Deception , developed by Just Games Interactive . The game was released on November 13 , 2006 , in North America ; November 24 , 2006 , in Europe ; and December 9 , 2006 , in Australia . 
 Unchained includes all the characters from the GameCube version , and four more characters — Blaze , Frost , Jax and Kitana — from Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance that are exclusive to the PlayStation Portable version . The four characters have only one Fatality and no Hara @-@ kiri in contrast to other characters , most likely because that was all they had in Deadly Alliance . Exclusive to the Unchained version is the Endurance mode , where players can compete against a constant wave of opponents . The system 's wireless ad hoc network functionality can be used for multiplayer games . Characters who remain hidden in the other versions appear unlocked by default in Unchained ; producer Shaun Himmerick explained that the staff wanted to show players characters that were difficult to obtain in Deception , such as Liu Kang . Although Midway did not develop the game , they helped Just Games <unk> optimize their code and the Wi @-@ Fi feature , as they wanted to keep the frame rate very high . Metacritic gave it an average of 70 from 14 reviews . Jeff Haynes from IGN mentioned problems with the controls and criticized the long loading times . 
 = Angus Lewis Macdonald = 
 Angus Lewis Macdonald PC QC ( August 10 , 1890 – April 13 , 1954 ) , popularly known as ' Angus L. ' , was a Canadian lawyer , law professor and politician from Nova Scotia . He served as the Liberal premier of Nova Scotia from 1933 to 1940 , when he became the federal minister of defence for naval services . He oversaw the creation of an effective Canadian navy and Allied convoy service during World War II . After the war , he returned to Nova Scotia to become premier again . In the election of 1945 , his Liberals returned to power while their main rivals , the Conservatives , failed to win a single seat . The Liberal rallying cry , " All 's Well With Angus L. , " was so effective that the Conservatives despaired of ever beating Macdonald . He died in office in 1954 . 
 Macdonald 's more than 15 years as premier brought fundamental changes . Under his leadership , the Nova Scotia government spent more than $ 100 million paving roads , building bridges , extending electrical transmission lines and improving public education . Macdonald dealt with the mass unemployment of the Great Depression by putting the jobless to work on highway projects . He felt direct government relief payments would weaken moral character , undermine self @-@ respect and discourage personal initiative . However , he also faced the reality that the financially strapped Nova Scotia government could not afford to participate fully in federal relief programs that required matching contributions from the provinces . 
 Macdonald was considered one of his province 's most eloquent political orators . He articulated a philosophy of provincial autonomy , arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health , education and welfare . He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods . It was no accident , Macdonald said , that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s . 
 Macdonald was a classical liberal in the 19th @-@ century tradition of John Stuart Mill . He believed in individual freedom and responsibility and feared that the growth of government bureaucracy would threaten liberty . For him , the role of the state was to provide basic services . He supported public ownership of utilities like the Nova Scotia Power Commission , but rejected calls for more interventionist policies such as government ownership of key industries or big loans to private companies . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Angus Lewis Macdonald was born August 10 , 1890 , on a small family farm at Dunvegan , Inverness County , on Cape Breton Island . He was the ninth child in a family of 14 . His mother was from a prominent Acadian family on Prince Edward Island while his father 's family had emigrated to Cape Breton from the Scottish Highlands in 1810 . The Macdonalds were devout Roman Catholics as well as ardent Liberal Party supporters . 
 In 1905 , when Macdonald was 15 , the family moved to the town of Port Hood , Cape Breton . Macdonald attended the Port Hood Academy . He hoped to enroll next in the Bachelor of Arts program at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish , but his family couldn 't afford to pay for a university education so Macdonald obtained a teaching licence and taught for two years to finance his education . Midway through his university studies , he took another year off to earn money teaching . He completed his final term on credit and was required to teach in the university 's high school during 1914 – 15 to pay off his debt . Macdonald did well at St. FX . He played rugby , joined the debating team , edited the student newspaper and , in his graduating year , won the gold medal in seven of his eight courses . He was also class valedictorian . 
 = = War service = = 
 The First World War broke out while Macdonald was earning his university degree . In 1915 , he underwent military training in the Canadian Officers Training Corps . In February 1916 , he joined the 185th battalion , known as the Cape Breton Highlanders , leaving for Britain in October 1916 where he received further training . Macdonald was finally sent to the front lines in France in May 1918 as a lieutenant in Nova Scotia 's 25th battalion . He participated in heavy fighting and on one occasion led his entire company because all of the other officers had been wounded or killed . Macdonald felt fortunate to have been spared , but his luck ran out in Belgium when he was hit in the neck by a German sniper 's bullet on November 7 , 1918 , just four days before the Armistice . Macdonald spent eight months in Britain recovering from his wound . He returned home to his family in Cape Breton in 1919 . Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that the war had made him " more serious and less self @-@ confident " , but " struck by the willingness of so many to march to horrible deaths in the name of an abstract principle " . 
 = = Life before politics = = 
 In September 1919 , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Macdonald began studying at Dalhousie Law School in Halifax . During his two years there , Macdonald formed lifelong friendships with students who were to become members of the political elite in the region . Once again , he excelled in athletics , was elected to the Dalhousie students ' council , became the associate editor of the student newspaper and led the opposition in the law school 's Mock Parliament . He scored firsts in nearly every course and graduated in 1921 with academic distinction . 
 Macdonald was hired by the Nova Scotia government as assistant deputy attorney @-@ general immediately after graduating from law school . He worked mainly as an administrator , although he occasionally appeared in court to help the attorney general prosecute a case . 
 In 1922 , Macdonald became a part @-@ time lecturer at the law school . When he left the attorney @-@ general 's office in 1924 , he became a full @-@ time professor . Macdonald was a popular and effective teacher . One former student describes him sitting at his desk on the rostrum speaking slowly and deliberately while gazing intently at the ceiling . " The more students disagreed ( with one another in class ) the more Angus encouraged it . " 
 On June 17 , 1924 , when he was 33 , Macdonald married Agnes Foley , a member of a prominent Irish Catholic family . They had worked together in the attorney general 's office where Foley served as secretary . Between 1925 and 1936 , the Macdonalds would have three daughters and a son . Agnes raised the children and ran the household after Macdonald entered politics . Biographer John Hawkins writes she eventually helped her husband win election in a Halifax riding with a significant Irish Catholic population . She had a large circle of friends including members of the powerful Liberal Women 's societies of Halifax . Hawkins also notes that Agnes Macdonald was a gifted hostess who loved conversation . " Quick witted , her rapid and varied flow of language contrasted with Angus L. ' s deliberate , thoughtful manner of speaking , which some have described as a ' drawl ' . " 
 In 1925 – 26 , while teaching at the Dalhousie Law School , Macdonald took additional courses in law at Columbia University in New York , mainly by correspondence . He used these courses as the basis for full @-@ time graduate work at the Harvard Law School in Boston , Massachusetts in 1928 . Harvard 's faculty members saw the law as an instrument for social improvement . That view was reflected in Macdonald 's 1929 doctoral thesis on the responsibility of property holders under civil law . 
 When the deanship of the law school came open in 1929 , Macdonald agonized over whether he should seek the job . He apparently had strong support from several members of the university 's board of governors . At the same time however , he was increasingly drawn to politics and accepting the deanship would mean postponing his political ambitions indefinitely . In the end , the job was offered to Sidney Smith , another prominent Canadian academic who accepted on condition that Macdonald remain at the school . Macdonald did stay , but only for one more year . In 1930 , he resigned so he would be free to enter politics .

 = = = Federal campaign , 1930 = = = 
 The federal election in the summer of 1930 gave the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Macdonald a chance to run for office . He decided to contest the riding of Inverness in his native Cape Breton . There he faced a Conservative opponent whose style contrasted sharply with his own cool and reserved manner . According to biographer John Hawkins , I. D. " Ike " MacDougall " was a gifted performer who before an audience could cut an opponent 's well @-@ marshalled arguments until they fell amid roars of laughter . He was the master of hyperbole , pun and high spirits . He could win a rural audience , not by his logic , but by his performance on the platform " . Macdonald campaigned hard , but the trend was against him . The Conservatives led by R. B. Bennett defeated Mackenzie King 's unpopular Liberals . And in Inverness , Ike MacDougall was re @-@ elected by the narrow margin of 165 votes . It was to be Macdonald 's only election defeat . Afterwards , Macdonald retreated to Halifax where he opened his own private law office in August 1930 . 
 = = = Provincial convention , 1930 = = = 
 Macdonald was active in provincial Liberal Party organizational work during the latter part of the 1920s . In 1925 , the party had suffered a crushing defeat after 43 years in power . On election day , the Liberals were reduced to three seats in the Nova Scotia legislature . Many believed that the time had come to return the party to its reformist roots . Macdonald worked with other reform @-@ minded members to establish a network of younger Liberals intent on reviving their party . 
 In the 1928 provincial election , the Liberals regained some of their lost popularity in one of the closest votes in Nova Scotia history . The Conservatives remained in power with 23 seats to the Liberals ' 20 . Economic conditions worsened after the stock market crash of 1929 making it seem increasingly likely that the Liberals would return to power in the next election . Macdonald helped draft a 15 @-@ point party platform for approval at a Liberal convention in the fall of 1930 . It promised an eight @-@ hour working day and free elementary school textbooks . It also pledged to establish a formal inquiry into Nova Scotia 's economic prospects and the province 's place within Confederation . 
 The convention , held on October 1 , 1930 , proved to be a turning point both for the party and for Macdonald . In a departure from tradition , the party 's new leader would be chosen by convention delegates instead of Liberal caucus members at the legislature . Two veterans of Liberal politics , both wealthy businessmen , were contesting the leadership . There was little enthusiasm , however , for either . Just as nominations were about to close , a delegate from Truro rose unexpectedly to nominate Macdonald . Surprised , Macdonald at first declined the nomination , then agreed to accept it when he sensed strong support on the convention floor . A few hours later , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Macdonald had won a resounding first @-@ ballot victory to become the new Liberal leader . 
 = = = Liberal party leader = = = 
 After winning the Liberal leadership , Macdonald travelled the province on speaking tours helping organize party support in every constituency . As Liberal leader , he proved to be an effective platform speaker . According to biographer John Hawkins , Macdonald 's " plain talk and simplicity " persuaded audiences of his honesty . He developed the ability to explain political issues with a " clarity that every voter could understand " . When the legislature was in session , he led the Liberals from the public galleries because he had no seat in the House . There were six vacancies , but the Conservatives refused to call by @-@ elections fearing they would lose their five @-@ seat majority . Macdonald publicly criticized Premier Gordon Harrington for depriving so many Nova Scotians of representation . He deplored what he called " the loss of responsible government . " It was a message that struck a chord in the province that had been the first in Canada to achieve responsible government in 1848 thanks to the efforts of the great liberal Reformer Joseph Howe . Privately however , Macdonald rejoiced that the government couldn 't risk calling a by @-@ election telling one supporter years later , " If the truth must be told , I was sometimes afraid that they would open up a seat and deprive me of this sort of ammunition " . 
 Macdonald was able to use the theme of responsible government even more effectively during the provincial election campaign of 1933 . The governing Conservatives , desperate to avoid electoral defeat , had enacted changes requiring that new voters ' lists be drawn up by government @-@ appointed registrars immediately before each election . Predictably , thousands of Liberal voters were left off the lists and the new law allowed only three days for corrections . The Liberals secured a court order requiring the appointment of additional registrars and some of the disenfranchised voters were finally added to the lists . The so @-@ called Franchise Scandal enabled the Liberal press to cast Macdonald as a latter @-@ day Joe Howe , crusading for the rights of the people . " No newcomer to the political scene " , writes historian Murray Beck , " has ever become so quickly , widely , and favourably known in such a dramatic fashion " . The scandal , compounded by suffering in the province due to the Great Depression , resulted in Macdonald 's Liberals winning 22 of the 30 seats on August 22 , 1933 . The Conservatives were now associated in the public mind with corruption and hard times . They would not regain power for 23 years . 
 = = First term as premier 1933 – 37 = = 
 Macdonald was sworn in as Premier of Nova Scotia on September 5 , 1933 . He was 43 years old and had never held a seat in the legislature . Historian Murray Beck writes that Macdonald 's cabinet was " probably Nova Scotia 's strongest " . Biographer Stephen Henderson points out that the " ministers were fresh , motivated and knowledgeable about their portfolios " , although Macdonald himself had no experience in finance . Biographer John Hawkins characterizes the Liberal party of 1933 as " a party of thinkers and reformers " . During the 1930s , Macdonald 's Liberals took credit for leading the province out of the depths of the Great Depression . As journalist Harry Flemming wrote many years later , Macdonald became " God himself " , the premier who " paved the roads and put the power into every home from Cape North to Cape Sable " . 
 = = = Pensions and relief programs = = = 
 On his first day in office , Macdonald kept a key Liberal promise by bringing in old age pensions for elderly people in need . Cheques would be mailed out to 6 @,@ 000 pensioners by the end of March 1934 . It was a popular move even though monthly pension payments in Nova Scotia were substantially below the national average . 
 The economic conditions facing the new government were dismal . Tens of thousands of Nova Scotians were impoverished and unemployed . The government expected that 75 @,@ 000 Nova Scotians would need assistance during the coming winter . Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald sympathized with the poor , but he worried that direct government relief payments would undermine their pride and self @-@ respect . Even though direct relief might be cheaper , the Macdonald government preferred to hire the unemployed for public works projects such as paving roads . Henderson reports that in 1933 , there were only 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) of paved roads in the province . By 1937 , that figure had risen to 605 . The government financed such public works by selling low @-@ interest bonds and raising gasoline taxes from six to eight cents a gallon . 
 Macdonald also urged the federal Conservative government of R. B. Bennett to increase financial support to poorer provinces . At the time , there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly the responsibility of the provinces and municipalities . Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression , Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system of matching grants for relief programs . Under that system , provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues . Thus , the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn 't afford to match the federal grants . Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example , that from January to May 1935 , all three levels of government spent an average of $ 2 @.@ 84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes , an amount less than half the $ 6 @.@ 18 spent in the other six provinces . 
 = = = Jones Commission = = = 
 Macdonald tried to deal with the financial imbalances in Confederation by appointing a Royal Commission . He asked it to recommend economic polices the province should follow to lessen the effects of the Depression and to lay out a framework for negotiations with the federal government . 
 The three @-@ man Jones Commission included Harold Innis , a prominent economic historian who had studied disparities between highly developed manufacturing regions and marginal ones that depended primarily on exploiting natural resources . After touring the province and hearing from more than 200 witnesses , the Commission issued its report in December 1934 . Macdonald could take satisfaction in its finding that high tariffs had sheltered central Canadian manufacturing at Nova Scotia 's expense and that federal subsidies to the province were " seriously inadequate " . 
 The Commission recommended that the federal government assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old @-@ age pensions and unemployment insurance . It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need , an idea that became central to Macdonald 's thinking about federal @-@ provincial relations . Among other things , the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads ; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms ; and , to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia 's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa . 
 = = = Tourism and Nova Scotian identity = = = 
 The Macdonald government took practical steps to promote tourism as a way of bringing money into the province . It improved conditions for tourists by granting small loans to hotel , motel and cottage owners to upgrade their facilities . It also offered cooking classes to restaurant and hotel employees . The government 's extensive road building program made it easier for tourists to travel . But biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald went well beyond these practical steps to promote Nova Scotia as a beautiful and rustic place peopled by colourful Scots , Acadians , Germans and Mi 'kmaq . Government advertising portrayed the province " as a place where urban , middle @-@ class families could go to ' step back in time ' " . Gradually , Henderson maintains , the tourism campaigns created a new identity for Nova Scotians . " They witnessed the provincial state constructing an elaborate network of modern roads ; they read books and brochures extolling the beauty of the province , and they heard their premier waxing romantically about the pure , simple nobility of their ancestors . " Macdonald was especially enthusiastic about " the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots " . Historian Ian McKay writes that under his leadership , the provincial government gave money to the Gaelic College ; bestowed Scottish names on key tourism sites and stationed " a brawny Scots piper " at the border with New Brunswick . Macdonald also helped assemble more than a quarter of a million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km2 ) for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park complete with a fancy resort hotel and world @-@ class golf course . " Macdonald believed " , Henderson writes , " he had created a piece of Scotland for tourists in the New World " . And , as more tourists came , Macdonald 's stature grew . 
 = = = Trade Union Act = = = 
 The Nova Scotia legislature recognized the growing power of industrial unions in the 1930s by passing what historian Stephen Henderson calls " Canada 's first piece of modern labour legislation " . Although Macdonald 's governing Liberals and the opposition Conservatives agreed on the need to protect union rights , the parties vied with each other to take credit for the Trade Union Act . In January 1937 , Premier Macdonald carried a bottle of bootleg rum to a meeting with union officials in Sydney , Cape Breton where they gave him a draft bill based on the American National Labor Relations Act . Before the Macdonald government could introduce the bill in the legislature , the Conservatives presented a similar one of their own . The legislation faced opposition from the Canadian Manufacturers ' Association during public hearings , but Liberals and Conservatives combined to pass it unanimously . The new Trade Union Act required employers to bargain with any union chosen by a majority of their employees . It also prohibited employers from firing workers for organizing a union . 
 = = = Government patronage = = = 
 Nova Scotia 's well @-@ entrenched system of paying off government supporters with jobs and contracts continued to flourish under the Macdonald Liberals . In his comprehensive history of Canadian patronage , journalist Jeffrey Simpson writes that the Liberals used road improvements to win votes , with highway crews " especially busy before and during election campaigns . " Simpson adds that the Liberals awarded government contracts to companies approved by the party . In return , the firms were required to kickback some of the money they received to the Liberals . Biographer Stephen Henderson argues that Macdonald himself did not relish the traditional practice of filling government jobs with party supporters . Nevertheless , the " wave of partisan hirings and firings " continued as committees in each riding " scrutinized employees for inappropriate political activity and rated prospective candidates based on what they or their families had done for the Liberal party " . 
 = = Second term as premier , 1937 – 40 = = 
 Fortunately for the Macdonald government , economic conditions improved during the 1930s . In March 1937 , Macdonald announced that after 14 years of running operating deficits , the Nova Scotia government had recorded a surplus with another forecast for the next year . The pro @-@ Liberal Halifax Chronicle gleefully described the scene in the legislature : " the House sat for a moment , as if not comprehending the good news , then rocked with acclaim , at least the Government side of the House did , though the opposition , stilled and stunned @-@ like , sat like figures carved in stone " . Macdonald promised the government would spend another $ 7 @.@ 5 million on its popular road paving program overseen by A. S. MacMillan , the veteran Minister of Highways . MacMillan , also Chairman of the Nova Scotia Power Commission , had been extending electrical service into rural areas . He now introduced a rural electrification bill designed to subsidize the cost of providing electricity . 
 After these preparations , the premier called a provincial election for June 29 , 1937 . Macdonald campaigned on his government 's record . On election day , his Liberals were rewarded with 25 of the 30 seats in the legislature . 
 Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had invited Macdonald to run for federal office during the general election of 1935 . Although Macdonald turned him down , there were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics . Biographer Stephen Henderson writes however , that Macdonald wanted to remain as premier so he could present Nova Scotia 's case to a Royal Commission on federal @-@ provincial relations . 
 = = = Rowell @-@ Sirois Commission = = = 
 The Depression of the 1930s exposed glaring weaknesses in federal @-@ provincial financial arrangements . Canada 's poorer provinces found it impossible to cope with widespread poverty and hunger while the federal government resisted taking full responsibility for unemployment relief . By 1937 , conditions had become so desperate that the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan faced bankruptcy . Finally , in August 1937 , Prime Minister King appointed the Royal Commission on Dominion @-@ Provincial Relations , popularly known as the Rowell @-@ Sirois Commission . According to biographer Stephen Henderson , Macdonald played an important role in shaping the Commission 's final recommendations . 
 Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia 's submission and presented it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938 . He called on the federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance , old @-@ age pensions and mothers ' allowances . Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs . He argued however , that to maintain their independence , the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes . He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes . 
 A central part of Macdonald 's case concerned the redistribution of wealth from richer provinces to poorer ones . His argument was based on the premise that richer provinces benefited from national economic policies such as high tariffs while poorer provinces were penalized by them . Macdonald suggested that compensatory subsidies to poorer , less @-@ populated provinces be based on need , not population , so that they could pay for government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher @-@ than @-@ average levels of taxation . 
 The Commission 's final report , released in May 1940 , reflected many of Macdonald 's recommendations . Mackenzie King called a federal @-@ provincial conference in January 1941 to discuss the report . The provinces failed to agree on what should be done , but in April , the federal government went ahead on its own announcing it would levy steep taxes on personal and corporate incomes as a temporary measure to finance Canada 's participation in the Second World War . 
 = = = Summons to Ottawa = = = 
 The course of Macdonald 's political career changed sharply after Canada declared war on Germany in September 1939 . Three months later , Mackenzie King called a federal election and on March 26 , 1940 , his Liberals won a decisive victory . In spite of his victory , King was under pressure to recruit the country 's " best brains " into his wartime cabinet . The death of his minister of defence in an air crash in June 1940 gave King an opportunity to reorganize his administration . He asked J. L. Ralston , a native Nova Scotian , to become his new minister of defence . Ralston agreed but imposed two conditions : First that J. L. Ilsley of Nova Scotia replace him as minister of finance and second that he get assistance in his new portfolio . 
 King decided to appoint two additional ministers , one in charge of the Royal Canadian Air Force , the other to oversee the Royal Canadian Navy . He therefore , asked Macdonald to join the federal cabinet as minister of national defence for naval services . Macdonald , who had fought in World War I as a soldier on the front lines in France and Belgium , decided it was his duty to fight World War II as a political leader in Ottawa . He handed over his responsibilities as premier to A. S. MacMillan and was sworn into the federal cabinet on July 12 , 1940 . 
 = = Wartime federal career , 1940 – 45 = = 
 Macdonald 's five years in Ottawa were tumultuous ones . He oversaw a massive increase in Canada 's naval forces and played a key role in a political crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart . He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King , a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe . When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940 , Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself . By the time he resigned in 1945 , Macdonald 's federal political career was in tatters . 
 Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald to stand for a vacant seat in Kingston , Ontario . It was a traditional Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald , Canada 's first prime minister . In 1935 however , the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it . " I told Mr. King that I did not know Kingston at all , nor its problems , nor its people " , Macdonald wrote later . When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however , Macdonald had no choice but to stand for office in Kingston . He won the seat by acclamation on August 12 , 1940 . 
 = = = Building the navy = = = 
 Macdonald faced a huge , but critical task in overseeing the expansion of the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) . As historian Desmond Morton points out , the RCN was tiny when Canada entered the war in 1939 . It consisted of six destroyers , five minesweepers and about 3 @,@ 000 personnel in its regular forces and volunteer reserves . By the time Macdonald took office in 1940 , the RCN had grown to 100 ships and more than 7 @,@ 000 personnel , but as biographer Stephen Henderson notes , " few of its ships and sailors were ready for service at sea " . By the end of the war , the RCN had expanded by 50 times its original strength with about 400 fighting ships , almost 500 additional craft and about 96 @,@ 000 men and women . 
 The RCN was assigned the task of escorting supply vessels transporting food and other materials needed to keep the war going . This convoy duty was critically important as German submarines or U @-@ boats sought to starve Britain into submission by sinking supply ships . The RCN performed about 40 percent of the war 's transatlantic Allied escort duty . Desmond Morton argues it was Canada 's " most decisive " military contribution . Canada 's convoy protection efforts did not always run smoothly , however . In the early part of the war , the Canadian navy lacked equipment that could detect underwater submarines as well as efficient radar for sighting ones on the surface . To make matters worse , Canada didn 't have the long @-@ range aircraft that were the most effective anti @-@ submarine weapons . 
 As supply ship losses mounted , the RCN struggled to catch up to the better @-@ equipped British and American navies . Macdonald himself lacked military expertise and often depended on senior naval staff who kept him in the dark about equipment shortages and other problems . " Macdonald 's administration of Naval Affairs did not rise to brilliance " , Henderson writes , " [ but ] the problem may have lain more with the senior naval staff than with Macdonald " . Macdonald 's conflict with high ranking naval officers , particularly Rear Admiral Percy W. Nelles , led to the effective dismissal of the latter in 1944 . Yet , as the war progressed , the RCN , led by Macdonald , gradually became more effective in protecting the huge cargoes of materials on which Allied victory depended . 
 = = = Conscription crisis = = = 
 Biographer Stephen Henderson maintains that Macdonald played a key role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942 , and again in 1944 , as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas . Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment . A committed internationalist , he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations . Macdonald realized however , that conscription was highly unpopular in French @-@ speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial . He also recognized that in the early years of the war , voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces . 
 Nevertheless , Macdonald continued to push the government to commit itself to conscription if circumstances should change . His position earned him the enmity of the politically cautious Mackenzie King . " Macdonald is a very vain man " , the prime minister complained in his diary , " and has an exceptional opinion of himself . Undoubtedly , he came here expecting to possibly lead the Liberal party later on but has found that he will not be able to command the following that he expected " . 
 As the opposition Conservatives continued to press for overseas conscription , the King government held a national plebiscite on April 27 , 1942 . The plebiscite asked voters to release the government from its previous promise not to introduce compulsory war service . The results confirmed the sharp national split . English Canada voted strongly in favour and French Canada overwhelmingly against . The results of the plebiscite seemed to strengthen the position of ministers who supported conscription . Macdonald 's two cabinet colleagues from Nova Scotia , defence minister J. L. Ralston , and finance minister J. L. Ilsley , urged the government to introduce conscription immediately . A more cautious Macdonald wanted the government to commit itself to conscription should it be required to support the war effort . 
 The crisis flared again two years later when the Canadian military called for overseas reinforcements . Ralston wanted King to impose conscription , but at Macdonald 's urging , seemed willing to compromise by going along with the prime minister 's plan for one last voluntary recruitment campaign . King however , suddenly dismissed Ralston during a cabinet meeting on November 1 , 1944 . Macdonald considered resigning , but said later he would have struck King if he had risen to leave . Instead he sat in his chair ripping sheets of notepaper into small shreds and dropping them on the floor . Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald 's decision not to resign probably saved the King government . King himself seemed to recognize that if Macdonald had left , Ilsley would have resigned too , possibly taking other ministers with him and causing the government 's collapse . 
 In the end , King was forced to impose overseas conscription after the failure of the voluntary recruitment campaign , but the war ended soon after and his government survived unscathed . The conscription crisis however , hardened the animosity between King and his naval minister . Macdonald , disillusioned by what he saw as the chicanery and ruthlessness of national politics , longed to return to Nova Scotia . After King called an election for June 11 , 1945 , Macdonald resigned from the federal cabinet . 
 = = Provincial premier , 1945 – 54 = = 
 When Macdonald returned to Nova Scotia in 1945 , he was only 55 , but the silver @-@ haired politician now seemed 20 years older . After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan , the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald 's leadership at their convention on August 31 , 1945 . Less than two months later , Macdonald 's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives for the first time since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF , the forerunner of the present @-@ day New Democratic Party , or NDP . In spite of his huge victory , a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940 . He had trouble making decisions , not because he was a <unk> , but because he was not well . 
 Nevertheless , Macdonald plunged into his role as a leading champion for the provinces . He argued that in order to maintain their independence , provinces needed exclusive jurisdiction over such sources of revenue as gasoline , electricity and amusement taxes . He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights . Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell @-@ Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need . Such a policy , he maintained , would enable poorer provinces to sustain government services available in other parts of the country without having to impose higher @-@ than @-@ average levels of taxation . In the end , Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes . The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies . 
 Aside from his role as a national spokesman for provincial rights , Macdonald presided over an administration that invested heavily in education . His government financed the building of rural high schools and extended financial assistance to Dalhousie University 's schools of medicine and law . Macdonald also appointed Nova Scotia 's first minister of education , Henry Hicks , in 1949 to oversee $ 7 @.@ 6 million in spending , about a fifth of the provincial budget . 
 The Macdonald Liberals easily won re @-@ election in 1949 and 1953 , but the Conservatives made steady gains under Robert Stanfield , their new leader . The Conservatives for example , drew attention to kickback schemes under which brewing companies , wineries and distilleries contributed to the Liberal party in exchange for the right to sell their products in government liquor stores . The Liberals seemed secure against such allegations however , as long as they were led by the popular Angus L. Macdonald . However , Macdonald suffered a slight heart attack on April 11 , 1954 , and was admitted to hospital where he died in his sleep two nights later , just four months before his 64th birthday . 
 Stephen Henderson writes that the Nova Scotia legislature sat on the day of his death . Macdonald 's seat was draped in Clanranald tartan and a sprig of heather decorated his desk . Macdonald 's body lay in state for three days in the legislative building as more than 100 @,@ 000 people filed past to pay their respects . 
 = = Aftermath of Macdonald 's death = = 
 Macdonald 's death proved disastrous for provincial Liberals . There was no obvious successor to the popular premier . At the party 's leadership convention held on September 9 , 1954 , the Liberals appeared badly split along religious lines . After five ballots , the convention rejected Harold Connolly , a Roman Catholic who had served as interim premier after Macdonald 's death . Instead they chose the Protestant Henry Hicks . " Unfortunately for the Liberals " , historian Murray Beck writes , " it appeared as if the delegates had <unk> up to defeat the only Catholic among the contestants " . Beck also notes that " Nova Scotia governments have always been most vulnerable after a change in leadership " . In the next provincial election held on October 30 , 1956 , Robert Stanfield and his Conservatives won 24 seats , the Liberals 18 . The 23 @-@ year Liberal era , begun under Macdonald 's leadership , had finally ended . 
 = = Assessment and legacy = = 
 Murray Beck writes that Macdonald 's political appeal to Nova Scotians may have been even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe 's . Like Howe , Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit , wide learning and respect for factual accuracy . Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises , Macdonald became known as a leader who always kept his word . 
 Macdonald 's reputation as the premier who led the province out of the Great Depression rested on his commitment to ambitious government projects such as highway construction and rural electrification . He continued to support highway improvements throughout his career . Two projects that he pushed especially hard for , the Canso Causeway linking Cape Breton Island to mainland Nova Scotia and a suspension bridge spanning Halifax Harbour were completed after his death . The bridge , named in his honour , made it possible to travel between Halifax and Dartmouth without having to board a ferry or drive several kilometres around the Bedford Basin . 
 Macdonald consistently called for a more equitable redistribution of wealth , so that poorer provinces such as Nova Scotia , could share fully in Canada 's prosperity . Biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald deserves credit for the introduction , in 1957 , of an equalization scheme designed to enable poorer provinces to provide comparable levels of services to their citizens . Macdonald 's advocacy of provincial autonomy however , fell victim to the centralizing tendencies of a post @-@ war welfare state in which the federal government increasingly assumed greater control over national social programs . 
 Throughout his life , Macdonald maintained ties to his alma mater , St. Francis Xavier University . He received an honorary doctor of laws degree from St. FX in 1946 . He served as honorary chair and fundraiser for the university 's centennial celebrations in 1953 and raised money to support student research into the early history of the Scots in Nova Scotia . Macdonald suggested that the reading room in a new university library be called the Hall of the Clans . St. FX adopted the idea and decided to name the library in his honour . Thus , when the Angus L. Macdonald Library officially opened on July 17 , 1965 , 50 coats of arms representing both Scottish and Irish clans adorned the walls of its reading room . 
 = Samuel Colt = 
 Samuel Colt ( July 19 , 1814 – January 10 , 1862 ) was an American inventor and industrialist from Hartford , Connecticut . He founded Colt 's Patent Fire @-@ Arms Manufacturing Company ( today , Colt 's Manufacturing Company ) , and made the mass production of the revolver commercially viable . 
 Colt 's first two business ventures — producing firearms in Paterson , New Jersey , and making underwater mines — ended in disappointment . But his business expanded rapidly after 1847 , when the Texas Rangers ordered 1 @,@ 000 revolvers during the American war with Mexico . During the American Civil War , his factory in Hartford supplied firearms both to the North and the South . Later , his firearms were prominent during the settling of the western frontier . Colt died in 1862 as one of the wealthiest men in America . 
 Colt 's manufacturing methods were at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution . His use of interchangeable parts helped him become one of the first to exploit the assembly line . Moreover , his innovative use of art , celebrity endorsements and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising , product placement and mass marketing . 
 = = Early years ( 1814 – 1835 ) = = 
 Samuel Colt was born in Hartford , Connecticut to Christopher Colt ( 1777 – 1850 ) , a farmer who had moved his family to the city after he became a businessman , and Sarah Colt , born Caldwell . His mother 's father , Major John Caldwell , had been an officer in the Continental Army and one of Samuel 's earliest possessions was his maternal grandfather 's flintlock pistol . Sarah died from tuberculosis when Samuel was six years old , and his father remarried two years later to Olivia Sargeant . Samuel had three sisters , one of whom died during her childhood . His oldest sister , Margaret , died of tuberculosis at 19 and the other , Sarah Ann , later committed suicide . One brother , James , became a lawyer ; another , Christopher , was a textile merchant . A third brother , John C. Colt , a man of many occupations , killed a creditor in 1841 in New York City , was found guilty of the murder , and committed suicide on the day he was to be executed . 
 At age 11 , Colt was indentured to a farmer in Glastonbury , where he did chores and attended school . Here he was introduced to the Compendium of Knowledge , a scientific encyclopedia that he preferred to read rather than his Bible studies . Its articles on Robert Fulton and gunpowder motivated Colt throughout his life . He discovered that other inventors in the Compendium had accomplished things that were once deemed impossible , and he wanted to do the same . Later , after hearing soldiers talk about the success of the double @-@ barreled rifle and the impossibility of a gun that could shoot five or six times without reloading , Colt decided that he would create the " impossible gun " . 
 In 1829 , at the age of 15 , Colt began working in his father 's textile plant in Ware , Massachusetts , where he had access to tools , materials , and the factory workers ' expertise . Following the encyclopedia , Samuel built a homemade galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives ; although the raft was missed , the explosion was still impressive . Sent to boarding school , he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics . In 1830 , a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling , and his father then sent him off to learn the seaman 's trade . On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo , he noticed that regardless of which way the ship 's wheel was spun , each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it . He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver . On the Corvo , Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood . It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached <unk> turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels a bolt , a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment . 
 When Colt returned to the United States in 1832 , he went back to work for his father , who financed the production of two guns , a rifle and a pistol . The first completed pistol exploded when it was fired , but the rifle performed well . His father would not finance any further development , so Samuel needed to find a way to pay for the development of his ideas . He had learned about nitrous oxide ( laughing gas ) from the factory chemist in his father 's textile plant , so he took a portable lab on the road and earned a living performing laughing gas demonstrations across the United States and Canada , billing himself as " the Celebrated Dr. <unk> of New @-@ York , London and Calcutta " . Colt conceived of himself as a man of science and thought if he could enlighten people about a new idea like nitrous oxide , he could in turn make people more receptive to his new idea concerning a revolver . He started his lectures on street corners and soon worked his way up to lecture halls and museums . As ticket sales declined , Colt realized that " serious " museum lectures were not what the people wanted to pay money to see and that it was dramatic stories of salvation and redemption the public craved . While visiting his brother , John , in Cincinnati , he partnered with sculptor , Hiram Powers , for his demonstrations with a theme based on The Divine Comedy . Powers made detailed wax sculptures and paintings based on demons , centaurs and mummies from Dante . Colt constructed fireworks to complete the show , which was a success . According to Colt historian Robert Lawrence Wilson , the " lectures launched Colt 's celebrated career as a pioneer Madison Avenue @-@ style pitchman " . His public speaking skills were so prized that he was thought to be a doctor and was pressed into service to cure an apparent cholera epidemic on board a riverboat by giving his patients a dose of nitrous oxide . 
 Having some money saved and keeping his idea alive of being an inventor as opposed to a " medicine man " , Colt made arrangements to begin building guns using proper gunsmiths from Baltimore , Maryland . He abandoned the idea of a multiple barreled revolver and opted for a single fixed barrel design with a rotating cylinder . The action of the hammer would align the cylinder bores with the single barrel . He sought the counsel of a friend of his father , Henry Leavitt Ellsworth , who loaned him $ 300 and advised him to perfect his prototype before applying for a patent . Colt hired a gunsmith by the name of John Pearson to build his revolver . Over the next few years Colt and Pearson fought over money , but the design improved and in 1835 Colt was ready to apply for his US patent . Ellsworth was now the superintendent of the US Patent Office and advised Colt to file for foreign patents first as a prior US patent would keep Colt from filing a patent in Great Britain . In August 1835 , Colt left for England and France to secure his foreign patent .

 In 1835 , Samuel Colt traveled to the United Kingdom , following in the footsteps of Elisha Collier , a Bostonian who had patented a revolving flintlock there that achieved great popularity . Despite the reluctance of English officials to issue a patent to Colt , no fault could be found with the gun and he was issued his first patent ( Number <unk> ) . Upon his return to America , he applied for his US patent for a " revolving gun " ; he was granted the patent on February 25 , 1836 ( later numbered <unk> ) . This instrument and patent No. 1304 , dated August 29 , 1836 , protected the basic principles of his revolving @-@ breech loading , folding trigger firearm named the Colt Paterson . 
 With a loan from his cousin , Dudley Selden , and letters of recommendation from Ellsworth , Colt formed a corporation of venture capitalists in April 1836 to bring his idea to market . Through the political connections of these venture capitalists , the Patent Arms Manufacturing of Paterson , New Jersey , was chartered by the New Jersey legislature on March 5 , 1836 . Colt was given a commission for each gun sold in exchange for his dam of patent rights , and stipulated the return of the rights if the company disbanded . 
 Colt never claimed to have invented the revolver ; his design was a more practical adaption of Collier 's earlier revolving flintlock incorporating a locking bolt to keep the cylinder in line with the barrel . The invention of the percussion cap made ignition more reliable , faster , and safer than the older flintlock design . Colt 's great contribution was to the use of interchangeable parts . Knowing that some gun parts were made by machine , he envisioned that all the parts on every Colt gun to be interchangeable and made by machine , later to be assembled by hand . His goal was the assembly line . This is shown in an 1836 letter that Colt wrote to his father in which he said , 
 The first workman would receive two or three of the most important parts and would affix these and pass them on to the next who would add a part and pass the growing article on to another who would do the same , and so on until the complete arm is put together . 
 Colt 's US revolver patent gave him a monopoly on revolver manufacture until 1857 . His was the first practical revolver and the first practical repeating firearm due to progress made in percussion technology . No longer a mere novelty arm , the revolver became an industrial and cultural legacy as well as a contribution to the development of war technology , ironically personified in the name of one of his company 's later innovations , the " Peacemaker " . 
 = = Early problems and failures = = 
 Although by the end of 1837 the Arms Company had made over 1 @,@ 000 weapons , there were no sales . Following the Panic of 1837 , the company 's underwriters were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts , so he went on the road to raise money . Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed , so with another loan from his cousin , Selden , he went to Washington , D.C. , and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson . Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so . Presidential approval in hand , Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military , but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon . A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy @-@ five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough . 
 Constant problems for Colt were the provisions of the Militia Act of 1808 which stated that any arms purchased by a State militia had to be in current service in the United States Military . This Act prevented state militias from allocating funds towards the purchase of experimental weapons or foreign weapons . 
 Colt undermined his own company by his reckless spending . Selden constantly chastised him for using corporate funds to buy an expensive wardrobe or making lavish gifts to potential clients . Selden twice cut off Colt from company money for spending it on liquor and fancy dinners ; Colt thought getting potential customers inebriated would generate more sales . 
 The company was briefly saved by the war against the Seminoles in Florida which provided the first sale of Colt 's revolvers and his new revolving rifles . The soldiers in Florida praised the new weapon , but the unusual hammerless design , sixty years ahead of its time , led to difficulty in training men who were used to exposed @-@ hammer guns . Consequently , many curious soldiers took the locks apart . This resulted in breakage of parts , stripped screw heads and inoperable guns . Colt soon reworked his design to leave the firing hammer exposed , but problems continued . In late 1843 , after the loss of payment for the Florida pistols , the Paterson plant closed and a public auction was held in New York City to sell the company 's most liquid assets . 
 = = Mines and tinfoil = = 
 Colt did not refrain long from manufacturing , and turned to selling underwater electrical detonators and waterproof cable of his own invention . Soon after the failure of the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company , he teamed up with Samuel Morse to lobby the US government for funds . Colt 's waterproof cable , made from tar @-@ coated copper , proved valuable when Morse ran telegraph lines under lakes , rivers , bays , and in his attempts to lay a telegraph line under the Atlantic Ocean . Morse used the battery from one of Colt 's mines to transmit a telegraph message from Manhattan to Governors Island when his own battery was too weak to send the signal . 
 When tensions with Great Britain prompted Congress to appropriate funds for Colt 's project toward the end of 1841 , he demonstrated his underwater mines to the US government . In 1842 he used one of the devices to destroy a moving vessel to the satisfaction of the United States Navy and President John Tyler . However , opposition from John Quincy Adams , who was serving as a US Representative from Massachusetts 's 8th congressional district scuttled the project as " not fair and honest warfare " and called the Colt mine an " unchristian contraption " . 
 After this setback , Colt turned his attention to perfecting tinfoil cartridges he had originally designed for use in his revolvers . The standard at the time was to have powder and ball contained in a paper or skin envelope or " cartridge " for ease of loading . However , if the paper got wet it would ruin the powder . Colt tried alternate materials such as rubber cement , but settled on a thin type of tinfoil . In 1841 he made samples of these cartridges for the army . During tests of the foil cartridges , 25 rounds were fired from a musket without cleaning . When the breech plug was removed from the barrel no fouling from the tin foil was evident . The reception was lukewarm and the army purchased a few thousand rounds for further testing . In 1843 the army returned to Colt with an order for 200 @,@ 000 of the tinfoil cartridges packed 10 to a box for use in muskets . 
 With the money made from the cartridges Colt turned back to Morse and his cable for ideas other than detonating mines . Colt concentrated on manufacturing his waterproof telegraph cable , believing the business would prosper alongside Morse 's invention . He began promoting the telegraph companies so he could create a wider market for his cable , for which he was to be paid $ 50 per mile . Colt tried to use this revenue to resurrect the Patent Arms Manufacturing Company , but could not secure funds from other investors or even his own family . This left Colt time to improve his earlier revolver design and have a prototype built by a gunsmith in New York for his " New and improved revolver " . This new revolver had a stationary trigger and was in a larger caliber . Colt submitted his single prototype to the War Department as a " Holster revolver " . 
 = = Colt 's Patent Manufacturing Company ( 1847 – 1860 ) = = 
 Captain Samuel Walker of the Texas Rangers had acquired some of the first Colt revolvers produced during the Seminole War and seen first @-@ hand their effective use as his 15 @-@ man unit defeated a larger force of 70 Comanche in Texas . Walker wanted to order Colt revolvers for use by the Rangers in the Mexican @-@ American War , and traveled to New York City in search of Colt . He met Colt in a gunsmith 's shop on January 4 , 1847 , and placed an order for 1 @,@ 000 revolvers . Walker asked for a few changes ; the new revolvers would have to hold 6 shots instead of 5 , have enough power to kill either a man or a horse with a single shot and be quicker to reload . The large order allowed Colt to establish a new firearm business . Colt hired Eli Whitney Blake , who was established in the arms business , to make his guns . Colt used his prototype and Walker 's improvements as the basis for a new design . From this new design , Blake produced the first thousand @-@ piece order known as the Colt Walker . The company then received an order for a thousand more ; Colt took a share of the profits at $ 10 per pistol for both orders . 
 With the money he made from the sales of the Walkers and a loan from his cousin , banker Elisha Colt , Colt bought the machinery and tooling from Blake to build his own factory : Colt 's Patent Fire @-@ Arms Manufacturing Company factory at Hartford . The first revolving @-@ breech pistols made at the factory were called " <unk> @-@ Hartford @-@ Dragoons " and became so popular that the word " Colt " was often used as a generic term for the revolver . The <unk> @-@ Hartford Dragoon , largely built from leftover Walker parts , is known as the first model in the transition from the Walker to the Dragoon series . Beginning in 1848 , more contracts followed for what is today known as the Colt Dragoon Revolvers . These models were based on the Walker Colt , and in three generations slight changes to each model showed the rapid evolution of the design . The improvements were 7 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 190 mm ) barrels for accuracy , shorter chambers and an improved loading lever . The shorter chambers were loaded to 50 grains of powder , instead of 60 grains in the earlier Walkers , to prevent the occurrence of ruptured cylinders . Finally , a positive catch was installed at the end of the loading lever to prevent the lever from dropping under recoil . 
 Besides being used in the war with Mexico , Colt 's revolvers were employed as a sidearm by both civilians and soldiers . Colt 's revolvers were a key tool in the westward expansion . A revolver which could fire six times without reloading helped soldiers and settlers fend off larger forces which were not armed in the same way . In 1848 , Colt introduced smaller versions of his pistols known as Baby Dragoons that were made for civilian use . In 1850 General Sam Houston and General Thomas Jefferson Rusk lobbied Secretary of War William Marcy and President James K. Polk to adopt Colt 's revolvers for the US military . Rusk testified : " Colt 's Repeating Arms are the most efficient weapons in the world and the only weapon which has enabled the frontiersman to defeat the mounted Indian in his own peculiar mode of warfare . " Lt. <unk> McDonald , who served under Walker when Walker was killed in Mexico , stated that 30 Rangers used Colt 's revolvers to keep 500 Mexicans in check . Colt followed this design with the Colt 1851 Navy Revolver which was larger than the Baby Dragoon , but not quite as large as the full @-@ sized version . The gun became the standard sidearm for US Military officers and proved popular among civilian buyers . After the testimony by Houston and Rusk , the next issue became how quickly Colt could supply the military . Ever the opportunist , when the War with Mexico was over , Colt sent agents south of the border to procure sales from the Mexican government . 
 = = = Patent extension = = = 
 During this period , Colt received an extension on his patent since he did not collect on it in the early years . In 1852 , gun makers James Warner and Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent . Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that the Warner and Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production . Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double @-@ action pepperbox revolver . However , Colt 's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $ 15 @,@ 000 . Production of Allen <unk> continued until the expiration of Colt 's patent in 1857 . In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the US Congress , who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension . By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt , but with Washington politicians . With a virtual monopoly , Colt sold his pistols in Europe , where demand was high due to tense international relations . By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt 's pistols , Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race . 
 A key element to Colt 's success was vigorous protection of his patent rights . Even though he lawfully held the only patent on a revolver , scores of imitators copied his work and Colt found himself constantly in litigation . In each one of these cases , Colt 's lawyer , Edward N. Dickerson , deftly exploited the patent system and successfully shut down Colt 's competitors . However , Colt 's zealous protection of his patents greatly impeded firearms development as a whole in the United States . His preoccupation with patent infringement suits slowed his own company 's transition to the cartridge system and blocked other firms from pursuing revolver designs . At the same time , Colt 's policies forced some competing inventors to greater innovation by denying them key features of his mechanism ; as a result they created their own . 
 Colt knew he had to make his revolvers affordable , as the death of many great inventions was a high retail price . Colt fixed his prices at a level below his competition to maximize sales volume . From his experience in haggling with government officials , he knew what numbers he would have to generate to make enough profit to invest money in improving his machinery , thereby limiting imitators ' ability to produce a comparable weapon at a lower price . Although successful at this for the most part , his preoccupation with marketing strategies and patent protection caused him to miss a great opportunity in firearms development when he dismissed an idea from one of his gunsmiths , Rollin White . White had an idea of a " bored @-@ through " revolver cylinder to allow the use of metallic cartridges in a handgun . After Colt fired White for suggesting an improvement to his revolver , White took his idea to Colt 's competitor , Smith & Wesson , who patented his invention and kept Colt from being able to build cartridge firearms for almost 20 years .

 Colt purchased a large tract of land beside the Connecticut River , where he built his first factory in 1848 , a larger factory called the Colt Armory in 1855 , a manor that he called <unk> in 1856 , and employee tenement housing . He established a ten @-@ hour day for employees , installed washing stations in the factory , mandated a one @-@ hour lunch break , and built the Charter Oak Hall , where employees could enjoy games , newspapers , and discussion rooms . Colt ran his plant with a military @-@ like discipline , he would fire workers for tardiness , sub @-@ par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs . 
 Colt hired Elisha K. Root as his chief mechanic in setting up the plant 's machinery . Root had been successful in an earlier venture automating the production of axes and made , bought , or improved jigs , fixtures and profile machinery for Colt . Over the years he developed specialized machinery for stock turning or cutting the rifling in gun barrels . Historian Barbara Tucker credits Root as " the first to build special purpose machinery and apply it to the manufacture of a commercial product " . Colt historian Herbert G. <unk> , wrote , " had it not been for Root 's inventive genius , Colt 's dream of mass production would never have been realized " . 
 Thus , Colt 's factory was the first to make use of the concept known as the assembly line . The idea was not new but was never successful in industry at the time because of the lack of interchangeable parts . Root 's machinery changed that for Colt , since the machines completed as much as 80 % of the work and less than 20 % of the parts required hand fitting and filing . Colt 's revolvers were made by machine , but he insisted on final hand finishing and polishing of his revolvers to impart a handmade feel . Colt turned to artisan gun makers from Bavaria and developed a commercial use for Waterman Ormsby 's <unk> to produce " roll @-@ die " engraving on steel , particularly on the cylinders . He hired Bavarian engraver Gustave Young for fine hand engraving on his more " custom " pieces . In an attempt to attract skilled European @-@ immigrant workers to his plant , Colt built a village near the factory away from the tenements which he named <unk> and modeled the homes after a village in Potsdam . In an effort to stem the flooding from the river he planted German <unk> , a type of willow tree in a 2 @-@ mile long dike . He subsequently built a factory to manufacture wicker furniture made from these trees . 
 On June 5 , 1856 , Colt married Elizabeth Jarvis , the daughter of the Rev. William Jarvis , who lived downriver from Hartford . The wedding was lavish and featured the ceremony on a steamship overlooking the factory as well as fireworks and rifle salutes . The couple had four children : two daughters and a son who died in infancy and a son born in 1858 : Caldwell Hart Colt . 
 = = = = London = = = = 
 Soon after establishing his Hartford factory , Colt set out to establish a factory in Europe and chose London . He organized a large display of his firearms at the Great Exhibition of 1851 at Hyde Park , London and ingratiated himself by presenting cased engraved Colt revolvers to such appropriate officials as Britain 's Master General of the Ordnance . At one exhibit Colt disassembled ten guns and reassembled ten guns using different parts from different guns . As the world 's leading proponent of mass production techniques , Colt went on to deliver a lecture on the subject to the Institution of Civil Engineers ( ICE ) in London . The membership rewarded his efforts by awarding him the Silver Telford Medal . With help from ICE secretary , Charles Manby , Colt established his London operation near Vauxhall Bridge on the Thames River and began production on January 1 , 1853 . On a tour of the factory , Charles Dickens was so impressed with the facilities that he recorded his favorable comments of Colt 's revolvers in an 1852 edition of Household Words . The factory 's machines mass @-@ produced its parts that were completely interchangeable and could be put together on assembly lines using standardized patterns and gauges by unskilled labor as opposed to England 's top gun makers making each part by hand . Colt 's London factory remained in operation for only four years . Unwilling to alter his open @-@ top single @-@ action design for the solid frame double @-@ action revolver that the British asked for ; Colt scarcely sold 23 @,@ 000 revolvers to the British Army and Navy . In 1856 he closed the London plant and had the machinery , tooling , and unfinished guns shipped to Hartford .

 When foreign heads of state would not grant him an audience , as he was only a private citizen , he persuaded the governor of the state of Connecticut make him a lieutenant colonel and aide @-@ de @-@ camp in the state militia . With this rank , he toured Europe again to promote his revolvers . He used marketing techniques which were innovative at the time . He frequently gave custom engraved versions of his revolvers to heads of state , military officers , and personalities such as Giuseppe Garibaldi , King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy , and Hungarian freedom fighter Lajos Kossuth . Colt commissioned western artist George Catlin to produce a series of paintings depicting exotic scenes in which a Colt weapon was prominently used against Indians , wild animals , or bandits in the earliest form of " product placement " . He placed numerous advertisements in the same newspapers ; The Knickerbocker ran as many as eight in the same edition . Lastly , he hired authors to write stories about his guns for magazines and travel guides . One of Colt 's biggest acts of self @-@ promotion was the payment to the publishers of United States Magazine $ 1 @,@ 120 ( $ 61 @,@ 439 by 1999 standards ) to run a 29 @-@ page fully illustrated story showing the inner workings of his factory . 
 After his revolvers had gained acceptance , Colt looked for unsolicited news stories containing mention of his guns that he could excerpt and reprint . He went so far as to hire agents in other states and territories to find such samples , to buy hundreds of copies for himself and to give the editor a free revolver for writing them , particularly if such a story disparaged his competition . Many of the revolvers Colt gave away as " gifts " had inscriptions such as " Compliments of Col. Colt " or " From the Inventor " engraved on the back straps . Later versions contained his entire signature which was used in many of his advertisements as a centerpiece , using his celebrity to guarantee the performance of his weapons . Colt eventually secured a trademark for his signature . 
 = = Later years and death = = 
 As the American Civil War approached , Colt supplied both the North and the South with firearms . He had been known to sell weapons to warring parties on both sides of other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect to the war in America . In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2 @,@ 000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth . Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time , newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune , the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union . In response to these charges , Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16 , 1861 in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle . Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons . However , the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20 , 1861 . 
 Samuel Colt died of gout in Hartford on January 10 , 1862 , and was buried in Cedar Hill Cemetery . At the time of his death , Colt 's estate , which he left to his wife and three @-@ year @-@ old son Caldwell Hart Colt , was estimated to be valued at around $ 15 million ( $ 350 million by 2009 standards ) . His professional responsibilities were turned over to his brother @-@ in @-@ law , Richard Jarvis . The only other person mentioned in Colt 's will was Samuel Caldwell Colt , the son of his brother , John . 
 Colt historian William Edwards wrote that Samuel Colt had married Caroline Henshaw ( who later married his brother , John ) in Scotland in 1838 , and that the son she bore later was Samuel Colt 's and not his brother John 's . In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters , Edwards wrote that John Colt 's marriage to Caroline in 1841 was a way to legitimize her unborn son as the real father , Samuel Colt , felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time . After John 's death , Samuel Colt took care of the child , named Samuel Caldwell Colt , financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what were described as " the finest private schools . " In correspondence to and about his namesake , Samuel Colt referred to him as his " nephew " in quotes . Historians such as Edwards and Harold Schechter have said this was the elder Colt 's way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without directly saying so . After Colt 's death in 1862 , he left the boy $ 2 million by 2010 standards . Colt 's widow , Elizabeth Jarvis Colt , and her brother , Richard Jarvis contested this . In probate Caroline 's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt 's estate , if not to the Colt Manufacturing Company . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 It is estimated that in its first 25 years of manufacturing , Colt 's company produced over 400 @,@ 000 revolvers . Before his death , each barrel was stamped : " Address Col. Samuel Colt , New York , US America " , or a variation using a London address . Colt did this as New York and London were major cosmopolitan cities and he retained an office in New York at 155 Broadway where he based his salesmen . 
 Colt was the first American manufacturer to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings . He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials . On a trip to Constantinople he gave a custom @-@ engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I , informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols , thus securing a Turkish order for 5 @,@ 000 pistols ; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order . 
 Apart from gifts and bribes , Colt employed an effective marketing program which comprised sales promotion , publicity , product sampling , and public relations . He used the press to his own advantage by giving revolvers to editors , prompting them to report " all the accidents that occur to the Sharps & other humbug arms " , and listing incidents where Colt weapons had been " well used against bears , Indians , Mexicans , etc " . Colt 's firearms did not always fare well in standardized military tests ; he preferred written testimonials from individual soldiers who used his weapons and these were what he most relied on to secure government contracts . 
 Colt felt that bad press was just as important as good press ; provided that his name and his revolvers received mention . When he opened the London armory he posted a 14 @-@ foot sign on the roof across from Parliament reading " Colonel Colt 's Pistol Factory " as a publicity stunt which created a stir in the British press . Eventually the British government forced him to take down this sign . Colt historian Herbert <unk> wrote that Colt championed the concept of modernism before the word was coined , he pioneered the use of celebrity endorsements to promote his products , he introduced the adjective " new and improved " to advertising and demonstrated the commercial value of brand @-@ name recognition as the word for " revolver " in French is Le Colt . Barbara M. Tucker , Professor of History and Director of the Center for Connecticut Studies at Eastern Connecticut State University , wrote that Colt 's marketing techniques transformed the firearm from a utilitarian object into a central symbol of American identity . Tucker added that Colt tied his revolvers to American patriotism , freedom and individualism while asserting America 's technological supremacy over Europe 's . 
 In 1867 , his widow , Elizabeth , had an Episcopal church designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter built as a memorial to Samuel Colt and the three children they lost . The church 's architecture contains guns and gun @-@ smithing tools sculpted in marble to commemorate Colt 's life as an arms maker . In 1896 a parish house was built on the site as a memorial to their son , Caldwell who died in 1894 . In 1975 the Church of the Good Shepherd and Parish House was listed in the National Register of Historic Places . 
 Colt set up libraries and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training grounds for several generations of <unk> and other machinists , who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century . Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt , Amos Whitney , Henry Leland , Edward Bullard , Worcester R. Warner , Charles Brinckerhoff Richards , William Mason and Ambrose Swasey . 
 In 2006 , Samuel Colt was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame . 
 = Prelude and Fugue on a Theme of Vittoria = 
 Prelude and Fugue on a Theme of Vittoria is a work for solo organ composed by Benjamin Britten in 1946 . It was commissioned for St Matthew 's Church , Northampton and first performed on 21 September 1946 , St Matthew 's Day , three days after its composition . It uses a theme from a motet by the Spanish composer Vittoria , both in the prelude ( where it is played repeatedly on the pedals ) and as the basis for the fugue . The piece , which lasts about five minutes in performance , has had a mixed reception . One writer has noted the difficulty on finding a suitable organ on which to perform the piece , given the difficulties in finding appropriate registration to meet Britten 's requirements . A reviewer of a concert performance in the 1960s called it " a contrived attempt to make bricks without straw " , although other commentators have been more favourable about the piece . 
 = = Background = = 
 The English composer Benjamin Britten was asked to write the Prelude and Fugue for St Matthew 's Church , Northampton . It was first performed there on St Matthew 's Day ( 21 September ) 1946 , three days after it was composed . There is a story that he wrote it in bed one morning before breakfast . Britten had previously been commissioned by the vicar of St Matthew 's , Walter Hussey , to write a cantata , Rejoice in the Lamb , for the church 's fiftieth anniversary in 1943 ; the organ accompaniment for the cantata used the organ in a " strikingly original way " . The Prelude and Fugue was one of two pieces based on themes by other composers that Britten wrote in 1946 ; the other was the Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra , which was based on a piece by Henry Purcell . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Both sections of the piece are based on a theme from a motet , Ecce <unk> magnus ( " Behold a great priest " ) , by the Spanish composer Tomás Luis de Victoria ( or " Vittoria " , 1548 – 1611 ) . The theme , which comes from a plainchant melody used in Vittoria 's day on the feast day of a saint and bishop , is nine notes long and does not range widely . The Prelude , which is in 42 time ( four minims to a bar ) , opens with a statement of the theme played on the pedals in <unk> ( five quavers played in the time of four ) , marked ff , ( fortissimo , " very loud " ) . The theme is repeated frequently in the pedals during the prelude , which is marked " <unk> " ( " broadly " ) . The prelude , which takes about one and a half minutes in performance , is thirteen bars long . 
 Vittoria 's theme is also used ( with little development ) as the subject of the fugue . This section is in 34 time ( three crochets to a bar ) and is marked " Andante con moto " ( " at a walking pace , with movement " ) . The fugue , which is mainly in four @-@ part writing with frequent rhythmic changes , gradually builds to a climax . In bar 69 , a new louder melody is added in the right hand against the fugue theme in the pedals . Gradually , the piece dies away to two parts and ppp ( <unk> , " very , very quietly " ) as the left and right hands play the fugue theme a bar apart from each other , in canon . The whole piece lasts about five minutes . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 The piece has had a mixed reception . Even one of its supporters says that " players do not seem to like it much " , despite it being written so that " the average parish organist might have a fair chance to play it . " 
 The American musician Luther Noss reviewed the piece upon its publication by Boosey & Hawkes in 1952 , stating that it was " well written for the organ " and " remarkably free " of some of the problems found in other modern organ music . He thought that it gave the impression of having been written with the organ in mind rather adapted from a piece intended for another instrument , unlike some other contemporary organ works . However , he commented that the theme provided little melodic or rhythmic interest and Britten used it , he thought , " not without a suggestion of monotony . " Although the theme is " not the stuff of which great music is made " , Noss remarked on the " exciting " pedal flourish at the opening of the piece , the attractive use of melody and harmony , and " grand crescendos and lingering <unk> " to keep the listener interested . Another early reviewer described it as " spacious " , with a " by no means academic " fugue and a style that " suggests a modern romantic composer 's appreciation of the more austere aspects of the classical organ school . " The review also noted that many of the accents marked in the piece " seem incapable of realization by any of the usual methods of suggesting accentuation of the organ . " 
 It was included in a concert at St Clement Danes , London , in November 1963 that honoured Britten 's fiftieth birthday with performances of some of his lesser @-@ known works . The review in The Times remarked favourably on the Te Deum in C and the Six Metamorphoses after Ovid for solo oboe . Of the organ piece , though , the critic said that it was " a contrived attempt to make bricks without straw . " 
 The organist Alan <unk> describes it as " excellent " and notes its " orthodox layout and textures " , in comparison to the organ writing of Rejoice in the Lamb and the Festival Te Deum ( 1944 ) . He regards the Prelude as " concise and majestic " and describes the ending as " touchingly serene " with a " charming canon " . The musicologist and Britten expert Philip Brett describes the piece ( without naming it ) in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians as a " slight organ work " . 
 The organist Timothy Bond disagrees with the piece 's " bad press " and the " dismissive " comments made about it by Brett and others . According to Bond , this " fresh and vital " work is " a finer , more accomplished piece than it sometimes sounds in performance . " He notes the difficulty of finding the best registration – no registration suggestions are given – and the best organ to perform the piece on , since it seems to require steady and considerable changes in volume without changes in the tone quality produced by the organ yet also demands neoclassical " brightness and clarity " , a combination of requirements that it is difficult for organs to meet . On the right organ , however , Bond says that the piece can sound " particularly striking " and " harmonically bold and telling , if occasionally gauche " , as it moves through passages that are " serene " , " creepy " , " vigorous " , " nostalgic " and finally " serene " , albeit with a " rather pedestrian " cadence .
