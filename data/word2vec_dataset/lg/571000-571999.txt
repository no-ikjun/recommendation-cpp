 Hickenbottom 's first marriage , to Theresa Wood , soon ended in an amicably settled divorce . He married Rebecca <unk> , a former WCW Nitro Girl known as Whisper , on March 31 , 1999 , at the Graceland Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas , Nevada . Only the couple and an Elvis impersonator were present . Their son , Cameron Kade , was born on January 15 , 2000 , and a daughter , Cheyenne , born on August 19 , 2004 followed . His cousin Matt Bentley is also a professional wrestler , having wrestled in TNA and WWE . 
 In 1996 , Hickenbottom posed for a non @-@ nude layout in Playgirl magazine . Only after he posed did he discover Playgirl has a mostly homosexual readership , for which some of his fellow wrestlers teased him . 
 He is ambidextrous , and had trouble differentiating between right and left , which affected his football games as a boy . He uses his right hand to draw and color and his left hand to write . He typically kicks with his right leg in Sweet Chin Music , but uses either arm for his signature elbow drop , depending on position . 
 Hickenbottom is a born @-@ again Christian . He was raised a Catholic , but became a non @-@ denominational Christian because of his wife . Following his conversion , his later ring attire often incorporated cross symbols and he often made a praying gesture on his knees during ring entrances . He was in the audience for a televised service of John Hagee 's Cornerstone Church in his hometown , San Antonio , where he is also a Bible teacher . In 2008 , he appeared on a Trinity Broadcasting Network program with fellow professional wrestler Sting .

 After weeks of having fun with Penguins fans on Twitter , the team officially invited Michaels for their Eastern Conference Finals Game 5 matchup with the Tampa Bay Lightning ( which consists of several wrestlers in its fanbase , including Hulk Hogan and Titus O 'Neil ) at Consol Energy Center , upon which Michaels accepted . Michaels meet with Penguins ' owner Mario Lemieux and sat with former Pittsburgh Steelers ' defensive lineman Brett Keisel during the game . Keisel also gave Michaels a tour of the city including at the Steelers headquarters and having lunch at <unk> Brothers in the city 's Strip District . The Penguins lost the game in overtime 4 @-@ 3 , but would go on to defeat the Lightning in the series and advance to the Stanley Cup Finals , eventually defeating the San Jose Sharks for the Stanley Cup . 
 Outside of his numerous appearances with WWE , it would not be Michaels first visit to Pittsburgh . In 2013 he appeared at the opening of the first Field & Stream store in suburban Cranberry Township .

 = Zinc oxide = 
 Zinc oxide is an inorganic compound with the formula ZnO . ZnO is a white powder that is insoluble in water , and it is widely used as an additive in numerous materials and products including rubbers , plastics , ceramics , glass , cement , lubricants , paints , ointments , adhesives , sealants , pigments , foods , batteries , ferrites , fire retardants , and first @-@ aid tapes . Although it occurs naturally as the mineral zincite , most zinc oxide is produced synthetically . 
 ZnO is a wide @-@ bandgap semiconductor of the II @-@ VI semiconductor group . The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n @-@ type . This semiconductor has several favorable properties , including good transparency , high electron mobility , wide bandgap , and strong room @-@ temperature luminescence . Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for : transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays , energy @-@ saving or heat @-@ protecting windows , and electronics as thin @-@ film transistors and light @-@ emitting diodes . 
 = = Chemical properties = = 
 Pure ZnO is a white powder , but in nature it occurs as the rare mineral zincite , which usually contains manganese and other impurities that confer a yellow to red color . 
 Crystalline zinc oxide is <unk> , changing from white to yellow when heated in air and reverting to white on cooling . This color change is caused by a small loss of oxygen to the environment at high temperatures to form the non @-@ stoichiometric <unk> + <unk> , where at 800 ° C , x = 0 @.@ <unk> . 
 Zinc oxide is an amphoteric oxide . It is nearly insoluble in water , but it is soluble in ( degraded by ) most acids , such as hydrochloric acid : 
 ZnO + 2 HCl → ZnCl2 + H2O 
 Bases also degrade the solid to give soluble <unk> : 
 ZnO + 2 NaOH + H2O → <unk> [ Zn ( OH ) 4 ] 
 ZnO reacts slowly with fatty acids in oils to produce the corresponding carboxylates , such as <unk> or stearate . ZnO forms cement @-@ like products when mixed with a strong aqueous solution of zinc chloride and these are best described as zinc hydroxy chlorides . This cement was used in dentistry . 
 ZnO also forms cement @-@ like material when treated with phosphoric acid ; related materials are used in dentistry . A major component of zinc phosphate cement produced by this reaction is <unk> , <unk> ( PO4 ) 2 · 4H2O . 
 ZnO decomposes into zinc vapor and oxygen at around 1975 ° C with a standard oxygen pressure . In a carbothermic reaction , heating with carbon converts the oxide into zinc vapor at a much lower temperature ( around 950 ° C ) . 
 ZnO + C → Zn ( Vapor ) + CO 
 Zinc oxide can react violently with aluminium and magnesium powders , with chlorinated rubber and linseed oil on heating causing fire and explosion hazard . 
 It reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give zinc sulfide . This reaction is used commercially . 
 ZnO + H2S → ZnS + H2O 
 = = Physical properties = = 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Zinc oxide crystallizes in two main forms , hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zincblende . The wurtzite structure is most stable at ambient conditions and thus most common . The zincblende form can be stabilized by growing ZnO on substrates with cubic lattice structure . In both cases , the zinc and oxide centers are tetrahedral , the most characteristic geometry for Zn ( II ) . ZnO converts to the rocksalt motif at relatively high pressures about 10 GPa . 
 Hexagonal and zincblende polymorphs have no inversion symmetry ( reflection of a crystal relative to any given point does not transform it into itself ) . This and other lattice symmetry properties result in piezoelectricity of the hexagonal and zincblende ZnO , and <unk> of hexagonal ZnO . 
 The hexagonal structure has a point group 6 mm ( Hermann @-@ <unk> notation ) or <unk> ( <unk> notation ) , and the space group is <unk> or <unk> . The lattice constants are a 
 = 3 @.@ 25 Å and c = 
 5 @.@ 2 Å ; their ratio c / a ~ 1 @.@ 60 is close to the ideal value for hexagonal cell c / a = 1 @.@ 633 . As in most group II @-@ VI materials , the bonding in ZnO is largely ionic ( Zn2 + – O2 − ) with the corresponding radii of 0 @.@ 074 nm for Zn2 + and 0 @.@ 140 nm for O2 − . This property accounts for the preferential formation of wurtzite rather than zinc blende structure , as well as the strong piezoelectricity of ZnO . Because of the polar Zn @-@ O bonds , zinc and oxygen planes are electrically charged . To maintain electrical neutrality , those planes reconstruct at atomic level in most relative materials , but not in ZnO – its surfaces are atomically flat , stable and exhibit no reconstruction . This anomaly of ZnO is not fully explained . 
 = = = Mechanical properties = = = 
 ZnO is a relatively soft material with approximate hardness of 4 @.@ 5 on the Mohs scale . Its elastic constants are smaller than those of relevant III @-@ V semiconductors , such as GaN . The high heat capacity and heat conductivity , low thermal expansion and high melting temperature of ZnO are beneficial for ceramics . ZnO exhibits a very long lived optical phonon E2 ( low ) with a lifetime as high as 133 ps at 10 K. 
 Among the tetrahedrally bonded semiconductors , it has been stated that ZnO has the highest piezoelectric tensor , or at least one comparable to that of GaN and <unk> . This property makes it a technologically important material for many <unk> applications , which require a large electromechanical coupling . 
 = = = Electrical properties = = = 
 ZnO has a relatively large direct band gap of ~ 3 @.@ 3 eV at room temperature . Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages , ability to sustain large electric fields , lower electronic noise , and high @-@ temperature and high @-@ power operation . The bandgap of ZnO can further be tuned to ~ 3 – 4 eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide . 
 Most ZnO has n @-@ type character , even in the absence of intentional doping . <unk> is typically the origin of n @-@ type character , but the subject remains controversial . An alternative explanation has been proposed , based on theoretical calculations , that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible . <unk> n @-@ type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group @-@ III elements such as Al , Ga , In or by substituting oxygen with group @-@ VII elements chlorine or iodine . 
 Reliable p @-@ type doping of ZnO remains difficult . This problem originates from low solubility of p @-@ type dopants and their compensation by abundant n @-@ type impurities . This problem is observed with GaN and ZnSe . Measurement of p @-@ type in " intrinsically " n @-@ type material is complicated by the inhomogeneity of samples . 
 Current limitations to p @-@ doping limit electronic and optoelectronic applications of ZnO , which usually require junctions of n @-@ type and p @-@ type material . Known p @-@ type dopants include group @-@ I elements Li , Na , K ; group @-@ V elements N , P and As ; as well as copper and silver . However , many of these form deep acceptors and do not produce significant p @-@ type conduction at room temperature . 
 Electron mobility of ZnO strongly varies with temperature and has a maximum of ~ 2000 cm2 / ( V · s ) at 80 K. Data on hole mobility are scarce with values in the range 5 – 30 cm2 / ( V · s ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 For industrial use , ZnO is produced at levels of 105 tons per year by three main processes : 
 = = = Indirect process = = = 
 In the indirect or French process , metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907 ° C ( typically around 1000 ° C ) . Zinc vapor reacts with the oxygen in the air to give ZnO , accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence . Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house . This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire ( France ) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process . Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0 @.@ 1 to a few micrometers . By weight , most of the world 's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process . 
 = = = Direct process = = = 
 The direct or American process starts with diverse contaminated zinc composites , such as zinc ores or smelter by @-@ products . The zinc precursors are reduced ( carbothermal reduction ) by heating with a source of carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor , which is then oxidized as in the indirect process . Because of the lower purity of the source material , the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process as compared to the indirect one . 
 = = = Wet chemical process = = = 
 A small amount of industrial production involves wet chemical processes , which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts , from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated . The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800 ° C. 
 = = = Laboratory synthesis = = = 
 Numerous specialised methods exist for producing ZnO for scientific studies and niche applications . These methods can be classified by the resulting ZnO form ( bulk , thin film , nanowire ) , temperature ( " low " , that is close to room temperature or " high " , that is T ~ 1000 ° C ) , process type ( vapor deposition or growth from solution ) and other parameters . 
 Large single crystals ( many cubic centimeters ) can be grown by the gas transport ( vapor @-@ phase deposition ) , hydrothermal synthesis , or melt growth . However , because of high vapor pressure of ZnO , growth from the melt is problematic . Growth by gas transport is difficult to control , leaving the hydrothermal method as a preference . Thin films can be produced by chemical vapor deposition , <unk> vapour phase epitaxy , electrodeposition , pulsed laser deposition , sputtering , sol @-@ gel synthesis , atomic layer deposition , spray pyrolysis , etc . 
 Ordinary white powdered zinc oxide can be produced in the laboratory by <unk> a solution of sodium bicarbonate with a zinc anode . Zinc hydroxide and hydrogen gas are produced . The zinc hydroxide upon heating decomposes to zinc oxide . 
 Zn + 2 H2O → Zn ( OH ) 2 + H2 
 Zn ( OH ) 2 → ZnO + H2O 
 = = = ZnO nanostructures = = = 
 Nanostructures of ZnO can be synthesized into a variety of morphologies including nanowires , nanorods , tetrapods , <unk> , <unk> , nanoparticles etc . Nanostructures can be obtained with most above @-@ mentioned techniques , at certain conditions , and also with the vapor @-@ liquid @-@ solid method . The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90 ° C , in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and <unk> , the latter providing the basic environment . Certain additives , such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine , can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO nanowires . Doping of the ZnO nanowires has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution . The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition ( such as the zinc concentration and pH ) or to the thermal treatment ( such as the temperature and heating rate ) . 
 Aligned ZnO nanowires on pre @-@ seeded silicon , glass , and gallium nitride substrates have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments . Pre @-@ seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis . Common pre @-@ seeding methods include in @-@ situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites , <unk> of ZnO nanoparticles and the use of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films . Pre @-@ seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and <unk> lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth . Aligned ZnO nanowires can be used in dye @-@ sensitized solar cells and field emission devices . 
 = = History = = 
 Zinc compounds were probably used by early humans , in processed and unprocessed forms , as a paint or medicinal ointment , but their composition is uncertain . The use of <unk> , probably zinc oxide , as a salve for eyes and open wounds , is mentioned in the Indian medical text the Charaka Samhita , thought to date from 500 BC or before . Zinc oxide ointment is also mentioned by the Greek physician Dioscorides ( 1st century AD . ) Avicenna mentions zinc oxide in The Canon of Medicine ( 1025 AD ) , which mentioned it as a preferred treatment for a variety of skin conditions , including skin cancer . Though it is no longer used for treating skin cancer , it is still widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions , in products such as baby powder and creams against diaper rashes , calamine cream , anti @-@ dandruff shampoos , and antiseptic ointments . 
 The Romans produced considerable quantities of brass ( an alloy of zinc and copper ) as early as 200 BC by a cementation process where copper was reacted with zinc oxide . The zinc oxide is thought to have been produced by heating zinc ore in a shaft furnace . This liberated metallic zinc as a vapor , which then ascended the flue and condensed as the oxide . This process was described by Dioscorides in the 1st century AD . Zinc oxide has also been recovered from zinc mines at Zawar in India , dating from the second half of the first millennium BC . This was presumably also made in the same way and used to produce brass . 
 From the 12th to the 16th century zinc and zinc oxide were recognized and produced in India using a primitive form of the direct synthesis process . From India , zinc manufacture moved to China in the 17th century . In 1743 , the first European zinc smelter was established in Bristol , United Kingdom . 
 The main usage of zinc oxide ( zinc white ) was in paints and as an additive to ointments . Zinc white was accepted as a pigment in oil paintings by 1834 but it did not mix well with oil . This problem was solved by optimizing the synthesis of ZnO . In 1845 , LeClaire in Paris was producing the oil paint on a large scale , and by 1850 , zinc white was being manufactured throughout Europe . The success of zinc white paint was due to its advantages over the traditional white lead : zinc white is essentially permanent in sunlight , it is not blackened by sulfur @-@ bearing air , it is non @-@ toxic and more economical . Because zinc white is so " clean " it is valuable for making tints with other colors , but it makes a rather brittle dry film when unmixed with other colors . For example , during the late 1890s and early 1900s , some artists used zinc white as a ground for their oil paintings . All those paintings developed cracks over the years . 
 In recent times , most zinc oxide was used in the rubber industry to resist corrosion . In the 1970s , the second largest application of ZnO was photocopying . High @-@ quality ZnO produced by the " French process " was added to photocopying paper as a filler . This application was soon displaced by titanium . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The applications of zinc oxide powder are numerous , and the principal ones are summarized below . Most applications exploit the reactivity of the oxide as a precursor to other zinc compounds . For material science applications , zinc oxide has high refractive index , high thermal conductivity , binding , antibacterial and UV @-@ protection properties . Consequently , it is added into materials and products including plastics , ceramics , glass , cement , rubber , lubricants , paints , ointments , adhesive , sealants , concrete manufacturing , pigments , foods , batteries , ferrites , fire retardants , etc . 
 = = = Rubber manufacture = = = 
 Between 50 % and 60 % of ZnO use is in the rubber industry . Zinc oxide along with stearic acid is used in the vulcanization of rubber ZnO additive also protect rubber from fungi ( see medical applications ) and UV light . 
 = = = Ceramic industry = = = 
 Ceramic industry consumes a significant amount of zinc oxide , in particular in ceramic glaze and frit compositions . The relatively high heat capacity , thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low <unk> of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics . ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes , enamels , and ceramic formulations . Zinc oxide as a low expansion , secondary <unk> improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent <unk> and shivering . By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO , the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased . Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces . However , in moderate to high amounts , it produces matte and crystalline surfaces . With regard to color , zinc has a complicated <unk> . 
 = = = Medicine = = = 
 Zinc oxide as a mixture with about 0 @.@ 5 % iron ( III ) oxide ( Fe2O3 ) is called calamine and is used in calamine lotion . Two minerals , zincite and <unk> , have been historically called calamine . When mixed with eugenol , a ligand , zinc oxide eugenol is formed , which has applications as a restorative and <unk> in dentistry . 
 Reflecting the basic properties of ZnO , fine particles of the oxide have <unk> and antibacterial properties and for that reason are added into materials including cotton fabric , rubber , oral care products , and food packaging . Enhanced antibacterial action of fine particles compared to bulk material is not exclusive to ZnO and is observed for other materials , such as silver . This property results from the increased surface area of the fine particles . 
 Zinc oxide is widely used to treat a variety of other skin conditions , in products such as baby powder and barrier creams to treat diaper rashes , calamine cream , anti @-@ dandruff shampoos , and antiseptic ointments . It is also a component in tape ( called " zinc oxide tape " ) used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts . 
 Zinc oxide can be used in ointments , creams , and lotions to protect against sunburn and other damage to the skin caused by ultraviolet light ( see sunscreen ) . It is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB reflector that is approved for use as a sunscreen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , and is completely <unk> . When used as an ingredient in sunscreen , zinc oxide blocks both UVA ( 320 – 400 nm ) and UVB ( 280 – 320 nm ) rays of ultraviolet light . Zinc oxide and the other most common physical sunscreen , titanium dioxide , are considered to be <unk> , <unk> , and non @-@ <unk> . Zinc from zinc oxide is , however , slightly absorbed into the skin 
 Many sunscreens use nanoparticles of zinc oxide ( along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide ) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore do not appear white . There has been concern that they might be absorbed into the skin . A study published in 2010 found a 0 @.@ 23 % to 1 @.@ 31 % ( mean 0 @.@ 42 % ) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days , and traces were also found in urine samples . In contrast , a comprehensive review of the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption can be found in the literature . 
 Zinc oxide nanoparticles can enhance the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin . It has been shown that nano ZnO which has the average size between 20 nm and 45 nm can enhance the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro . The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains . This effect may be due to two reasons . First , zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with <unk> protein , which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the <unk> of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell . Second , zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with <unk> protein , which is responsible for the permeation of quinolones into the cell . 
 = = = Cigarette filters = = = 
 Zinc oxide is a constituent of cigarette filters . A filter consisting of charcoal impregnated with zinc oxide and iron oxide removes significant amounts of hydrogen cyanide ( HCN ) and hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) from tobacco smoke without affecting its flavor . 
 = = = Food additive = = = 
 Zinc oxide is added to many food products , including breakfast cereals , as a source of zinc , a necessary nutrient . ( Zinc sulfate is also used for the same purpose . ) Some prepackaged foods also include trace amounts of ZnO even if it is not intended as a nutrient . 
 Zinc oxide was linked to dioxin contamination in pork exports in the 2008 Chilean pork crisis . The contamination was found to be due to dioxin contaminated zinc oxide used in pig feed . 
 = = = Pigment = = = 
 Zinc white is used as a pigment in paints and is more opaque than <unk> , but less opaque than titanium dioxide . It is also used in coatings for paper . Chinese white is a special grade of zinc white used in artists ' pigments . The use of zinc white ( zinc oxide ) as a pigment in oil painting started in the middle of 18th century . It has partly replaced the poisonous lead white and was used by painters such as Böcklin , Van Gogh , Manet , Munch and others . It is also a main ingredient of mineral makeup ( CI <unk> ) . 
 = = = UV absorber = = = 
 <unk> and nano @-@ scale zinc oxide and titanium dioxide provide strong protection against UVA ultraviolet radiation , and are used in suntan lotion , and also in UV @-@ blocking sunglasses for use in space and for protection when welding , following research by scientists at Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) . 
 = = = Coatings = = = 
 Paints containing zinc oxide powder have long been utilized as <unk> coatings for metals . They are especially effective for galvanized iron . Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion . Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years . 
 ZnO highly n @-@ type doped with Al , Ga , or In is transparent and conductive ( transparency ~ 90 % , lowest resistivity ~ 10 − 4 Ω · cm ) . ZnO : Al coatings are used for energy @-@ saving or heat @-@ protecting windows . The coating lets the visible part of the spectrum in but either reflects the infrared ( IR ) radiation back into the room ( energy saving ) or does not let the IR radiation into the room ( heat protection ) , depending on which side of the window has the coating . 
 Plastics , such as polyethylene <unk> ( PEN ) , can be protected by applying zinc oxide coating . The coating reduces the diffusion of oxygen with PEN . Zinc oxide layers can also be used on polycarbonate ( PC ) in outdoor applications . The coating protects PC from solar radiation and decreases the oxidation rate and photo @-@ yellowing of PC . 
 = = = Corrosion prevention in nuclear reactors = = = 
 Zinc oxide depleted in 64Zn ( the zinc isotope with atomic mass 64 ) is used in corrosion prevention in nuclear pressurized water reactors . The depletion is necessary , because 64Zn is transformed into radioactive 65Zn under irradiation by the reactor neutrons . 
 = = = Methane reforming = = = 
 Zinc oxide ( ZnO ) is used as a pretreatment step to remove hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) from natural gas following hydrogenation of any sulfur compounds prior to a methane reformer , which can poison the catalyst . At temperatures between about 230 – 430 ° C ( 446 – 806 ° F ) , H2S is converted to water by the following reaction : 
 H2S + ZnO → H2O + ZnS 
 The zinc sulfide ( ZnS ) is replaced with fresh zinc oxide when the zinc oxide has been consumed .

 ZnO has wide direct band gap ( 3 @.@ 37 eV or 375 nm at room temperature ) . Therefore , its most common potential applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes ( LEDs ) . Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN , which has a similar bandgap ( ~ 3 @.@ 4 eV at room temperature ) . Compared to GaN , ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy ( ~ 60 meV , 2 @.@ 4 times of the room @-@ temperature thermal energy ) , which results in bright room @-@ temperature emission from ZnO . ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED @-@ applications . For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light <unk> . Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high @-@ energy radiation and to wet chemical etching . Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications . ZnO is the most promising candidate in the field of random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source . 
 The pointed tips of ZnO nanorods result in a strong enhancement of an electric field . Therefore , they can be used as field emitters . 
 Aluminium @-@ doped ZnO layers are used as a transparent electrodes . The constituents Zn and Al are much cheaper and less toxic compared to the generally used indium tin oxide ( ITO ) . One application which has begun to be commercially available is the use of ZnO as the front contact for solar cells or of liquid crystal displays . 
 Transparent thin @-@ film transistors ( <unk> ) can be produced with ZnO . As field @-@ effect transistors , they even may not need a p – n junction , thus avoiding the p @-@ type doping problem of ZnO . Some of the field @-@ effect transistors even use ZnO nanorods as conducting channels . 
 = = = Zinc oxide nanorod sensor = = = 
 Zinc oxide nanorod sensors are devices detecting changes in electric current passing through zinc oxide nanowires due to adsorption of gas molecules . Selectivity to hydrogen gas was achieved by sputtering Pd clusters on the nanorod surface . The addition of Pd appears to be effective in the catalytic dissociation of hydrogen molecules into atomic hydrogen , increasing the sensitivity of the sensor device . The sensor detects hydrogen concentrations down to 10 parts per million at room temperature , whereas there is no response to oxygen .

 ZnO has also been considered for spintronics applications : if doped with 1 – 10 % of magnetic ions ( Mn , Fe , Co , V , etc . ) , ZnO could become ferromagnetic , even at room temperature . Such room temperature ferromagnetism in ZnO : Mn has been observed , but it is not clear yet whether it originates from the matrix itself or from secondary oxide phases .

 The piezoelectricity in textile fibers coated in ZnO have been shown capable of fabricating " self @-@ powered <unk> " with everyday mechanical stress from wind or body movements . 
 In 2008 the Center for <unk> Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology reported producing an electricity generating device ( called flexible charge pump generator ) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide nanowires . This mini @-@ generator creates an oscillating voltage up to 45 <unk> , converting close to seven percent of the applied mechanical energy into electricity . Researchers used wires with lengths of 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 mm and diameters of three to five micrometers , but the device could be scaled down to smaller size . 
 = = Safety = = 
 As a food additive , zinc oxide is on the U.S. FDA 's list of generally recognized as safe , or GRAS , substances . 
 Zinc oxide itself is non @-@ toxic ; however it is hazardous to inhale zinc oxide fumes , as generated when zinc or zinc alloys are melted and oxidized at high temperature . This problem occurs while melting brass because the melting point of brass is close to the boiling point of zinc . Exposure to zinc oxide in the air , which also occurs while welding galvanized ( zinc plated ) steel , can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever . For this reason , typically galvanized steel is not welded , or the zinc is removed first .

 = Methoxyflurane = 
 Methoxyflurane ( INN ) , formerly marketed as <unk> by Abbott Laboratories , is a halogenated ether that was in clinical use as a volatile inhalational anesthetic from its introduction by Joseph F. <unk> et al in 1960 until the late 1970s . It was first synthesized in the late 1940s by William T. Miller and his team of chemists following their involvement in the Manhattan Project . 
 Methoxyflurane is an extremely potent and highly lipid @-@ soluble anesthetic agent , characterized by very slow induction ( onset of action ) and emergence ( offset or dissipation ) times . It is non @-@ flammable , has relatively mild hemodynamic effects , and it does not predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances . It is , however , a significant respiratory depressant . Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic ( pain @-@ relieving ) properties at well below full anesthetic doses . It was utilized in self @-@ administration devices for obstetric analgesia , in a manner that foreshadowed the patient @-@ controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today . 
 The biodegradation of methoxyflurane produces inorganic fluoride and dichloroacetic acid ( DCAA ) . The combined effects of these two compounds may be responsible for the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body . Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic ( damaging to the kidneys ) in a dose @-@ dependent response and <unk> ( damaging to the liver ) at anesthetic doses in 1973 , and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s . In 1999 , the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada , and on September 6 , 2005 , the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns . It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma , as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people . 
 = = Medical use = = 
 Methoxyflurane has been extensively used since the 1970s in Australia as an emergency analgesic for short @-@ term use , mostly by the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces , and the Australian ambulance services . The drug is currently only available from one manufacturer ( Medical Developments International , Melbourne , Victoria , Australia ) . It is self @-@ administered to children and adults using the Penthrox inhaler , a hand @-@ held inhaler device , known as " the green whistle " . A non @-@ opioid alternative to morphine , it is also easier to use than nitrous oxide . As of 2010 , methoxyflurane was listed under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma , as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for patient transport . A portable , disposable , single @-@ use inhaler device ( the Penthrox inhaler ) , along with a single 3 milliliter brown glass vial of methoxyflurane is provided in doctor 's kits that allows conscious <unk> stable patients ( including children over the age of 5 years ) to self @-@ administer the drug , under supervision . The device is often referred to as the " green whistle " , due to its appearance . 
 Each 3 milliliter dose lasts approximately 30 minutes . Pain relief begins after 6 – 8 breaths and continues for several minutes after stopping inhalation . The maximum recommended dose is 6 milliliters per day or 15 milliliters per week because of the risk of cumulative dose @-@ related nephrotoxicity , and it should not be used on consecutive days . Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses , no significant adverse effects have been reported in the literature when it is used at the lower doses ( up to 6 milliliters ) used for producing analgesia and sedation . Due to the risk of organ ( especially renal ) toxicity , methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre @-@ existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus , and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme @-@ inducing drugs . 
 = = Chemical and physical properties = = 
 With a molecular formula of <unk> and a condensed structural formula of <unk> , the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC ) name for methoxyflurane is 2 @,@ 2 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @,@ 1 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @-@ <unk> . It is a halogenated ether in form of a clear , colorless liquid , and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma . It is miscible with ethanol , acetone , chloroform , diethyl ether , and fixed oils . It is soluble in rubber . 
 With a minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) of 0 @.@ 2 % , methoxyflurane is an extremely potent anesthetic agent . It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations . Because of its low volatility and very high boiling point ( 104 @.@ 8 ° C at 1 atmosphere ) , methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure . It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers . 
 The carbon – fluorine bond , a component of all organofluorine compounds , is the strongest chemical bond in organic chemistry . Furthermore , this bond becomes <unk> and stronger as more fluorine atoms are added to the same carbon on a given molecule . Because of this , <unk> are some of the most chemically stable organic compounds . 
 = = Pharmacokinetics = = 
 Methoxyflurane has a very high lipid solubility ( oil : gas partition coefficient of around 950 ) , which gives it very slow pharmacokinetics ( induction and emergence characteristics ) ; this being undesirable for routine application in the clinical setting . Initial studies performed in 1961 revealed that in <unk> healthy individuals , induction of general anesthesia with methoxyflurane @-@ oxygen alone or with nitrous oxide was difficult or even impossible using the vaporizers available at that time . It was found to be necessary to administer an intravenous anesthetic agent such as sodium <unk> to ensure a smooth and rapid induction . It was further found that after <unk> induction , it was necessary to administer nitrous oxide for at least ten minutes before a sufficient amount of methoxyflurane could accumulate in the bloodstream to ensure an adequate level of anesthesia . This was despite using high flow ( liters / minute ) of nitrous oxide and oxygen , and with the vaporizers delivering the maximum possible concentration of methoxyflurane . 
 Similar to its induction pharmacokinetics , methoxyflurane has very slow and somewhat unpredictable emergence characteristics . During initial clinical studies in 1961 , the average time to emergence after discontinuation of methoxyflurane was 59 minutes after administration of methoxyflurane for an average duration of 87 minutes . The longest time to emergence was 285 minutes , after 165 minutes of methoxyflurane administration . 
 = = Pharmacodynamics = = 
 Cardiovascular effects 
 The effects of methoxyflurane on the circulatory system resemble those of diethyl ether . In dogs , methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate , and no significant effect on blood sugar , epinephrine , or norepinephrine . Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ( PaCO2 ) both induce further decreases in blood pressure , as well as increases in blood glucose , epinephrine and norepinephrine . In humans , methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure , but cardiac output , stroke volume , and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed . Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible , and it does not predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias . 
 Respiratory effects 
 Unlike diethyl ether , methoxyflurane is a significant respiratory depressant . In dogs , methoxyflurane causes a dose @-@ dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume , with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume . In humans , methoxyflurane causes a dose @-@ dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume , with respiratory rate relatively constant . The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression , as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH ( this is referred to as a respiratory acidosis ) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time . 
 Gastrointestinal effects 
 In a series of 500 consecutive obstetric patients , <unk> and <unk> observed vomiting in 12 ( 4 @.@ 8 % ) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia . These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane ( 42 % ) , <unk> ( 28 % ) and halothane ( 4 @.@ 6 % ) . In another study of 645 obstetric patients , <unk> and Korman observed 8 cases ( 1 @.@ 2 % ) of postoperative vomiting , one of whom was retching before the administration of the anesthetic . 
 <unk> effects 
 Although the high blood solubility of methoxyflurane is often undesirable , this property makes it useful in certain situations — it persists in the lipid compartment of the body for a long time , providing sedation and analgesia well into the postoperative period . There is substantial data to indicate that methoxyflurane is an effective analgesic and sedative agent at <unk> doses . Supervised self @-@ administration of methoxyflurane in children and adults can briefly lead to deep sedation , and it has been used as a patient controlled analgesic for painful procedures in children in hospital emergency departments . During childbirth , administration of methoxyflurane produces significantly better analgesia , less psychomotor agitation , and only slightly more somnolence than <unk> . 
 In 1968 , Robert Wexler of Abbott Laboratories developed the Analgizer , a disposable inhaler that allowed the self @-@ administration of methoxyflurane vapor in air for analgesia . The Analgizer consisted of a polyethylene cylinder 5 inches long and 1 inch in diameter with a 1 inch long mouthpiece . The device contained a rolled wick of polypropylene felt which held 15 milliliters of methoxyflurane . Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane , it was easy for patients to self @-@ administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours . The 15 milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours , during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain ; the device could be refilled if necessary . The Analgizer was found to be safe , effective , and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth , as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations , and for dressing changes on burn patients . When used for labor analgesia , the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on <unk> scores . All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients , newborns , and injured patients . The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s , in a manner that foreshadowed the patient @-@ controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today . The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974 , but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler . Trials of methoxyflurane as an analgesic in emergency medicine are going on in the UK . 
 = = <unk> and toxicity = = 
 The first report of nephrotoxicity appeared in 1964 , when Paddock and colleagues reported three cases of acute renal insufficiency , two of whom were found to have calcium oxalate crystals in the renal tubules at autopsy . In 1966 , Crandell and colleagues reported a series in which 17 / 95 ( 18 % ) of patients developed an unusual type of nephropathy after operations in which methoxyflurane was used as a general anesthetic . This particular type of renal insufficiency was characterized by vasopressin @-@ resistant high @-@ output renal failure ( production of large volumes of poorly concentrated urine ) with a negative fluid balance , pronounced weight loss , elevation of serum sodium , chloride , osmolality and blood urea nitrogen . The urine of these patients was of a relatively fixed specific gravity and an osmolality very similar to that of the serum . Furthermore , the high urine output persisted a challenge test of fluid deprivation . Most cases resolved within 2 – 3 weeks , but evidence of renal dysfunction persisted for more than one year in 3 of these 17 cases ( 18 % ) , and more than two years in one case ( 6 % ) . 
 Reports of severe and even fatal hepatotoxicity related to the use of methoxyflurane began to appear in 1966 . These reports prompted anesthesiologists to subject this agent to intense and systematic scrutiny . A study published in 1973 by Cousins and <unk> demonstrated that compared with halothane , methoxyflurane produces dose @-@ dependent and deleterious abnormalities in renal function . The authors showed that subclinical nephrotoxicity occurred following methoxyflurane at minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC ) for 2 @.@ 5 to 3 hours ( 2 @.@ 5 to 3 MAC hours ) , while overt toxicity was present in all patients at dosages greater than five MAC hours . This landmark study provided a model that would be used for the assessment of the nephrotoxicity of volatile anesthetics for the next two decades . 
 The biodegradation of methoxyflurane begins immediately after the onset of exposure . The kidney and liver toxicity observed after anesthetic doses is attributable to one or more metabolites produced by O @-@ demethylation of methoxyflurane . Significant products of this catabolic process include <unk> acid ( <unk> ) , dichloroacetic acid ( DCAA ) , and inorganic fluoride . Methoxyflurane nephrotoxicity is dose dependent and irreversible , resulting from O @-@ demethylation of methoxyflurane to fluoride and DCAA . This effect is so predictable and reproducible that methoxyflurane now serves as a pharmacologic model of fluoride @-@ related nephrotoxicity , one with which newer drugs are compared . It is not entirely clear whether the fluoride itself is toxic — it may simply be a surrogate measure for some other toxic metabolite . The concurrent formation of inorganic fluoride and DCAA is unique to methoxyflurane <unk> compared with other volatile anesthetics , and this combination is more toxic than fluoride alone . This may explain why fluoride formation from methoxyflurane is associated with nephrotoxicity , while fluoride formation from other volatile anesthetics ( such as <unk> and sevoflurane ) is not . Furthermore , the concurrent use of tetracyclines and methoxyflurane has been reported to result in fatal renal toxicity . 
 Based on the findings of these and other studies in the early 1970s , the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals , in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then , only at dosages less than 2 @.@ 5 MAC hours . Partly because of these warnings , but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as <unk> , <unk> , desflurane and sevoflurane , the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health maintains a recommended exposure limit for methoxyflurane as waste anesthetic gas of 2 ppm ( 13 @.@ 5 mg / m3 ) over 60 minutes . 
 = = History = = 
 All of the currently used volatile anesthetic agents are organofluorine compounds . Aside from the synthesis of Freon ( Thomas Midgley , Jr. and Charles F. Kettering , 1928 ) and the discovery of Teflon ( Roy J. Plunkett , 1938 ) , the field of organofluorine chemistry had not attracted a great deal of attention up to 1940 because of the extreme reactivity of elemental fluorine , which had to be produced in situ for use in chemical reactions . The development of organofluorine chemistry was a spin @-@ off from the Manhattan Project , during which elemental fluorine was produced on an industrial scale for the first time . 
 The need for fluorine arose from the need to separate the <unk> from 238U because the former , present in natural uranium at a concentration of less than 1 % is fissile ( capable of sustaining a nuclear chain reaction of nuclear fission with thermal neutrons ) , whereas the latter is not . Members of the MAUD Committee ( especially Francis Simon and Nicholas Kurti ) proposed the use of gaseous diffusion for isotope separation , since , according to Graham 's law the rate of diffusion is inversely proportional to molecular mass . After an extensive search , uranium hexafluoride , UF6 , was determined to be the most suitable compound of uranium to be used for the gaseous diffusion process . Elemental fluorine is needed in the production of UF6 . 
 Significant obstacles had to be overcome in the handling of both fluorine and UF6 . Before the K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built , it was first necessary to develop non @-@ reactive chemical compounds that could be used as coatings , lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas ( a highly reactive and corrosive substance ) . William T. Miller , professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University , was co @-@ opted to develop such materials , because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry . Miller and his team developed several novel non @-@ reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application . 
 Charles Suckling synthesized halothane in 1951 . <unk> was the first organofluorine anesthetic agent to be introduced into clinical practice in 1956 . Miller and his team continued to develop organofluorine chemistry after the end of World War II and methoxyflurane was synthesized in 1948 .

 " The List " is the fifth episode of the third season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files television series . It was first broadcast in the United States on the Fox network on October 20 , 1995 . " The List " was written and directed by series creator Chris Carter . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the series ' larger mythology . " The List " received a Nielson household rating of 10 @.@ 8 , being watched by 16 @.@ 72 million people on its initial broadcast , and received mixed to positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate a case where a death row inmate declares that he will be reincarnated and that as a result five men will die . 
 " The List " was written and directed by Carter after the success of the second season entry " Duane Barry " . The art department of The X @-@ Files were tasked with creating a death row set quickly , a feat which eventually caused the episode to go over budget . Several sequences necessitated the use of real maggots , a turn of events that was not popular with the cast , most notably with Anderson . " The List " later was nominated — and won — several International Monitor Awards . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Napoleon " Neech " Manley ( <unk> <unk> ) , a death row inmate at a Florida prison , is brought to the electric chair . Before he is executed , Neech proclaims that he will be reincarnated and avenge himself against five men who tormented him in prison . 
 Shortly after the execution , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are brought in to investigate when a prison guard is mysteriously found dead in Neech 's cell . The agents meet the prison 's warden , Brodeur ( J. T. Walsh ) , who believes that Neech planned the guard 's murder with someone on the outside before the execution . John Speranza , another inmate , believes that Neech has returned . When Scully explores the prison 's showers , she meets another guard named Vincent Parmelly ( Ken Foree ) . He claims that another prisoner , Roque ( <unk> Woodbine ) , is keeping a list of the remaining four victims . 
 Later , the head of another guard , Fornier , is found inside a paint can . An examination of the head shows the premature appearance of larvae . The prison coroner tells Scully that the first guard 's lungs were completely infested with the larvae , belonging to the green bottle fly . Meanwhile , Mulder talks to Roque , who wants a transfer out of the prison in exchange for revealing the remaining three people on the list . Brodeur later finds Fornier 's headless body in his office . While searching Neech 's cell , Mulder discovers evidence of his obsession with reincarnation . Scully , of course , is skeptical . They later talk to Neech 's fearful widow , Danielle Manley ( April Grace ) , who is secretly seeing Parmelly . Roque is brought to the showers , where he is beaten to death by Brodeur after revealing he is the fifth person on the list . 
 Brodeur puts the prison under lockdown and tells Mulder that Neech had a violent history with all three victims . Mulder believes that Neech came back for revenge against the guards , but doubts that Roque was on the list . He requests that he be provided with the name of Neech 's executioner , who turns out to be a volunteer named Perry Simon . The agents arrive at Simon 's home to discover his decomposing body in the attic . Mulder confronts Speranza about the list , but Speranza only tells him that Roque was not on it . He claims to have seen Neech " big as life " outside of his cell . Based on phone records , Scully theorizes that Neech 's lawyer , Danny Charez , may have engineered the murders with Speranza . The agents interview Charez , who tells them about Danielle 's relationship with Parmelly ; after they leave , Charez is suffocated by a resurrected Neech . 
 Brodeur visits Speranza in his cell , and offers to have his death sentence commuted in exchange for stopping the murders . Speranza takes the offer . That night , Parmelly visits Danielle , who has become agitated since Mulder and Scully have begun staking out her house . The agents now suspect Parmelly to be behind the murders and leave to notify Brodeur , who asks that Parmelly be arrested . Soon afterward , Danielle wakes up to see Neech by her bed . She grabs her gun and confronts Parmelly , thinking he is Neech 's resurrected form . The agents and a police task force arrive to see her shoot and kill Parmelly . Meanwhile , Brodeur — assuming that Charez and Parmelly were on the list — thinks Speranza has reneged on their deal and has him taken to the showers . Before Brodeur kills him , Speranza claims that one person remains on the list . 
 Parmelly is blamed for the murders . The agents start to leave Florida , but Mulder soon pulls over . He remains frustrated , since Parmelly was on @-@ duty during only one murder , and was not one of the three men who knew Perry Simon 's confidential identity . He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque , who was also assumed to be part of the plot . Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths , and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to enact his revenge . However , Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over , and that they should return home . Just then , Brodeur passes them in his car . Looking in his rear view mirror , he sees Neech , who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree , claiming his last victim . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written and directed by series creator Chris Carter , his second directorial endeavor after the second season entry " Duane Barry " . The art department of The X @-@ Files were tasked with creating a " convincing " death row set " out of thin air " . The set took 10 days to build , making it one of the most complicated jobs for the show 's staff during the season . Due to the construction of the prison set , the episode ended up going over budget . However , the set was used again later in the season in " Teso Dos Bichos " and " Talitha Cumi " . The set was also rented out to other productions in Vancouver , Canada . 
 Real maggots were used during many of the scenes , which were described by Gillian Anderson as being the hardest animals to work with on the show . The show 's special effects producers were unable to create a full body replica of the first victim in time , requiring him to lay on an autopsy table with makeup applied while the maggots were poured on to him . Rice was used in place of the maggots during some of the scenes . The car crash at the end of the entry was described by stunt coordinator Tony Morelli as the most harrowing action sequence during the show 's third season . To give the episode a different look the producers applied a green <unk> to the film in post @-@ production . 
 The executioner , Perry Simon , was named after an NBC executive producer that writer and director Chris Carter knew . The part was played by an uncredited Bruce <unk> . Joseph Patrick Finn , one of the show 's producers , played the prison chaplain .

" The List " later won the award for best director . Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode , " I think this is a vastly underrated episode . I also think it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very well . I think it was brave because there is not a single likable character - nobody you can root for . Mulder and Scully do not solve the case , and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time . " Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode . 
 " The List " received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . Entertainment Weekly gave " The List " a B + , describing it as " standard but well executed " . Zack Handlen , writing for The A.V. Club , had mixed feelings about it , ultimately rating it a B- . He felt that " The List " embodied a bland stand @-@ alone X @-@ Files episode for its underdeveloped concept and script , with " attempts at drama " that had no depth , and " <unk> [ that ] have so little effect on the main narrative as to be basically padding " . Handlen however praised the cinematography and art direction , the performances of both Ken Foree and J.T. Walsh , and the final scene , but ultimately considered that " once you get past the set @-@ design and cinematography , you end up with some good lines and a few scary moments , and that 's it . " 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode two stars out of four . She praised Carter 's directing , but felt that the story suffered in comparison to the second season 's " Duane Barry " , also written and directed by Carter , which was better at " unsettling ambiguity " . She felt that there were too many characters for the audience to get to know them , and the lack of resolution would leave the audience " utterly frustrated " . Other reviews were more critical . Author Phil Farrand wrote negatively of the episode , calling it his third least favorite episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpickers Guide to the X @-@ Files . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five . The two positively critiqued Carter 's directing , calling the entry " good looking " and noting that it was " a decidedly grisly hour of television . " However , they derided the plot and called it " barely cooked " , writing that the characters that are killed are wholly one @-@ dimensional and are not fleshed out .

 The first high school in Garden City that would eventually become Garden City High School was established in 1910 on the location that is now Sabine Hall in order to educate a rapidly increasing population . During the school 's inaugural year , the school newspaper , The Sugar Beet , was established . In 1913 , the high school was accredited by the North Central Association . In 1916 , the Garden City School Board set a minimum teaching standard of one year of college and two years of teaching experience for all staff members , and a year later , the high school was accredited by the U.S. Military Academy . Later that year , a new high school was constructed at the site that is now known as Calkins Hall . Two years later , the high school was renamed " Sequoyah High School " . The Board of Education approved night school in 1920 and summer school was approved the following year . In 1926 , vocational home economics was started and in 1927 , the Board established a maximum for teaching of two years of college and two years of experience . Calkins Hall was remodeled in 1929 and 15 credits were now required for graduation . This number was increased to 16 credits in 1931 when the high school was renamed " Garden City High School " . During this time , the main gym was named in honor of Ben Grimsley and was known as the " Ben Grimsley Gymnasium " . The hot lunch program began in 1938 . 
 As years passed , the athletics department began to experience moderate success , and in 1945 , Garden City won its first state championship in track as well as repeating the feat in 1946 . A new high school was constructed in 1954 , with the auditorium being completed the following year . The graduation credit limit was increased further to 19 credits in 1958 . Garden City High School experienced many changes in 1959 , including the creation of the counseling and honors programs . Another major change was the introduction of school uniforms .

 In 1961 , the main gymnasium ( referred to as " The Garden " ) was completed . The football stadium was constructed in 1962 which was one of the largest stadiums in western Kansas at the time . Two years later , Garden City finally experienced unification as Garden City District No. 1 became Unified School District No. 457 . During this same year , the football stadium was renamed " Memorial Stadium " . As interest in athletics grew throughout Garden City , so did the athletic departments . Cross @-@ country was introduced in 1966 and the men 's basketball team won their first state championship . Eight trailers were also purchased for use in the remedial reading program . Two years later , GCHS experienced major renovations and expansion as the J.D. Adams Vocational Building was constructed and other high school remodeling was completed . The population of Garden City at this time was 14 @,@ 745 . The following year , an agreement was signed between the <unk> and the district relative to the exchange of the former junior college site for senior high vocational building space and other specified district facilities used by the college .

Garden City would win its first state championship in men 's golf in 1977 and progress continued throughout the rest of the decade . The practice gym and locker rooms were added in 1981 . In 1984 , an idea was conceived among administrators and board members of the school district to recognize past graduates of GCHS who had gone on to distinguish themselves through outstanding accomplishments . This idea was brought into action the following spring , when the first members of the Garden City High School Hall of Fame were inducted . The Buffalo athletics programs struggled throughout the rest of the decade , failing to win a single state championship .

Groundbreaking for the new high school took place on September 23 , 2009 , and construction was completed on April 1 , 2012 at $ 7 million under budget . As a result , the school board approved construction of a $ 975 @,@ 000 ticket / concession / restroom and storage building . This also allowed the asphalt parking to be changed to concrete and for adding artificial turf to the football field , which saves on future maintenance costs . Installation of the football field 's turf was completed in September 2011 . In early 2012 , the Board of Education approved a 1 @-@ 1 initiative , providing every student with an iPad .

 Garden City High School operates on an 8 : 10 a.m. to 3 : 20 p.m. schedule , which includes an eight period block schedule ( 4 classes one day , 4 classes the next ) and a staggered 4 shift lunch schedule . Additionally , a mentoring period is offered which allows students to work on homework . 
 There are four academies at the high school ; School of Trade and Health Sciences , Academy of Arts and Communications , Academy of Public Service and the Ninth Grade Academy . Each career academy has teachers from different subjects , who combine their efforts as a means of integrating academic and technical curriculum . Students are able to participate in different academies each year , with the ultimate purpose of better preparing them for college and careers than traditional educational systems . 
 Despite rapidly rising numbers of English as a Second Language students , Garden City High School has raised student achievement in reading , mathematics and science . Even with a more rigorous curriculum and higher graduation requirements , the dropout rate fell from 15 percent in 1993 – 1994 to 3 @.@ 4 percent in 2003 – 2004 and the attendance rate rose from 89 percent to 96 percent . In 2009 , 18 students earned top rankings in the Spanish National Exams sponsored by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese . In 2012 , GCHS was selected as one of 314 Blue Ribbon Schools nationwide . 
 Currently , Garden City requires students to complete 26 ½ credits in order to graduate . Many students also attend classes at Garden City Community College .

 The previous high school consisted of several halls . The main hall was the longest hall in the school and consisted of several classrooms . It was attached to the main entrance on the west and met the trophy room on the east . The John D. Adams Vocational Technology building stood by itself next to the main building . There were two gymnasiums on campus . The main gym was often referred to as " The Garden " and accommodated approximately 2 @,@ 000 people . There were also 8 trailers located on the north side of the school to help provide additional classrooms . These trailers were used largely for English and History classes . 
 GCHS underwent a major remodeling project during the 2005 – 2006 school year . An open courtyard had previously existed in the central section of the school which had gone largely unused . School officials met and decided to enclose the courtyard and transform the space into a multi @-@ purpose atrium <unk> . After nearly a year , construction was completed . The new multi @-@ purpose area was used for additional seating during lunchtime , as well as conferences , banquets , and additional uses . The atrium featured a projection screen , a flat @-@ screen HDTV , additional storage closets , a small elevated stage area , several unique design features , and additional entrances / exits to classrooms . The renovation was , however , largely regarded by students and residents of Garden City as a waste of resources , owing to the construction of the current high school . One of the main reasons for the enclosure of the courtyard was to provide adequate room for most of its students in a lunchroom of some sort . However , at the time , the high school espoused an open lunch policy , and consequently a majority of its close to 2 @,@ 000 students left campus for lunch . Administrators responded to this in the 2007 – 2008 school year by closing lunch to freshmen , and the following year by closing lunch to sophomores who do not have special identification cards .

 = Catherine de ' Medici 's building projects = 
 Catherine de ' Medici 's building projects included the Valois chapel at Saint @-@ Denis , the Tuileries Palace , and the Hôtel de la Reine in Paris , and extensions to the château of Chenonceau , near Blois . Born in 1519 in Florence to an Italian father and a French mother , Catherine de ' Medici was a daughter of both the Italian and the French Renaissance . She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the Medici popes , Leo X and Clement VII . In 1533 , at the age of fourteen , she left Italy and married Henry , the second son of Francis I and Queen Claude of France . On doing so , she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe . 
 King Francis set his daughter @-@ in @-@ law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot . She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at Chambord and Fontainebleau . She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together , forging the style that became known as the first School of Fontainebleau . Francis died in 1547 , and Catherine became queen consort of France . But it wasn 't until her husband King Henry 's death in 1559 , when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France , that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture . Over the next three decades , she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy . During the same period , however , religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb . 
 Catherine loved to supervise each project personally . The architects of the day dedicated books to her , knowing that she would read them . Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces , little remains of Catherine 's investment today : one Doric column , a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens , an empty tomb at Saint Denis . The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost , or scattered , often damaged or incomplete , in museums and churches . Catherine de ' Medici 's reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects . These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage . 
 = = Influences = = 
 Historians often assume that Catherine 's love for the arts stemmed from her Medici heritage . " As the daughter of the Medici , " suggests French art historian Jean @-@ Pierre Babelon , " she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died . " Born in Florence in 1519 , Catherine lived at the Medici palace , built by Cosimo de ' Medici to designs by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo . After moving to Rome in 1530 , she lived , surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures , at another Medici palace ( now called the Palazzo Madama ) . There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city . When she later commissioned buildings herself , in France , Catherine often turned to Italian models . She based the Tuileries on the Pitti palace in Florence ; and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the Uffizi palace in mind . 
 Catherine , however , left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married Henry of Orléans , the second son of King Francis I of France . Though she kept in touch with her native Florence , her taste matured at the itinerant royal court of France . Her father @-@ in @-@ law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be . She later copied Francis ' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone , whatever the cost . His lavish building projects inspired her own . 
 Francis was a compulsive builder . He began extension works at the Louvre , added a wing to the old castle at Blois , and built the vast château of Chambord , which he showed off to the emperor Charles V in 1539 . He also transformed the lodge at Fontainebleau into one of the great palaces of Europe , a project that continued under Henry II . Artists such as Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio worked on the interior , alongside French craftsmen . This meeting of Italian Mannerism and French patronage bred an original style , later known as the first School of Fontainebleau . Featuring frescoes and high @-@ relief stucco in the shape of parchment or curled leather strapwork , it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century . Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel . She also patronised French talent , such as the architects Philibert de l 'Orme and Jean Bullant , and the sculptor Germain Pilon . 
 The death of Henry II from jousting wounds in 1559 changed Catherine 's life . From that day , she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance . She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons . She also became intent on <unk> her sorrow at the death of her husband . She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings . She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry , as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel . 
 In 1562 , a long poem by Nicolas Houël likened Catherine to Artemisia , who had built the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus , one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World , as a tomb for her dead husband . Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children . Houël laid stress on Artemesia 's devotion to architecture . In his dedication to L 'Histoire de la <unk> <unk> , he told Catherine : 
 You will find here the edifices , columns , and pyramids that she had built both at Rhodes and Halicarnassus , which will serve as remembrances for those who reflect on our times and who will be astounded at your own buildings – the palaces at the Tuileries , Montceaux , and Saint @-@ Maur , and the infinity of others that you have constructed , built , and embellished with sculptures and beautiful paintings . 
 = = Valois Chapel = = 
 In memory of Henry II , Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the basilica of Saint Denis , where the kings of France were traditionally buried . As the centrepiece of this circular chapel , sometimes known as the Valois rotunda , she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself . The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting . The plan was to integrate the tomb 's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel , creating a vast spatial composition . Catherine 's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 To lead the Valois chapel project , Catherine chose Francesco Primaticcio , who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau . Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building , crowned by a dome , to be joined to the north transept of the basilica . The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with pilasters , columns , and epitaphs in coloured marble . The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine . Primaticcio 's circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and Philibert de l 'Orme , who had built previous royal tombs . Whereas de l 'Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side , Primaticcio 's design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles . Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan " a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda 's celestial space " . 
 Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades . Primaticcio died in 1570 , and the architect Jean Bullant took over the project two years later . After Bullant 's death in 1578 , Baptiste du Cerceau led the work . The building was abandoned in 1585 . Over two hundred years later , in 1793 , a mob tossed Catherine and Henry 's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens . 
 = = = Tomb = = = 
 Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived . These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry — in Zerner 's view , " the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance " . Primaticcio himself designed its structure , which eliminated the traditional bas @-@ reliefs and kept ornamentation to a minimum . The sculptor Germain Pilon , who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I , carved the tomb 's two sets of effigies , which represented death below and eternal life above . The king and queen , cast in bronze , kneel in prayer ( <unk> ) on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns . Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of Louis XII and Francis I. Pilon 's feel for the material , however , invests his statues with a greater sense of movement . 
 Before they were destroyed in the Revolution , the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below . Catherine 's effigy suggests sleep rather than death , while Henry is posed strikingly , with his head thrown back . From 1583 , Pilon also sculpted two later <unk> of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes . In this case , he portrays Catherine realistically , with a double chin . These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel . Pilon 's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb . Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps ' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I. 
 = = = Statuary = = = 
 In the 1580s , Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb . Among these , the fragmentary Resurrection , now in the Louvre , was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel . This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo , who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine 's father at the Medici chapels in Florence . Pilon 's statue of St Francis in Ecstasy now stands in the church of St Jean and St François . In art historian Anthony Blunt 's view , it marks a departure from the tension of Mannerism and " almost foreshadows " the Baroque . 
 Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France . Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio 's decorations at Fontainebleau : the work of his predecessor Jean Goujon , for example , is more linear and classical . Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work , sometimes to the point of the grotesque . His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the French wars of religion . 
 = = Montceaux = = 
 Catherine 's earliest building project was the château of Montceaux @-@ en @-@ Brie , near Paris , which Henry II gave her in 1556 , three years before his death . The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase , and two wings with a pavilion at each end . Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall , an early form of croquet . For this commission , Philibert de l 'Orme built her a grotto . He set it on a base made to look like natural rock , from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments . The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived . The château ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640 , and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798 . 
 = = Tuileries = = 
 After the death of Henry II , Catherine abandoned the palace of the Tournelles , where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a joust . To replace the Tournelles , she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or <unk> . The site was close to the congested Louvre , where she kept her household . The grounds extended along the banks of the Seine and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west . The Tuileries was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up . It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe . Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris , as seen from the river , into a monumental complex . 
 To design the new palace , Catherine brought back Philibert de l 'Orme from disgrace . This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of Henry II 's reign , after making too many enemies . De l 'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture , but his ideas are not fully known . It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles . De l 'Orme is said to have " taught France the classical style — lucid , rational and regular " . He notes , however , that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen . The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to Bullant 's later work and to a less classical style of architecture . 
 For the pilasters of Catherine 's palace , de l 'Orme chose the Ionic order , which he considered a feminine form : 
 I will not go on to other matters without pointing out to you that I chose the present Ionic order , from amongst all others , in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace , which Her Majesty the Queen , mother of the most Christian King Charles IX , today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly , on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen , is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses , as was the Doric to those of men , which is what the ancients have told me : for , when they decided to build a temple to a god , they used the Doric , and to a goddess , the Ionic . Yet all architects have not followed that [ principle ] , shown in Vitruvius 's text ... accordingly I have made use , at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen , of the Ionic order , on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric , and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features . 
 Catherine de ' Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building . De l 'Orme records , for example , that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain . She also insisted on large panels between the dormers to make room for inscriptions . Only a part of de l 'Orme 's scheme was ever built : the lower section of a central pavilion , containing an oval staircase , and a wing on either side . Though work on de l 'Orme 's design was abandoned in 1572 , two years after his death , it is nonetheless held in high regard . According to Thomson , " The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens , the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux @-@ Arts [ Paris ] and the Château de la Punta in Corsica show that the columns , pilasters , dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non @-@ figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture " . 
 De l 'Orme 's original plans have not survived . Jacques Androuet du Cerceau , however , has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries . One engraving shows a grandiose palace , with three courts and two oval halls . This design is atypical of de l 'Orme 's style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau 's own proposal or his son Baptiste 's . It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s . Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau 's courtyards were Catherine de ' Medici 's idea . She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments . Du Cerceau 's drawings reveal that , before he published them in 1576 , Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine . Only the ground floor of the first section , the Petite Galerie , was completed in her lifetime . It was left to Henry IV , who ruled from 1589 to 1610 , to add the second floor and the Grande Galerie that finally linked the two palaces . 
 After de l 'Orme died in 1570 , Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards . To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river . This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant . Bullant attached columns to his pavilion , as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders , to mark proportion . Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l 'Orme 's departures from the style of Roman monuments . 
 Despite its unfinished state , Catherine often visited the palace . She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens . According to the French military leader Marshal <unk> , it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre , in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris . The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted . They included canals , fountains , and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard <unk> . In 1573 , Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries . This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son , the duke of Anjou , later Henry III of France . Henry IV later added to the Tuileries ; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace . The <unk> set fire to the remainder in 1871 . Twelve years later , the ruins were demolished and then sold off . 
 = = Saint @-@ Maur = = 
 The palace of Saint @-@ Maur @-@ des @-@ Fossés , south east of Paris , was another of Catherine 's unfinished projects . She bought this building , on which Philibert de l 'Orme had worked , from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay , after the latter 's death in 1560 . She then commissioned de l 'Orme to finish the work he had begun there . Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine 's intentions for Saint @-@ Maur . They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the pavilions next to the main block of the house . The house was to stay as one storey , with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters . That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side . 
 De l 'Orme died in 1570 ; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint @-@ Maur . The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs . He also planned two more arches over de l 'Orme 's terrace , which joined the pavilions on the garden side . In historian R. J. Knecht 's view , the scheme would have given this part of the house , a " colossal , even grotesque " pediment . The work was only partly carried out , and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in . 
 = = Hôtel de la Reine = = 
 After de l 'Orme 's death , Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine 's chief architect . In 1572 , Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls . She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household . To make space for the new scheme and its gardens , she had an entire area of Paris demolished . 
 The new palace was known in Catherine 's time as the Hôtel de la Reine and later as the Hôtel de Soissons . Engravings made by <unk> Silvestre in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the Hôtel de la Reine possessed a central wing , a courtyard , and gardens . The walled gardens of the hôtel included an aviary , a lake with a water jet , and long avenues of trees . Catherine also installed an orangery that could be dismantled in winter . The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant 's death in 1582 . The building was demolished in the 1760s . All that remains of the Hôtel de la Reine today is a single Doric column , known as the Colonne de l <unk> or Medici column , which stood in the courtyard . It can be seen next to the domed Bourse de commerce . Catherine 's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it " a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power " . 
 = = Chenonceau = = 
 In 1576 , Catherine decided to enlarge her château of Chenonceau , near Blois . On Henry II 's death , she had demanded this property from Henry 's mistress Diane de Poitiers . She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her . In return , she gave Diane the less prized Chaumont . When Diane arrived at Chaumont , she found signs of the occult , such as <unk> drawn on the floor . She quickly withdrew to her château of Anet and never set foot in Chaumont again . 
 Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau , such as de l 'Orme 's bridge over the Cher River . Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival 's work . She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge . The architect was almost certainly Bullant . The decorations show the fantasy of his late style . 
 Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them . At Chenonceau , she added waterfalls , menageries , and aviaries , laid out three parks , and planted mulberry trees for silkworms . Jacques Androuet du Cerceau made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau . A trapezoidal lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular atria joined to two halls that flank the original house . These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant 's plans . Du Cerceau " sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question " . 
 Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine 's . Like Bullant , he became a more fantastical designer with time . Nothing he built himself , however , has survived . He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day , including Saint @-@ Maur , the Tuileries , and Chenonceau . In 1576 and 1579 , he produced the two @-@ volume Les Plus <unk> <unk> de France , a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine . His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered . 
 = = End of the dynasty = = 
 Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague , famine , and economic hardship in France . As the country slipped deeper into anarchy , her plans grew ever more ambitious . Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its moral authority was in steep decline . The popular view condemned Catherine 's building schemes as obscenely extravagant . This was especially true in Paris , where the parlement was often asked to contribute to her costs . 
 Ronsard captured the mood in a poem : 
 Ronsard was in many ways proved correct . The death of Catherine 's beloved son Henry III in 1589 , a few months after her own , brought the Valois dynasty to an end . Precious little of Catherine 's grand building work has survived .

Due to the success of her eleventh studio album , E = MC ² ( 2008 ) , and its lead single " Touch My Body " , Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of the effort , but poor charting subsequent singles from the album prompted a halt on promotion by her label , Island Records . It was also rumored that Carey had become pregnant and miscarried , though she never addressed it until late 2010 . She began to work on her twelfth studio effort , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel throughout 2009 , and it was released later on in the year . In October 2010 , Carey revealed that she had in fact been pregnant in late 2008 , and that was the reason why tour plans were cancelled . 
 The song was recorded at several recording locations , including The Boom Boom Room in Burbank , California , the Studio at the Palms in Las Vegas , Nevada and at Honeywest Studios in New York City . The lyrics revolve around the idea of outing a cheating boyfriend publicly on television , and Carey makes a reference to Oprah Winfrey and her chat show . " Betcha Gon ' Know ( The Prologue ) " garnered mixed responses from music critics . Sal Cinqeumani for Slant Magazine wrote that the song was " promising , " however , Jon Caramanica for The New York Times criticized the song 's lackluster arrangement and Carey 's vocal execution .

 After Carey finished her The Adventures of Mimi Tour ( 2006 ) in support of her tenth studio album The Emancipation of Mimi ( 2005 ) , she began to work on material for her eleventh studio effort , the yet untitled E = MC ² ( 2008 ) . E = MC ² was hailed as one of the most anticipated albums to be released in 2008 , with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success , following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi . After the release and success of " Touch My Body " , the project 's lead single , subsequent singles of the album failed to garner airplay or significant charting , Island Records halted promotion of the album . Since the album 's release , Carey had planned to embark on an extensive tour in support of E = MC ² , describing its production and direction in several interviews . When asked to describe the tour 's theme , Carey explained " I 'm thinking elaborate . I like elaborate . We only do substantial . That 's what my jeweler says .

" <unk> plans for a tour were underway , and Carey 's announcement for a tour during her promotional appearance on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in November 2008 , the tour was suddenly cancelled in the following month . 
 Because of the tour 's cancellation , various media outlets circulated speculation that Carey had become pregnant , and had abandoned her plans for a tour as a result . Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist 's office in Los Angeles . Carey did not address those rumours until two years later on October 28 , 2010 , which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy ; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008 , and suffered a miscarriage . For that reason , she cancelled the tour , and lost the child only two months later . Carey later opted to record a new album , that would be released during the summer of 2009 . During the later stages of the project , Carey released the title , Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel , that would serve as the singer 's twelfth studio album .

 = USS Nevada ( BB @-@ 36 ) = 
 USS Nevada ( BB @-@ 36 ) , the second United States Navy ship to be named after the 36th state , was the lead ship of the two Nevada @-@ class battleships ; her sister ship was Oklahoma . Launched in 1914 , the Nevada was a leap forward in dreadnought technology ; four of her new features would be included on almost every subsequent US battleship : triple gun turrets , oil in place of coal for fuel , geared steam turbines for greater range , and the " all or nothing " armor principle . These features made Nevada the first US Navy " super @-@ dreadnought " . 
 Nevada served in both World Wars : during the last few months of World War I , Nevada was based in Bantry Bay , Ireland , to protect the supply convoys that were sailing to and from Great Britain . In World War II , she was one of the battleships trapped when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . She was the only battleship to get underway during the attack , making the ship " the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal and depressing morning " for the United States . Still , she was hit by one torpedo and at least six bombs while steaming away from Battleship Row , forcing her to be beached . Subsequently salvaged and modernized at Puget Sound Navy Yard , Nevada served as a convoy escort in the Atlantic and as a fire @-@ support ship in four amphibious assaults : the Normandy Landings and the invasions of Southern France , Iwo Jima , and Okinawa . 
 At the end of World War II , the Navy decided that Nevada was too old to be retained , so they assigned her to be a target ship in the atomic experiments that were going to be conducted at Bikini Atoll in July 1946 ( Operation Crossroads ) . After being hit by the blast from the first atomic bomb , Able , she was still afloat but heavily damaged and radioactive . She was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and sunk during naval gunfire practice on 31 July 1948 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Being the first second @-@ generation battleship in the US Navy , Nevada has been described as " revolutionary " and " as radical as Dreadnought was in her day " by present @-@ day historians . At the time of her completion in 1916 , the New York Times remarked that the new warship was " the greatest [ battleship ] afloat " because she was so much larger than other contemporary American battleships : her tonnage was nearly three times that of the obsolete 1890 pre @-@ dreadnought Oregon , almost twice that of the 1904 battleship Connecticut , and almost 8 @,@ 000 long tons ( 8 @,@ 100 t ) greater than that of one of the first American dreadnoughts , Delaware , which had been built just seven years prior to Nevada . 
 Nevada was the first battleship in the US Navy to have triple gun turrets , a single funnel , and an oil @-@ fired steam power plant . In particular , using oil gave the ship an engineering advantage over the earlier coal @-@ fired plants , as oil is much more efficient than coal because it yields " a far greater steaming radius for a given amount of fuel " . Nevada was also the first US battleship with geared turbines , also increasing fuel economy and thus range compared to earlier direct drive turbines . The ability to steam great distances without refueling was a major concern of the General Board at that time . In 1903 , the Board felt all American battleships should have a minimum steaming radius of 6 @,@ 000 nmi ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) so that the US could enforce the Monroe Doctrine . One of the main purposes of the Great White Fleet , which sailed around the world in 1907 – 1908 , was to prove to Japan that the US Navy could " carry any naval conflict into Japanese home waters " . Possibly as a result of this , battleships after 1908 were mainly designed to " steam 8 @,@ 000 miles at cruising speeds " ; given the distance between San Pedro , where the fleet would be based , and Manila , where the Fleet was expected to have to fight under War Plan Orange , was 6 @,@ 550 nmi ( 7 @,@ 540 mi ; 12 @,@ 130 km ) , endurance was obviously a major concern for the U.S. Navy . Also , oil allowed for the boiler @-@ room crew to be reduced — the engineer on Delaware estimated that 100 firemen ( stokers ) and 112 coal passers could be adequately replaced by just 24 men , which would allow some crew 's quarters to be eliminated ; this would save weight and also reduce the amount of fresh water and provisions that the ship would have to carry . 
 In addition to all of this , Nevada had maximum armor over critical areas , such as the magazines and engines , and none over less important places , even though previous battleships had armor of varying thickness depending on the importance of the area it was protecting . This radical change became known as the " all or nothing " principle , which most major navies later adopted for their own battleships . With this new armor scheme , the armor on the battleship was increased to 41 @.@ 1 % of the displacement . 
 As a result of all of these design modifications from previous battleships , Nevada was the first of the US Navy 's " Standard " type battleships . " Standards " were characterized by the use of oil fuel , the " all or nothing " armor scheme , and the arrangement of the main armament in four triple or twin turrets without any turrets located in the middle of the ship . The Navy was to create a fleet of modern battleships similar in long @-@ range gunnery , speed , turning radius , and protection . " Nevada " was followed by 11 other battleships of this type , although significant improvements were made in subsequent designs as naval technology rapidly progressed . An additional seven standard type battleships , the USS Washington ( BB @-@ 47 ) and the South Dakota class were never completed due to the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 The two battleships of the Nevada @-@ class were virtually identical except in their propulsion . Nevada and her sister were fitted with different engines to compare the two , putting them ' head @-@ to @-@ head ' : Oklahoma received older vertical triple expansion engines , which had proven more fuel @-@ efficient and reliable than the direct drive turbines of some earlier battleships , while Nevada received geared Curtis steam turbines . 
 = = Construction and trials = = 
 Nevada 's construction was authorized by an Act of Congress on 4 March 1911 . The contract went to Fore River Shipbuilding Company on 22 January 1912 for a total of $ 5 @,@ 895 @,@ 000 ( not including the armor and armament ) , and the time of construction was originally to be 36 months . A secondary contract was signed on 31 July 1912 for $ 50 @,@ 000 to cover the additional cost of a geared cruising unit on each propeller shaft ; this also extended the planned construction time by five months . Her keel was laid down on 4 November 1912 , and by 12 August 1914 , the ship was 72 @.@ 4 % complete . Nevada was launched on 11 July 1914 ; she was sponsored by Miss Eleanor Anne Seibert , niece of Governor Tasker Oddie of Nevada and a descendant of the first Secretary of the Navy , Benjamin Stoddert . The launch was attended by several prominent members of the government , including Governor Oddie , Governor David I. Walsh of Massachusetts , Senator Key Pittman of Nevada , Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt , who would later become the 32nd President of the United States . 
 Nevada then had to undergo many different tests and trials prior to her commissioning to ensure that she met the terms of the original contract . These began on 4 November 1915 , when the ship conducted a twelve @-@ hour endurance run " up and down the New England coast " , reaching a top speed of 21 @.@ 4 kn ( 24 @.@ 6 mph ; 39 @.@ 6 km / h ) . Though her " acceptance trials " were interrupted on 5 November because of a gale and rough seas , they were continued on the 6th with a test of her fuel economy ; this consisted of a 24 @-@ hour run where Nevada steamed at 10 kn ( 12 mph ; 19 km / h ) . The test results were positive : the oil consumption of the <unk> was 6 lb per knot lower than the contract had demanded . Another test was conducted for 12 hours at 15 kn ( 17 mph ; 28 km / h ) , with an even better result of 10 lb per knot lower than the contract specifications . After completing all of these tests and running trials off Rockland , Maine , Nevada sailed to the Boston and New York Navy Yards for equipment , torpedo tubes , and ammunition hoists . When all of the preliminaries were completed , Nevada was commissioned on 11 March 1916 at the Charlestown Navy Yard , and William S. Sims was the first captain of the new ship .

 After fitting out in the Boston and New York Navy Yards , Nevada joined the Atlantic Fleet in Newport , Rhode Island on 26 May 1916 . Prior to the United States ' entry into World War I , she conducted many training cruises and underwent many exercises out of her base in Norfolk , Virginia , sailing as far south as the Caribbean on these cruises . The US entered the war in April 1917 , but Nevada was not sent to the other side of the Atlantic because of a shortage of fuel oil in Britain . Instead , four coal @-@ fired battleships of Battleship Division 9 ( BatDiv 9 ) ( Delaware , Florida , Wyoming , and New York ) departed the US to join the British Grand Fleet on 25 November 1917 . They arrived on 7 December and were designated as the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet . Texas joined them after damage from a grounding on Block Island was repaired ; she departed on 30 January and arrived in Scotland on 11 February . It was not until 13 August 1918 that Nevada left the US for Britain , becoming the last American ship to join the Fleet overseas . 
 After a 10 @-@ day voyage , she arrived in Berehaven , Ireland , on 23 August . Along with Utah and her sister Oklahoma , the three were nicknamed the " Bantry Bay Squadron " ; officially , they were BatDiv 6 under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers , who chose Utah as his flagship . For the rest of the war , the three ships operated from the bay , escorting the large and valuable convoys bound for the British Isles to ensure no German heavy surface ships could slip past the British Grand Fleet and annihilate the merchant ships and their weak escorts of older cruisers . This never came to pass , and the war ended on 11 November with Nevada not getting a chance to engage an enemy during the war . 
 On 13 December 10 battleships , including Nevada , and 28 destroyers escorted the ocean liner George Washington , with president Woodrow Wilson embarked , into Brest , France , during the last day of Wilson 's journey to the country so he could attend the Paris Peace Conference . The flotilla met George Washington and her escorts ( Pennsylvania and four destroyers ) just off Brest and escorted them into the port . The 10 battleships sailed for home at 14 : 00 on the next day , 14 December . They took less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic , and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades and celebrations .

 Between the two World Wars , Nevada served in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets . Though she had originally been equipped with 21 five @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) / 51 cal guns to defend against enemy destroyers , this number was reduced to 12 in 1918 , due to the overly wet bow and stern positions of the other nine . 
 Along with Arizona , Nevada represented the United States at the Peruvian Centennial Exposition in July 1921 . A year later , in company with Maryland this time , she returned to South America as an escort to the steamer Pan America with Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes embarked ; they all attended the Centennial of Brazilian Independence in Rio de Janeiro , celebrated from 5 to 11 September 1922 . The New York Times later credited the crew of Nevada for bringing baseball and that sport 's unique terminology to Brazil , allowing the country to " make the Yankee game an institution of their own " . Three years later , from July – September 1925 , Nevada took part in the US Fleet 's " goodwill cruise " to Australia and New Zealand . During this cruise , the ships had only limited replenishment opportunities , but they still made it to Australia and back without undue difficulty . This demonstrated to those allies and Japan that the US Navy had the ability to conduct transpacific operations and meet the Imperial Japanese Navy in their home waters , where both Japanese and American war plans expected the " decisive battle " to be fought , if it should come . 
 After the cruise , Nevada was modernized at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard between August 1927 and January 1930 , with the exchange of her " basket " masts for tripod masts and her steam turbines for those from the recently stricken battleship North Dakota . These were geared turbines that had been retrofitted to North Dakota in 1917 , replacing her original direct drive turbines to increase her range . Additionally , many different adaptations and additions were made : her main guns ' elevation was increased to 30 ° ( which upped the range of the guns from 23 @,@ 000 yd ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) to 34 @,@ 000 yd ( 31 @,@ 100 m ) ) , anti @-@ torpedo bulges were added , her 12 original Yarrow boilers were replaced with 6 more efficient Bureau Express boilers in a new arrangement to accommodate those bulges , two catapults were added for three Vought O2U @-@ 3 Corsair biplane spotter aircraft , eight 5 in ( 127 mm ) / 25 cal AA guns were added , a new superstructure was installed , and her 5 inch ( 127 mm ) 51 cal secondary battery was relocated above the hull in an arrangement similar to that of the New Mexico class . Nevada then served in the Pacific Fleet for the next eleven years .

 = = = Attack on Pearl Harbor = = = 
 When the weekend of 6 – 7 December arrived , all of the Pacific Fleet 's battleships were in port for the weekend for the first time since 4 July . Normally they took turns spending time in port — six would be out with Vice Admiral William S. Pye 's battleship Task Force One one weekend , while the next weekend would find three ranging with Vice Admiral William Halsey , Jr . ' s aircraft carrier task force . However , because Halsey could not afford to take the slow battleships with his fast carriers on his dash to reinforce Wake Island 's Marine detachment with fighters and because it was Pye 's turn to rest in port and the harbor was where it was considered safe , none of the battleships were sailing on that morning . When the sun rose over Nevada on the 7th , the ship 's band was playing " Morning Colors " ; but planes then appeared on the horizon and the attack on Pearl Harbor began . 
 Aft of Arizona during the attack , Nevada was not moored alongside another battleship off Ford Island , and therefore was able to maneuver , unlike the other seven battleships present . The Officer of the Deck , Ensign Joe Taussig ( son of the admiral of the same name ) , had earlier that morning ordered a second boiler lit off , planning to switch the power load from one boiler to the other around 0800 . As Nevada 's gunners opened fire and her engineers started to raise steam , a single 18 in ( 460 mm ) Type 91 Mod 2 torpedo exploded against Frame 41 about 14 ft ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) above the keel at 0810 . Seconds later , the same Kate torpedo bomber that dropped the torpedo was shot down by the Nevada 's gunners . The torpedo bulkhead held , but leaking through joints caused flooding of port side compartments below the first platform deck between frames 30 and 43 and a list of 4 – 5 ° . Her damage control crew corrected the list by counter @-@ flooding and Nevada got underway at 0840 , her gunners already having shot down four planes . Ensign Taussig 's efficiency paid off , likely saving his ship , but he lost a leg in the attack . 
 Nevada became a prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers during the second wave . Japanese pilots intended to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor . Tactically target selection was wrong as 14 – 18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn 't be able to sink a battleship with 250 kg bombs and the channel 's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible . As she steamed past Ten @-@ Ten Dock at about 09 : 50 , Nevada was struck by five bombs . One exploded over the crew 's galley at Frame 80 . Another struck the port director platform and exploded at the base of the stack on the upper deck . Yet another hit near No. 1 turret inboard from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks . Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15 ; one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding , but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank ; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship . 
 The gasoline fires that flared up around Turret 1 might have caused more critical damage if the main magazines had not been empty . For several days prior to the attack , all of the 14 @-@ inch @-@ gun ( 356 mm ) battleships had been replacing their standard @-@ weight main battery projectiles with a new heavier projectile that offered greater penetration and a larger explosive charge in exchange for a slight decrease in range . All of the older projectiles and powder charges had been removed from the magazines of Nevada , and the crew had taken a break after loading the new projectiles in anticipation of loading the new powder charges on Sunday . 
 As bomb damage became evident , Nevada was ordered to proceed to the west side of Ford Island to prevent her from sinking in deeper water . Instead , she was grounded off Hospital Point at 10 : 30 , with the help of <unk> and Avocet , though she managed to force down three planes before she struck the shore . Gasoline fires prevented damage control parties from containing flooding forward of the main torpedo defense system . Flooding the main magazine and counterflooding to keep the ship stable lowered the bow allowing water to enter the ship at the second deck level . Lack of watertight subdivision between the second and main decks from frame 30 to frame 115 allowed water entering through bomb holes in the forecastle to flow aft through the ship 's ventilation system to flood the dynamo and boiler rooms . 
 Over the course of the morning , Nevada suffered a total of 60 killed and 109 wounded . Two more men died aboard during salvage operations on 7 February 1942 when they were overcome by hydrogen sulfide gas from decomposing paper and meat . The ship suffered a minimum of six bomb hits and one torpedo hit , but " it is possible that as many as ten bomb hits may have been received , [ ... ] as certain damaged areas [ were ] of sufficient size to indicate that they were struck by more than one bomb . " 
 = = = Attu and D @-@ Day = = = 
 Nevada was refloated on 12 February 1942 and underwent temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor so she could get to Puget Sound Navy Yard for a major overhaul and modernization . This was completed in October 1942 , and it changed the old battleship 's appearance so she slightly resembled a South Dakota from a distance . Her 5 " / 51s and 5 " / 25s were replaced with sixteen 5 " / 38 caliber guns in new twin mounts . Nevada then sailed for Alaska , where she provided fire support from 11 – 18 May 1943 for the capture of Attu . 
 Nevada then departed for Norfolk Navy Yard in June for further modernization . After this was completed , Nevada went on Atlantic convoy duty . Old battleships such as Nevada were attached to many convoys across the Atlantic to guard against the chance that a German capital ship might head out to sea on a raiding mission . 
 After completing more convoy runs , Nevada set sail for the United Kingdom to prepare for the Normandy Invasion , arriving in April 1944 . Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS @-@ 7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee @-@ on @-@ Solent ( HMS Daedalus ) . She was chosen as Rear Admiral Morton Deyo 's flagship for the operation . During the invasion , Nevada supported forces ashore from 6 – 17 June , and again on 25 June ; during this time , she employed her guns against shore defenses on the Cherbourg Peninsula , " [ seeming ] to lean back as [ she ] hurled salvo after salvo at the shore batteries . " Shells from her guns ranged as far as 17 nmi ( 20 mi ; 31 km ) inland in attempts to break up German concentrations and counterattacks , even though she was straddled by counterbattery fire 27 times ( though never hit ) . Nevada was later praised for her " incredibly accurate " fire in support of beleaguered troops , as some of the targets she hit were just 600 yd ( 550 m ) from the front line . Nevada was the only battleship present at both Pearl Harbor and the Normandy landings . 
 = = = Southern France and Iwo Jima = = = 
 After D @-@ Day , the Allies headed to Toulon for another amphibious assault , codenamed Operation Dragoon . To support this , many ships were sent from the beaches of Normandy to the Mediterranean , including five battleships ( the United States ' Nevada , Texas , Arkansas , the British Ramillies , and the Free French Lorraine ) , three US heavy cruisers ( Augusta , Tuscaloosa and Quincy ) , and many destroyers and landing craft were transferred south . 
 Nevada supported this operation from 15 August to 25 September 1944 , " dueling " with " Big Willie " : a heavily reinforced fortress with four 340 mm ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin turrets . These guns had been salvaged from the French battleship Provence after the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon ; the guns had a range of nearly 19 nautical miles ( 35 km ) and they commanded every approach to the port of Toulon . In addition , they were fortified with heavy armor plate bedded into the rocky sides of the island of Saint <unk> . Due to these dangers , the fire @-@ support ships assigned to the operation were ordered to level the fortress . Beginning on 19 August , and continuing on subsequent days , one or more heavy warships bombarded it in conjunction with low @-@ level bomber strikes . On the 23rd , a bombardment force headed by Nevada struck the " most damaging " blow to the fort during a 6 ½ hour battle , which saw 354 salvos fired by Nevada . Toulon fell on the 25th , but the fort , though it was " coming apart at the seams " , held out for three more days . 
 Nevada then headed to New York to have her gun barrels relined . In addition , her 14 " / 45 caliber guns ( 356 mm ) from Turret 1 were replaced with the Mark 8 guns from turret 2 of Arizona ; these new guns were relined to Mark 12 specifications . After that was completed , she sailed for the Pacific , arriving off Iwo Jima on 16 February 1945 to " [ prepare ] the island for invasion with heavy bombardment " ; which she did through 7 March . During the invasion , she moved to be within 600 yd ( 550 m ) from shore to provide maximum firepower for the troops that were advancing . 
 = = = Okinawa and Japan = = = 
 On 24 March 1945 , Nevada joined Task Force 54 ( TF 54 ) , the " Fire Support Force " , off Okinawa as pre @-@ invasion bombardment began . The ships of TF 54 then moved into position on the night of the 23rd , beginning their bombardment missions at dawn on the 24th . Along with the rest of the force , Nevada shelled Japanese airfields , shore defenses , supply dumps , and troop concentrations . However , after the fire support ships retired for the night , dawn " came up like thunder " when seven kamikazes attacked the force while it was without air cover . One plane , though hit repeatedly by antiaircraft fire from the force , crashed onto the main deck of Nevada , next to turret No. 3 . It killed 11 and wounded 49 ; it also knocked out both 14 in ( 360 mm ) guns in that turret and three 20 mm anti @-@ aircraft weapons . Another two men were lost to fire from a shore battery on 5 April . Until 30 June , she was stationed off Okinawa ; she then departed to join the 3rd Fleet from 10 July to 7 August , which allowed Nevada to come within range of the Japanese home islands during the closing days of the war , though she did not bombard them . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 Nevada then returned to Pearl Harbor after a brief stint of occupation duty in Tokyo Bay . Nevada was surveyed and , at 32 ⅓ years old , was deemed too old to be kept in the post @-@ war fleet . As a result , she was assigned to be a target ship in the first Bikini atomic experiments ( Operation Crossroads ) of July 1946 . The experiment consisted of detonating two atomic bombs to test their effectiveness against ships . Nevada was the bombardier 's target for the first test , codenamed ' Able ' , which used an air @-@ dropped weapon . To help distinguish the target from surrounding vessels , Nevada was painted a reddish @-@ orange . However , even with the high @-@ visibility color scheme , the bomb fell about 1 @,@ 700 yd ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) off @-@ target , exploding above the attack transport Gilliam instead . Due in part to the miss , Nevada survived . The ship also remained afloat after the second test — ' Baker ' , a detonation some 90 ft ( 27 m ) below the surface of the water — but was damaged and extremely radioactive from the spray . Nevada was later towed to Pearl Harbor and decommissioned on 29 August 1946 . 
 After she was thoroughly examined , Iowa and two other vessels used Nevada as a practice gunnery target on 31 July 1948 . The ships did not sink Nevada , so she was given a coup de grâce with an aerial torpedo hit amidships .

 Sophocles ( / <unk> / ; Greek : <unk> , <unk> , Ancient Greek : [ <unk> ̂ ːs ] ; c . 497 / 6 – winter 406 / 5 BC ) is one of three ancient Greek tragedians whose plays have survived . His first plays were written later than those of Aeschylus , and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides . Sophocles wrote 120 plays during the course of his life , but only seven have survived in a complete form : Ajax , Antigone , The Women of Trachis , Oedipus the King , Electra , Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus . For almost 50 years , Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city @-@ state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the <unk> and the Dionysia . He competed in 30 competitions , won 18 , and was never judged lower than second place . Aeschylus won 14 competitions , and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles , while Euripides won 5 competitions . 
 The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone : they are generally known as the Theban plays , although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy , the other members of which are now lost . Sophocles influenced the development of the drama , most importantly by adding a third actor , thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot . He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus . 
 = = Life = = 
 Sophocles , the son of <unk> , was a wealthy member of the rural deme ( small community ) of <unk> Colonus in Attica , which was to become a setting for one of his plays , and he was probably born there . Sophocles was born a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC : the exact year is unclear , although 497 / 6 is the most likely . Sophocles was born into a wealthy family ( his father was an armour manufacturer ) and was highly educated . Sophocles ' first artistic triumph was in 468 BC , when he took first prize in the Dionysia theatre competition over the reigning master of Athenian drama , Aeschylus . According to Plutarch , the victory came under unusual circumstances . Instead of following the usual custom of choosing judges by lot , the archon asked Cimon and the other strategoi present to decide the victor of the contest . Plutarch further contends that following this loss Aeschylus soon left for Sicily . Although Plutarch says that this was Sophocles ' first production , it is now thought that his first production was probably in 470 BC . <unk> was probably one of the plays that Sophocles presented at this festival . 
 In 480 BC Sophocles was chosen to lead the paean ( a choral chant to a god ) , celebrating the Greek victory over the Persians at the Battle of Salamis . Early in his career , the politician Cimon might have been one of his patrons , although if he was , there was no ill will borne by Pericles , Cimon 's rival , when Cimon was ostracized in 461 BC . In 443 / 2 he served as one of the <unk> , or treasurers of Athena , helping to manage the finances of the city during the political ascendancy of Pericles . According to the Vita <unk> , in 441 BC he was elected one of the ten generals , executive officials at Athens , as a junior colleague of Pericles , and he served in the Athenian campaign against Samos ; he was supposed to have been elected to this position as the result of his production of Antigone . 
 In 420 BC , he welcomed and set up an altar for the image of Asclepius at his house , when the deity was introduced to Athens . For this , he was given the posthumous epithet <unk> ( receiver ) by the Athenians . He was also elected , in 413 BC , one of the commissioners ( <unk> ) who responded to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in Sicily during the Peloponnesian War . 
 Sophocles died at the age of ninety or ninety @-@ one in the winter of 406 / 5 BC , having seen within his lifetime both the Greek triumph in the Persian Wars and the bloodletting of the Peloponnesian War . As with many famous men in classical antiquity , his death inspired a number of apocryphal stories . The most famous is the suggestion that he died from the strain of trying to recite a long sentence from his Antigone without pausing to take a breath . Another account suggests he choked while eating grapes at the Anthesteria festival in Athens . A third holds that he died of happiness after winning his final victory at the City Dionysia . A few months later , a comic poet , in a play titled The Muses , wrote this eulogy : " Blessed is Sophocles , who had a long life , was a man both happy and talented , and the writer of many good tragedies ; and he ended his life well without suffering any misfortune . " According to some accounts , however , his own sons tried to have him declared incompetent near the end of his life ; he is said to have refuted their charge in court by reading from his as yet unproduced Oedipus at Colonus . One of his sons , <unk> , and a grandson , also called Sophocles , also became playwrights . 
 Several ancient sources mention Sophocles ' homosexuality or bisexuality . <unk> reported that Sophocles loved boys like Euripides loved women . The poet Ion of Chios relates an anecdote involving Sophocles seducing a serving boy at a symposium , and <unk> one in which Sophocles is tricked by a hustler . 
 = = Works and legacy = = 
 Among Sophocles ' earliest innovations was the addition of a third actor , which further reduced the role of the chorus and created greater opportunity for character development and conflict between characters . Aeschylus , who dominated Athenian playwriting during Sophocles ' early career , followed suit and adopted the third character into his own work towards the end of his life . Aristotle credits Sophocles with the introduction of <unk> , or scenery @-@ painting . It was not until after the death of the old master Aeschylus in 456 BC that Sophocles became the pre @-@ eminent playwright in Athens . 
 Thereafter , Sophocles emerged victorious in dramatic competitions at 18 Dionysia and 6 <unk> festivals . In addition to innovations in dramatic structure , Sophocles ' work is also known for its deeper development of characters than earlier playwrights . His reputation was such that foreign rulers invited him to attend their courts , although unlike Aeschylus who died in Sicily , or Euripides who spent time in Macedon , Sophocles never accepted any of these invitations . Aristotle used Sophocles ' Oedipus the King in his Poetics ( c . 335 BC ) as an example of the highest achievement in tragedy , which suggests the high esteem in which his work was held by later Greeks . 
 Only two of the seven surviving plays can be dated securely : Philoctetes ( 409 BC ) and Oedipus at Colonus ( 401 BC , staged after Sophocles ' death by his grandson ) . Of the others , Electra shows stylistic similarities to these two plays , which suggests that it was probably written in the latter part of his career . Ajax , Antigone and The <unk> are generally thought to be among his early works , again based on stylistic elements , with Oedipus the King coming in Sophocles ' middle period . Most of Sophocles ' plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism and the beginnings of Socratic logic as a mainstay for the long tradition of Greek tragedy . 
 = = = Theban plays = = = 
 The Theban plays consist of three plays : Oedipus the King ( also called Oedipus <unk> or by its Latin title Oedipus Rex ) , Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone . All three plays concern the fate of Thebes during and after the reign of King Oedipus . They have often been published under a single cover . Sophocles , however , wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions , many years apart . Not only are the Theban plays not a true trilogy ( three plays presented as a continuous narrative ) but they are not even an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them . He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes , such as the Epigoni , of which only fragments have survived . 
 = = = = Subjects = = = = 
 Each of the plays relates to the tale of the mythological Oedipus , who killed his father and married his mother without knowledge that they were his parents . His family is fated to be doomed for three generations . 
 In Oedipus the King , Oedipus is the protagonist . Oedipus ' infanticide is planned by his parents , Laius and Jocasta , to avert him from fulfilling a prophecy ; in truth , the servant entrusted with the infanticide passes the infant on through a series of intermediaries to a childless couple , who adopt him not knowing his history . Oedipus eventually learns of the Delphic Oracle 's prophecy of him , that he would kill his father and marry his mother ; Oedipus attempts to flee his fate without harming those he knows as his parents ( at this point , he does not know that he is adopted ) . Oedipus meets a man at a crossroads accompanied by servants ; Oedipus and the man fought , and Oedipus killed the man . ( This man was his father , Laius , not that anyone apart from the gods knew this at the time ) . He becomes the ruler of Thebes after solving the riddle of the sphinx and in the process , marries the widowed queen , his mother Jocasta . Thus the stage is set for horror . When the truth comes out , following from another true but confusing prophecy from Delphi , Jocasta commits suicide , Oedipus blinds himself and leaves Thebes . At the end of the play , order is restored . This restoration is seen when Creon , brother of Jocasta , becomes king , and also when Oedipus , before going off to exile , asks Creon to take care of his children . Oedipus 's children will always bear the weight of shame and humiliation because of their father 's actions . 
 In Oedipus at Colonus , the banished Oedipus and his daughter Antigone arrive at the town of Colonus where they encounter Theseus , King of Athens . Oedipus dies and strife begins between his sons Polyneices and Eteocles . 
 In Antigone , the protagonist is Oedipus ' daughter , Antigone . She is faced with the choice of allowing her brother Polyneices ' body to remain unburied , outside the city walls , exposed to the ravages of wild animals , or to bury him and face death . The king of the land , Creon , has forbidden the burial of Polyneices for he was a traitor to the city . Antigone decides to bury his body and face the consequences of her actions . Creon sentences her to death . Eventually , Creon is convinced to free Antigone from her punishment , but his decision comes too late and Antigone commits suicide . Her suicide triggers the suicide of two others close to King Creon : his son , <unk> , who was to wed Antigone , and his wife , Eurydice , who commits suicide after losing her only surviving son . 
 = = = = Composition and inconsistencies = = = = 
 The plays were written across thirty @-@ six years of Sophocles ' career and were not composed in chronological order , but instead were written in the order Antigone , Oedipus the King , and Oedipus at Colonus . Nor were they composed as a trilogy – a group of plays to be performed together , but are the remaining parts of three different groups of plays . As a result , there are some inconsistencies : notably , Creon is the undisputed king at the end of Oedipus the King and , in consultation with Apollo , single @-@ handedly makes the decision to expel Oedipus from Thebes . Creon is also instructed to look after Oedipus ' daughters Antigone and Ismene at the end of Oedipus the King . By contrast , in the other plays there is some struggle with Oedipus ' sons Eteocles and Polynices in regard to the succession . In Oedipus at Colonus , Sophocles attempts to work these inconsistencies into a coherent whole : Ismene explains that , in light of their tainted family lineage , her brothers were at first willing to cede the throne to Creon . Nevertheless , they eventually decided to take charge of the monarchy , with each brother disputing the other 's right to succeed . In addition to being in a clearly more powerful position in Oedipus at Colonus , Eteocles and Polynices are also culpable : they consent ( l . 429 , <unk> , tr . ) to their father 's going to exile , which is one of his bitterest charges against them . 
 = = = Other plays = = = 
 In addition to the three Theban plays , there are four surviving plays by Sophocles : Ajax , The Women of Trachis , Electra , and Philoctetes , the last of which won first prize in 409 BC in which it competed . 
 Ajax focuses on the proud hero of the Trojan War , <unk> Ajax , who is driven to treachery and eventually suicide . Ajax becomes gravely upset when Achilles ’ armor is presented to Odysseus instead of himself . Despite their enmity toward him , Odysseus persuades the kings Menelaus and Agamemnon to grant Ajax a proper burial . 
 The Women of Trachis ( named for the <unk> women who make up the chorus ) dramatizes Deianeira 's accidentally killing Heracles after he had completed his famous twelve labors . Tricked into thinking it is a love charm , Deianeira applies poison to an article of Heracles ' clothing ; this poisoned robe causes Heracles to die an excruciating death . Upon learning the truth , Deianeira commits suicide . 
 Electra corresponds roughly to the plot of Aeschylus ' Libation Bearers . It details how Electra and Orestes ' avenge their father Agamemnon 's murder by Clytemnestra and <unk> . 
 Philoctetes retells the story of Philoctetes , an archer who had been abandoned on Lemnos by the rest of the Greek fleet while on the way to Troy . After learning that they cannot win the Trojan War without Philoctetes ' bow , the Greeks send Odysseus and Neoptolemus to retrieve him ; due to the Greeks ' earlier treachery , however , Philoctetes refuses to rejoin the army . It is only Heracles ' deus ex machina appearance that persuades Philoctetes to go to Troy . 
 = = = Fragmentary plays = = = 
 Although the list of over 120 titles of plays associated with Sophocles are known and presented below , little is known of the precise dating of most of them . Philoctetes is known to have been written in 409 BC , and Oedipus at Colonus is known to have only been performed in 401 BC , posthumously , at the initiation of Sophocles ' grandson . The convention on writing plays for the Greek festivals was to submit them in <unk> of three tragedies along with one satyr play . Along with the unknown dating of the vast majority of over 120 play titles , it is also largely unknown how the plays were grouped . It is , however , known that the three plays referred to in the modern era as the " Theban plays " were never performed together in Sophocles ' own lifetime , and are therefore not a trilogy ( which they are sometimes erroneously seen as ) . 
 Fragments of <unk> ( Tracking Satyrs ) were discovered in Egypt in 1907 . These amount to about half of the play , making it the best preserved satyr play after Euripides ' Cyclops , which survives in its entirety . Fragments of the Epigoni were discovered in April 2005 by classicists at Oxford University with the help of infrared technology previously used for satellite imaging . The tragedy tells the story of the second siege of Thebes . A number of other <unk> works have survived only in fragments , including : 
 = = = Sophocles ' view of his own work = = = 
 There is a passage of Plutarch 's tract De <unk> in <unk> 7 in which Sophocles discusses his own growth as a writer . A likely source of this material for Plutarch was the <unk> of Ion of Chios , a book that recorded many conversations of Sophocles . This book is a likely candidate to have contained Sophocles ' discourse on his own development because Ion was a friend of Sophocles , and the book is known to have been used by Plutarch . Though some interpretations of Plutarch 's words suggest that Sophocles says that he imitated Aeschylus , the translation does not fit grammatically , nor does the interpretation that Sophocles said that he was making fun of Aeschylus ' works . C. M. Bowra argues for the following translation of the line : " After practising to the full the bigness of Aeschylus , then the painful ingenuity of my own invention , now in the third stage I am changing to the kind of diction which is most expressive of character and best . " 
 Here Sophocles says that he has completed a stage of Aeschylus ' work , meaning that he went through a phase of imitating Aeschylus ' style but is finished with that . Sophocles ' opinion of Aeschylus was mixed . He certainly respected him enough to imitate his work early on in his career , but he had reservations about Aeschylus ' style , and thus did not keep his imitation up . Sophocles ' first stage , in which he imitated Aeschylus , is marked by " <unk> pomp in the language " . Sophocles ' second stage was entirely his own . He introduced new ways of evoking feeling out of an audience , as in his Ajax , when Ajax is mocked by Athene , then the stage is emptied so that he may commit suicide alone . Sophocles mentions a third stage , distinct from the other two , in his discussion of his development . The third stage pays more heed to diction . His characters spoke in a way that was more natural to them and more expressive of their individual character feelings . 
 = Washington State Route 527 = 
 State Route 527 ( SR 527 , also known as the Bothell – Everett Highway ) is a state highway in Snohomish County , of the U.S. state of Washington . It extends 9 @.@ 23 miles ( 14 @.@ 85 km ) north from I @-@ 405 in the city of Bothell , Washington , to an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) , SR 99 , and SR 526 in Everett , Washington . SR 527 intersects SR 524 and SR 96 before ending in Everett . The route serves as a connector between Bothell , Everett , and Mill Creek . 
 The highway itself did not fully open until October 17 , 1969 , and , since its opening , has become increasingly congested , with about 57 @,@ 000 motorists using the highway at its interchange with I @-@ 405 in 2004 . A large construction project to widen the highway and put up sound walls ran from 1991 @-@ 2006 . A 2 @.@ 69 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 33 km ) section of the route was turned over to local authorities in 2011 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 527 links the cities of Bothell , Everett , and Mill Creek , and intersects two highways : SR 524 , and SR 96 WSDOT has found that about 46 @,@ 000 motorists utilize the road daily at I @-@ 405 based on average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) data . 
 SR 527 starts at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 405 . From the interchange , the road heads northeast to Thrashers Corner , where SR 527 intersects SR 524 before moving on to pass Kennard Corner , Silver Creek Park , North Creek County Park , and Mays Pond Park . The highway then intersects 164th Street SE , a major arterial road , in Mill Creek . Beyond 164th Street SE , the road turns to the north , routing traffic past Mill Creek 's town center , Mill Creek Library and Library Park before intersecting a connector to SR 96 westbound . Following the connector , SR 527 intersects SR 96 and runs along the eastern shore of Silver Lake . The route then intersects 112th Street SE , which goes west to the South Everett Freeway Station . From 112th Street , the route continues north to the <unk> Park and Ride , where it turns northwest toward an interchange with I @-@ 5 and then to an intersection with SR 99 , SR 526 , and Broadway , where it terminates . The road continues west from the intersection as SR 526 ( also known as the Boeing Freeway ) , leading to the Boeing Everett Factory , Paine Field , and Mukilteo , Washington . SR 99 runs south from the intersection to the Everett Mall , Seattle , and Fife . An extension of SR 99 , Broadway , continues north from the intersection into downtown Everett .

 In 1923 , before the Primary and Secondary system , SR 527 was part of State Road 1 , which later became U.S. Route 99 ( US 99 ) . In 1937 , the route became part of Secondary State Highway 2A ( SSH 2A ) , but was later removed in 1943 , and readded as SSH 2J in 1957 . It went from PSH 2 BO ( Bothell branch ) in Bothell to SSH 1I and US 99 in Everett . SSH 2J became state highway during the 1964 highway renumbering , in which the Washington State Department of Transportation replaced the previous system of Primary and Secondary Highways with the system of State Routes in use today . 
 SR 527 officially opened on October 17 , 1969 , but eventually became overcrowded , with about 57 @,@ 000 motorists using the road at the I @-@ 405 interchange as of 2004 . To alleviate congestion , an expansion project began in 1991 that was completed in 2006 . The first stage of the project involved widening the road between 228th Street SE and SR @-@ 524 to five – seven lanes , as well as minor improvements at its interchange with I @-@ 405 . The second stage widened the roadway to five lanes between SR 524 and 164th Street , while the third widened the road between 164th Street SE and SR 96 . The fourth and most complex stage widened the road between SR 96 and 112th Street SE . This stage involved expanding the SR 527 / SR 96 intersection dramatically and raising the roadway near Silver Lake , along with numerous pedestrian and aesthetic improvements . 
 On May 4 , 2011 , Gov. Christine Gregoire signed into law HB 1520 which turned over the responsibility of a 2 @.@ 69 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 4 @.@ 33 km ) section between I @-@ 405 and SR 522 from the state to the City of Bothell . The transferred section will be developed into a suburban multi @-@ way boulevard with pedestrian walkways and bikeways .

 = Hurricane Paul ( 2006 ) = 
 Hurricane Paul was a hurricane that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006 . It developed from an area of disturbed weather on October 21 , and slowly intensified as it moved into an area of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear . Paul attained hurricane status on October 23 , and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , a strong Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . A strong trough turned the hurricane to the north and northeast into an area of strong vertical shear , and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October 24 . It accelerated northeastward , and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled from the rest of the convection . Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October 25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico , and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October 26 . 
 Paul was the third hurricane to threaten western Mexico in the season , the others being Hurricanes John and Lane . Rough surf killed two people along Baja California Sur , while flooding was reported in Sinaloa . Damage totaled more than $ 35 million ( 2006 MXN , $ 3 @.@ 2 million 2006 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 4 . It moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean without development , and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on October 18 . The next day , it combined with a previously existing area of disturbed weather , resulting in a large area of convection extending northward into southern Mexico . The broad and disorganized system moved westward at 10 – 15 mph ( 16 – 24 km / h ) . On October 20 , the system developed an area of low pressure , and began to show signs of organization . It continued to organize , and developed into Tropical Depression Seventeen @-@ E on October 21 while located about 265 miles ( 425 km ) south @-@ southwest of Manzanillo . Upon forming , the depression possessed a small , tight low @-@ level circulation beneath a well @-@ defined mid @-@ level circulation . Easterly wind shear initially restricted upper @-@ level outflow as the cyclone moved to the west , a motion due to a subtropical ridge to its north . 
 The cloud pattern of the depression quickly became better organized as a curved band developed around intensifying deep <unk> , and it is estimated the system intensified into Tropical Storm Paul just six hours after forming . Easterly wind shear exposed the low level circulation to the east of the area of deep convection , though Paul continued to intensify as it moved through an area of warm waters and progressively weakening wind shear . The low level circulation gradually became more embedded within the convection as the cloud pattern improved . Computer models had troubles in forecasting the future of the storm early in its life ; the GFDL model forecast Paul to reach winds of 119 mph ( 191 km / h ) , while global models expected the system to dissipate in 48 – 72 hours . Early on October 22 , wind shear began to decrease , which coincided with an increase of outflow on its eastern side . The storm temporarily degraded in appearance as it turned to the northwest . However , shear sharply abated over Paul late on October 22 , resulting in the storm quickly gaining organization and intensifying . An eye began to develop within the convection , and Paul intensified into a hurricane early on October 23 . 
 Located in an area of warm water temperatures and light wind shear , Hurricane Paul continued to intensify and organize ; its well @-@ defined eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection while outflow remained strong to the north and south . On October 23 , while located 465 miles ( 750 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas , Paul reached its peak intensity of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Scale . A large trough located off the west coast of California turned the hurricane to the north @-@ northwest , and later to the north . The combination of increasing shear and dry air quickly weakened Paul to a tropical storm on October 24 as its low @-@ level circulation became detached from the diminishing convection . The storm then turned to the northeast after passing near Socorro Island . Despite increasing wind shear of over 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , Paul remained a tropical storm while its circulation remained on the southwest side of its developing deep convection . Early on October 25 , the storm passed about 100 miles ( 160 km ) south of the southern tip of Baja California . The circulation briefly became involved with the deep convection as it accelerated northeastward , though as it approached the coast of Sinaloa , the center again decoupled from the upper level circulation . Later that day , Paul weakened to a tropical depression a short distance off the coast of Mexico , and turned to the north . Early the next day , the depression , devoid of any deep convection , made landfall near Isla Altamura in northwestern Sinaloa . Hours later , the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 As Paul became a hurricane , the government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for Baja California Sur from Agua Blanca on the west coast to La Paz on the east coast . When a weakening trend was evident as the storm turned to the northeast , the hurricane watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning . 45 hours before the storm struck land , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch from Mazatlán to San Evaristo along the coast of Sinaloa . When Paul was expected to weaken to a tropical depression before landfall , the tropical storm watch for mainland Mexico was discontinued . When Paul retained tropical storm status for longer than expected , and was now expected to make landfall as a tropical storm , a tropical storm warning was issued from Mazatlán to <unk> , which was later discontinued as Paul weakened to a tropical depression . 
 Emergency officials near the southern tip of Baja California closed schools , while rescue workers ordered for the evacuation of more than 1 @,@ 500 people from shanty towns . Local police officers went door @-@ to @-@ door to inform the potentially affected residents . Buses carried the evacuated citizens to schools temporarily set up as shelters . A hotel in Cabo San Lucas informed its guests of the approaching storm , and organized indoor activities for those that stayed . Several tourists ended their vacations early and left through local airports . The threat of the storm closed the port at Cabo San Lucas , causing delays in a local fishing competition . In Sinaloa , authorities evacuated over 5 @,@ 000 families in risk of flooding . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The National Hurricane Center noted that the precursor disturbance had the potential to drop heavy rainfall which could result in life @-@ threatening flash flooding or mudslides in Oaxaca and Guerrero . However , no damage reports were received there . 
 In southern Baja California , a fisherman slipped off rocks due to strong seas , while an American tourist was swept out to sea due to rough surf ; both were killed . Two others were killed in Sinaloa when their truck was swept away by a swollen river . Paul was the third hurricane in the year to threaten Los Cabos , the others being John and Lane . The hurricane caused little damage in the area , only producing gusty winds and some rainfall . Paul dropped moderate rainfall across mainland Mexico , including a 24 @-@ hour total of 2 @.@ 3 inches ( 58 mm ) in Mazatlán , Sinaloa and over 8 inches ( 200 mm ) in isolated locations . The rainfall led to flooding , the worst of which occurred in Villa Juarez . There , a canal overflowed , while the rainfall flooded streets with up to 3 @.@ 3 feet ( 1 m ) of water . 5 @,@ 000 houses were damaged from the flooding , displacing 20 @,@ 000 people . The storm damaged more than 3 @,@ 700 acres ( 15 km2 ) of crop lands , primarily beans and corn . Damage totaled more than $ 35 million ( 2006 MXN , $ 3 @.@ 2 million 2006 USD ) . 
 = Triumph International = 
 Triumph International is an international underwear manufacturer founded in 1886 in <unk> , Germany . The company 's headquarters has been located in Bad Zurzach since 1977 , and it has branches in 50 countries . In addition to the Triumph brand , the company produces and distributes the products under the brands sloggi and BeeDees . Triumph International has been an industry leader , particularly in women 's and sleepwear , since the 1960s . Shares of the German subsidiary have been traded on the stock exchange until 2011 . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1886 , Johann Gottfried <unk> and Michael Braun founded a factory for the production of corsets in <unk> ( Baden @-@ Wurttemberg ) . They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines . That number rose to 150 people in 1890 , and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad , to England . It was only in 1902 that <unk> and Braun registered the Triumph brand , which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe , to which International was later added . After the economic boom in the 1920s , demand for the classic corset declined , which is why the company began parallel production of brassieres . In the 1930s , Triumph International also began producing <unk> . 
 In 1933 , the first foreign branch was set up in Bad Zurzach ( Switzerland ) . With the division of Germany in 1949 , the Triumph International brand continued in the German Democratic Republic , but business activities there came to a virtual standstill . However , the internationalization of the company continued in the following period and beginning in the 1950s , offices were opened in Belgium , Great Britain , Sweden , Norway and Austria . Triumph International further expanded in 1960 by establishing its Asia @-@ Pacific region headquarters in Hong Kong , and opening its first Japanese branch in 1963 . At the time , observers already described it as a " cunning web " of companies , some of which were registered in the tax havens of Liechtenstein and Bermuda . In the late 1960s , Triumph International 's market share for corsetry in Germany was about 50 percent . 
 At that time , the group had generated sales of 620 million Deutsche Mark and employed 22 @,@ 600 employees . In the mid @-@ 1960s Triumph International introduced broad scale electronic data processing . Due to the economic crisis , the company encountered significant difficulties for the first time at the beginning of the 1970s , meaning the company even had to introduce short @-@ term work . The crisis also affected the company ’ s tights sales , which they had begun in 1969 and discontinued only three years later . At the same time , Triumph International began for the first time to produce products from lighter fabrics with fibers such as nylon or lycra . 
 At the end of the 1970s , the new sloggi brand was introduced , under which underwear and other products with high cotton content were marketed . The company moved its headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in 1977 , and its holding has since been headquartered in Bad Zurzach . By 1986 , sales increased to 996 million Swiss francs and the number of employees fell slightly to 19 @,@ 000 employees . At the same time , sales began in the People 's Republic of China and beginning in 1988 , individual Triumph products were manufactured under license in East Germany for the local market . This included swimwear in addition to underwear . 
 With the takeover of two French name brands , HOM and Valisère , Triumph International ventured into the men 's underwear and high @-@ quality lingerie market . At the same time , the company announced in 1995 that in the future it would focus more on its Triumph umbrella brand , under which a number of brands would be classified . To that end , an advertising campaign was launched featuring Naomi Campbell and Helena Christensen . In the 1990s , Triumph International launched another phase of international expansion , and since 1998 it has been present on the subcontinent of India . In 2001 , its newest production facility opened in Dunaújváros ( Hungary ) . After the turn of the millennium , Triumph was one of the biggest textile manufacturers in terms of sales in the domestic market . 
 From 2008 to 2012 , the company hosted the Triumph Inspiration Awards , where lingerie designers were able to compete according to an annually changing theme . The entries were evaluated both by a jury and according to the votes by visitors to the competition website . In 2009 , the competition attracted broader attention , particularly as that event was held in London . Initially a local competition was held in the participating countries prior to the international final competition . 
 Since 2012 , all the collections of Triumph International have been tested for harmful substances and certified under the <unk> @-@ <unk> standard for textiles , after individual products had been successfully tested as early as 1993 when the initiative was established . 
 In recent years , the company has expanded , opening new stores of its own and acquiring competitors . In 2010 , Triumph International acquired <unk> , the leading Swiss distributor of lingerie , and later purchased other distributors in Mexico and the United States . In the latter country , Triumph International has also acquired the majority stake in the luxury dealer <unk> and has since opened two Triumph stores in New York City . The Triumph International AG , headquartered in Munich , under which the company 's German business is associated , was once again fully acquired by the company in 2011 through the exclusion of minority shareholders . Since then , company stocks have no longer been traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange , and the company is wholly owned by the Braun and <unk> families . 
 = = Brands = = 
 The Triumph brand is the focus of the company . Products are divided into several categories for different target groups , with Triumph International typically presenting several collections each year . As of 2010 , the importance of shapewear for the company increased , and Triumph 's sale of these products attracted special attention . In 2013 , Triumph was honored as one of the best brands . In 2015 , the Magic Wire bra received the Red Dot Design Award . 
 In the late 1970s , Triumph International launched the sloggi cotton underwear brand , at first only for female customers and later also with products for men ( sloggi Men ) and swimwear ( sloggi swim ) . Since the 1980s , Triumph International has also been targeting young customers aged up to 25 years old with the BeeDees brand . The products are characterized by accessories and patterned fabrics . In addition to sloggi and BeeDees , the company has also been marketing sports bras under <unk> since the late 1990s . 
 In the 1980s HOM , the French manufacturer of upscale underwear for men , was purchased and has since continued as a trademark within the company . The headquarters was located in Marseille . In early 2015 , HOM was sold to the Austrian Huber Group , as Triumph wanted to streamline its portfolio . Valisère is the label for upper segment products , which beginning in 2007 became also available in Germany and was used primarily for luxury lingerie . Since 2014 , Triumph International no longer uses the Valisère brand in the European market . Instead , the company focuses on Triumph Essence in the premium segment . 
 Triumph products are distributed both via trade partners and department stores , as well as in their own shops . By the end of 2011 , the company had built a network of 2 @,@ 000 stores in 120 countries , of which 800 are its own stores , 450 are franchises and 850 are run with other partners . The company is one of the largest lingerie retailers in Germany based on the number of branches . The largest branch in terms of retail space was opened in Dresden 's Centrum Gallery in 2012 . In addition , Triumph International operates several online stores . These were developed using a fulfillment service provider that is part of <unk> .

 In 2002 , Triumph International had to close its factory in Myanmar due to public pressure . The Berne Declaration and Clean Clothes Campaign accused the company of renting land from the country 's military regime and thus indirectly supporting it . In January 2002 , Triumph International announced that it would close the affected factory and offer a social plan for the remaining employees because no buyer had been found . Moreover , Triumph International clarified that there had not been any forced laborers among the employees . 
 In October 2003 , the self @-@ regulatory body of the French advertising industry criticized Triumph International for a campaign for the sloggi brand . At the center of the protest was a picture of scantily clad women on billboards which advertised thongs under the slogan " It 's String Time " . It was claimed that the ads violated the dignity of women and harmed the public perception of advertising , but the company did not adjust the campaign . It was also criticized for the same reason by leading French politicians like Ségolène Royal . 
 In 2008 , Triumph International came under fire after a female president of a local union was dismissed in Thailand . She had appeared on a Thai evening television program with a T @-@ shirt on which a political statement could be seen . The company 's management had the view that the appearance had harmed their public image and therefore laid off the staff member in question . The international work council of the company , Triumph International Labor Union , protested and collected 2 @,@ 500 signatures to petition for the rehiring of the union president , supported in solidarity in Germany , inter alia , by the <unk> youth . In November 2008 , the Labor Court in Bangkok found the lay @-@ off to have been lawful . 
 Most recently , Triumph International has been the subject of even greater criticism after mass layoffs in Thailand and the Philippines at the end of 2009 were met with transnational protests by trade unions . The company regretted this step and made it clear that it was necessitated by the global economic crisis . Allegations that , parallel to the redundancies , another location was being set up in Thailand , were rejected . 
 = French battleship Lorraine = 
 Lorraine was a battleship of the French Navy built in the 1910s , named in honor of the region of Lorraine in France . She was a member of the Bretagne class , alongside her two sister ships , Bretagne and Provence . Lorraine was laid down in August 1912 at the Chantiers de Penhoët shipyard , launched in September 1913 , and commissioned into the fleet in March 1916 , after the outbreak of World War I. She was armed with a main battery of ten 340 mm ( 13 in ) guns and had a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 Lorraine spent the bulk of her career in the French Mediterranean Squadron . During World War I , she was stationed at Corfu to prevent the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet from leaving the Adriatic Sea , but she saw no action . She was modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s , and in 1935 her amidships 340 mm gun turret was removed and aircraft facilities were installed in its place . After the outbreak of World War II , Lorraine carried a shipment of gold from the French treasury to Bermuda before returning to operate in the Mediterranean . At the French surrender in July 1940 , Lorraine was moored in Alexandria , where she was disarmed by the Royal Navy . After joining the Free French Naval Forces in December 1942 , Lorraine was refitted for active service . She provided gunfire support for the landings in Operation Dragoon in August – September 1944 and bombarded German positions around La Rochelle in April 1945 . After the end of the war , Lorraine was used was a gunnery training ship and then a barracks ship until late 1953 , when she was stricken and sold to shipbreakers . 
 = = Design = = 
 Lorraine was 166 meters ( 544 ft 7 in ) long overall and had a beam of 26 @.@ 9 m ( 88 ft 3 in ) and a full @-@ load draft of 9 @.@ 8 m ( 32 ft 2 in ) . She displaced 23 @,@ 230 metric tons ( 22 @,@ 860 long tons ) as designed and around 25 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ; 28 @,@ 000 short tons ) at full load and had a crew of between 1124 and 1133 officers and enlisted men . She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines with twenty @-@ four Guyot du Temple water @-@ tube boilers . They were rated at 29 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 22 @,@ 000 kW ) and provided a top speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Coal storage amounted to 2 @,@ 680 t ( 2 @,@ 640 long tons ; 2 @,@ 950 short tons ) , which provided a range of 4 @,@ 700 nmi ( 8 @,@ 700 km ; 5 @,@ 400 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Lorraine 's main battery consisted of ten 340mm / 45 Modèle 1912 guns mounted in five twin gun turrets , numbered from front to rear . They were placed all on the centerline ; two were in a superfiring pair forward , one amidships , and the last two in a superfiring arrangement aft . As completed , however , the amidships turret did not have its guns installed until January 1917 . The secondary battery consisted of twenty @-@ two Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1910 guns in casemates along the length of the hull . She also carried seven 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns , two on the conning tower and one on the roof of each turret . The ship was also armed with four submerged 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's main belt was 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick and the main armored deck was 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The main battery was protected by up to 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of armor on the turrets and the casemates for the secondary guns were 170 mm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) thick . The conning tower had 314 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) thick sides . 
 = = Service = = 
 Lorraine was ordered on 15 July 1912 , as a replacement for the battleship Liberté , which had been destroyed by a magazine explosion the previous year . She was laid down at the Chantiers de Penhoët shipyard in Saint @-@ Nazaire on 1 August 1912 and launched on 30 September 1913 . She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 March 1916 . After entering service in 1916 , Lorraine and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron . The three ships remained in the unit for the remainder of the war . They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic . The fleet 's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece , which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente . Later in the war , men were drawn from their crews for anti @-@ submarine warfare vessels . As the Austro @-@ Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war , Lorraine saw no action during the conflict . In 1917 , she returned to Toulon for a periodic refit , but apart from that voyage , she saw no time at sea for the rest of the year . 
 In January 1919 , she went to Cattaro , where she guarded the former Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . She assisted in repatriating Austrian naval personnel , and escorted former Austro @-@ Hungarian warships to France and Italy ; this duty lasted until March . The French Navy intended to send Lorraine and her sister Provence to the Black Sea to join operations against the Bolsheviks , but a major mutiny prevented the operation . The two ships went to Constantinople in October 1919 , where they formed the core of the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron , which operated until July 1921 . Lorraine underwent her first refit starting on 10 November 1921 , which lasted until 4 December 1922 . After emerging from refit , Lorraine was placed in reserve , due to fiscal limitations in the post @-@ war French Navy . She returned to service the following year — 1923 — with the 1st Battleship Division of the Mediterranean Fleet . 
 Lorraine was modernized a second time between 15 November 1924 and 4 August 1926 . A third refit followed on 17 September 1929 and lasted until 6 June 1931 . During these periods in dock , the range of the main battery was increased , the anti @-@ aircraft battery was strengthened , and her boilers were replaced with newer , oil @-@ fired models . Between 18 September 1934 and 20 September 1935 , a fourth and final pre @-@ war refit was carried out in Brest ; Lorraine 's amidships turret was removed , and an aircraft catapult along with a hangar for three aircraft were installed . The aircraft were initially Gourdou @-@ Leseurre <unk> and Potez 452 seaplanes , though they were later replaced with Loire 130 flying boats . In 1936 , Lorraine was transferred to the Atlantic Squadron , where she remained until the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 After the start of World War II , Lorraine served primarily in the western Mediterranean . On 4 December , Lorraine operated out of Casablanca against German surface forces , along with the cruisers <unk> , La Galissonnière , and Marseillaise , and several destroyers and submarines . During this period , she carried a shipment of gold bullion from the French treasury to Bermuda . On 1 January 1940 , she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Squadron , and went into drydock for refit , which lasted until April . 
 On 27 April , Lorraine and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria . On 10 June , Italy declared war on France ; by that time , both Bretagne and Provence had moved back to the western Mediterranean . Lorraine was the only French capital ship in the eastern Mediterranean , though she was joined by four British battleships and an aircraft carrier . On the night of 20 – 21 June , Lorraine formed the center of an Anglo @-@ French task force , with the cruisers HMS Neptune , Orion , and Achilles , for a bombardment of Italian positions at Bardia . The operation , which caused only minimal damage , was the last combined British and French naval operation before the French surrender . 
 Following the French surrender , the French commander , Vice Admiral Godfroy , concluded an agreement with Admiral Andrew Cunningham to demilitarize and intern the French ships in Alexandria ; this included Lorraine , four cruisers , and three destroyers . In December 1942 , the ship 's crew decided to join the Allies in the Free French Naval Forces , and so Lorraine was placed back into service . On 3 July 1943 , the ship left the Suez and sailed around Africa to Dakar , stopping in Cape Town on the way . After arriving on 12 October , she was used briefly as a training ship ; on 2 December , Lorraine was sent to Oran for refitting . The work included removing the aircraft facilities and installing a large number of anti @-@ aircraft guns , including eight 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns , fourteen 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) guns , and twenty @-@ five 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . Radar equipment was also installed on the ship . 
 The overhaul readied Lorraine to participate in Operation Dragoon , the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944 . On 15 August , Lorraine joined the bombardment force , Task Force 86 , that supported landings . She and the American battleship USS Nevada hammered German defenses in and around Toulon , including 340 mm coastal guns that had been removed from Provence . The bombardment lasted until 21 August . Over the course of 1 – 13 September , Lorraine , four cruisers , and two destroyers shelled German defenses throughout the French Riviera . Among the targets Lorraine attacked were fortresses at <unk> and Castillon , along with Axis positions around <unk> and Saint @-@ Tropez . Lorraine left the bombardment area on 17 September , but remained in the western Mediterranean until she was sent to Portsmouth for a brief refit toward the end of the year . She was then sent to Cherbourg in December . 
 In late March 1945 , Lorraine left Cherbourg to participate in her final wartime operations , codenamed <unk> and <unk> . In the operations , which took place in April , the French Navy focused on eliminating a pocket of German resistance in Gironde . On 14 – 20 April , Lorraine and several cruisers and destroyers bombarded the German " <unk> @-@ Nord " fortress in Royan in support of an attack by the French 10th Division and American 66th Division ; the German defenders surrendered on the 20th . After completing the operation , Lorraine returned to Brest before being sent to Toulon . Starting in February 1947 , she was used as a stationary gunnery training ship . Later , she was used as a barracks ship , until she was stricken from the naval register on 17 February 1953 . She was sold on 18 December , to a French shipbreaking company , and towed to <unk> outside Toulon in January 1954 and broken up for scrap . 
 = Stanley Holloway = 
 Stanley Augustus Holloway , OBE ( 1 October 1890 – 30 January 1982 ) was an English stage and film actor , comedian , singer , poet and <unk> . He was famous for his comic and character roles on stage and screen , especially that of Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady . He was also renowned for his comic monologues and songs which he performed and recorded throughout most of his 70 @-@ year career . 
 Born in London , Holloway pursued a career as a clerk in his teen years . He made early stage appearances before infantry service in the First World War , after which he had his first major theatre success starring in Kissing Time when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway . In 1921 , he joined a concert party , The Co @-@ Optimists , and his career began to flourish . At first , he was employed chiefly as a singer , but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised . Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small , invented by Holloway , and Albert Ramsbottom , created for him by Marriott Edgar , were absorbed into popular British culture , and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues . By the 1930s , he was in demand to star in variety , pantomime and musical comedy , including several revues . 
 Following the outbreak of the Second World War , Holloway made short propaganda films on behalf of the British Film Institute and Pathé News and took character parts in a series of war films including Major Barbara , The Way Ahead , This Happy Breed and The Way to the Stars . After the war , he appeared in the film Brief Encounter and made a series of films for Ealing Studios , including Passport to Pimlico , The Lavender Hill Mob and The Titfield Thunderbolt . 
 In 1956 he was cast as the irresponsible and irrepressible Alfred P. Doolittle in My Fair Lady , a role that he played on Broadway , the West End and in the film version in 1964 . The role brought him international fame , and his performances earned him nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . In his later years , Holloway appeared in television series in the UK and the US , toured in revues , appeared in stage plays in Britain , Canada , Australia and the US , and continued to make films into his eighties . Holloway was married twice and had five children , including the actor Julian Holloway . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Family background and early life = = = 
 Holloway was born in Manor Park , Essex ( now in the London Borough of Newham ) , the younger child and only son of George Augustus Holloway ( 1860 – 1919 ) , a lawyer 's clerk , and Florence May née Bell ( 1862 – 1913 ) , a housekeeper and dressmaker . He was named after Henry Morton Stanley , the journalist and explorer famous for his exploration of Africa and for his search for David Livingstone . There were theatrical connections in the Holloway family going back to Charles Bernard ( 1830 – 1894 ) , an actor and theatre manager , who was the brother of Holloway 's maternal grandmother . 
 Holloway 's paternal grandfather , Augustus Holloway ( 1829 – 1884 ) , an orphan , was brought up by John Stone , a sailmaker , and his wife Mary , in Poole , Dorset . Augustus became a wealthy shopkeeper , running his own brush @-@ making business . He married Amelia Catherine Knight in September 1856 , and they had three children , Maria , Charles and George . 
 In the early 1880s the family moved to Poplar , London . When Augustus died , George Holloway ( Stanley 's father ) moved to nearby Manor Park and became a clerk for a city lawyer , Robert Bell . George married Bell 's daughter Florence in 1884 , and they had two children , Millie ( 1887 – 1949 ) and Stanley . George left Florence in 1905 and was never seen or heard from again by his family . 
 During his early teenage years , Holloway attended the Worshipful School of Carpenters in nearby Stratford and joined a local choir , which he later called his " big moment " . He left school at the age of 14 and worked as a junior clerk in a boot polish factory , where he earned ten shillings a week . He began performing part @-@ time as Master Stanley Holloway – The Wonderful Boy Soprano from 1904 , singing sentimental songs such as " The Lost Chord " . A year later , he became a clerk at Billingsgate Fish Market , where he remained for two years before commencing training as an infantry soldier in the London Rifle Brigade in 1907 .

 Holloway 's stage career began in 1910 , when he travelled to Walton @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Naze to audition for The White Coons Show , a concert party variety show arranged and produced by Will S. Pepper , father of Harry S. Pepper , with whom Holloway later starred in The Co @-@ Optimists . This seaside show lasted six weeks . 
 In 1913 Holloway was recruited by the comedian Leslie Henson to feature as a support in Henson 's more prestigious concert party called <unk> , Thanks . In later life , Holloway often spoke of his admiration for Henson , citing him as a great influence on his career . The two became firm friends and often consulted each other before taking jobs . In his 1967 autobiography , Holloway dedicated a whole chapter to Henson , whom he described as " the greatest friend , inspiration and mentor a performer could have had " . Later in 1913 , Holloway decided to train as an operatic baritone , and so he went to Italy to take singing lessons from Ferdinando Guarino in Milan . However , a yearning to start a career in light entertainment and a contract to re @-@ appear in Bert Graham and Will Bentley 's concert party at the West Cliff Theatre caused him to return home after six months . 
 In the early months of 1914 , Holloway made his first visit to the US and then went to Buenos Aires and Valparaíso with the concert party The <unk> . At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 , he decided to return to the UK , but his departure was delayed for six weeks due to his contract with the troupe . At the age of 25 , Holloway enlisted in the Connaught Rangers . In December 1915 he was commissioned as a subaltern because of his previous training as a private in the London Rifle Brigade . He was stationed in Cork and initially fought against Sinn Féin during the Easter Rising of 1916 . Later that year , he was sent to France , where he fought in the trenches alongside Michael O 'Leary , who later won the Victoria Cross for gallantry . Holloway and O 'Leary stayed in touch after the war , becoming close friends . 
 Holloway spent much of his time in the later part of the war organising shows to boost troop morale in France . One such revue , Wear That Ribbon , was performed in honour of O 'Leary 's winning the VC . Holloway , along with Henson and his newly established Star Attractions concert party , entertained the British troops in Wimereux . The party included such performers as Jack Buchanan , Eric Blore , Binnie Hale and Phyllis Dare , as well as the performers who would later form The Co @-@ Optimists . Upon his return from France , Holloway joined a Yorkshire regiment in Hartlepool and immediately after the war ended he starred in The Disorderly Room with Leslie Henson , which Eric Blore had written while serving in the South Wales Borderers . It toured theatres on England 's south coast , including Walton @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Naze and Clacton @-@ on @-@ Sea .

 On being demobilised on 1 May 1919 , Holloway returned to London and resumed his singing and acting career , finding success in two West End musicals at the Winter Garden Theatre . Later that month , he created the role of Captain Wentworth in Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse 's Kissing Time , followed in 1920 by the role of René in A Night Out . Following its provincial success , The Disorderly Room was given a West End production at the Victoria Palace Theatre in late 1919 , in which Holloway starred alongside Henson and Tom Walls . Holloway made his film debut in a 1921 silent comedy called The <unk> . 
 From June 1921 , Holloway had considerable success in The Co @-@ Optimists , a concert party formed with performers whom he had met during the war in France , which The Times called " an all @-@ star ' pierrot ' entertainment in the West @-@ end . " It opened at the small Royalty Theatre and soon transferred to the much larger Palace Theatre , where the initial version of the show ran for over a year , giving more than 500 performances . The entertainment was completely rewritten at regular intervals to keep it fresh , and the final edition , beginning in November 1926 , was the 13th version . The Co @-@ Optimists closed in 1927 at His Majesty 's Theatre after 1 @,@ 568 performances over eight years . In 1929 , a feature film version was made , with Holloway rejoining his former co @-@ stars . 
 In 1923 Holloway established himself as a BBC Radio performer . The early BBC broadcasts brought variety and classical artists together , and Holloway could be heard in the same programme as the cellist John Barbirolli or the Band of the Scots Guards . He developed his solo act throughout the 1920s while continuing his involvement with the musical theatre and The Co @-@ Optimists . In 1924 he made his first gramophone discs , recording for HMV two songs from The Co @-@ Optimists : " London Town " and " Memory Street " . After The Co @-@ Optimists disbanded in 1927 , Holloway played at the London Hippodrome in Vincent Youmans 's musical comedy Hit the Deck as Bill Smith , a performance judged by The Times to be " invested with many shrewd touches of humanity " . In The Manchester Guardian , Ivor Brown praised him for a singing style " which coaxes the ear rather than clubbing the head . " 
 Holloway began regularly performing monologues , both on stage and on record , in 1928 , with his own creation , Sam Small , in Sam , Sam , Pick oop thy Musket . Over the following years , he recorded more than 20 monologues based around the character , most of which he wrote himself . He created Sam Small after Henson had returned from a tour of northern England and told him a story about an insubordinate old soldier from the Battle of Waterloo . Holloway developed the character , naming him after a Cockney friend of Henson called Annie Small ; the name Sam was chosen at random . Holloway adopted a northern accent for the character . The Times commented , " For absolute delight ... there is nothing to compare with Mr. Stanley Holloway 's monologue , concerning a military contretemps on the eve of Waterloo ... perfect , even to the curled moustache and the Lancashire accent of the stubborn Guardsman hero . " 
 In 1929 Holloway played another leading role in musical comedy , Lieutenant Richard Manners in Song of the Sea , and later that year he performed in the revue Coo @-@ ee , with Billy Bennett , Dorothy Dickson and Claude Hulbert . When The Co @-@ Optimists re @-@ formed in 1930 , he rejoined that company , now at the Savoy Theatre , and at the same venue appeared in Savoy Follies in 1931 , where he introduced to London audiences the monologue The Lion and Albert . The monologue was written by Marriott Edgar , who based the story on a news item about a boy who was eaten by a lion in the zoo . In the monologue , Mr. and Mrs. Ramsbottom react in a measured way when their son Albert is swallowed . Neither Edgar nor Holloway was convinced that the piece would succeed , but needing material for an appearance at a Northern Rugby League dinner Holloway decided to perform it . It was well received , and Holloway introduced it into his stage act . Subsequently , Edgar wrote 16 monologues for him . In its obituary of Holloway , The Times wrote that Sam and Albert " became part of English folklore during the 1930s , and they remained so during the Second World War . " These monologues employed the Holloway style that has been called " the understated look @-@ on @-@ the @-@ bright @-@ side world of the cockney working class . ... Holloway 's characters are [ mischievous , like Albert , or ] obstinate , and hilariously clueless . He often told his stories in costume ; sporting outrageous attire and bushy moustaches . " 
 Beginning in 1934 , Holloway appeared in a series of British films , three of which featured his creation Sam Small . He started his association with the filmmakers Ealing Studios in 1934 , appearing in the fifth Gracie Fields picture Sing As We Go . His other films from the 1930s included <unk> ( 1935 ) and The Vicar of Bray ( 1937 ) . In December 1934 , Holloway made his first appearance in pantomime , playing <unk> in Aladdin . In his first season in the part , he was overshadowed by his co @-@ star , Sir Henry Lytton , as the Emperor , but he quickly became established as a favourite in his role , playing it in successive years in Leeds , London , Edinburgh and Manchester . 
 = = = = Second World War and post @-@ war = = = = 
 On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 Holloway was 49 , too old for active service . Instead , he made his contribution in short propaganda pieces for the British Film Institute and Pathé News . He narrated documentaries aimed at lifting morale in war @-@ torn Britain , including Albert 's Savings ( 1940 ) , written by Marriott Edgar and featuring the character Albert Ramsbottom , and Worker and <unk> No.8 ( 1943 ) , with a script written by E. C. Bentley about a worker who neglects to have an injury examined and contracts blood poisoning . Both films were included on a 2007 Imperial War Museum DVD Britain 's Home Front at War : Words for Battle . 
 On stage during the war years , Holloway appeared in revues , first Up and Doing , with Henson , Binnie Hale and Cyril Ritchard in 1940 and 1941 , and then Fine and Dandy , with Henson , Dorothy Dickson , Douglas Byng and Graham Payn . In both shows , Holloway presented new monologues , and The Times thought a highlight of Fine and Dandy was a parody of the BBC radio programme The Brains Trust , with Holloway " ponderously anecdotal " and Henson " <unk> omniscient " . 
 In 1941 Holloway took a character part in Gabriel Pascal 's film of Bernard Shaw 's Major Barbara , in which he played a policeman . He had leading parts in later films , including The Way Ahead ( 1944 ) , This Happy Breed ( 1944 ) and The Way to the Stars ( 1945 ) . After the war , he played Albert Godby in Brief Encounter and had a cameo role as the First Gravedigger in Laurence Olivier 's 1948 film of Hamlet . In 1951 Holloway played the same role on the stage to the Hamlet of Alec Guinness . For Pathé News , he delivered the commentary for documentaries in a series called Time To Remember , where he narrated over old newsreels from significant dates in history from 1915 to 1942 . Holloway also starred in a series of films for Ealing Studios , beginning with Champagne Charlie in 1944 alongside Tommy Trinder . After that he made Nicholas Nickleby ( 1947 ) and Another Shore ( 1948 ) . He next appeared in three of the most famous Ealing Comedies , Passport to Pimlico ( 1949 ) , The Lavender Hill Mob ( 1951 ) and The Titfield Thunderbolt ( 1953 ) . His final film with the studio was Meet Mr. Lucifer ( 1953 ) . 
 In 1948 Holloway toured for six months in Australia around Melbourne and in New Zealand supported by the band leader Billy <unk> . He made his Australian début at The Tivoli Theatre , Melbourne , and recorded television appearances to publicise the forthcoming release of Passport to Pimlico . Holloway wrote the monologue Albert Down Under especially for the tour .

 In 1954 Holloway joined the Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania . After playing at the Edinburgh Festival , the Royal Shakespeare Company took the production to New York , where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada . The production was harshly reviewed by critics on both sides of the Atlantic , but Holloway made a strong impression . Holloway said of the experience : " Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them , playing Bottom . ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on , well , just let 's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was very pleasant at my age . " Holloway 's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work ; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy . American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s . 
 In 1956 Holloway created the role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the original Broadway production of My Fair Lady . The librettist , Alan Jay Lerner , remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role , even before it was written . Lerner 's only concern was whether , after so long away from the musical stage , Holloway still had his resonant singing voice . Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge 's : Lerner recalled , " He put down his knife and fork , threw back his head and unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room , drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks <unk> . " Holloway had a long association with the show , appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre , the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane , and the film version in 1964 , which he undertook instead of the role of Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins that he had been offered the same year . In The Manchester Guardian , Alistair Cooke wrote , " Stanley Holloway <unk> into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England . " Also in 1964 , he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of The <unk> . 
 Looking back in 2004 , Holloway 's biographer Eric Midwinter wrote , " With his cockney authenticity , his splendid baritone voice , and his wealth of comedy experience , he made a great success of this role , and , as he said , it put him ' bang on top of the heap , in demand ' again at a time when , in his mid @-@ sixties , his career was beginning to wane " . His performances earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role . Following his success on Broadway , Holloway played Pooh @-@ Bah in a 1960 US television Bell Telephone Hour production of The Mikado , produced by the veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer Martyn Green . Holloway appeared with Groucho Marx and Helen Traubel of the Metropolitan Opera . His notable films around this time included Alive and Kicking in 1959 , co @-@ starring Sybil Thorndike and Kathleen Harrison , and No Love for Johnnie in 1961 opposite Peter Finch . In 1962 , Holloway took part in a studio recording of Oliver ! with Alma Cogan and Violet Carson , in which he played Fagin . 
 In 1962 Holloway played the role of an English butler called Higgins in a US television sitcom called Our Man Higgins . It ran for only a season . His son Julian also appeared in the series . In 1964 he again appeared on stage in Philadelphia in Cool Off ! , a short @-@ lived Faustian spoof . He returned to the US a few more times after that to take part in The Dean Martin Show three times and The Red Skelton Show twice . He also appeared in the 1965 war film In Harm 's Way , together with John Wayne and Kirk Douglas .

 Holloway appeared for the first time in a major British television series in the BBC 's 1967 adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse 's Blandings Castle stories , playing Beach , the butler , to Ralph Richardson 's Lord Emsworth . His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation , but the series was a popular success . After My Fair Lady , Holloway was able to get film roles in Mrs. Brown You 've Got A Lovely Daughter ( 1968 ) , which starred the 1960s British pop group Herman 's Hermits , The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes , Flight of the Doves and Up the Front , all in the early 1970s . His final film was Journey into Fear ( 1974 ) . 
 In 1970 , Holloway began an association with the Shaw Festival in Canada , playing Burgess in Candida . He made what he considered his West End debut as a straight actor in Siege by David Ambrose at the Cambridge Theatre in 1972 , co @-@ starring with Alastair Sim and Michael Bryant . He returned to Shaw and Canada , playing the central character Walter / William in You Never Can Tell in 1973 . 
 Holloway continued to perform until well into his eighties , touring Asia and Australia in 1977 together with Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. and David Langton in The Pleasure of His Company , by Samuel A. Taylor and Cornelia Otis Skinner . He made his last appearance performing at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium in 1980 , aged 89 . 
 Holloway died of a stroke at the Nightingale Nursing Home in Littlehampton , West Sussex , on 30 January 1982 , aged 91 . He is buried , along with his wife Violet , at St. Mary the Virgin Church in East Preston , West Sussex . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Holloway was married twice , first to Alice " Queenie " Foran . They met in June 1913 in Clacton , while he was performing in a concert party and she was selling charity flags on behalf of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution . Queenie was orphaned at the age of 16 , something that Holloway felt he and Queenie had in common , as his mother had died that year and his father had earlier abandoned the family . He married Queenie in November 1913 . 
 Holloway and Queenie had four children : Joan , born on Holloway 's 24th birthday in 1914 , Patricia ( b . 1920 ) , John ( 1925 – 2013 ) and Mary ( b . 1928 ) . Upon the death of her mother , Queenie inherited some property in Southampton Row and relied on the rents from the property for her income . During the First World War , while Holloway was away fighting in France , Queenie began to have financial trouble , as the tenants failed to pay their rent . Out of desperation , she approached several loan sharks , incurring a huge debt about which Holloway knew nothing . She also started to drink heavily as the pressures from the war and of supporting her daughter took their toll . On Holloway 's return from the war , the debt was paid off and they moved to Hampstead , West London . By the late 1920s , Holloway found himself in financial difficulties with the British tax authorities and was briefly declared bankrupt . In the 1930s , Holloway and Queenie moved to Bayswater and remained there until Queenie 's death in 1937 at the age of 45 , from cirrhosis of the liver . Of the children from this first marriage , John worked as an engineer in an electrics company , and Mary worked for British Petroleum for many years . 
 On 2 January 1939 , Holloway married a 25 @-@ year @-@ old actress and former chorus dancer named Violet Marion Lane ( 1913 – 1997 ) and they moved to Marylebone . Violet was born into a working @-@ class family from Leeds . Her mother was Scottish , and her civil engineer father , Alfred Lane , was a Yorkshireman . Holloway 's second marriage lasted over 40 years until his death in 1982 . Although he was a client of the <unk> Agency in London , Violet effectively managed Holloway 's career , and no project was taken on without her approval . In his autobiography , Holloway said of her , " I suppose I am committing lawful bigamy . Not only is she my wife , lover , mother , cook , <unk> , private secretary , house keeper , hostess , electrician , business manager , critic , handy woman , she is also my best friend . " Together , they had one son , Julian , who also became an actor and is best known for appearing in the Carry On films . Julian had a brief relationship with Patricia Neal 's daughter Tessa Dahl which produced a daughter , the model and author Sophie Dahl . 
 Holloway , Violet and Julian lived mainly in the tiny village of Penn , Buckinghamshire . Holloway also owned other properties including a flat in St. John 's Wood in North West London , which he used when working in the capital , and a flat in Manhattan during the My Fair Lady Broadway years . The final years of his life were spent in Angmering , West Sussex , with Violet . Holloway forged close friendships with fellow performers including Leslie Henson , Gracie Fields , Maurice Chevalier , Laurence Olivier and Arthur Askey , who said of him , " He was the nicest man I ever knew . He never had a wrong word to say about anyone . He was a great actor , a super mimic and a one @-@ man walking comic show . " While working in the US , Holloway numbered among his friends Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Burgess Meredith and Groucho Marx . 
 = = Honours , memorials and books = = 
 Holloway was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1960 New Year 's Honours list for his services to entertainment . In 1978 he was honoured with a special award by the Variety Club of Great Britain . 
 There is a memorial plaque dedicated to Holloway in St. Paul 's , Covent Garden , London , which is known as " the actors ' church " . The plaque is next to a memorial to Gracie Fields . In 2009 English Heritage unveiled a Blue plaque at 25 Albany Road , Manor Park , Essex , the house in which he was born in 1890 . There is a building named after him at 2 <unk> Road , Newham , London , called Stanley Holloway Court . 
 Holloway entitled his 1967 autobiography <unk> a Little Bit of Luck after the song he performed in My Fair Lady . The book was ghost @-@ written by the writer and director Dick Richards and was published in 1967 . Holloway oversaw the publication of three volumes of the monologues by or associated with him : Monologues ( 1979 ) ; The Stanley Holloway Monologues ( 1980 ) ; and More Monologues ( 1981 ) . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 Holloway had a 54 @-@ year recording career , beginning in the age of acoustic recording , and ending in the era of the stereophonic LP . He mainly recorded songs from musicals and revues , and he recited many monologues on various subjects . Most prominent among his recordings ( aside from his participation in recordings of My Fair Lady ) are those of three series of monologues that he made at intervals throughout his career . They featured Sam Small , Albert Ramsbottom , and historical events such as the Battle of Hastings , Magna Carta and the Battle of Trafalgar . In all , his discography runs to 130 recordings , spanning the period 1924 to 1978 . A review in The Gramophone of one of his 1957 albums containing recordings of his old " concert party " songs commented , " what a fine voice he has and how well he can use it – diction , phrasing , range and the interpretative insight of the artist " . 
 = Maine Coon = 
 The Maine Coon is the largest domesticated breed of cat . 
 It has a distinctive physical appearance and valuable hunting skills . It is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America , specifically " native " to the state of Maine ( though the feline was simply introduced there ) , where it is the official state cat . 
 No records of the Maine Coon 's exact origins and date of introduction to the United States exist , so several competing hypotheses have been suggested . The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century , but its existence became threatened when long @-@ haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century . The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and is now one of the more popular cat breeds in the world . 
 The Maine Coon is a large and sociable cat , hence its nickname , " the gentle giant " . It is characterized by a robust bone structure , rectangular body shape , a silky flowing coat and a long , bushy tail . The breed 's colors vary widely , with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree . Reputed for its intelligence and playful , gentle personality , the Maine Coon is often cited as having " dog @-@ like " characteristics . Professionals notice certain health problems in the breed including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia , but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 The ancestral origins of the Maine Coon are unknown — there is only speculation and folk tales . One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette , the Queen of France , who was executed in 1793 . The story goes that before her death , Antoinette attempted to escape France with the help of Captain Samuel Clough . She loaded Clough 's ship with her most prized possessions , including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats . Although she did not make it to the United States , her pets safely reached the shores of <unk> , Maine , where they bred with other short @-@ haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of the Maine Coon . 
 Another folk tale involves Captain Charles Coon , an English seafarer who kept long @-@ haired cats aboard his ships . Whenever Coon 's ship would anchor in New England ports , the felines would exit the ship and mate with the local feral cat population . When long @-@ haired kittens began appearing in the litters of the local cat population , they were referred to as one of " Coon 's cats " . 
 A myth which is trait @-@ based , though genetically impossible , is the idea that the modern Maine Coon descended from ancestors of semi @-@ feral domestic cats and raccoons . This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed ( brown tabby ) and its bushy tail . Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated between the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats , which could explain the tufts of hairs that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears . 
 The generally accepted hypothesis among breeders is that the Maine Coon is descended from the pairings of local short @-@ haired domestic cats and long @-@ haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers ( possibly by Captain Charles Coon ) or 11th @-@ century Norsemen . The connection to the Norsemen is seen in the strong resemblance of the Maine Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat , another breed that is said to be a descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen . 
 = = = Cat shows and popularity = = = 
 The first mention of Maine Coons in a literary work was in 1861 , in Frances Simpson 's The Book of the Cat ( 1903 ) . F.R. Pierce , who owned several Maine Coons , wrote a chapter about the breed . During the late 1860s , farmers located in Maine told stories about their cats and held the " Maine State Champion Coon Cat " contest at the local Skowhegan Fair . 
 In 1895 , a dozen Maine Coons were entered into a show in Boston . On 8 May 1895 , the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City . A female Maine Coon brown tabby , named Cosey , was entered into the show . Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown , Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show . The silver collar was purchased by the Cat Fanciers ' Association ( CFA ) Foundation with the help of a donation from the National Capital Cat Show . The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library . 
 In the early 20th century , the Maine Coon 's popularity began to decline with the introduction of other long @-@ haired breeds , such as the Persian , which originated in the Middle East . The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland , Oregon . The breed was rarely seen after that . The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s , although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time . The Central Maine Cat Club ( <unk> ) was created in the early 1950s by Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer in attempts to increase the popularity of the Maine Coon . For 11 years , the <unk> held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for the Maine Coon . 
 The Maine Coon was denied provisional breed status — one of the three steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA to be able to compete in championship competitions — by the CFA three times , which led to the formation of the Maine Coon Cat Club in 1973 . The breed was finally accepted by the CFA under provisional status on 1 May 1975 , and was approved for championship status on 1 May 1976 . The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of the Maine Coon , with championship victories and an increase in national rankings . In 1985 , the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official State Cat . Today the Maine Coon is the third most popular cat breed , according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA .

 Maine Coons are the largest breed of domestic cat . On average , males weigh from 13 to 18 lb ( 5 @.@ 9 to 8 @.@ 2 kg ) with females weighing from 8 to 12 lb ( 3 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 4 kg ) . The height of adults can vary between 10 and 16 in ( 25 and 41 cm ) and they can reach a length of up to 48 in ( 120 cm ) , including the tail , which can reach a length of 14 in ( 36 cm ) and is long , tapering , and heavily furred , almost resembling a raccoon 's tail . The body is solid and muscular , which is necessary for supporting their own weight , and the chest is broad . Maine Coons possess a rectangular body shape and are slow to physically mature ; their full potential size is normally not reached until they are three to five years old , while other cats take about one year . 
 In 2010 , the Guinness World Records accepted a male purebred Maine Coon named " Stewie " as the " Longest Cat " measuring 48 @.@ 5 in ( 123 cm ) from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail . Stewie died 4 February 2013 , from cancer at his home in Reno , Nevada , at age 8 . Large Maine coons can overlap in length with Eurasian lynxes , although with a much lighter build and lower height . 
 The Maine Coon is a longhaired , or medium @-@ haired , cat . The coat is soft and silky , although texture may vary with coat color . The length is shorter on the head and shoulders , and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion @-@ like ruff around their neck . Minimal grooming is required for the breed , compared to other long @-@ haired breeds , as their coat is mostly self @-@ maintaining owing to a light @-@ density undercoat . The coat is subject to seasonal variation , with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer . 
 Maine Coons can have any colors that other cats have . Colors indicating crossbreeding , such as chocolate , lavender , the Siamese pointed patterns or the " ticked " patterns , are not accepted by some breed standards ( the ' ticked ' pattern , for example , is accepted by <unk> ) . The most common pattern seen in the breed is brown tabby . All eye colors are accepted under breed standards , with the exception of the occurrence of blue @-@ colored or odd @-@ eyes ( i.e. two eyes of different colors ) in cats possessing coat colors other than white . 
 Maine Coons have several physical adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates . Their dense water @-@ resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection when they are walking or sitting on top of wet surfaces of snow or ice . Their long and bushy raccoon @-@ like tail is resistant to sinking in snow , and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface . Large paws , and especially the extra @-@ large paws of <unk> Maine Coons , facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes . Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight . Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm . 
 Many of the original Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism ( having one or more extra toes on the feet ) . While some sources claim that trait is thought to have occurred in approximately 40 % of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time , little evidence has been given to substantiate this claim . <unk> is rarely , if ever , seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards . The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene , which has shown to pose no threat to the cat 's health . The trait was almost eradicated from the breed due to the fact that it was an automatic <unk> in show rings . Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing . 
 Maine Coons are known as the " gentle giants " and possess above @-@ average intelligence , making them relatively easy to train . They are known for being loyal to their family and cautious — but not mean — around strangers , but are independent and not clingy . The Maine Coon is generally not known for being a " lap cat " but their gentle disposition makes the breed relaxed around dogs , other cats , and children . They are playful throughout their lives , with males tending to be more clownish and females generally possessing more dignity , yet both are equally affectionate . Many Maine Coons have a fascination with water and some theorize that this personality trait comes from their ancestors , who were aboard ships for much of their lives . Maine Coons are also well known for being very vocal cats . They are known for their frequent yowling or howling , trilling , chirping , and making other loud vocalizations . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Maine Coons require ample protein and nutrients in their diets . Since they are a large cat breed with high levels of energy , it is best to feed them quality food . Their dietary needs are fulfilled with both dry food and wet food . However , the wet food should be mixed in with the dry food only 2 @-@ 3 times a week . Feeding the cat with quality dry food can reduce tartar build up on the teeth . Avoid grain based foods . A cat 's natural diet does not contain grain and grain can also lead to both obesity and diabetes . Maine Coons should not eat food that lists soy or some grains as the first ingredient on the label . Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon . Cats can develop allergies from plastic bowls , so it is best if they eat out of a glass or stainless steel bowl . 
 = = Health = = 
 Pet insurance data obtained from a study during years 2003 – 2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at > 12 @.@ 5 years . 74 % lived to 12 years or more and 54 % lived to 16 @.@ 5 years or more . Maine Coons are generally a healthy and hardy breed and have adapted to survive the New England climate . The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) , the most common heart disease seen in cats , whether pure bred or not . In Maine Coons , it is thought to be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait . Middle @-@ aged to older cats as well as males are thought to be predisposed to the disease . HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure , paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart , and sudden death . A specific mutation that causes HCM is seen in Maine Coons for which testing services are offered . Of all the Maine Coons tested for the <unk> mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine located at Washington State University , approximately one @-@ third tested positive . Not all cats that tested positive will have clinical signs of the disease and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation , strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed . The HCM prevalence was found to be 10 @.@ 1 % ( 95 % CI 5 @.@ 8 <unk> % ) in this study . 
 Another potential health problem is spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) , another genetically inherited disease which causes the loss of the spinal @-@ cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs . Symptoms are normally seen within 3 – 4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy , muscle weakness , and a shortened life span . A test is offered to detect the genes responsible for SMA .
