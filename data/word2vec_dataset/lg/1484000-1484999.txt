 = Operation Deadstick = 
 Operation Deadstick was the codename for an operation by airborne forces of the British Army that took place on 6 June 1944 as part of the Normandy landings of World War II . The objective was to capture intact two road bridges in Normandy across the River Orne and the Caen Canal providing the only exit eastwards , for British forces from their landing on Sword Beach . Intelligence reports said both bridges were heavily defended by the Germans and wired for demolition . Once captured , the bridges had to be held against any counter @-@ attack until the assault force was relieved by commandos and infantry advancing from the British landing zone . 
 The mission was vital to the success of the Operation Tonga , the British airborne landings in Normandy . Failure to capture the bridges intact or to prevent their demolition by the Germans , would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut off from the rest of the Allied armies with their backs to the two waterways . If the Germans retained control over the bridges , they could be used by their armoured divisions to attack the landing beaches of Normandy . 
 Responsibility for the operation fell to the men of ' D ' Company , 2nd ( Airborne ) Battalion , Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry , part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade of the 6th Airborne Division . The assault group comprised a reinforced company of six infantry platoons and an attached platoon of Royal Engineers . They flew from the south of England to Normandy in six Airspeed Horsa gliders . Through what was later described as the " most outstanding flying achievements of the war " , the gliders delivered the company to their objective . After a brief exchange of fire , both bridges were captured and then defended against tank , gunboat and infantry counter @-@ attacks , until the company relief arrived .

 During the planning stage of the Normandy invasion , the decision was made to land the 6th Airborne Division ( Major @-@ General Richard Gale ) on the left flank of the invasion beaches between the River Orne and the River Dives . Their primary objective was to capture the two road bridges over the River Orne and the Caen Canal and prevent a German flanking attack on the landing area . Failure to capture the bridges would leave the 6th Airborne Division cut off in enemy territory , so the 5th Parachute Brigade were earmarked to defend the bridges against counter @-@ attacks . Gale decided that the only way to capture the bridges intact was by a glider coup de main assault . He then asked Brigadier Hugh Kindersley of the 6th Airlanding Brigade to nominate his best company for the operation . 
 'D ' Company , 2nd ( Airborne ) Battalion , Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry ( Major John Howard ) and second in command Captain Brian Priday , was selected for the mission . The company had trained hard and became the fittest in the battalion , often utilizing bomb @-@ damaged inner @-@ city areas to practice street fighting with live ammunition . Howard expected the invasion to involve night @-@ fighting and changed the daily routine to ensure that his men were up to the task . For weeks at a time , they rose at 20 : 00 and completed exercises , drills and normal paperwork throughout the night before retiring at 13 : 00 . General Gale tested the company through two exercises where the objective was to capture bridges , when it became apparent that the company would not be able to carry out the mission on its own . Asked to select two more platoons from the battalion to join them , Howard chose two from ' B ' Company commanded by Lieutenants Fox and Smith . Any explosive charges found attached to the bridges were the responsibility of 30 Royal Engineers from the 249th ( Airborne ) Field Company , commanded by Captain Jock Neilson . Changes were then made to the operational plan to accommodate six platoons . Three were assigned to attack each bridge simultaneously with infantry overcoming the troops on guard duty while the engineers located and dismantled any demolition charges . For six days and nights the company carried out exercises just outside Exeter , in the south @-@ west of England , where two bridges similar to their objectives were found over the Exeter Ship Canal . 
 Transport to Normandy was arranged in six Airspeed Horsa gliders , piloted by 12 NCOs from ' C ' Squadron , Glider Pilot Regiment . The Horsa had a wingspan of 88 feet ( 27 m ) and a length of 67 feet ( 20 m ) , with a maximum load of 15 @,@ 750 pounds ( 7 @,@ 140 kg ) or space for two pilots , twenty @-@ eight troops or a mixture of two jeeps , artillery guns and trailers . Pilot training involved practice landings on a small strip of land , instrument flying using stopwatches for accurate course changes and fitting flight crew goggles with dark glass to get them used to night flying . By May 1944 they had carried out 54 training sorties , flying in all weathers both day and night . 
 Howard was not told the exact details of the operation until 2 May , 1944 . His orders were to seize the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal at Bénouville and Ranville intact and hold them until relieved . The relief force would initially be a company from the 7th Parachute Battalion under Howard 's command . When the remainder of the parachute battalion arrived , he would hand over to their commander Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Richard Pine @-@ Coffin . The 3rd Infantry Division and the commandos of the 1st Commando Brigade were scheduled to land at Sword Beach at 06 : 00 on the day then advance to the bridges where they were expected to arrive at 11 : 00 . 
 At the end of May 1944 , ' D ' Company left the battalion camp at Bulford in Wiltshire for RAF Tarrant Rushton in Dorset . The base was then secured and Howard briefed everyone on the mission , distributing photographs of the bridges and unveiling a model of the area . Glider pilot commander Staff Sergeant Jim Wallwork told Howard that with a full load of men , ammunition , assault boats and engineers ' stores his gliders would be dangerously overloaded . Howard decided to only take one assault boat per glider and leave behind two men from each platoon . At the last minute Doctor John Vaughan replaced an injured man in one of the platoons . 
 On 5 June 1944 , the company made final preparations for the mission . Each man was issued their personal weapons and ammunition as well as up to nine hand grenades and four Bren gun magazines . Each platoon also had a 2 @-@ inch mortar and a radio . Just before the men boarded the gliders , codewords were issued . ' Ham ' indicated the canal bridge was captured and ' Jam ' the river bridge . Capture and destruction of the canal bridge would be signalled using the codeword ' Jack ' ; ' Lard ' would be used if a similar fate befell the river bridge . 
 = = = Bridges = = = 
 The Ranville bridge spans the River Orne and the Bénouville bridge crosses the Caen Canal to the west . They are 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) from the coast and provided the only access to the city of Caen . The main road between the two communes crosses the bridges and then continues east to the River Dives . At 190 feet ( 58 m ) long and 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wide , the Caen Canal bridge opens to allow canal traffic to pass underneath . The controls were housed in a nearby cabin . The canal is 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) deep by 150 feet ( 46 m ) wide , with earth and stone banks 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) high . Small tarmac tracks run on both banks along the canal 's entire length . Between the two bridges there is a strip of mostly marshy ground about 550 yards ( 500 m ) wide , broken up by ditches and small streams . The Ranville bridge over the River Orne is 350 feet ( 110 m ) long , 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide and can be opened to allow river traffic to pass . The river is 160 – 240 feet ( 49 – 73 m ) wide and with an average depth of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) . It has mud banks averaging about 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) high and a tidal rise and fall of 16 – 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 – 2 @.@ 0 m ) . A number of small houses lie to the west of the river , connected by a track 8 – 10 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide , that runs along both banks . 
 = = = German forces = = = 
 The bridge was guarded by 50 men belonging to the German 736th Grenadier Regiment , 716th Infantry Division . The unit was commanded by Major Hans Schmidt and based at Ranville , 1 @.@ 2 miles ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) east of the River Orne . The 716th was a static formation and had been assigned to Normandy since June 1942 . The division 's eight infantry battalions were deployed to defend 21 miles ( 34 km ) of the Atlantic wall . The unit was poorly equipped with a mixture of foreign weapons and manned by conscripts from Poland , Russia and France under a German officer and senior non @-@ commissioned officers ( NCOs ) . Schmidt 's soldiers had orders to blow up the two bridges if they were in danger of capture . 
 A second division , the 21st Panzer , moved into the area in May 1944 . One of its regiments , the 125th Panzergrenadier , commanded by Colonel Hans von Luck , was billeted at Vimont just east of Caen . There was also a battalion of the 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon to the west of the bridges . Colonel von Luck trained his regiment in anti @-@ invasion operations . He also identified likely incursion points and marked out forward routes , rest and refuelling areas and anti @-@ aircraft gun positions . The 21st Panzer Division was a new formation based on the former Afrika Korps unit , which had been destroyed in North Africa . Although equipped with an assortment of older tanks and other armoured vehicles , the division 's officers were veterans and 2 @,@ 000 men from the old division filled its ranks . Further afield were the 12th SS Panzer Division at Lisieux and the Panzer Lehr Division at Chartres , both less than a day 's march from the area . 
 Defences were in place at both bridges . On the west bank of the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine @-@ gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine @-@ gun and an anti @-@ tank gun . To their north were another three machine @-@ guns and a concrete pillbox . An anti @-@ aircraft tower equipped with machine @-@ guns stood to the south . At the River Orne bridge , the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ aircraft guns . To the north of the bridge were two machine @-@ guns . Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks .

 At 22 : 56 on 5 June , 1944 , the six gliders towed by Halifax bombers took off from RAF Tarrant Rushton . Horsa number one , the first of the three headed for the Caen Canal , carried Howard with Lieutenant Den Brotheridge 's platoon , number two bore Lieutenant David Wood 's platoon , and number three carried Lieutenant Smith 's platoon . Priday with Lieutenant Hooper 's platoon made for the river bridge aboard number four . Horsa number five carrying Lieutenant Fox 's platoon was followed by number six bearing Tod Sweeney 's platoon . Each glider also carried five Royal Engineers . Flying over the English Channel at 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , the bombers crossed the Normandy coast at 00 : 07 on 6 June , 1944 and released their towed gliders . With Wallwork at the controls , the number one glider crashed into the barbed wire surrounding the canal bridge defences at 00 : 16 . The other two gliders followed at one @-@ minute intervals . The number two glider broke in half and came to halt at the edge of a large pond . One of the men fell into the water and drowned , becoming the first casualty of the operation . Brotheridge and Smith 's platoons headed for the bridge , while Wood 's platoon moved towards the trenches on its north east side . 
 = = = Bridges captured = = = 
 The Germans knew the invasion was imminent if not the exact location ; Major Schmidt , in command of the bridges , had been told that they were one of the most critical points in Normandy . The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed . The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the bridge . As Brotheridge 's platoon attacked , one ran off shouting " paratroops " while the second fired a flare gun to alert nearby defenders . Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades . Alerted by the flare , the German machine gunners opened fire at the men on the bridge , wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade . The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire . Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank . The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any . Smith 's platoon crossed the bridge next , exchanging fire with the German defenders , whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade . Using grenades and sub @-@ machine gun fire , the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers . By 00 : 21 German resistance on the west bank of the canal bridge was over . Checking the area , the men of Brotheridge 's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded . He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds , becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion . On the east bank Wood 's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition . Woods was hit in the leg by machine @-@ gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences . All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded . 
 At 00 : 19 pathfinders from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company landed in the area between the River Orne and the River Dives . Brigadier Nigel Poett commanding 5th Parachute Brigade and a small team accompanied them . <unk> after landing , Poett heard Brotheridge 's Sten gun and set off for the bridges with the only man he could locate . Only one of the Germans at the bridge , Unteroffizier Weber escaped ' D ' Company 's attack , he reached Bénouville and reported the bridge had been captured . 
 Fox 's glider number five was the first to land 330 yards ( 300 m ) from the river bridge at 00 : 20 while glider number four was reported missing . When the Germans opened fire with an MG 34 , the platoon responded with a 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) mortar and destroyed the gun with a direct hit . They then crossed the bridge without further opposition . At 00 : 21 glider number six landed , 770 yards ( 700 m ) short of the bridge . Sweeney left one of his sections on the west bank then moved the rest of the platoon across the bridge to take up defensive positions on the east bank . 
 From his newly established command post in the trenches on the eastern bank of the canal near the bridge , Howard learned that the river bridge had also been taken . Captain Neilson of the engineers reported that although the bridges had been prepared for demolition , the explosives had not been attached . Howard ordered his signalman to transmit the code words ' Ham ' and ' Jam ' then brought Fox 's platoon across the canal bridge , positioning them at the Bénouville to Le Port crossroads as the company 's forward platoon . 
 = = = 7th Parachute Battalion = = = 
 At 00 : 50 aircraft carrying the rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended into drop zones marked out by the pathfinders . Howard began blowing the morse code letter ' V ' on his whistle , to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges . The first paratroops to arrive at 00 : 52 were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route . <unk> by Howard on the situation , they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port . On the drop zone , only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion had made it to the rallying point but all their signal equipment , machine guns and mortars were missing . Pine @-@ Coffin , aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges , decided they could not wait any longer and at 01 : 10 left for the bridges . 
 At about the same time Major Schmidt , the German commander of the bridge guard force , decided he needed to see for himself what was happening . He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 with a motorcycle escort . Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of ' D ' Company 's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the company opened fire . The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the SdKfz 250 was forced off the road . Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner . 
 The commander of the 716th Infantry Division Generalleutnant Wilhelm Richter was informed at 01 : 20 of the parachute landings and that the bridges had been captured intact . One of his first actions was to contact Generalmajor Edgar Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division . Richter ordered the division to attack the landing areas . While Feuchtinger 's tanks were delegated to support the 716th , it was also part of the German armoured reserve , which could not move without orders from the German High Command . All German panzer formations could only be moved on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler , who was sleeping at the time and his staff refused to wake him . When Colonel Von Luck of the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment received the news of the airborne landings at 01 : 30 he ordered the regiment to their assembly areas north and east of Caen and waited for further orders . 
 The closest large German unit to the canal bridge were the 2nd Battalion , 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment based at Cairon . General Feuchtinger ordered them to recapture the bridges and then attack the parachute landing zones further west . At 02 : 00 the 2nd Battalion headed for the bridges from the west , supported by the 1st <unk> Company and part of the <unk> Heavy Artillery Battalion coming from the north . As the first Panzer IVs from the north reached the junction leading to the bridge , the leading vehicle was hit by a round from ' D ' Company 's only serviceable PIAT anti @-@ tank weapon . The vehicle exploded , setting off its stowed ammunition , and the other tanks withdrew . 
 The first company of the 7th Parachute Battalion , commanded by Major Nigel Taylor , arrived at the bridges . Howard directed them to defensive positions west of the canal in Bénouville and Le Port . When Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Pine @-@ Coffin arrived at the bridges , he was briefed by Howard , and crossed into Bénouville and set up his headquarters beside the church . Pine @-@ Coffin had about 200 men in his three companies . He positioned ' A ' and ' C ' Companies in Bénouville facing south towards Caen and ' B ' Company in Le Port facing Ouistreham . ' D ' Company was now pulled back into the area between the two bridges and held in reserve . A further check of the trenches and bunkers captured a number of Germans . 
 At 03 : 00 the 8th Heavy Company , 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment with 75 mm SP guns , 20 mm AA guns and mortars attacked ' A ' and ' C ' Companies , 7th Parachute Battalion , from the south . The paratroops were forced back and the Germans established their own positions in Bénouville , but were unable to break the British line . They dug in and waited for tank support before moving forward again . The Germans fired mortar rounds and machine guns at the paratroopers and attempted small assaults on their positions throughout the night . 
 Just before dawn Howard summoned his platoon commanders to a meeting . With their senior officers dead or wounded , numbers One , Two and Three Platoons were now commanded by corporals . Howard 's second in command , Captain Priday and number Four Platoon were missing . Only Lieutenants Fox and Sweeney in Five and Six Platoons had a full complement of officers and NCOs . The landings at Sword Beach began at 07 : 00 , preceded by a heavy naval bombardment . At the bridges , daylight allowed German snipers to identify targets and anyone moving in the open was in danger of being shot . The men of number One Platoon who had taken over the 75 mm anti @-@ tank gun on the east bank of the canal used it to engage possible sniper positions in Bénouville , the Château de Bénouville and the surrounding area . At 09 : 00 , two German gunboats approached the canal bridge from Ouistreham . The lead boat fired its 20 mm gun and number Two Platoon returned fire with a PIAT , hitting the wheelhouse of the leading boat , which crashed into the canal bank . The second boat retreated to Ouistreham . A lone German aircraft bombed the canal bridge at 10 : 00 , dropping one bomb . The bomb struck the bridge but failed to detonate . 
 = = = 1st Commando Brigade = = = 
 The German 2nd Battalion , 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment continued to attack Bénouville and Le Port , assisted by their tanks , mortars and infantry . The attack caused serious problems for the understrength 7th Parachute Battalion , until the leading tank was blown up with a Gammon bomb , blocking the road . During the attack 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through to the bridge were destroyed . The paratroopers were then reinforced by number One Platoon from ' D ' Company . The platoon moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting . Numbers Five and Six Platoons also moved into positions opposite the <unk> Cafe on the west bank of the canal . By midday most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges and the three platoons were moved back to their original positions . 
 Just after midday , the 21st Panzer Division received permission to attack the landings . Colonel von Luck east of the River Orne , moved the 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment towards the bridges . The column was quickly spotted and engaged for the next two hours by Allied artillery and aircraft causing heavy losses . The 1st Battalion , 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment and the 100th Panzer Regiment , attacking from west of the canal , had more success reaching the beaches between the British Sword Beach and the Canadian Juno Beach . At 13 : 30 the men at the bridges heard the sound of bagpipes , played by Bill Millin of the 1st Commando Brigade . As the commandos arrived they crossed the bridges and joined the rest of 6th Airborne Division defending the eastern side of the bridges . Some of the tanks accompanying the commandos moved into Bénouville to reinforce its defences while others crossed the bridges with the commandos . At 15 : 00 a boat loaded with German infantry approached from Caen . It was engaged with the anti @-@ tank gun manned by number One Platoon . It was hit in the stern by the second round fired and retreated back toward Caen . 
 At 21 : 15 the 2nd Battalion , Royal Warwickshire Regiment of the 185th Infantry Brigade arrived from Sword Beach and began taking over the bridges ' defences . At around midnight Howard handed over command of the bridges to the Warwickshire Regiment and his company left to join the rest of their battalion at Ranville . At 03 : 30 they finally located the battalion 's positions . They found Captain Priday and number Four Platoon had already joined the battalion . The platoon had landed beside the River Dives at Varaville about 8 miles ( 13 km ) away and had spent the previous day fighting their way towards the bridges , trying to rejoin the company .

 Bénouville was the farthest forward point of the British advance on 6 June 1944 . Of the 181 men ( 139 infantry , 30 engineers and 12 pilots ) of ' D ' Company involved in the capture of the bridges , two had been killed and fourteen wounded . On 9 June , the German Air Force attacked the bridges with 13 aircraft . The British had positioned light and medium @-@ sized anti @-@ aircraft guns around the bridges and in the face of intense anti @-@ aircraft fire the attack failed , although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by a direct hit . 
 The 6th Airborne retained control of the area between the Rivers Orne and Dives until 14 June , when the 51st ( Highland ) Infantry Division took over the southern part of the Orne bridgehead . In the days that followed the division was reinforced by the Dutch Princess Irene Brigade and the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade . A period of static warfare ended on 22 August when the division crossed the River Dives . Within nine days it had advanced 45 miles ( 72 km ) to the mouth of the River Seine . Between the 6 June and 26 August when they were pulled out of the front line the division 's casualties were ; 821 killed , 2 @,@ 709 wounded , and 927 missing . After Operation Deadstick the engineers , glider pilots and ' B ' Company men were returned to their parent formations . ' D ' Company played their part in the division 's defence of the Orne bridgehead and advance to the River Seine . On 5 September when the division was withdrawn to England , all that remained of the company were 40 men under the only remaining officer , Howard , the other officers , sergeants and most of the junior NCOs having been among the casualties . 
 The glider pilots were the first group to leave ' D ' Company , their expertise being required for other planned operations . In particular Operation Comet , which included another coup @-@ de @-@ main operation where eighteen gliders would be used to capture three bridges in the Netherlands . The mission would be carried out by the 1st Airborne Division with a brigade allocated to defend each bridge . Comet was scheduled for the 8 September 1944 , but was delayed and then cancelled . The plans were adapted and became Operation Market Garden , involving three airborne divisions , however the coup @-@ de @-@ main assault plans were not carried out . 
 Prior to being withdrawn on 16 July , Howard was awarded the Distinguished Service Order , presented in the field by General Bernard Montgomery . Other awards were the Military Cross to Smith and Sweeney , the Military Medal to Sergeant Thornton and Lance @-@ Corporal Stacey , Lieutenant Brotheridge was posthumously mentioned in dispatches . Air Chief Marshal Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory of the Royal Air Force praised the pilots involved , saying the operation included the " most outstanding flying achievements of the war " . The feat was recognised by the award of the Distinguished Flying Medal to eight of the glider pilots involved .

 The Caen Canal bridge was renamed Pegasus Bridge after the emblem of the British airborne forces , while the River Orne bridge became Horsa Bridge . The road across them is now the " Esplanade Major John Howard " . Since the end of the war , Pegasus Bridge and the adjacent Café <unk> have become a place where British veterans of the conflict visiting Normandy congregate . In 1994 , Pegasus Bridge was replaced by a new structure and the old bridge was added to the displays at the Pegasus Museum in Benouville . 
 The original model of the area around the bridge , that was used to brief troops taking part in the assault , is preserved in Airborne Assault : The Museum of The Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces , located at the Imperial War Museum Duxford . 
 A number of books have been written about or have mentioned the assault . In 1962 , Operation Deadstick featured in Darryl Zanuck 's film The Longest Day which was based on the book of the same title by Cornelius Ryan . Major John Howard was played by Richard Todd , who had been an officer in the 7th Parachute Battalion during the battle . 
 In 2003 , the attack on the Bénouville ( Pegasus ) Bridge was recreated in the highly successful and lauded video game , Call of Duty , in which the player joins the assault of the 6th Airborne Division in both capturing and holding the bridge . 
 The film Pegasus Bridge , which begins filming in 2016 , covers the events of Operation Deadstick , the fighting at the bridge and the fighting in Benouville and Le Port and is written and directed by Lance Nielsen . 
 = Acne vulgaris = 
 Acne vulgaris ( or simply acne ) is a long @-@ term skin disease that occurs when hair follicles become clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin . Acne is characterized by areas of <unk> , whiteheads , pimples , and greasy skin , and may result in scarring . The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety , reduced self @-@ esteem and , in extreme cases , depression or thoughts of suicide . 
 Genetics is thought to be the cause in 80 % of cases . The role of diet and cigarette smoking is unclear and neither cleanliness nor sunlight appear to be involved . Acne primarily affects skin with a greater number of oil glands , including the face , upper part of the chest , and back . During puberty , in both sexes , acne is often brought on by an increase in androgens such as testosterone . Excessive growth of the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes , which is normally present on the skin , is often involved . 
 Many treatment options are available to improve the appearance of acne , including lifestyle changes , procedures , and medications . Eating fewer simple carbohydrates like sugar may help . Topical azelaic acid , benzoyl peroxide , and salicylic acid are commonly used treatments . Antibiotics and retinoids are available in both topical and oral formulations to treat acne . However , resistance to antibiotics may develop . A number of birth control pills may be useful for preventing acne in women . Oral isotretinoin is usually reserved for severe acne due to greater potential side effects . Early and aggressive treatment is advocated by some to lessen the overall long @-@ term impact to individuals . 
 In 2013 , acne was estimated to affect 660 million people globally , making it the 8th most common disease worldwide . Acne occurs most commonly during adolescence , affecting an estimated 80 – 90 % of teenagers in the Western world . Lower rates are reported in some rural societies . People may also be affected before and after puberty . Though it becomes less common in adulthood than in adolescence , nearly half of people in their twenties and thirties continue to have acne . About 4 % continue to have difficulties into their forties . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Acne is commonly classified by severity as mild , moderate , or severe . This type of categorization can be an important factor in determining the appropriate treatment regimen . Mild acne is classically defined as open ( <unk> ) and closed ( whiteheads ) comedones limited to the face with occasional inflammatory lesions . Acne may be considered to be of moderate severity when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face compared to mild cases of acne , and acne lesions also occur on the trunk of the body . Lastly , severe acne is said to occur when nodules ( the painful ' bumps ' lying under the skin ) are the characteristic facial lesions , and involvement of the trunk is extensive . 
 Large nodules have been referred to as cysts in the past , and the term <unk> has been used in the medical literature to describe severe cases of inflammatory acne . However , since true cysts are rare in those with acne , the term severe nodular acne is now the preferred terminology . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Typical features of acne include <unk> ( increased oil secretion ) , <unk> , comedones , papules , pustules , nodules ( large papules ) , and in many cases scarring . The appearance of acne varies with skin color . It may result in psychological and social problems . 
 = = = Scars = = = 
 Acne scars are the result of inflammation within the dermal layer of skin , brought on by acne , and are estimated to affect 95 % of people with acne vulgaris . The scar is created by an abnormal form of healing following this dermal inflammation . Scarring is most likely to occur with severe nodular acne , but may occur with any form of acne vulgaris . Acne scars are classified based on whether the abnormal healing response following dermal inflammation leads to excess collagen deposition or collagen loss at the site of the acne lesion . 
 <unk> acne scars are the most common type of acne scar and have lost collagen from this healing response . <unk> scars may be further classified as ice @-@ pick scars , boxcar scars , and rolling scars . Ice @-@ pick scars are typically described as narrow ( less than 2 mm across ) , deep scars that extend into the dermis . Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary in size from 1 @.@ 5 – 4 mm across . Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars ( 4 – 5 mm across ) and have a wave @-@ like pattern of depth in the skin . 
 <unk> scars are less common , and are characterized by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response . They are described as firm and raised from the skin . <unk> scars remain within the original margins of the wound , whereas <unk> scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders . <unk> scars from acne usually occur in men , and usually occur on the trunk of the body rather than the face . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> hyperpigmentation ( PIH ) is usually the result of nodular acne lesions . They often leave behind an inflamed red mark after the original acne lesion has resolved . PIH occurs more often in people with darker skin color . <unk> scar is a common but misleading term , as it suggests the color change is permanent . Often , PIH can be prevented by avoiding aggravation of the nodule . These scars can fade with time . However , untreated scars can last for months , years , or even be permanent if deeper layers of skin are affected . Daily use of <unk> 15 or higher sunscreen can minimize pigmentation associated with acne .

 The predisposition to acne for specific individuals is likely explained in part by a genetic component , a theory which has been supported by twin studies as well as studies that have looked at rates of acne among first @-@ degree relatives . The genetics of acne susceptibility is likely polygenic , as the disease does not follow a classic Mendelian inheritance pattern . There are multiple candidates for genes which are possibly related to acne , including polymorphisms in TNF @-@ alpha , IL @-@ 1 alpha , and <unk> , among others . The 308 G / A single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) is associated with acne risk . 
 = = = Hormonal = = = 
 Hormonal activity , such as occurs during menstrual cycles and puberty , may contribute to the formation of acne . During puberty , an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the follicular glands to grow larger and make more sebum . Acne that first develops between the ages of 21 and 25 is uncommon . Several hormones have been linked to acne , including the androgens testosterone , dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , and <unk> sulfate ( DHEA @-@ S ) , as well as insulin @-@ like growth factor 1 ( IGF @-@ 1 ) and growth hormone ( GH ) . Both androgens and IGF @-@ 1 seem to be essential for acne to occur , as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome ( CAIS ) or Laron syndrome ( insensitivity to GH , resulting in extremely low IGF @-@ 1 levels ) . 
 Medical conditions that commonly cause a high @-@ androgen state , such as polycystic ovary syndrome , congenital adrenal hyperplasia , and androgen @-@ secreting tumors , can cause acne in affected individuals . Conversely , people who lack androgenic hormones or are insensitive to the effects of androgens rarely have acne . An increase in androgen ( and sebum ) synthesis may also be seen during pregnancy . Acne can be a side effect of testosterone replacement therapy or of anabolic steroid use . <unk> steroids are commonly found in over @-@ the @-@ counter bodybuilding supplements . 
 = = = Infectious = = = 
 Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) is the anaerobic bacterium species that is widely suspected to contribute to the development of acne , but its exact role in this process is not entirely clear . There are specific sub @-@ strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin and others with moderate or severe inflammatory acne . It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on @-@ site or are acquired , or possibly both depending on the person . These strains have the capability of either changing , perpetuating , or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation , oil production , and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores . One particularly virulent strain has been circulating in Europe for at least 87 years . Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne . However , it is unclear whether eradication of these mites improves acne . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The relationship between diet and acne is unclear , as there is no high @-@ quality evidence which establishes any definitive link . High @-@ glycemic @-@ load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity by different studies . Multiple randomized controlled trials and <unk> studies have found a lower @-@ glycemic @-@ load diet to be effective in reducing acne . Additionally , there is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher incidence and severity of acne . Effects from other potentially contributing dietary factors , such as consumption of chocolate or salt , are not supported by the evidence . Chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar , which can lead to a high glycemic load , and it can be made with or without milk . There may be a relationship between acne and insulin metabolism , and one trial found a relationship between acne and obesity . Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne ( <unk> eruptions ) , or exacerbate existing acne , when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake . 
 = = = Smoking = = = 
 The relationship between cigarette smoking and acne severity is unclear and remains a point of debate . Due to the observational nature of the evidence obtained from epidemiological studies , there are concerns that bias and confounding may have influenced the results . Certain medical literature reviews have stated cigarette smoking clearly worsens acne whereas others have stated it is unclear whether smoking is unrelated to , worsens , or improves acne severity . Due to the various known negative health effects of cigarette smoking , it is not recommended as an approach to improving the appearance of acne . 
 = = = Psychological = = = 
 Overall , few high @-@ quality studies have been performed which demonstrate that stress causes or worsens acne . While the connection between acne and stress has been debated , some research indicates that increased acne severity is associated with high stress levels in certain settings ( e.g. , in association with the hormonal changes seen in premenstrual syndrome ) . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin disease of the pilosebaceous unit and develops due to blockages in the skin 's hair follicles . These blockages are thought to occur as a result of the following four abnormal processes : a higher than normal amount of sebum production ( influenced by androgens ) , excessive deposition of the protein keratin leading to comedone formation , colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes ( P. acnes ) bacteria , and the local release of pro @-@ inflammatory chemicals in the skin . 
 The earliest pathologic change is the formation of a plug ( a microcomedone ) , which is driven primarily by excessive proliferation of keratinocytes in the hair follicle . In normal skin , the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle . However , increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together . The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle , thus forming the microcomedone . This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle . If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle , the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air , resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance ( known as a blackhead or open comedone ) . In contrast , if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle , this causes the formation of a whitehead ( known as a closed comedone ) . 
 <unk> ( DHT ) is the main driver of androgen @-@ induced sebum production in the skin . Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA @-@ S. Higher amounts of DHEA @-@ S are secreted during adrenarche ( a stage of puberty ) , and this leads to an increase in sebum synthesis . In a sebum @-@ rich skin environment , the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system . P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro @-@ inflammatory chemical signals ( such as IL @-@ 1α , IL @-@ 8 , TNF @-@ α , and LTB4 ) ; IL @-@ 1α is known to be essential to comedone formation . 
 A major mechanism of acne @-@ related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes 's ability to bind and activate a class of immune system receptors known as toll @-@ like receptors , especially toll @-@ like receptor 2 ( TLR2 ) and toll @-@ like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) . Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of IL @-@ 8 , TNF @-@ α , and IL @-@ 1α . Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils , macrophages , and Th1 cells . IL @-@ 1α stimulates higher <unk> activity and reproduction , which in turn fuels comedone development . Sebaceous gland cells also produce more antimicrobial peptides , such as <unk> and <unk> , in response to binding of TLR2 and TLR4 . 
 P. acnes is also capable of provoking additional skin inflammation by altering sebum 's fatty composition . <unk> oxidation by P. acnes is of particular importance . Oxidation of squalene activates NF @-@ κB and consequently increases IL @-@ 1α levels . Additionally , squalene oxidation leads to increased activity of the 5 @-@ lipoxygenase enzyme responsible for conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) . LTB4 promotes skin inflammation by acting on <unk> <unk> @-@ activated receptor alpha ( <unk> ) . <unk> increases activity of activator protein 1 ( AP @-@ 1 ) and NF @-@ κB , thereby leading to the recruitment of inflammatory T cells . The inflammatory properties of P. acnes can be further explained by the bacterium 's ability to convert sebum triglycerides to pro @-@ inflammatory free fatty acids via secretion of the enzyme lipase . These free fatty acids spur production of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , thus leading to further inflammation . 
 This inflammatory cascade typically leads to the formation of inflammatory acne lesions , including papules , infected pustules , or nodules . If the inflammatory reaction is severe , the follicle can break into the deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and cause the formation of deep nodules . Involvement of AP @-@ 1 in the aforementioned inflammatory cascade also leads to activation of matrix <unk> , which contribute to local tissue destruction and scar formation . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 There are several features that may indicate that a person 's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences . Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone @-@ sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30 ; worsening the week before a woman 's menstrual cycle ; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin ; and inflammatory / nodular acne lesions . 
 Several scales exist to grade the severity of acne vulgaris , but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard . Cook 's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 ( 0 being the least severe and 8 being the most severe ) . This scale was the first to use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity ; since its creation in 1979 , Cook 's grading scale has undergone several revisions . Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face , back , and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non @-@ inflammatory . Leeds scores range from 0 ( least severe ) to 10 ( most severe ) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12 . The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies the severity of the acne from 1 ( least severe ) to 4 ( most severe ) . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 Skin conditions which may mimic acne vulgaris include angiofibromas , folliculitis , keratosis pilaris , <unk> dermatitis , and rosacea , among others . Age is one factor which may help a physician distinguish between these disorders . Skin disorders such as <unk> dermatitis and keratosis pilaris can appear similar to acne but tend to occur more frequently in childhood , whereas rosacea tends to occur more frequently in older adults . Facial redness triggered by heat or the consumption of alcohol or spicy food is suggestive of rosacea . The presence of comedones can also help health professionals differentiate acne from skin disorders that are similar in appearance . 
 = = Management = = 
 Many different treatments exist for acne , including alpha hydroxy acid , anti @-@ androgen medications , antibiotics , <unk> medications , azelaic acid , benzoyl peroxide , hormonal treatments , <unk> soaps , nicotinamide , retinoids , and salicylic acid . They are believed to work in at least four different ways , including the following : anti @-@ inflammatory effects , hormonal manipulation , killing P. acnes , and normalizing skin cell shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage . 
 Commonly used medical treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics , benzoyl peroxide , and retinoids , and systemic therapies including antibiotics , hormonal agents , and oral retinoids . Procedures such as light therapy and laser therapy are not considered to be first @-@ line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and the limited evidence of their efficacy . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 A low @-@ glycemic @-@ index / low @-@ glycemic @-@ load diet is recommended as a dietary method of improving acne . As of 2014 , evidence is insufficient to recommend milk restriction for this purpose . 
 = = = Medications = = = 
 = = = = Benzoyl peroxide = = = = 
 Benzoyl peroxide is a first @-@ line treatment for mild and moderate acne due to its effectiveness and mild side @-@ effects ( mainly irritant dermatitis ) . It works against P. acnes , helps prevent formation of comedones , and has anti @-@ inflammatory properties . Benzoyl peroxide normally causes dryness of the skin , slight redness , and occasional peeling when side effects occur . This topical treatment does increase sensitivity to the sun , as indicated on the packaging , so sunscreen use is often advised during treatment , to prevent sunburn . Benzoyl peroxide has been found to be nearly as effective as antibiotics , with all concentrations tested being equally effective . Unlike antibiotics , benzoyl peroxide does not appear to generate bacterial resistance . Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide / adapalene , respectively . 
 = = = = Retinoids = = = = 
 Retinoids are medications which possess anti @-@ inflammatory properties , normalize the follicle cell life cycle , and reduce sebum production . The retinoids appear to influence the cell life cycle in the follicle lining . This helps prevent the <unk> of these cells which can create a blockage . They are a first @-@ line acne treatment , especially for people with dark @-@ colored skin , and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation . 
 This class includes adapalene , isotretinoin , retinol , tazarotene , and tretinoin . Like isotretinoin , these retinoids are related to vitamin A , but are administered topically and generally have much milder side effects . They can , however , cause significant irritation of the skin . Tretinoin is the least expensive of the topical retinoids and is the most irritating to the skin , whereas adapalene is the least irritating to the skin but costs significantly more than other retinoids . <unk> is the most effective of the topical retinoids . However , tazarotene is also the most expensive and is not as well @-@ tolerated as other topical retinoids . <unk> is a form of vitamin A that has similar but milder effects , and is used in many over @-@ the @-@ counter moisturizers and other topical products . Topical retinoids often cause an initial flare @-@ up of acne and facial flushing . Generally speaking , retinoids increase skin 's sensitivity to sunlight and are therefore recommended for use at night . 
 <unk> is an oral retinoid and is very effective for severe nodular acne as well as moderate acne refractory to other treatments . Improvement is typically seen after one to two months of use . Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4- to 6 @-@ month course of oral isotretinoin . After a single course , about 80 % of people report an improvement , with more than 50 % reporting complete remission . About 20 % of people require a second course . A number of adverse effects may occur , including dry skin and lips , nose bleeds , muscle pains , increased liver enzymes , and increased lipid levels in the blood . There is no clear evidence that use of oral retinoids increases the risk of psychiatric side effects such as depression and suicidality . 
 = = = = Antibiotics = = = = 
 Topical antibiotics are frequently used for mild to moderately severe acne . Oral antibiotics are indicated for moderate to severe cases of inflammatory acne , and decrease acne due to their anti @-@ inflammatory properties and antimicrobial activity against P. acnes . Oral antibiotics are highly effective against inflammatory acne and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than application of topical antibiotics . They are believed to work both by decreasing the number of bacteria and as an anti @-@ inflammatory . With increasing resistance of P. acnes worldwide , they are becoming less effective . Commonly used antibiotics , either applied topically or taken orally , include clindamycin , erythromycin , metronidazole , <unk> , and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline . It is recommended that oral antibiotics be stopped and topical retinoids be used once the disease has improved . Furthermore , the use of topical antibiotics alone is discouraged due to concerns surrounding antibiotic resistance , but their use is recommended in combination with topical benzoyl peroxide . Topical dapsone is not typically used as a first @-@ line antibiotic due to its higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics . <unk> is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to reports of yellow @-@ orange skin discoloration with this combination of medications . 
 = = = = Hormonal = = = = 
 In women , acne can be improved with the use of any combined oral contraceptive . Oral contraceptives decrease the ovaries ' production of androgen hormones , resulting in lower skin production of sebum , and consequently improve acne severity . The combinations which contain third- or fourth @-@ generation progestins such as <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> may theoretically be more beneficial . A 2014 systematic review and meta @-@ analysis found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than oral contraceptives at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months . However , the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory , non @-@ inflammatory , and total acne lesions . The authors of the analysis suggested that oral contraceptives may be a preferred first @-@ line acne treatment over oral antibiotics in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance . 
 <unk> such as <unk> acetate and spironolactone have also been used successfully to treat acne , especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness , baldness , or increased skin production of oily sebum . The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone is an effective treatment for acne in adult women , but unlike combination oral contraceptives , it is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose . <unk> is thought to be a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses . It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive . Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with certain birth defects such as hypospadias and feminization of the male fetus or infant . Finasteride is also likely to be an effective treatment for acne . 
 = = = = Azelaic acid = = = = 
 Azelaic acid has been shown to be effective for mild @-@ to @-@ moderate acne when applied topically at a 20 % concentration . Application twice daily for six months is necessary , and treatment is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide 5 % , isotretinoin 0 @.@ 05 % , and erythromycin 2 % . Treatment of acne with azelaic acid is less effective and more expensive than treatment with retinoids . Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its antibacterial , anti @-@ inflammatory , and <unk> properties . Additionally , azelaic acid has a slight skin @-@ lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis , and is therefore useful in treatment of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation . Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe . 
 = = = = Salicylic acid = = = = 
 Salicylic acid is a topically applied beta @-@ hydroxy acid that possesses bacteriostatic and <unk> properties . Additionally , salicylic acid opens obstructed skin pores and promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells . Salicylic acid is known to be less effective than retinoid therapy . Dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect with topical application , though darkening of the skin has been observed in individuals with darker skin types who use salicylic acid . 
 = = = = Other medications = = = = 
 Topical and oral preparations of nicotinamide ( the amide form of vitamin B3 ) have been suggested as alternative medical treatments for acne . Nicotinamide is thought to improve acne due to its anti @-@ inflammatory properties , its ability to suppress sebum production , and its ability to promote wound healing . Similarly , topical and oral preparations of zinc have also been proposed as effective treatments for acne ; however , the evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited . Zinc 's benefits in acne are attributed to its beneficial effects against inflammation , sebum production , and P. acnes . Tentative evidence has found that antihistamines may improve symptoms among those already taking isotretinoin . Antihistamines are thought to improve acne due to their anti @-@ inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production . 
 = = = = Combination therapy = = = = 
 Combination therapy — using medications of different classes together , each with a different mechanism of action — has been demonstrated to be a more efficacious approach to acne treatment than monotherapy . The use of topical benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics together has been shown to be more effective than antibiotics alone . Similarly , using a topical retinoid with an antibiotic clears acne lesions faster than the use of antibiotics alone . Frequently used combinations include the following : antibiotic + benzoyl peroxide , antibiotic + topical retinoid , or topical retinoid + benzoyl peroxide . The pairing of benzoyl peroxide with a retinoid is preferred over the combination of a topical antibiotic with a retinoid since both regimens are effective but benzoyl peroxide does not lead to antibiotic resistance . 
 = = = Procedures = = = 
 <unk> extraction may temporarily help those with comedones that do not improve with standard treatment . A procedure for immediate relief is the injection of corticosteroids into the inflamed acne comedone . 
 Light therapy ( also known as <unk> therapy ) is a method that involves delivering intense pulses of light to the area with acne following the application of a <unk> substance such as aminolevulinic acid or methyl <unk> . This process is thought to kill bacteria and decrease the size and activity of the glands that produce sebum . As of 2012 , evidence for light therapy was insufficient to recommend it for routine use . Disadvantages of light therapy include its cost , the need for multiple visits , and the time required to complete the procedure . Light therapy appears to provide a short @-@ term benefit , but data for long @-@ term outcomes , and for outcomes in those with severe acne , are sparse . However , light therapy may have a role for individuals whose acne has been resistant to topical medications . Typical side effects of light therapy include skin peeling , temporary reddening of the skin , swelling , and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation . 
 <unk> is an effective therapeutic procedure for reducing the appearance of superficial atrophic scars of the boxcar and rolling varieties . Ice @-@ pick scars do not respond well to treatment with <unk> due to their depth . However , the procedure is painful and has many potential side effects such as skin sensitivity to sunlight , redness , and decreased pigmentation of the skin . <unk> has fallen out of favor with the introduction of laser resurfacing . Unlike <unk> , there is no evidence that <unk> is an effective treatment for acne . 
 Laser resurfacing can be used to reduce the scars left behind by acne . <unk> fractional <unk> laser resurfacing was found to be more effective for reducing acne scar appearance than non @-@ ablative fractional <unk> , but was associated with higher rates of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation ( usually about one @-@ month duration ) , facial redness ( usually for 3 – 14 days ) , and pain during the procedure . As of 2012 , the evidence to support the routine use of laser resurfacing as a treatment modality for acne was insufficient . Many studies that evaluated this form of treatment did not have a control group , did not compare laser resurfacing to effective medical treatments , or were of a short duration , thus limiting the quality of the evidence . 
 Chemical peels can also be used to reduce the appearance of acne scars . Mild chemical peels include those using glycolic acid , lactic acid , salicylic acid , <unk> 's solution , or a lower concentration ( 20 % ) of trichloroacetic acid . These peels only affect the epidermal layer of the skin and can be useful in the treatment of superficial acne scars as well as skin pigmentation changes from inflammatory acne . Higher concentrations of trichloroacetic acid ( 30 – 40 % ) are considered to be medium @-@ strength peels and affect skin as deep as the papillary dermis . Formulations of trichloroacetic acid concentrated to 50 % or more are considered to be deep chemical peels . <unk> and deep @-@ strength chemical peels are more effective for deeper atrophic scars , but are more likely to cause side effects such as skin pigmentation changes , infection , or <unk> . 
 = = = Pregnancy = = = 
 In general , topically applied medications are considered the first @-@ line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy , as topical therapies have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus . Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide ( category C ) and azelaic acid ( category B ) . Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption ( 9 – 25 % ) and an association between the use of anti @-@ inflammatory medications in the third trimester of pregnancy and adverse effects to the developing fetus including <unk> and early closure of the ductus arteriosus . Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm . Tretinoin ( category C ) and adapalene ( category C ) are very poorly absorbed , but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester . In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy , fetal harm has not been seen in the second and third trimesters . Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid tazarotene ( category X ) and oral retinoids isotretinoin ( category X ) and acitretin ( category X ) . <unk> is relatively contraindicated for use during pregnancy due to its <unk> effects . Finasteride is also not recommended for use during pregnancy as it is highly teratogenic . 
 Topical antibiotics deemed safe during pregnancy include clindamycin ( category B ) , erythromycin ( category B ) and metronidazole ( category B ) , due to negligible systemic absorption . <unk> and dapsone ( category C ) are other topical antibiotics that may be used to treat acne in pregnant women , but have received less extensive study . No adverse fetal events have been reported in association with topical use of dapsone during pregnancy . If retinoids are used during pregnancy , there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus ; therefore , women of childbearing age are required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne . Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy ( all category B ) include azithromycin , cephalosporins , and penicillins . <unk> ( category D ) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth , resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel . Use of tetracyclines in pregnancy has also been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is avoided for this reason as well . 
 = = = Alternative medicine = = = 
 Numerous natural products have been investigated for treating people with acne . Low @-@ quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce the total number of skin lesions in those with acne . Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid , but has been associated with cases of allergic contact dermatitis . Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil 's anti @-@ acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes and anti @-@ inflammatory properties . Numerous other plant @-@ derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne ( e.g. , basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed ) ; however , few studies have been performed , and most have been of lower methodological quality . There is a lack of high @-@ quality evidence for the use of acupuncture , herbal medicine , or cupping therapy for acne . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Acne usually improves around the age of 20 , but may persist into adulthood . Permanent physical scarring may occur . There is good evidence to support the idea that acne has a negative psychological impact , and that it worsens mood , lowers self @-@ esteem , and is associated with a higher risk of anxiety , depression , and suicidal thoughts . Another psychological complication of acne vulgaris is acne <unk> , which occurs when a person persistently picks and scratches pimples , irrespective of the severity of their acne . This can lead to significant scarring , changes in the affected person 's skin pigmentation , and a cyclic worsening of the affected person 's anxiety about their appearance . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Globally , acne affects approximately 650 million people , or about 9 @.@ 4 % of the population , as of 2010 . It affects nearly 90 % of people in Western societies during their teenage years , and may persist into adulthood . Acne after the age of 25 affects 54 % of women and 40 % of men . Acne vulgaris has a lifetime prevalence of 85 % . About 20 % of those affected have moderate or severe cases . It is slightly more common in females than males ( 9 @.@ 8 % versus 9 @.@ 0 % ) . In those over 40 years old , 1 % of males and 5 % of females still have problems . 
 Rates appear to be lower in rural societies . While some research has found it affects people of all ethnic groups , acne may not occur in the non @-@ Westernized peoples of Papua New Guinea and Paraguay . 
 Acne affects 40 to 50 million people in the United States ( 16 % ) and approximately 3 to 5 million in Australia ( 23 % ) . In the United States , acne tends to be more severe in Caucasians than in people of African descent . 
 = = History = = 
 Since at least as long ago as the reign of Cleopatra , the application of sulfur to the skin has been recognized as a useful form of treatment for acne . The sixth @-@ century Greek physician Aëtius of Amida is credited with coining the term " <unk> " ( <unk> , ) or " <unk> " , which is believed to have been a reference to facial skin lesions that occur during " the ' acme ' of life " ( referring to puberty ) . 
 In the 16th century , the French physician and botanist François <unk> de Sauvages de Lacroix provided one of the earlier descriptions of acne and used the term " <unk> <unk> " to describe small , red and hard tubercles that altered a person 's facial appearance during adolescence and were neither itchy nor painful . The recognition and characterization of acne progressed in 1776 when Josef <unk> ( an Austrian physician ) published a book that proposed the novel concept of classifying skin diseases by their elementary ( initial ) lesions . <unk> 's work was later refined when the English dermatologist Robert Willan authored his seminal 1808 treatise , which provided the first detailed descriptions of several skin disorders with morphologic terminology that continues to be used today . Thomas Bateman continued and expanded on Robert Willan 's work as his student and provided the medical literature 's first descriptions and illustrations of acne accepted as accurate by modern dermatologists . 
 <unk> originally hypothesized that acne represented a disease of the skin 's hair follicle and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum . During the 1880s , bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones , sebum production , and ultimately acne . During the mid @-@ twentieth century , dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor ( sebum , bacteria , or excess keratin ) could completely explain the disease . This led dermatologists to propose the modernly accepted idea that acne could be explained by a sequence of related events , beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells , followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore , changes in sebum production , and inflammation . 
 The approach to acne treatment also underwent significant changes during the twentieth century . Benzoyl peroxide was introduced as a medication to treat acne in the 1920s . Acne treatment was again modified in the 1950s with the introduction of oral tetracycline antibiotics ( such as minocycline ) , which reinforced the idea amongst dermatologists that bacterial growth on the skin plays an important role in causing acne . Subsequently , in the 1970s tretinoin ( original trade name <unk> A ) was found to be an effective treatment for acne . This preceded the development of oral isotretinoin ( sold as Accutane and <unk> ) in 1980 . Following the introduction of isotretinoin in the United States , it was recognized as a medication highly likely to cause birth defects if taken during pregnancy . In the United States , more than 2 @,@ 000 women became pregnant while taking the drug between 1982 and 2003 , with most pregnancies ending in abortion or miscarriage . About 160 babies with birth defects were born .

 The social and economic costs of treating acne vulgaris are substantial .

 = = = Stigma = = = 
 <unk> about acne 's causative and aggravating factors are common and those affected by acne are often blamed for their condition . Such blame can worsen the affected person 's sense of self @-@ esteem . Acne vulgaris and its resultant scars have been associated with significant social difficulties that can last into adulthood . 
 = = Research = = 
 Efforts are underway to better understand the mechanisms involved in sebum production . The aim of this research is to develop medications targeting hormones known to increase sebum production ( e.g. , IGF @-@ 1 and alpha @-@ <unk> @-@ stimulating hormone ) . Additional sebum @-@ lowering medications being researched include topical <unk> and <unk> modulators . Another avenue of early @-@ stage research has focused on how to best use laser and light therapy to selectively destroy sebaceous glands in the skin 's hair follicles to reduce sebum production and improve acne appearance . 
 The use of antimicrobial peptides against P. acnes is also under investigation as a novel method of treating acne and overcoming antibiotic resistance . In 2007 , the first genome sequencing of a P. acnes bacteriophage ( <unk> ) was reported . The authors proposed applying this research toward development of bacteriophage therapy as an acne treatment in order to overcome the problems associated with long @-@ term antibiotic therapy , such as bacterial resistance . Oral and topical probiotics are also being evaluated as treatments for acne . <unk> have been hypothesized to have therapeutic effects for those affected by acne due to their ability to decrease skin inflammation and improve skin moisture by increasing the skin 's ceramide content . As of 2014 , studies examining the effects of probiotics on acne in humans were limited . 
 Decreased levels of retinoic acid in the skin may contribute to comedone formation . To address this deficiency , and potentially replace the use of irritating topical retinoids , methods to increase the skin 's production of retinoid acid are being explored . A vaccine against inflammatory acne has been tested successfully in mice , but has not yet been proven to be effective in humans . Other workers have voiced concerns related to creating a vaccine designed to neutralize a stable community of normal skin bacteria that is known to protect the skin from colonization by more harmful microorganisms .

 = = History = = 
 Kajaani was one of the cities founded in 1651 by the Swedish Governor General of Finland , Per Brahe . At that time , the Kainuu region — as wood country — was an important producer of tar derived from pine , and the tar trade was its major industry . In 1653 @-@ 4 the district court sessions of Kajaani and <unk> were responsible for authorizing a road to be built between <unk> and <unk> , improving communications in the region . 
 During the Greater Wrath in the 18th century , Kajaani Castle was forced to surrender to Russian forces . The Russians blew the castle up in March 1716 , and it has been in ruins ever since . On 17 October 1808 , General Johan August Sandels won a key victory to the south of Kajaani near Iisalmi during the Battle of <unk> of the Finnish War , when his army of just 1 @,@ 800 defeated over 6 @,@ 000 Russians .

 = Kang and Kodos = 
 Kang and Kodos Johnson are a duo of recurring characters in the animated television series The Simpsons . Kang is voiced by Harry Shearer and Kodos by Dan Castellaneta . They are aliens from the fictional planet Rigel VII and appear almost exclusively in the " Treehouse of Horror " episodes . The duo has appeared in at least one segment of all twenty @-@ six Treehouse of Horror episodes . Sometimes their appearance is the focus of a plot , other times a brief cameo . Kang and Kodos are often bent on the conquest of Earth and are usually seen working on sinister plans to invade and subjugate humanity . 
 The duo first appeared in season two 's " Treehouse of Horror " . The first drawing of Kang and Kodos came from writers Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky . The finished design was based on an EC Comics issue cover . Kang and Kodos had brief cameo appearances in several non- " Treehouse of Horror " episodes and have appeared as villains in several of The Simpsons video games . 
 = = Role in The Simpsons = = 
 Speaking " <unk> " , which coincidentally sounds exactly like English , Kang and Kodos are Rigellians from the planet Rigel VII . Virtually identical in appearance , wearing breathing helmets , one of the few distinguishing characteristics is the duo 's voices as Kang 's is deeper . In most appearances they are antagonistic towards humanity . One exception is Kang and Kodos 's first appearance in " Treehouse of Horror " , where they capture the Simpson family and feed them exquisite cuisine . Lisa becomes suspicious of their intentions and accuses Kang and Kodos of wanting to eat the Simpson family . Kang and Kodos deny this accusation and are outraged . Afterwards both take the Simpsons back to Earth . Kang and Kodos have invaded the Earth on several occasions , with varying results . In 1996 , Kang and Kodos impersonated Bill Clinton and Bob Dole and ran against each other in the 1996 election . At first , Americans declared they would vote for a third party candidate , but Kang convinced them that the option would be a waste of a vote . As a result , Kang was elected president . In their second appearance , they decided to take over the Earth after citizens had declared world peace , but ultimately failed . Kang and Kodos 's religion is " Quantum Presbyterians " , although Kodos later claims to be Jewish . Other Rigellians that have appeared include Serak the Preparer , who was voiced by James Earl Jones and only appeared in " Treehouse of Horror " . 
 Kang and Kodos have appeared in every " Treehouse of Horror " episode to date , and have played major roles in " Treehouse of Horror I " , " Treehouse of Horror II " , " Treehouse of Horror VII " , " Treehouse of Horror IX " , " Treehouse of Horror XVII " , " Treehouse of Horror XVIII " . and " Treehouse of Horror XXII . The rest of their appearances were cameos , although both appeared in the opening segment of " Treehouse of Horror X " , " Treehouse of Horror XIV " , " Treehouse of Horror XV " and " Treehouse of Horror XVI " . Kang and Kodos 's cameo appearances normally occur in the midst of segments , which will suddenly cut away to the duo . For example , Kang and Kodos observe zombies attacking Earth from space . The duo laugh maniacally at the Earthlings ' suffering , before the scene is switched back from space to Earth . Kang and Kodos have made rare appearances in non- " Treehouse of Horror " episodes , such as " Behind the Laughter " and " Gump Roast " , and had a non @-@ speaking cameo in " The Springfield Files " on a line @-@ up with other aliens . Also , the duo can be seen in the crowd flyby during the updated HD opener . 
 In the episode " The Man Who Came to Be Dinner " , Kang and Kodos have one of their few canon appearances . The Simpsons end up on Rigel VII where Kang and Kodos give them a tour and a brief look at their lifecycle before placing them in a zoo with one of them , Homer , to be eaten in a yearly ritual . But after it is revealed that human consumption is fatal to their kind due to their unhealthy diet , their queen killed as a result , the <unk> send the Simpsons back to Earth . 
 In one Treehouse of Horror episode , Kang claims to be Maggie 's father , the result of an experiment to breed two different <unk> this episode was non @-@ canon , hints of Maggie 's <unk> <unk> have been hidden throughout " The Simpsons " .

 = = = Creation = = = 
 Kang and Kodos first appeared in the second season in " Treehouse of Horror " . The idea of Kang and Kodos came from Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky , writers of " Hungry are the Damned " . In the script , Kang and Kodos were shown as " an octopus in a space helmet with a trail of goo " . The finished design was based on EC Comics cover issue . Although originally designed to constantly drool , Matt Groening suggested that they not drool all the time to make the animation process easier . However , the animators did not mind the work , leading to the drooling staying in the script . Kang and Kodos 's names are derived from two Star Trek characters . Kang was a Klingon captain portrayed by actor Michael Ansara in " Day of the Dove " , whereas Kodos the Executioner was a human villain from " The Conscience of the King " . Harry Shearer voices Kang , and Dan Castellaneta voices Kodos . An unofficial rule for the writers is that Kang and Kodos must appear in every Halloween episode . Despite this rule , the writers say the duo will often be forgotten and are added at the last second , leading to brief appearances . 
 = = = Development = = = 
 Traditionally , Kang and Kodos appeared in every single Treehouse of Horror episode as a part of a story 's plotline or as cameos . They almost did not make the cut in " Treehouse of Horror VIII " , but David X. Cohen managed to persuade the producers to keep the scene . Kang however didn 't appear in Treehouse of Horror XXI . Kang and Kodos were originally going to make regular appearances in the show . One idea was only Homer would be able to see them and everyone else thinking Homer is crazy when he talked about the aliens . However the concept was " too far out " , leading to characters only featured in the " Treehouse of Horror " specials . In some appearances , Kang and Kodos will laugh hysterically for several seconds . This was suggested by Sam Simon . During production , the episodes would often be too short ; so to make more time , their laughter was lengthened . 
 Kodos ' gender has come into debate from fans . In " Treehouse of Horror VII " , Kang introduces Kodos with " This is my sister Kodos " . The line was pitched by George Meyer and was even somewhat followed in later episodes as the writers tried to make Kang the more dominant of the two . In previous and subsequent episodes , Kodos has been referred to as a male . In The Simpsons : Tapped Out video game , Kodos , but not Kang , is sent on a mission that only female characters are allowed to complete . In the Futurama crossover episode " Simpsorama " , Kang and Kodos , referred to as " the Johnsons " , visit recurring Futurama characters <unk> and <unk> for dinner in the 31st century , and both identify themselves as female .

In an attempt to collect new material for their failing reality TV show , Foolish Earthlings , Kang and Kodos plan to drug Springfield with a mind @-@ control serum distributed through their " New and Improved Buzz Cola " product . After drinking the cola , the brainwashed people performed stupid stunts under the watchful view of wasp @-@ like surveillance cameras , all for the sake of better ratings . They also appeared as villains in The Simpsons Game along with an army of other Rigellians , but like Simpsons Hit & Run Kang and Kodos only appear in cutscenes . In The Simpsons Tapped Out , Kang was a premium Character for 2012 Halloween , and Kodos followed in the 2013 Halloween . 
 In 2001 , Kang and Kodos were made into separate action figures in the World of Springfield toy line .

 Transandinomys bolivaris , also known as the long @-@ whiskered rice rat , is a rodent in the genus Transandinomys . It is found in humid forest from northeastern Honduras to western Ecuador , up to 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level . Since it was first described in 1901 from Ecuador , six scientific names have been introduced for it , but their common identity was not documented until 1998 and the species has long been known under the name Oryzomys bombycinus , described from Panama in 1912 . The name Oryzomys bolivaris was used before it was moved to the new genus Transandinomys with Transandinomys talamancae ( formerly Oryzomys talamancae ) in 2006 . 
 It is a medium @-@ sized rice rat distinguished by its very long vibrissae ( whiskers ) — those above the eyes are up to 50 mm ( 2 in ) long . The fur , which is soft and dense , is usually dark brown above and light gray below ; it is darker in juveniles . The feet are long and the tail is about as long as the head and body . The skull is narrow and has a broad interorbital region ( between the eyes ) . The species generally lives on the ground . Although it is rare , its conservation status is thought to be secure . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In 1901 , Joel Asaph Allen described four new species of rice rat in the genus Oryzomys : three from Ecuador and the Peruvian Oryzomys perenensis . The three Ecuadorian species – Oryzomys bolivaris from Porvenir , Bolívar Province ; Oryzomys castaneus from San Javier , <unk> Province ; and Oryzomys rivularis from Río Verde , Pichincha Province — were each based on a single specimen collected in 1899 or 1900 . He distinguished the three on the basis of coloration , size , and relative tail length . Philip Hershkovitz listed all three among the many synonyms of " Oryzomys laticeps " ( currently more narrowly defined as Hylaeamys laticeps ) in a 1960 paper . 
 Edward Alphonso Goldman described Oryzomys bombycinus in 1912 from four specimens from Panama . He compared it to Oryzomys talamancae and placed it with the " Oryzomys laticeps group " . Three years later , he described Oryzomys nitidus alleni from Costa Rica as a subspecies of Oryzomys nitidus , without mentioning bombycinus . He revised Oryzomys of North America in 1918 and recognized Oryzomys bombycinus as the only member of its own group , with alleni as a subspecies distinguished by the proportions of the skull . He also mentioned that the group occurred in Ecuador and indicated that O. bombycinus probably reached Colombia . Goldman considered the group to be similar to O. talamancae , but suggested that bombycinus and alleni might only be subspecies of O. nitidus . In 1939 , Oliver Pearson added a third subspecies , O. b. orinus , from eastern Panama , and in 1966 the species was first recorded from Colombia . Ronald Pine reviewed Oryzomys bombycinus in 1971 , when 59 specimens of it were known , and first recorded the species from Nicaragua and Ecuador . He kept the three described subspecies — alleni from Nicaragua to western Panama , bombycinus from central Panama , and orinus from eastern Panama to Ecuador . 
 Alfred Gardner and James Patton suggested in 1976 that Allen 's O. rivularis may be the same species as O. bombycinus . They considered O. bolivaris as probably the same as O. nitidus and listed castaneus as a synonym of O. capito ( equivalent to modern Hylaeamys megacephalus and closely related species plus Transandinomys talamancae ) . In 1984 , <unk> and colleagues reported the first record of Oryzomys bombycinus from Honduras . Guy Musser and Marina Williams reviewed O. talamancae in 1985 and included O. castaneus as one of its synonyms , though without having examined the holotype . In the 1993 second edition of Mammal Species of the World , Musser and Michael Carleton used the name Oryzomys bolivaris for the species previously known as O. bombycinus , and in 1998 , Musser and colleagues fully documented the allocation of the names bolivaris , castaneus , rivularis , bombycinus , alleni , and orinus to the same species , Oryzomys bolivaris . They noted its similarity to O. talamancae , but did not attempt to determine phylogenetic relationships among the species they discussed . In their limited material , they found geographic variation within the species inconsequential and they recognized no subspecies . 
 In 2006 , Marcelo Weksler published a phylogenetic analysis of Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , the tribe to which Oryzomys is allocated , using morphological and DNA sequence data . His results showed species of Oryzomys dispersed across Oryzomyini and suggested that most species in the genus should be allocated to new genera . Later in the same year , he , together with Alexandre Percequillo and Robert Voss , named ten new genera for these species , including Transandinomys , which has Oryzomys talamancae ( now Transandinomys talamancae ) as its type species . They also included Oryzomys bolivaris in Transandinomys , so that it is now named Transandinomys bolivaris , although it had not been included in Weksler 's phylogenetic study . The two species are morphologically similar , but they could identify only one synapomorphy ( shared @-@ derived trait ) for them : very long superciliary vibrissae ( whiskers above the eyes ) . Transandinomys is one of about 30 genera in Oryzomyini , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 Various authors have used the common name " long @-@ whiskered rice rat " for this species , but several other names have been proposed . In 1918 , Goldman named O. bombycinus bombycinus the " Long @-@ Haired Rice Rat " and O. b. alleni the " Allen Rice Rat " . Musser and Carleton , writing in the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World , used " Long @-@ whiskered Oryzomys " , the 2009 IUCN Red List gave " Bolivar Rice Rat " , and Thomas Lee and colleagues used " Long @-@ whiskered Trans @-@ Andean Rice Rat " in 2010 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Transandinomys bolivaris is a medium @-@ sized rice rat with very long superciliary vibrissae ( more than 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) long and extending well beyond the ears when laid back against the head ) . According to Fiona Reid 's Mammals of Southeastern Mexico & Central America , it is distinguishable from any similarly sized rice rats by the length of these whiskers ; T. talamancae also has long superciliary vibrissae , but not as long as in T. bolivaris . In both species , the mystacial vibrissae ( above the mouth ) are also long and extend beyond the ears when laid back , but they are again much longer in T. bolivaris . The vibrissae are mostly dark , but translucent at the tips . Handleyomys alfaroi , a rice rat with which young T. bolivaris are often confused , is much smaller . In T. bolivaris , the cheeks may be light gray , buff , or reddish . The ears are dark brown to black and are sparsely haired . 
 The fur , which is soft , dense , and thick , is dark brown to gray on the upperparts , grading to black on the <unk> and yellowish brown on the sides . The underparts are sharply different in color . There , the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips , so that the fur appears grayish white . The fur is shorter and darker than in T. talamancae and softer and thicker than in H. alfaroi . Young animals have darker , finer , and softer fur . Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus on the basis of their darker fur , but Musser and colleagues could not confirm this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions . 
 The tail appears naked and is shorter than or about as long as the head and body ; it is longer in T. talamancae . Its coloration is variable ; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white to a greater or smaller extent below , and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below . The scales on the tail are smaller than in T. talamancae . 
 The forearms are dark gray . The forefeet are unpigmented and ungual tufts of white hairs surround the equally unpigmented claws . The animal has long , narrow hindfeet , longer than in T. talamancae , with usually smooth soles ( lacking squamae , which are present in T. talamancae ) . The three middle digits are much longer than the outer two . Six pads are present on the sole . The upper surface and the sides of the hindfeet are white and appear naked , although short , white hairs are present ; these hairs are longer in T. talamancae . Ungual tufts of long , white or gray hairs are present around the claws , which are short and lack pigment . 
 Head and body length is 100 to 140 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 5 in ) , tail length 90 to 130 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 to 5 @.@ 1 in ) , hindfoot length 27 to 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 4 in ) , ear length 16 to 21 mm ( 0 @.@ 63 to 0 @.@ 83 in ) , and body mass 39 to 75 g ( 1 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 6 oz ) . Females have four pairs of mammae , as usual in oryzomyines . Like most rice rats , T. bolivaris has twelve thoracic ( chest ) and seven lumbar vertebrae . A study in Costa Rica found that there are 58 chromosomes , including many that are large and have two arms , and the fundamental number of arms is 80 ( 2n 
 = 58 , FN = 
 80 ) , a highly differentiated karyotype . The karyotype of T. talamancae is variable , but has fewer chromosomes ( 34 to 54 ) and major arms ( 60 to 67 ) . H. alfaroi has more chromosomes ( 60 to 62 ) and major arms ( 100 to 104 ) . 
 = = = Skull and teeth = = = 
 The skull is relatively long and has a long , narrow rostrum ( front region ) , broad interorbital region ( between the eyes ) and narrow braincase with almost vertically oriented walls at the sides and behind . It differs from that of T. talamancae in various proportions . Although the subspecies previously recognized in " Oryzomys bombycinus " have been separated by small differences in skull features , Pine rejected these on the basis of his much larger samples . Musser and colleagues agreed , but noted that Colombian animals appeared to have larger skulls . The zygomatic plates are broad and the zygomatic arches ( cheekbones ) behind them are nearly parallel to each other . The margins of the interorbital region contain prominent beads , which extend to the braincase as temporal ridges ; these are usually less well @-@ developed in T. talamancae . Unlike in T. talamancae and H. alfaroi , the parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to the sides . 
 The incisive foramina , which perforate the front part of the palate , do not extend between the molars . The palate ends beyond the third molars and is perforated by posterolateral palatal pits there . Behind it , the roof of the mesopterygoid fossa is perforated by poorly developed sphenopalatine vacuities . The auditory bullae , which house the inner ear , are large . Usually , the mastoid bone lacks openings ( fenestrae ) , which are present in T. talamancae . The pattern of the arteries in the head is primitive , as indicated by the condition of various foramina ( openings ) and grooves in the skull . 
 The mandible ( lower jaw ) looks chunky and has a long condyloid process at its back ; that of T. talamancae is more slender . The capsular process , a projection at the back of the jaw which houses the root of the lower incisor , is poorly developed . 
 The incisors are large and <unk> . Their enamel is orange , but paler on the lowers . The orientation of the upper incisors is opisthodont , with the cutting edge oriented backwards . The molars are brachydont ( low @-@ crowned ) and have two rows of main cusps separated by deep valleys and complemented by a network of crests and smaller cusps . The first upper molar is broader than in T. talamancae . As in this species , but unlike in many other rice rats , including H. alfaroi , the mesoflexus on the second upper molar , which separates the paracone ( one of the main cusps ) from the mesoloph ( an accessory crest ) , is not divided in two by an enamel bridge . The hypoflexid on the second lower molar , the main valley between the cusps , is very long , extending more than halfway across the tooth ; in this trait , it is similar to T. talamancae but unlike H. alfaroi . Each of the upper molars has three roots ( two on the outer and one on the inner side ) and each of the lowers has two ( one at the front and another at the back ) . 
 = = Distribution , ecology , and behavior = = 
 Transandinomys bolivaris is an uncommon species . Its known distribution extends from northeastern Honduras , on the Caribbean seaboard , through eastern Nicaragua , Costa Rica , and Panama , into coastal western Colombia and northwestern and west @-@ central Ecuador . It has been found near sea level and the upper altitudinal records are at nearly 1 @,@ 500 m ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) in Panama and 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) in Ecuador . This distribution coincides with that of the humid <unk> forest . It generally occurs in areas with mean temperatures above 16 ° C ( 60 @.@ 8 ° F ) and annual rainfall of 4 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 mm ( 157 to 236 in ) , prefers mid @-@ elevation forests ( 600 to 900 m or 1 @,@ 970 to 2 @,@ 950 ft ) , and often occurs near water . The actual range of this species may be expected to extend further north and west , perhaps into Veracruz , southern Mexico , and western Venezuela , where it has not yet been recorded . Omar Linares mentioned a possible record from the Lake Maracaibo region of northwestern Venezuela in 1998 . Its range is similar to that of various other rainforest animals , including the <unk> hawk ( <unk> <unk> ) , the rice rats Sigmodontomys alfari and S. aphrastus , the spiny rats <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the opossum Marmosa <unk> . T. talamancae and H. alfaroi are often found in the same localities as T. bolivaris , but also occur in other areas . 
 Little is known of its biology . The species mainly lives on the ground , but some young animals have been taken in vegetation , up to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) above the ground . It is usually captured " under logs , around the roots of large trees , or among rocks along streams . " Two females with four embryos each have been caught in Panama in June , one with two in Nicaragua in September , and one with four in Costa Rica in December . A very young specimen was trapped in Costa Rica in March . One pregnant female was herself still in juvenile fur . Four species of mites have been found on T. bolivaris in Panama ( Gigantolaelaps gilmorei , G. <unk> , Laelaps <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ) , two chiggers ( <unk> panamensis and Pseudoschoengastia bulbifera ) , and two fleas ( Polygenis roberti and Polygenis <unk> ) . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 The 2009 IUCN Red List lists T. bolivaris as " Least Concern " , as it is a widely distributed species with a presumably large population that is found in numerous protected areas . However , habitat destruction by deforestation may pose a threat . 
 = Ring a Ring o ' Roses = 
 " Ring a Ring o ' Roses " or " Ring Around the Rosie " is a nursery rhyme or folksong and playground singing game . It first appeared in print in 1881 , but it is reported that a version was already being sung to the current tune in the 1790s and similar rhymes are known from across Europe . It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of <unk> . Urban legend says the song originally described the plague , specifically the Great Plague of London , or the Black Death , but folklorists reject this idea . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 It is unknown what the earliest version of the rhyme was or when it began . Many incarnations of the game have a group of children form a ring and dance in a circle around a person and stoop or curtsy with the final line . The slowest child to do so would be faced with some penalty or become the " rosie " ( literally : rose tree ) from the French rosier ) and take their place in the center of the ring . Numerous variations , corruptions and even several vulgarized versions were noted to be in use long prior to the earliest printed publications . One such variation was dated to be in use in Connecticut in the 1840s . 
 Common British versions include : 
 Common American versions include :

 = = = Early attestation = = = 
 The first printing of the rhyme was in Kate Greenaway 's 1881 edition of Mother Goose ; or , the Old Nursery Rhymes : 
 A novel of 1855 , The Old Homestead by Ann S. Stephens , describes children playing " Ring , ring a rosy " in New York . William Wells Newell reports two versions in America a short time later ( 1883 ) and says that another was known in New Bedford , Massachusetts around 1790 : 
 There are also versions from Shropshire , collected in 1883 , and a manuscript of rhymes collected in Lancashire at the same period gives three closely related versions , with the now familiar sneezing , for instance : 
 In 1892 , folklorist Alice Gomme could give twelve versions . 
 = = = Other languages = = = 
 A German rhyme first printed in 1796 closely resembles " Ring a ring o <unk> " in its first stanza and accompanies the same actions ( with sitting rather than falling as the concluding action ) : 
 Loosely translated this says : " Ringed , ringed row . We are three children , sitting under an elder bush . All of us going hush , hush , hush ! " The rhyme is well known in Germany with the first line " Ringel , Ringel , Reihe " ( as the popular collection Des Knaben Wunderhorn gave it ) ; it has many local variants , often with " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " ( which in German could mean " quick , quick " ) in the fourth line , comparable to the " Hush ! hush ! hush ! hush ! " of the first printed English version . Notable also this popular variant : 
 The translation is : " A ring , a ring of roses . Beautiful apricots . Blue violets , forget @-@ me @-@ nots . All children sit down . " Swiss versions have the children dancing round a <unk> . Other European singing games with a strong resemblance include " Roze , <unk> , <unk> " ( " Rose , rose , May " ) from The Netherlands with a similar tune to " Ring a ring o ' roses " and " Gira , <unk> rosa " ( " Circle , circle , rose " ) , recorded in Venice in 1874 , in which girls danced around the girl in the middle who skipped and curtsied as demanded by the verses and at the end kissed the one she liked best , so choosing her for the middle . 
 = = Meaning = = 
 The origins and meanings of the game have long been unknown and subject to speculation . In 1898 , A Dictionary of British Folklore contained the belief that an explanation of the game was of pagan origin , based on the Sheffield Glossary comparison of Grimm 's <unk> . Myth . The theory states that it is in reference to Pagan myths and cited a passage which states , " Gifted children of fortune have the power to laugh roses , as <unk> wept gold . " Believing the first instance to be indicative of Pagan beings of light . Another suggestion is more literal , that it was making a " ring " around the roses and bowing with the all " fall down " as a curtsy . In 1892 , the American writer , Eugene Field wrote a poem titled Teeny @-@ Weeny that specifically referred to fey folk playing ring @-@ a @-@ rosie . According to Games and Songs of American Children , published in 1883 , the " rosie " was a reference to the French word for rose tree and the children would dance and stoop to the person in the center . Variations , especially more literal ones , were identified and noted with the literal falling down that would sever the connections to the game @-@ rhyme . Addy 's interpretation failed to account for the sneezing , which had not carried over to the United States and was losing ground in Britain , as another instance of the Pagan influence . Again in 1898 , sneezing was then noted to be indicative of many superstitious and supernatural beliefs across differing cultures . 
 Since the 20th century , the rhyme has often been associated with the Great Plague which happened in England in 1665 , or with earlier outbreaks of the Black Death in England . Interpreters of the rhyme before the Second World War make no mention of this ; by 1951 , however , it seems to have become well established as an explanation for the form of the rhyme that had become standard in the United Kingdom . Peter and Iona Opie , the leading authorities on nursery rhymes , remarked : 
 The invariable sneezing and falling down in modern English versions have given would @-@ be origin finders the opportunity to say that the rhyme dates back to the Great Plague . A rosy rash , they allege , was a symptom of the plague , and <unk> of herbs were carried as protection and to ward off the smell of the disease . Sneezing or coughing was a final fatal symptom , and " all fall down " was exactly what happened . 
 The line Ashes , Ashes in colonial versions of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies , the burning of victims ' houses , or blackening of their skin , and the theory has been adapted to be applied to other versions of the rhyme . In its various forms , the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague . 
 Folklore scholars regard the theory as baseless for several reasons : 
 The plague explanation did not appear until the mid @-@ twentieth century . 
 The symptoms described do not fit especially well with the Great Plague . 
 The great variety of forms makes it unlikely that the modern form is the most ancient one , and the words on which the interpretation are based are not found in many of the earliest records of the rhyme ( see above ) . 
 European and 19th @-@ century versions of the rhyme suggest that this " fall " was not a literal falling down , but a curtsy or other form of bending movement that was common in other dramatic singing games . 
 = Port of Albany – Rensselaer = 
 The Port of Albany – Rensselaer , widely known as the Port of Albany , is a port of entry in the United States with facilities on both sides of the Hudson River in Albany and Rensselaer , New York . Private and public port facilities have existed in both cities since the 17th century , with an increase in shipping after the Albany Basin and Erie Canal were built with public funds in 1825 . 
 The port 's modern name did not come into widespread use until 1925 ; the current port was constructed in 1932 under the governorship of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression . It included the largest grain elevator in the world at the time . Today the grain elevator is the largest in the United States east of the Mississippi River ; the port has the tallest harbor crane in the state of New York . 
 The port has rail connections with the Albany Port Railroad , which allows for connections with <unk> and CP Rail . It is near several interstates and the New York State Canal System . The port features several tourist attractions as well , such as the USS Slater ( DE @-@ 766 ) , the only destroyer escort still afloat in the United States . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Port of Albany consists of roughly 236 acres ( 96 ha ) , including about 202 acres ( 82 ha ) in Albany and 34 acres ( 14 ha ) in Rensselaer . It is 124 nautical miles ( 230 km ) north of New York Harbor . From New York Harbor to the Federal Dam three miles ( 5 km ) north of Albany , the Hudson River is an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean . The Hudson has a deep water shipping channel 400 feet ( 120 m ) across , and at Albany the river is 700 feet ( 210 m ) across with a maximum 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) saltwater draft and a mean range of tides of 4 @.@ 7 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) . The port is at sea level . 
 = = History = = 
 Since the founding of Albany in 1624 as a trading post , shipping has been important to its growth and prosperity . Furs ( especially beaver ) , timber , and farm produce were important exports while European people and goods were shipped in . The Dongan Charter , which established Albany as a city , made Albany the exclusive market town in the upper Hudson River Valley . From its beginning , the port consisted of hastily built docks built every spring and destroyed every winter by erosion , flooding , ice , and tidal action . Three city @-@ owned docks were established in 1766 , the northern and southern ones later being expanded into wharves . 
 Many historically significant ships used Albany as their home port . The Experiment left Albany in 1785 to become the second American ship to sail to China . In 1809 Robert Fulton 's Clermont became the first commercially viable steamboat when it left Albany and sailed down the Hudson to the city of New York . In 1825 a 4 @,@ 300 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 300 m ) long and 80 @-@ foot ( 24 m ) wide pier was constructed 250 feet ( 76 m ) from , and perpendicular to , Albany 's shoreline . Along with two bridges the pier enclosed roughly 32 acres ( 13 ha ) of the Hudson River as the Albany Basin . The construction of the pier and bridges cost $ 119 @,@ 980 . The basin was located where the Erie Canal , constructed between 1818 and 1825 , met the Hudson River . The basin could accommodate 1 @,@ 000 canal boats and 50 steamboat moorings . Along the Erie Canal within the city 's North Albany neighborhood private wharves and slips were constructed for use in the lumber trade , this soon became the large and prosperous Albany Lumber District of national importance . In 1860 Albany , along with nearby Watervliet and Troy , was the largest lumber market in the state . The Maiden Lane Bridge was constructed in 1871 over the basin to connect Albany with the east side of the river , it was open to railroad traffic only . 
 The Albany Port District was established in 1925 under New York law Chapter 192 . This was only four years after the interstate compact that created the Port of New York Authority ( later renamed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ) . In 1932 Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt unveiled a modern port to replace the aging infrastructure of the Albany Basin and the lumber district along the Erie Canal in the North Albany neighborhood . The port was constructed on around 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) on Westerlo Island in the southern end of Albany along with approximately 34 acres ( 140 @,@ 000 m2 ) across the river in the city of Rensselaer . The grain elevator at the port , built during the original construction in 1932 , was the largest in the world and as of 2008 is still considered to be the largest in the United States east of the Mississippi River . The area of Albany 's original port ( the Albany Basin ) has been covered by Interstate 787 and the Corning Preserve ( Riverfront Park ) since the very early 1970s . In 1979 remnants of the basin wall were excavated from the preserve 's lagoon by Phillip Lord working for the New York State Museum . 
 A Master Plan adopted in 2000 called for the port to be transformed into a container port , which led to the purchase of the largest harbor crane in the state . In 2002 , the Port District Commission took the lead in the development of Albany 's Riverfront Park in the Corning Preserve as part of a development to enhance Albany 's access to the river . The port helped in financing the project and in the construction of two bulkheads which have seasonal floating docks attached . In a 2005 audit , the Office of the State Comptroller questioned the port 's involvement in the construction and financing . Two issues raised were the port district 's lack of authority to build docks for non @-@ commercial use and that the port would receive no income for facilities it was financing . The port received $ 3 @.@ 3 million in 2002 to upgrade and become a member of the Inland Distribution Network , a select group of ports that are used as satellite locations for the distribution of container cargo from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey , resulting in less congestion at downstate ports and highways . 
 On December 9 , 2003 , the <unk> , a Dutch @-@ owned ship , capsized at the port , killing three Russian crewmembers . The ship was hauling General Electric generators when it overturned . The United States Coast Guard determined that poor communication resulting from the supervisors speaking Dutch while the crew spoke Russian , with English being used as a relay , was a contributing factor to mismanagement of ballast tanks . In the early spring of 2008 a port employee was arrested for stealing copper . This in turn led to investigations of employee theft which resulted in the arrest of an operations manager and a maintenance foreman for larceny . In 2008 the port received two awards from the Railway Industrial Clearance Association . One award was for customer satisfaction and the other for being the most improved port in the United States for handling heavy lift cargo .

 The Port of Albany is replacing 500 feet ( 150 m ) of <unk> at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 6 million in 2008 and 2009 . In late March 2008 a proposal for a $ 350 million ethanol plant was approved by the Albany Port District Commission , but the project has been held up due to financing issues .

 The Albany Port District Commission is a public benefit corporation created by the state of New York to develop and manage port facilities anywhere in the cities of Albany and Rensselaer . The commission has five members , four of which are nominated by the mayor of Albany and one is nominated by the mayor of Rensselaer . The governor of New York then appoints them to three @-@ year terms . The commissioners serve without pay , but are compensated for business related expenses . The commission is considered to be a unit of the city of Albany and is included in the city 's financial statements . Any deficit in the finances of the commission are assessed against both Albany and Rensselaer . In 1932 the state decided that any deficit assessment would be based on Albany owing 88 % of the total and Rensselaer 12 % . In 2005 the commission had a staff of 35 employees : eight in administrative duties , five in maintenance , and 22 as part @-@ time security .

The Albany Port Customs District includes all of the following counties : Albany , Columbia , Delaware , Fulton , Greene , Montgomery , Otsego , Rensselaer , Saratoga , Schenectady , Schoharie , Warren , and Washington ; along with the parts of Dutchess , Sullivan , and Ulster counties north of 41 ° 42 ' N. latitude . The 35 acres ( 140 @,@ 000 m2 ) on the Rensselaer side of the port is site C of Foreign Trade Zone number 121 .

 = Hard Candy ( Madonna album ) = 
 Hard Candy is the eleventh studio album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was released on April 19 , 2008 , by Warner Bros. Records . The album was her final studio album with the record company , marking the end of a 25 @-@ year recording history . Madonna started working on the album in early 2007 , and collaborated with Justin Timberlake , Timbaland , The Neptunes and Nate " Danja " Hills . The album has an overall R & B vibe , while remaining a dance @-@ pop record at its core . The Pet Shop Boys were also asked to collaborate with Madonna on the album by Warner Bros. , but the record company later changed their mind and withdrew their invitation . 
 Madonna became interested in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex / LoveSounds . Together they developed a number of songs for the album , but the basis of the development was Pharrell Williams ' demos . Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album , which amazed Timberlake . They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song . Later , Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects . However , according to her this was not intentional and happened while she was in the process of developing the album . 
 Madonna had initially decided to portray herself as the Black Madonna for the cover art , and call it the same , but later felt the idea may have been seen as controversial . She instead named the album " Hard Candy " , which refers to the juxtaposition of toughness and sweetness . Critical reaction to the album were generally favorable , though some reviewers condemned it for its attempt to harness the urban market . On release Hard Candy debuted at number one in 37 countries worldwide , including the United States , Australia , Canada , France , Germany , Japan , Spain and the United Kingdom and became the eleventh best @-@ selling album worldwide of 2008 . The album has sold more than 4 million copies worldwide . 
 Three singles were released from the album . The first , " 4 Minutes " , was a worldwide success , topping the charts in 21 countries and becoming Madonna 's 37th Billboard Hot 100 top @-@ ten hit . Other singles released were " Give It 2 Me " and " Miles Away " . To promote the album , Madonna went on a small promotional tour , where she played in three cities in small venues . The album received the majority of its promotion from the 2008 – 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour , which went on to become the highest grossing tour ever by a solo female artist . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In February 2007 , Timbaland said that he was working with Madonna for her upcoming eleventh studio album . It was Madonna 's last studio album for Warner Bros. Records , and following the release of a greatest hits collection ( Celebration ) , she would join Live Nation Artists , a new initiative launched by concert promoter Live Nation . The 10 @-@ year deal with Live Nation encompassed all of Madonna 's future music and music @-@ related businesses , including the exploitation of the Madonna brand , new studio albums , touring , merchandising , fan clubs / Web sites , DVDs , music @-@ related television and film projects and associated sponsorship agreements . In August 2007 , Timbaland spoke about the development of the album to MTV News . Together he and Justin Timberlake were confirmed to have worked on the album with Madonna and said that they wrote ten songs for her . Songs confirmed to have been developed were " La , La " and " Candy Shop " , which was written by Pharrell Williams . Timbaland added , 
 " Me and Justin did the records . [ Madonna 's ] got a hot album . Her album is up there with Justin 's album . [ ... ] Ah , man , there 's this one song , we taking it back to ' You must be my luck @-@ <unk> <unk> ! ' ... Remember ' Ugly ' by Bubba Sparxxx ? I got a beat similar to that . The hook is no words . It 's saying stuff named after coffee ... The name of the song is ' La , La ' . Pharrell did a hot one for her too called ' Candy Shop ' . " 
 Timbaland finished off by saying that the title of the album was not decided then , but he had to reconvene with Madonna to complete the record by September 2007 . MTV described the new album as moving in an urban direction . It had initially been defined as having " a lot of producers from a lot of genres in there . " Pet Shop Boys were originally asked by Warner to write and produce some songs for the album . Timbaland referred to the album as being " like ' Holiday ' with an R & B groove " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The album features vocal appearances by Timberlake , Timbaland , Pharrell Williams and Kanye West . It features production by Madonna , Timbaland , Timberlake , The Neptunes and Nate " Danja " Hills . Previously , Madonna had worked with relatively unknown producers like William Orbit , Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Stuart Price . However , for Hard Candy Madonna decided to collaborate with producers and artists who were already well @-@ known . Talking to MTV , Madonna explained her decision to collaborate with well @-@ known producers : " Because they 're good , and I like their shit . [ ... ] I mean , I don 't like to repeat myself , and I was sitting around thinking , ' What music do I love right now ? ' And it was actually [ Timberlake 's ] record FutureSex / LoveSounds . [ ... ] I was listening to it obsessively . " 
 Madonna had already started work on the album with Williams , and during one of her breaks from recording , her manager Guy Oseary spoke to Timberlake , suggesting that it " would be cool " if he recorded some songs with her . Timberlake commented " ' That would be awesome , ' but I thought , ' That 'll never happen ' , [ ... ] But it 's a testament to Pharrell . He had already laid the groundwork where she was going with it . She played ' Candy Shop ' for me , and a couple of other songs , and I thought , ' What a cool direction . ' I thought she could essentially do the whole record with Pharrell if she wanted to , and I asked Tim , ' How do we fit in ? ' And it basically came down to how we did my record , co @-@ producing , and just throwing Madonna in the mix . " The first track recorded by Madonna and Timberlake was " Devil Wouldn 't Recognize You " . Timberlake felt that the song , which Madonna had been working on for years before the Hard Candy project , was comparable to " Frozen " ( 1998 ) . He wanted to turn the line " ' The devil wouldn 't recognize you , but I do " into a catchy hook and make it sound like a concept . 
 Timberlake was impressed by the amount of recording material Madonna would already have ready . He said that he does not normally write down his lyrics , since the ideas come faster to him , but Madonna had " all these thoughts , riddles , poems , feelings , all written in huge notebooks ... she kept handing them over . It was amazing , taking these little bits here and there and putting them together like a puzzle . " For recording " Miles Away " , Timberlake played a guitar riff for Madonna and asked " How do we want to do this ? What do we want it to be about ? What do we want to say ? " Madonna decided to have discussions between herself and Timberlake to develop other ideas for the songs . One of the ideas they connected on was the universality of long @-@ distance relationships , which they felt was too personal for them , but nevertheless used the concept in " Miles Away " . Madonna commented on the recorded version : " We put our stuff out there . [ ... ] And after we did the song , everybody in the studio was like , ' Oh , I can relate to that . ' " 
 = = Music structure and composition = = 
 With Interview magazine , Madonna explained her inspirations behind the songs and the music of Hard Candy . She said that " probably in many respects most of the songs [ on Hard Candy ] are [ autobiographical ] . But in more of an unconscious way . I don 't really think about telling personal stories when I 'm writing music . It just comes . And then a lot of times , six months later , eight months later , I go , ' Oh , that 's what I wrote that song about . ' But that 's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go , ' Oh , I can totally relate to that . ' " " Candy Shop " is the opening track of the album . Produced by Williams , the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex . Williams said , " We were just in a studio , [ ... ] and [ Madonna ] was like , ' Look , give me some hot shit . ' I was looking at her like , ' She 's saying hot shit ? ' She was like , ' What ? ' And I 'm like , ' OK . ' So we just worked and made it . " The first single from the album , " 4 Minutes " , was initially known as " 4 Minutes to Save the World " . The song 's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction , and how people can enjoy themselves in the process . According to Madonna , the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are . The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland . An uptempo dance song with an urban , hip hop style , it also incorporates Timbaland 's bhangra beats . The instrumentation used in the song includes brass , foghorns and cow bells . The song 's lyrics carry a message of social awareness , inspired by Madonna 's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed . 
 In " Give It 2 Me " , the album 's second single , Madonna merged bounce @-@ beats and a funky bassline . " If it 's against the law , arrest me " , she sings " If you can handle it , undress me . " The song has a short interlude where Madonna continuously <unk> the words " Get stupid " , as Williams chants , " To the left , to the right " . " Give It 2 Me " was written by Madonna as an anthemic , self @-@ manifesto song which , although it appears to be about dance and sex , is a reference to Madonna 's career spanning three decades in the music industry . Musically it is an upbeat dance song , featuring instrumentation from West African percussion and cowbells . Backing vocals are provided by Williams . The fourth track " Heartbeat " has Madonna singing breathlessly and also features an interlude where the music changes from its normal rhythm , just the sound of drums . 
 MTV said that " Miles Away " , the third single from the album , was the most deceptively simple track because although it appeared straightforward on the surface , it had a lot of technical tricks underneath it . The song departs from the dance theme of the album and deals with the difficulties of long @-@ distance relationships . " Miles Away " is a melancholy electronic ballad , which , according to Madonna is autobiographical , and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie . The relationship themed lyrics continue in the next track " She 's Not Me " , which talks about Madonna being emulated by another woman , hence she utters the line " She started dressing like me and talking like me , It freaked me out , She started calling you up in the middle of the night , What 's that about ? " 
 The next track " Incredible " starts off like a love song but reveals itself to be a plea to someone to start over , while changing its composition from the interlude . According to MTV , the shift in the structure reflected Madonna 's own confusion about how she felt about her lover in the song . " Can 't get my head around it " , she sang . " I , I need to think about it . " " Beat Goes On " featuring West , has a 70s R & B meeting 80s dance vibe and a rap interlude by West . Williams has commented that Madonna 's work ethic was different from other artists that he had worked with before . That is reflected in songs like " Spanish Lesson " where she sings the line " If you do your homework / Baby I will give you more " . It also has influences of Spanish music . Groove inspired music is present in " Dance <unk> " , which featured Timberlake . 
 " Devil Wouldn 't Recognize You " was written by Madonna before the Hard Candy project started . The song has a sense of mystery and starts off softly and slowly with a piano introduction . It then becomes fast and melancholy , with Madonna singing : " Your eyes are full of surprises / They cannot predict my fate " . The trip hop inspired " Voices " is the last track of the album , consisting of unresolved chords and sweeping strings , as the lyrics question who is really in control : " Are you walking the dog ? / Is the dog walking you ? "

 Hard Candy was released on April 25 , 2008 , in the European countries of Germany , Ireland , Austria and Netherlands . On April 28 , the album was released in the United Kingdom , Brazil and throughout the rest of Europe , and on April 29 , in the United States , Mexico and Canada . Billboard reported that the title of the album was Licorice , as announced on the Sirius Satellite Radio programme <unk> . In an interview with MTV Australia , Madonna explained that a prominent theme of the Hard Candy album was about incorporating the image of a boxer , an idea which has been repeated within the song " Give It 2 Me " . According to her , " [ ' Give It 2 Me ' ] is basically [ opposite in meaning ] . I 'm not [ ... ] , ' give me all you got ' [ kind of person ] , so it 's quite a sort of tough stance . " Hence , initially Madonna decided that the title of the song was to be used for the then @-@ unnamed album . This was changed following the release of a similarly named song by Timbaland . After that , Madonna decided to call the album Black Madonna , and even shot a photograph for the cover art , wearing blackface make @-@ up with white eyes . In a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone Madonna commented : 
 " I did a photoshoot with Steven Klein for my last album cover , and I painted my face black , except for red lips and white eyes . It was a play on words . Have you ever heard of the Black Madonna ? It has layers of meaning and for a minute , I thought it would be a fun title for my record . Then I thought , ' Twenty @-@ five per cent of the world might get this , probably less , it 's not worth it . ' It happens all the time , because my references are usually off the Richter scale . " 
 The title of the album was finally confirmed by MTV as Hard Candy . Madonna 's representative Liz Rosenberg told Entertainment Weekly : " She loves candy , [ ... ] [ The title is ] about the juxtaposition of tough and sweetness , or as Madonna so eloquently expressed : ' I 'm gonna kick your ass , but it 's going to make you feel good . " The album cover art was also released at the same time and featured Madonna with short cropped hair in a black leotard with a professional wrestling championship belt across her waist . The belt includes the inscription " Give It to Me " , the original title of the album . The backdrop displayed pink peppermint swirls . The photo was taken during a photoshoot with Klein for Interview magazine 's April 2008 issue .

 Following the album 's release , Madonna went on a promotional tour for the album , which was the first venture as part of her new contract with concert promoters Live Nation with media content provided by " Frank the Plumber LLC " . The show consisted of a 40 @-@ minute set featuring six songs , with dates in New York City , Paris and Maidstone . In an interview with the BBC , Madonna stated : 
 " Obviously , I want to do new stuff because I 'm very excited about it . I feel that 's what people come to hear but I also want to do a few of my oldies but goodies . I chose " Hung Up " because that was the biggest hit from my last record and I chose " Music " because it 's a crowd pleaser , it 's anthemic and it brings people together . " 
 The show had an expandable , five @-@ platform stage which displayed the album 's cover art . Madonna , wearing a skintight black suit and a lace top , appeared on the stage while sitting on a throne with a golden walking stick , as the music of " Candy Shop " started . Images of confectionery flashed on the television screens flanking the back of the stage . Madonna , along with her six dancers , gyrated in choreographed dance moves . Next , Madonna strapped on an acoustic guitar , took a swig from a champagne bottle and started singing " Miles Away " , as images of planes taking off and landing , airports and various locations around the globe were projected across the screens behind her . After that " 4 Minutes " was performed , which mimicked its video with a flashing countdown clock . Then Madonna paused for a moment to thank her collaborators , including Timberlake , West , Timbaland and others . " I feel like the luckiest girl in the world " , she said , before dedicating the next song , " Hung Up " from 2005 's Confessions on a Dance Floor , to her fans . The song was mixed with The Rolling Stones track " ( I Can 't Get No ) Satisfaction " . It was followed by " Give It 2 Me " , during which pink and green disco beams pulsated across the crowd . The show ended with a performance of " Music " ( 2000 ) , during which her dancers emerged from a false , silver subway car door . Madonna danced across the stage , touching the hands of the audience and ended the show by racing up the stage to the subway doors , behind which she disappeared . 
 Chris Harris from MTV reviewed the show at Roseland Ballroom , New York , and commented that " It was an event better @-@ suited for Madison Square Garden and one that these fans — many of whom probably had to call a sitter for the evening — won 't soon forget . " Ben Sisario from The New York Times commented " for Madonna 's fans , [ the New York show ] proved that seeing her for free in a 2 @,@ 200 @-@ capacity hall — minuscule by her usual touring standards — was something worth waiting for . And waiting for a very long time . " Silvio <unk> from Billboard felt that " The crowd of 2 @,@ 200 was certainly dedicated . " The April 30 , 2008 , New York set was shown live via MSN in association with Control Room and Live Nation . It was broadcast internationally on May 15 , 2008 . The Maidstone show faced problems with the organisers due to Madonna 's use of swearing , causing complaints to be made to the BBC when the show was aired on Radio 1 .

 To further promote the album , Madonna embarked on the Sticky & Sweet Tour , her eighth worldwide concert tour . It began in August 2008 and was Madonna 's first tour from her new recording and business deal with Live Nation . The tour was announced in February 2008 , with dates for American and British venues revealed . Though initially planned , the tour failed to visit Australia due to financial problems and the financial recession . Costume designer Arianne Phillips designed the costumes , supported by a number of famous designers and brands , namely Givenchy , Stella McCartney , Yves Saint Laurent , Roberto Cavalli , and Jeremy Scott . The stage for the main show was planned similarly to that of her 2006 Confessions Tour . After the Sticky & Sweet Tour concluded in 2008 , Madonna announced plans to begin a second European leg in 2009 to perform in cities she had either never been to , or had not played for a long time . 
 The tour was described as a " rock driven dancetastic journey " . It was divided into four acts : Pimp , where S & M was the main theme , Old School where Madonna 's classic songs were performed alongside displays of the work of deceased artist Keith Haring , Gypsy , a fusion of Romani folk music and dance , with performances ranging from melancholy to joyous , and Rave , where she performed track 's featuring Eastern influences . The show ended with a sing @-@ along of the final song with the audience . Some changes were made to the set list during the second European leg of the tour in 2009 , including a dance tribute to deceased singer Michael Jackson . The tour generated positive reviews from critics . 
 The Sticky & Sweet Tour broke many records in terms of ticket sales , commercial gross and audience attendance . After the first leg , it became the highest grossing tour by a solo artist , earning $ 282 million , breaking the previous record Madonna herself held with her Confessions Tour . Overall , Madonna performed to over 3 @.@ 5 million fans in 32 countries , grossing a total of US $ 408 million , making it also the second highest grossing tour of all time and the highest grossing tour by a solo artist . At the 2009 Billboard Touring Awards , the Sticky & Sweet Tour won the Top Tour and Top Draw prizes , which acknowledge the highest @-@ grossing and highest @-@ attended tours of the year , respectively .

 Hard Candy received a score of 65 / 100 on Metacritic , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " . Mark Savage from the BBC commented on the composition of the tracks , saying " if a handful of the tracks had been delivered to more producers with a touch more subtlety , Hard Candy could have ranked alongside Madonna 's best . [ ... ] Over and over again , she subsumes her pop sensibilities to their arsenal of clattering beats , hollered raps and over @-@ fussy production . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that " There 's a palpable sense of disinterest [ in Hard Candy ] , as if she just handed the reins over to Pharrell and <unk> , trusting them to polish up this piece of stale candy . Maybe she 's not into the music , maybe she 's just running out this last album for Warner before she moves onto the greener pastures of Live Nation — either way , Hard Candy is as a rare thing : a lifeless Madonna album . " 
 Tom Young from Blender gave a positive review saying " On Hard Candy , she 's like an aging master thief sneaking into the temple of pop goodies for one last big score . Album 11 is good @-@ naturedly smutty , not <unk> nasty , but it 's a veritable filth bath compared to the C @-@ SPAN sermons and confessional strumming of 2003 's dreadful American Life or the <unk> self @-@ actualized club trance of 2005 's Confessions on a Dance Floor . " Kerri Mason from Billboard complimented the new sound and the musical direction taken by Madonna but felt that she had become a producer 's puppet , leading her to comment that " Madonna makes producers , producers don 't make Madonna . " Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B + and said " [ Madonna ] makes it work with this surprisingly rejuvenated set . " Mike Collett @-@ White from Reuters reported : " As parting gifts go , Madonna 's 11th studio album — and her last before she exits long @-@ term record label Warner Bros. — is unusually generous , if early reviews are to be believed . [ ... ] Hard Candy scored solidly among rock critics . " 
 Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone said that Hard Candy is the work of " a songwriting team of American chart royalty " that helps Madonna " revisit her roots as an urban @-@ disco queen . [ ... ] For Hard Candy , she lets top @-@ shelf producers make her their plaything . " Ben Thompson from The Guardian commented on the music by saying that " Hard Candy is a tough , <unk> confection offering plenty for listeners to get their teeth into . [ ... ] Whenever [ it ] threatens to get boring , something always happens to recapture your interest . " Sarah <unk> from The Times felt that while " Hard Candy is no disaster " , the album 's producers have " already done the same thing with Nelly Furtado , Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani . " Andy Gill from The Independent said that the album portrayed Madonna as " how a once diverse talent has ossified into simply satisfying the sweet tooth of functional dance @-@ pop . " Thomas Hausner from PopMatters wrote that the album " is overpopulated with recycled pop that is indistinguishable and artificial , something Madonna 's soothing <unk> vocals cannot alleviate " . 
 Tom Ewing from Pitchfork Media wondered " after listening [ to the album ] , the question 's still open — nobody involved in Hard Candy is anywhere near their creative peak ! " Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was disappointed with the album and said , " Madonna hasn 't delivered this many vapid floor fillers on one disc since her debut , and maybe not even then . [ ... ] There are few confessions here — nothing political , nothing too spiritual , no talk of fame , war , or the media . It 's just what America ordered . " Wilfred Young from NME felt that Hard Candy was " a solid enough album by the standards of most pop tarts , but from the mistress of innovation ? Pretty mediocre . "

 House ( also called House , M.D. ) is an American television medical drama that originally ran on the Fox network for eight seasons , from November 16 , 2004 to May 21 , 2012 . The series ' main character is Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) , a pain medication @-@ dependent , unconventional , misanthropic medical genius who leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton – Plainsboro Teaching Hospital ( PPTH ) in New Jersey . The series ' premise originated with Paul Attanasio , while David Shore , who is credited as creator , was primarily responsible for the conception of the title character . The series ' executive producers included Shore , Attanasio , Attanasio 's business partner Katie Jacobs , and film director Bryan Singer . It was filmed largely in Century City . 
 House often clashes with his fellow physicians , including his own diagnostic team , because many of his hypotheses about patients ' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights . His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss , hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) . House 's only true friend is Dr. James Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) , head of the Department of Oncology . During the first three seasons , House 's diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase ( Jesse Spencer ) , Dr. Allison Cameron ( Jennifer Morrison ) , and Dr. Eric Foreman ( Omar Epps ) . At the end of the third season , this team disbands . Rejoined by Foreman , House gradually selects three new team members : Dr. Remy " Thirteen " Hadley ( Olivia Wilde ) , Dr. Chris Taub ( Peter Jacobson ) , and Dr. Lawrence Kutner ( Kal Penn ) . Kutner makes an appearance late in season five and then reappears in season 8 episode 22 . Chase and Cameron continue to appear in different roles at the hospital until early in season six . Cameron then departs the hospital , and Chase returns to the diagnostic team . Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven , and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters ( Amber Tamblyn ) . Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight ; Foreman becomes the new Dean of Medicine , while Dr. Jessica Adams ( Odette Annable ) and Dr. Chi Park ( Charlyne Yi ) join House 's team . 
 House was among the top 10 series in the United States from its second through fourth seasons . Distributed to 66 countries , House was the most @-@ watched television program in the world in 2008 . The show received numerous awards , including five Primetime Emmy Awards , two Golden Globe Awards , a Peabody Award , and nine People 's Choice Awards . On February 8 , 2012 , Fox announced that the eighth season , then in progress , would be its last . The series finale aired on May 21 , 2012 , following an hour @-@ long retrospective .

 = = = Conception = = = 
 In 2004 , David Shore and Paul Attanasio , along with Attanasio 's business partner Katie Jacobs , pitched the series ( untitled at the time ) to Fox as a CSI @-@ style medical detective program , a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes . Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by The New York Times Magazine column , " Diagnosis " , written by physician Lisa Sanders , who is an attending physician at Yale @-@ New Haven Hospital ( <unk> ) , and Princeton @-@ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital ( PPTH ) is modeled after this teaching institution . Fox bought the series , though the network 's then @-@ president , Gail Berman , told the creative team , " I want a medical show , but I don 't want to see white coats going down the hallway " . Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show 's ultimate form . 
 After Fox picked up the show , it acquired the working title Chasing Zebras , Circling the Drain ( " zebra " is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis , while " circling the drain " refers to terminal cases , patients in an irreversible decline ) . The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to " diagnose the <unk> " . Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character , one who could examine patients ' personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies . As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character 's possibilities , the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role . The character was named " House " , which was adopted as the show 's title , as well . Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode . Bryan Singer , who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles , has said that the " title of the pilot was ' Everybody Lies ' , and that 's the premise of the show " . Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton <unk> , a staff writer for The New Yorker between 1944 and 1994 , who specialized in features about unusual medical cases . 
 Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital . Shore recalled : " I knew , as soon as I left the room , they would be mocking me relentlessly [ for my cluelessness ] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room . " A central part of the show 's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way . The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair , but Fox rejected this . Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network 's insistence that the character be reimagined — putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension . The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis , which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency . 
 = = = Production team = = = 
 House was a co @-@ production of Heel and Toe Films , Shore Z Productions , and Bad Hat Harry Productions in association with Universal Media Studios for Fox . Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs , the heads of Heel and Toe Films ; David Shore , the head of Shore Z Productions ; and Bryan Singer , the head of Bad Hat Harry Productions , were executive producers of the program for its entirety . Lawrence Kaplow , Peter Blake , and Thomas L. Moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode . Writers Doris Egan , Sara Hess , Russel Friend , and Garrett Lerner joined the team at the start of season two . Friend and Lerner , who are business partners , had been offered positions when the series launched , but turned the opportunity down . After observing the show 's success , they accepted when Jacobs offered them jobs again the following year . Writers Eli Attie and Sean Whitesell joined the show at the start of season four . Since the beginning of season four , Moran , Friend , and Lerner have been credited as executive producers on the series , joining Attanasio , Jacobs , Shore , and Singer . Hugh Laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second and third episodes of season five . 
 Shore is House 's showrunner . Through the end of the sixth season , more than two dozen writers have contributed to the program . The most prolific have been Kaplow ( 18 episodes ) , Blake ( 17 ) , Shore ( 16 ) , Friend ( 16 ) , Lerner ( 16 ) , Moran ( 14 ) , and Egan ( 13 ) . The show 's most prolific directors through its first six seasons were Deran Sarafian ( 22 episodes ) , who was not involved in season six , and Greg Yaitanes ( 17 ) . Of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series , only David Straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season . Hugh Laurie directed the 17th episode of season six , " Lockdown " . Elan <unk> has been the visual effects supervisor since the show began . Lisa Sanders , an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine , is a technical advisor to the series . She writes the " Diagnosis " column that inspired House 's premise . According to Shore , " three different doctors ... check everything we do " . Bobbin Bergstrom , a registered nurse , is the program 's on @-@ set medical adviser . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 At first , the producers were looking for a " quintessentially American person " to play the role of House . Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non @-@ American actor for the role . At the time of the casting session , actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie Flight of the Phoenix . He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom , the only place with enough light , and apologized for its appearance ( which Singer compared to a " bin Laden video " ) . Laurie improvised , using an umbrella for a cane . Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the " American actor " was able to grasp the character . Singer was not aware that Laurie was English , due to his convincing American accent . Laurie credits the accent to " a misspent youth [ watching ] too much TV and too many movies " . Although locally better @-@ known actors such as Denis Leary , David Cross , Rob Morrow , and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part , Shore , Jacobs , and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House . 
 Laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show 's central character was Dr. James Wilson . He assumed that House was a supporting part , due to the nature of the character , until he received the full script of the pilot episode . Laurie , the son of a doctor , Ran Laurie , said he felt guilty for " being paid more to become a fake version of [ his ] own father " . From the start of season three , he was being paid $ 275 @,@ 000 to $ 300 @,@ 000 per episode , as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series . By the show 's fifth season , Laurie was earning around $ 400 @,@ 000 per episode , making him one of the highest @-@ paid actors on network television . 
 Robert Sean Leonard had received the script for the CBS show Numb3rs , as well as that for House . Leonard thought the Numb3rs script was " kind of cool " and planned to audition for the show . However , he decided that the character he was up for , Charlie Eppes , was in too many scenes ; he later observed , " The less I work , the happier I am " . He believed that his House audition was not particularly good , but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson . Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein 's portrayal of a prostitute on The West Wing , and sent her a copy of the pilot script . Edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character 's " snappy dialogue " with House , and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy . 
 Australian actor Jesse Spencer 's agent suggested that he audition for the role of Dr. Robert Chase . Spencer believed the program would be similar in style to General Hospital , but changed his mind after reading the scripts . After he was cast , he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an Australian . Patrick Dempsey also auditioned for the part of Chase ; he later became known for his portrayal of Dr. Derek Shepherd on Grey 's Anatomy . Omar Epps , who plays Dr. Eric Foreman , was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the NBC medical drama ER . Jennifer Morrison felt that her audition for the part of Dr. Allison Cameron was a complete disaster . However , before her audition , Singer had watched some of her performances , including on Dawson 's Creek , and already wanted to cast her in the role . Morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six . 
 At the end of season three , House dismisses Chase , while Foreman and Cameron resign . After an episode in which he " borrows " a janitor whom he calls " Dr. Buffer " to assist in a diagnosis , House must then recruit a new diagnostic team , for which he identifies seven finalists . The producers originally planned to recruit two new full @-@ time actors , with Foreman , who returns in season four 's fifth episode , bringing the team back up to three members ; ultimately , the decision was made to add three new regular cast members . ( Along with Epps , actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast , as their characters moved on to new assignments . ) During production , the show 's writers dismissed a single candidate per episode ; as a result , said Jacobs , neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute . In the season 's ninth episode , House 's new team is revealed : Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner ( Kal Penn ) , Chris Taub ( Peter Jacobson ) , and Remy " Thirteen " Hadley ( Olivia Wilde ) . The candidates rejected by House did not return to the show , with the exception of the last one cut : Amber Volakis ( Anne Dudek ) , who appeared for the rest of season four as Wilson 's girlfriend , and in seasons five and eight as a hallucination of House 's . While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists , Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers ' interest in their characters . Kutner was written out of the series in episode 20 of season 5 after Penn took a position in the Obama White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs . 
 The contracts of Edelstein , Epps , and Leonard expired at the end of season seven . As a cost @-@ cutting measure , the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries . Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers , but Edelstein did not , and in May 2011 it was announced that she would not be returning for the show 's eighth season . 
 = = = Filming style and locations = = = 
 House is often filmed using the " walk and talk " filming technique , popularized on television by series such as St. Elsewhere , ER , Sports Night , and The West Wing . The technique involves the use of tracking shots , showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking . Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because " when you put a scene on the move , it 's a ... way of creating an urgency and an intensity " . She noted the significance of " the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6 ' 2 " and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk @-@ and @-@ talks pop " . Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show 's " cool , Fantastic Voyage – like special effects of patients ' innards . I 'll bet you didn 't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping . " " Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat " of one patient , another critic observed , " but up her nose and inside her brain and leg " . Instead of relying primarily on computer @-@ generated imagery , the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography . Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise , revealing aspects of his character and the story . 
 The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver , Canada ; primary photography for all subsequent episodes has been shot on the Fox lot in Century City . Bryan Singer chose the hospital near his hometown , West Windsor , New Jersey , as the show 's fictional setting . Princeton University 's Frist Campus Center is the source of the aerial views of Princeton ‑ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the series . Some filming took place at the University of Southern California for the season @-@ three episode " Half @-@ Wit " , which guest @-@ starred Dave Matthews and Kurtwood Smith . Part of House 's sixth season was filmed at the abandoned Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital , in Parsippany @-@ Troy Hills , New Jersey , as the fictional Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital . 
 = = = Opening sequence = = = 
 The opening sequence begins with an MRI of a head with an image of the boxed " H " from the logo ( the international symbol for hospital ) in the foreground . This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House 's face taken from the pilot episode with the show 's full title appearing across his face . House 's head then fades and the show 's title is underlined and has the " M.D. " appear next to it , producing the entire logo of the show . This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode . All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore . Laurie 's name appears first , followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order ( Edelstein , Epps , Leonard , Morrison , and Spencer , then Shore ) . 
 After the show 's title fades , an aerial view of PPTH ( actually various Princeton University buildings , primarily Frist Campus Center ) is followed by a series of images accompanying each member 's name ; most are shown next to , or superimposed upon , illustrations of the human anatomy . Laurie 's name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed ; Edelstein 's name appears next to a visual effects – produced graphic of an angiogram of the heart . Epps 's name is superimposed upon a rib cage X @-@ ray ; Leonard 's name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain . The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle , but Fox objected . Morrison 's title card was thus lacking an image ; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University 's Lake Carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name . Spencer 's name appears next to an old @-@ fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine . Between the presentations of Spencer and Shore 's names is a scene of House and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital 's hallways . Jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning ; however , the final image — the text " created by David Shore " superimposed upon a human neck — connotes that Shore is " the brain of the show " . The sequence was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005 . The title sequence continued to credit Spencer and Morrison , even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five , and Morrison even after hers was written out . A new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast , removing Morrison 's name and including Jacobson and Wilde 's . It was updated in season eight removing Edelstein 's name and added Annable and Yi 
 The series ' original opening theme , as heard in the United States , comprises instrumental portions of " Teardrop " by Massive Attack . The piece was used in part because of the distinct tempo which roughly mimics the sound of a beating human heart . An acoustic version of " Teardrop " , with guitar and vocals by José González , is heard as background music during the season @-@ four finale . 
 = = Series overview = = 
 Gregory House , M.D. , often construed as a misanthropic medical genius , heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton @-@ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey . Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a <unk> scene set outside the hospital , showing events ending with the onset of the patient 's symptoms . The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient 's illness , which often fail until the patient 's condition is critical . They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed , and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting . The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices , and on the other characters ' reactions to them , rather than on the details of the treatments . 
 The team employs the differential diagnosis method , listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard , then eliminating most of them , usually because one of the team ( most often House ) provides logical reasons for ruling them out . Typically , the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless ; this usually causes further complications , but — as the nature of the complications often provides valuable new evidence — eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly . House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue , often inspired by a passing remark made by another character . Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases . 
 The team faces many diagnostic difficulties from patients ' concealment of symptoms , circumstances , or personal histories , so House frequently proclaims during the team 's deliberations , " The patient is lying " , or mutters " Everybody lies " ; such an assumption guides House 's decisions and diagnoses , and makes the countermeasure of housebreaking a routine procedure . Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights , he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior , who in all but the final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy . This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable . Frequent disagreements occur between House and his team , especially Dr. Allison Cameron , whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters . 
 Like all of the hospital 's doctors , House is required to treat patients in the facility 's walk @-@ in clinic . His grudging fulfillment of this duty , or his creative methods of avoiding it , constitute a recurring subplot , which often serves as the series ' comic relief . During clinic duty , House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives , eccentric prescriptions , and unorthodox treatments . However , after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints , he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses . Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team 's case . 
 A significant plot element is House 's use of Vicodin to manage pain , caused by an infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show 's first season , which also forces him to use a cane . In the first season , 11th episode " Detox " , House admits he is addicted to Vicodin , but says he does not have a problem because the pills " let me do my job , and they take away my pain " . His addiction has led his colleagues , Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson , to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times . When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain , he occasionally self @-@ <unk> with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine , oxycodone , and methadone . House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty , and classifies himself as a " big drinker " . Toward the end of season five , House begins to hallucinate ; after eliminating other possible diagnoses , Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause . House goes into denial about this for a brief time , but at the close of the season finale , he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital . In the following season 's debut episode , House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control . However , about a year and a half later , in season seven 's 15th episode , " Bombshells " , House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin , and his addiction recurs .

 Throughout House 's run , six of the main actors have received star billing . All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton @-@ Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey . Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) , the title character , heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine . House describes himself as " a board @-@ certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology " . Dr. James Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) , House 's one true friend , is the head of the Department of Oncology . Dr. Lisa Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) , an endocrinologist , is House 's boss , as she is the hospital 's dean of medicine and chief administrator . House has a complex relationship with Cuddy , and their interactions often involve a high degree of innuendo and sexual tension . In the sixth episode of season five , " Joy " , they kiss for the first time . Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season ; in the finale , House believes he and Cuddy had sex , but this is a hallucination brought on by House 's Vicodin addiction . In the finale of season six , Cuddy tells House she loves him . They kiss and agree to try being a couple . Throughout season seven , House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work . 
 House 's original team of diagnosticians consists of Dr. Eric Foreman ( Omar Epps ) , a neurologist ; Dr. Robert Chase ( Jesse Spencer ) , an <unk> ; and Dr. Allison Cameron ( Jennifer Morrison ) , an immunologist . In the season @-@ three episode " Family " , Foreman announces his resignation , telling House , " I don 't want to turn into you " . During the season finale , House tells Chase that he has either learned everything he can , or nothing at all , and dismisses him from the team . Cameron , who has developed an affection for Chase , soon resigns . This leaves House without a team for the season @-@ four premiere . 
 Under orders from Cuddy to recruit a new team , House considers 40 doctors . Season four 's early episodes focus on his selection process , structured as a reality TV – style elimination contest ( Jacobs referred to it as a " version of Survivor " ) . House assigns each applicant a number between one and 40 , and pares them down to seven finalists . He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases , assisted by Foreman , who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House @-@ like behavior . While Foreman 's return means only two slots are open , House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants . He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub ( Peter Jacobson ) , a former plastic surgeon ; Dr. Lawrence Kutner ( Kal Penn ) , a sports medicine specialist ; and Dr. Remy " Thirteen " Hadley ( Olivia Wilde ) , an internist ( nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest ) . In the season finale , Thirteen discovers she has , as she had long dreaded , Huntington 's disease , which is incurable . 
 In the 11th episode of season five , " Joy to the World " , Foreman and Thirteen engage in a passionate kiss . Thirteen is at first reluctant to start a relationship with Foreman , but the two eventually begin dating and are still together at the end of the season . They break up early in season six . In the 20th episode of season five , " Simple Explanation " , Kutner is found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head . Because Kutner left no note , House suspects foul play , though the death is accepted by the other characters as a suicide . 
 In the seventh episode of season two , " Hunting " , Cameron and Chase have a one @-@ night stand . In the middle of season three , they initiate a sexual relationship that Cameron insists be casual ; when Chase declares that he " wants more " , Cameron ends the affair . By the end of the season , however , Cameron recognizes that she has romantic feelings for Chase and they begin a serious relationship . After leaving the diagnostic team , they assume different roles at the PPTH , Cameron as a senior attending physician in the emergency room and Chase as a surgeon . They become engaged in the season @-@ five episode " Saviors " ( the episode immediately following Kutner 's suicide ) and are married in the season finale . When Chase rejoins House 's team in season six , Cameron leaves her husband and the hospital in " Teamwork " , the season 's eighth episode . She returns as a guest character in " Lockdown " , nine episodes later . 
 Early in season seven , Thirteen takes an unexplained leave of absence . Cuddy orders House to fill her position with another woman , but eventually makes the choice for him : medical student Dr. Martha M. Masters ( Amber Tamblyn ) , who makes her first appearance in the season 's sixth episode . Thirteen returns in the " The Dig " — the season 's 18th episode and the show 's 150th — in which the reason for her absence is revealed : she was in prison for six months for having helped euthanize her brother , who was suffering from advanced Huntington 's . While Jacobson and Wilde play central characters ( as did Penn ) , they did not receive star billing until season seven . They were credited as " Also Starring " , with their names appearing after the opening sequence . In season seven , Jacobson and Wilde received star billing ; new regular cast member Tamblyn did not .

 The first six seasons of House each included one or more recurring featured characters , who appear in multiple @-@ episode story arcs . In season one , Edward Vogler ( Chi McBride ) , the billionaire owner of a pharmaceutical company , appears in five episodes . He donates US $ 100 million to the PPTH in return for chairing its board . Vogler represented an attempt to introduce a villain , a move urged by Fox . By the time the Vogler episodes began to air , the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped . Shore said the concept of a villainous boss was not really viable for the series : " It 's called House . The audience knows he 'll never get fired . " 
 Stacy Warner ( Sela Ward ) , House 's ex @-@ girlfriend , appears in the final two episodes of the first season , and seven episodes of season two . She wants House to treat her husband , Mark Warner ( Currie Graham ) , whom House diagnoses with acute intermittent porphyria in the season @-@ one finale . Stacy and House grow close again , but House eventually tells Stacy to go back to Mark , which devastates her . 
 Michael Tritter ( David Morse ) , a police detective , appears in several season @-@ three episodes . He tries to extract an apology from House , who left Tritter in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum . After House refuses to apologize , Tritter brings him up on charges of <unk> narcotics possession and forces him to attend rehabilitation . When the case reaches court , Cuddy <unk> herself for House and the case is dismissed . The judge reprimands Tritter for pursuing House to excess , and tells House that she thinks he " has better friends than he deserves " , referring to Cuddy 's 11th @-@ hour testimony on his behalf . House is sentenced to one night in jail for contempt of court and finishes his rehabilitation under the influence of Vicodin . 
 The candidates for House 's new diagnostics team are season four 's primary recurring characters . In addition to the three who are chosen , the other four finalists are Jeffrey Cole ( Edi Gathegi ) ; Travis Brennan ( Andy Comeau ) , an epidemiologist ; Henry Dobson ( Carmen <unk> ) , a former medical school admissions officer ; and Amber " Cut @-@ throat Bitch " Volakis ( Anne Dudek ) , an interventional radiologist . Each of the four departs the show after elimination , except for Volakis , who appears throughout the season , having started a relationship with Wilson . In the two @-@ part season finale , Volakis attempts to shepherd a drunken House home when Wilson is unavailable . They are involved in a bus crash , which leads to her death . She reappears late in season five among the hallucinations House suffers . 
 Private investigator Lucas Douglas ( Michael Weston ) , a character inspired in part by Shore 's love of The Rockford Files , appears in three episodes of season five . House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson , who has ended their friendship after Volakis 's death ( the friendship is subsequently rekindled ) . House later pays Douglas to look into the private lives of his team members and Cuddy . If the character had been accepted by the audience , plans existed to feature him as the lead in a spin @-@ off show . In September 2008 , Shore spoke to Entertainment Weekly about his vision for the character : " I don 't want to do just another medical show . What does excite me in terms of writing is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong ... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can . " There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule . He returns to House in season six as Cuddy 's boyfriend . They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off , realizing that she is in love with House .

 House received largely positive reviews on its debut ; the series was considered a bright spot amid Fox 's schedule , which at the time was largely filled with reality shows . Season one holds a Metacritic score of 75 out of 100 , based on 30 reviews , indicating " generally favorable " reviews . Matt Roush of TV Guide said that the program was an " uncommon cure for the common medical drama " . New York Daily News critic David Bianculli applauded the " high caliber of acting and script " . The Onion 's " A.V. Club " approvingly described it as the " nastiest " black comedy from FOX since 1996 's short @-@ lived Profit . New York 's John Leonard called the series " medical TV at its most satisfying and basic " , while The Boston Globe 's Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not sugarcoat the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers ' fears about " HMO factories " . Variety 's Brian Lowry , less impressed , wrote that the show relied on " by @-@ the @-@ numbers storytelling , albeit in a glossy package " . Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle described it as " mediocre " and unoriginal . 
 General critical reaction to the character of Gregory House was particularly positive . Tom Shales of The Washington Post called him " the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years " . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette 's Rob Owen found him " fascinatingly unsympathetic " . Critics have compared House to fictional detectives Nero Wolfe , Hercule Poirot , and Adrian Monk , and to Perry Cox , a cantankerous doctor on the television show Scrubs . One book @-@ length study of the series finds a powerful kinship between House and another famous TV doctor , Hawkeye Pierce of M * A * S * H. Laurie 's performance in the role has been widely praised . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Goodman called him " a wonder to behold " and " about the only reason to watch House " . Gabrielle Donnelly of the Daily Mail said that because of Laurie 's complex personality , he was " perfectly cast " in the title role . 
 Critics have also reacted positively to the show 's original supporting cast , which the Post 's Shales called a " first @-@ rate ensemble " . Leonard 's portrayal of Dr. Wilson has been considered Emmy Award worthy by critics with TV Guide , Entertainment Weekly , and USA Today . Bianculli of the Daily News was happy to see Edelstein " finally given a deservedly meaty co @-@ starring role " . Freelance critic Daniel Fienberg was disappointed that Leonard and Edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances . 
 Reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed . " With the new crew in place House takes on a slightly more energized feel " , wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk . " And the set up for the fifth season is quite brilliant . " The Star @-@ Ledger 's Alan Sepinwall wrote , " The extended , enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie 's comic genius " . Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times , on the other hand , took issue with the developments : " the cast just kept getting bigger , the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will " . USA Today 's Robert Bianco cheered the season finale : " Talk about saving the best for last . With two fabulous , heartbreaking hours ... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse , overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good . " 
 Season five of House was met with a more positive response in comparison to the previous season . It holds a Metacritic score of 77 out of 100 , based on ten reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . It also holds a 100 % approval rating on aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes , with an average score of 8 @.@ 1 based on nine collected reviews . USA Today praised Laurie 's performance and the repercussions of the season @-@ four finale , stating " a carry @-@ over from last season 's brilliant finale , House is firmly in the forefront . And when you have an actor of Hugh Laurie 's range , depth and charisma , putting him center @-@ stage makes perfect sense , particularly when you 've written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems " . The New York Daily News noted that " The show pays more attention to relationships we care about , hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise , and thus doesn 't rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden " , and noted that " the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow " . Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times highlighted the performances of the cast , especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas , calling him a " delightful addition " . She concluded , " So different is the premiere that the savvy House ( and Fox ) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream . That does not seem to be the case , and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now @-@ iconic character back to Princeton . Not too different , of course , but different enough . " Conversely , The Chicago Tribune 's Maureen Ryan disliked Weston 's character , calling him " An unwelcome distraction ... an irritating pipsqueak " . She continued saying " House used to be one of the best shows on TV , but it 's gone seriously off the rails " . The Sunday Times felt that the show had " lost its sense of humour " . The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism . 
 At the end of the show 's run , Steven Tong of Entertainment Weekly wrote that " House had , in its final seasons , become a rather sentimental show " . In New York Magazine 's blog ' Vulture ' , Margaret Lyons wrote , " More than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else , House is a complex meditation on misery . " But , continued Lyons , there is a line between " enlightened cynicism " and " misery @-@ entropy " , and " as the show wore on , its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter . " Alan Sepinwall wrote , " The repetition and muck of [ the ] middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection I had to House 's personal struggles . " 
 The show placed # 62 on Entertainment Weekly 's " New TV Classics " list . The show was declared the second highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro ( 2002 – 2012 ) .

 = Russian battleship Rostislav = 
 Rostislav was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built by the Nikolaev Admiralty Shipyard in the 1890s for the Black Sea Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy . She was conceived as a small , inexpensive coastal defence ship , but the Navy abandoned the concept in favor of a compact , seagoing battleship with a displacement of 8 @,@ 880 long tons ( 9 @,@ 020 t ) . Poor design and construction practices increased her actual displacement by more than 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 600 t ) . Rostislav became the world 's first capital ship to burn fuel oil , rather than coal . Her combat ability was compromised by the use of 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) main guns instead of the de facto Russian standard of 12 inches ( 305 mm ) . 
 Her hull was launched in September 1896 , but non @-@ delivery of the ship 's main guns delayed her maiden voyage until 1899 and her completion until 1900 . In May 1899 Rostislav became the first ship of the Imperial Navy to be commanded by a member of the House of Romanov , Captain Alexander Mikhailovich . From 1903 to 1912 the ship was the flagship of the second @-@ in @-@ command of the Black Sea Fleet . During the 1905 Russian Revolution her crew was on the verge of mutiny , but ultimately remained loyal to the regime , and actively suppressed the mutiny of the cruiser Ochakov . 
 Rostislav was actively engaged in World War I until the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918 . She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I , the first to be hit by a German airstrike , and the first to destroy a submarine , albeit a Russian one . In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol . A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines . The White forces used the ship as a towed floating battery , then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Similar in size to earlier coastal defence ships but seaworthy for operations in the Black Sea , Rostislav was conceived in 1892 as a cheap and compact platform for 12 @-@ inch guns . Admiral Nikolay Chikhachov , Chief of the Ministry of the Navy , envisioned a squadron of such ships , each displacing 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 to 5 @,@ 100 t ) , that would fit into his total desired displacement target of 24 @,@ 000 long tons ( 24 @,@ 400 t ) . Chief designer of the Nikolaev Shipyard , Sergey <unk> , evaluated Chikhachov 's request for proposals , and advised against the idea in general . The Naval Technical Committee ( NTC ) concurred : any meaningful combination of firepower , armor , speed and stability required at least 6 @,@ 000 long tons ( 6 @,@ 100 t ) . The NTC discarded <unk> 's advice to build an improved copy of the battleship Sissoi Veliky of 8 @,@ 880 long tons ( 9 @,@ 020 t ) , but did not present a definite alternative . The NTC declined to discuss tactical matters , leaving the choice of armament to Chikhachov . 
 Chikhachov instructed Andrey Toropov of the Nikolaev Shipyard to draft two proposals , one armed with 10 @-@ inch and the other with 12 @-@ inch guns . Toropov estimated that the ship should have displaced at least 8 @,@ 880 tons . Chikhachov admitted the fact and presented the two options to the NTC . The admiral himself and the active fleet commanders voted for the 12 @-@ inch caliber , which had already become a worldwide battleship standard , but the NTC strongly advised against it . The Navy brass spent April and May 1893 in lengthy debates . They agreed to increase displacement to 8 @,@ 880 tons and were leaning toward accepting 12 @-@ inch guns when General Admiral Grand Duke Alexey resolved the discussion in favor of the smaller caliber . 
 Rostislav had the same hull as Sissoi Veliky , protected with the newly developed Harvey armor . She was also the first Russian battleship to use electric power instead of older hydraulic systems to train her guns . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Rostislav was 345 feet 6 inches ( 105 @.@ 3 m ) long at the waterline and 351 feet 10 inches ( 107 @.@ 2 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 68 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) and a draft of 25 feet 2 inches ( 7 @.@ 7 m ) . She displaced 10 @,@ 520 long tons ( 10 @,@ 690 t ) , over 1 @,@ 500 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 t ) more than her designed displacement of 8 @,@ 880 long tons ( 9 @,@ 020 t ) . This weight gain increased her draft by about 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) , submerging most , if not all , of her waterline armored belt . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Rostislav had two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , identical to those of Sissoi Veliky , that had a total designed output of 8 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 300 kW ) . Eight cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers provided steam to the engines , each of which drove one propeller . Half of the fire @-@ tube boilers were coal @-@ fired and the other half were oil @-@ fired , making Rostislav the first capital ship in the world to use fuel oil . This was done in order to substitute cheap oil from Baku for expensive imported coal . On sea trials , the power plant produced a total of 8 @,@ 816 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 574 kW ) and a top speed of 15 @.@ 8 knots ( 29 @.@ 3 km / h ; 18 @.@ 2 mph ) . She carried a maximum of 820 long tons ( 830 t ) of fuel oil and coal at full load that provided a range of 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament consisted of two pairs of 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) 45 @-@ caliber Model 1891 guns mounted in French @-@ style , center @-@ pivot twin gun turrets fore and aft . Each turret had an arc of fire of 240 ° . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 15 ° and could depress to − 5 ° . They fired a 496 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 225 @.@ 2 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 273 ft / s ( 693 m / s ) . At an elevation of + 6 ° the guns had a range 7 @,@ 320 metres ( 8 @,@ 010 yd ) . All eight of the 45 @-@ caliber , 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Canet Pattern 1891 guns were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets on the main deck . Each turret was positioned at a corner of the superstructure and had an arc of fire of 110 ° . They fired shells that weighed 91 @.@ 4 lb ( 41 @.@ 46 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 792 m / s ) . They had a maximum range of 12 @,@ 602 yards ( 11 @,@ 523 m ) when fired at an elevation of + 20 ° . 
 The anti @-@ torpedo boat armament consisted of twelve 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns . Eight of these were mounted in the superstructure and the locations of the remaining four are unclear . They fired a 2 @.@ 2 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 00 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) . The ship also mounted sixteen 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns , eight of which were carried in the fighting top . The locations of the other eight are unknown . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 660 m / s ) . 
 Rostislav carried six 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes . The bow and stern tubes and the aft pair of broadside tubes were above water . The forward broadside tubes were underwater . The ship carried 50 mines to be used to protect her anchorage . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The maximum thickness of the Rostislav 's waterline belt was 14 @.@ 5 inches ( 368 mm ) , tapering to 10 inches ( 254 mm ) abreast the magazines . It covered 227 feet ( 69 @.@ 2 m ) of the ship 's length and was 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high . While the exact height of the belt above the designed waterline is unknown , much of it , if not all , would have been below the waterline as the ship 's draft was over 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) deeper than designed . The belt terminated forward in a 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) transverse bulkhead and aft in a 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) bulkhead . The upper belt was 5 inches thick , 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 3 m ) high and covered 160 feet ( 48 @.@ 8 m ) of the ship 's side . The sides of the main gun turrets were 10 inches thick and they had 2 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 64 mm ) roofs . The sides of the 6 @-@ inch turrets were 6 inches thick as were the sides of the conning tower .

 Work on Rostislav commenced on January 30 , 1894 . The ship was officially christened May 20 , 1894 ; in line with Russian tradition , the formal laying down ceremony was delayed until May 19 , 1895 . The contract for oil @-@ firing boilers and engines was awarded to Baltic Works . The armor was rolled in the United States by Bethlehem Steel within the framework of an earlier contract for Petropavlovsk @-@ class battleships . Bethlehem Steel faced the scrutiny of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs for charging the Russians an unusually low " introductory " price of $ 250 to $ 300 per ton , compared to $ 600 to $ 660 paid by the United States Navy . Senator Benjamin Tillman publicly accused Bethlehem and Carnegie of price fixing and robbing the American taxpayer . 
 Rostislav 's hull was launched on September 2 , 1896 . Lack of proper cranes in Nikolaev made the installation of its engines exceedingly difficult , to the point that the navy even considered towing the hull to Sevastopol for completion . The Nikolaev engineers eventually resolved the problem and the ship was ready to sail in July 1897 . Rostislav conducted her speed trials on October 21 , 1898 , still missing her main guns . Her power plant performed flawlessly , but its weight exceeded the design target by more than 295 long tons ( 300 t ) . 
 Non @-@ delivery of the new 10 @-@ inch Model 1897 guns , made by the Obukhov Factory in Saint Petersburg for Rostislav , Admiral Ushakov @-@ class coastal defense ships and Peresvet @-@ class battleships , delayed the completion of the ship by two years . One of these guns , earmarked for Admiral Ushakov , exploded at the proving ground and the whole batch was subjected to exhaustive tests and , when possible , repairs . Guns Number 16 through Number 19 passed the tests and were delivered to Sevastopol in July and August 1899 . Rostislav was able to sail to her first gunnery trial on April 12 , 1900 . On the second day of shooting practice the recoil mechanisms of her forward turret failed and more defects were discovered back at the base . Rostislav spent the rest of the spring having her gun mounts repaired , but the problem persisted and the Navy " solved " it by prohibiting them from being used . The gun mounts were rebuilt along the pattern of those used by the armored cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in 1901 and 1902 , and Rostislav successfully passed the gunnery tests in June 1902 . The ship 's electrical turret controls , with their 332 contact pairs , required tedious maintenance and proved too complex for most of the enlisted men . 
 = = Service = = 
 On May 1 , 1899 , Captain Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich assumed command of Rostislav , becoming the first Romanov since Peter I to command a combat ship . Another Romanov , Grand Duke Kirill , spent a few uneventful months on board Rostislav in 1900 . Alexander 's guests , parties and diplomatic visits to Istanbul regularly interfered with the crew 's duties , but he personally managed the repairs and alterations of the ship 's equipment . Shipyards and contractors treated Rostislav as a priority customer . Alexander , based on his experience with Sissoi Veliky , persuaded the NTC to reinforce Rostislav 's rudder frame and supervised installation of a backup control post deep under the conning tower . In 1903 Alexander was promoted to rear admiral and returned to his ship as a squadron commander . Rostislav served as the junior flagship of the Black Sea Fleet until September 1912 . 
 The 1900 season revealed grave problems with Rostislav 's boilers . Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke . Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating , buckling of fireboxes and sudden <unk> . For three and a half months the boilers failed one by one , starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers . Oil delivered by the Rothschild @-@ controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault ; similar problems were experienced by oil @-@ fired ships of the Baltic Fleet . Repairs and alterations of the power plant continued until 1904 , when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with oil fuel and convert Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905 . Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overweight ship , and by 1907 the ship 's belt armor was completely below the waterline . 
 The Tsentralka , the group plotting a mutiny of the Black Sea Fleet , decided on June 25 , 1905 , that the mutiny should start on Potemkin rather than Rostislav . On June 27 , 1905 , the day of the battleship Potemkin mutiny , Rostislav was sailing under the ensign of Vice Admiral Alexander Krieger . Nicholas II ordered Krieger and his superior , fleet commander Grigory <unk> , to destroy the rebels by force , but the admirals refrained from shooting . They let the rebels flee to Odessa and later to Romania . Krieger 's own crew was on the verge of open mutiny . On July 2 , 1905 , a military council held on board Rostislav decided to moor the ships in Odessa , disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will . By the time of the Ochakov mutiny in November 1905 , fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10 @-@ inch and fourteen 6 @-@ inch shells against the rebels .

 After the Battle of Tsushima the Imperial Navy concentrated on improving their gunnery skills and fire @-@ control practices . In 1908 Alexei Krylov and Yevgeny <unk> led Rostislav on an unprecedented long @-@ range gunnery shoot : Rostislav fired 330 ten @-@ inch shells at a distance of 8 to 10 miles ( 13 to 16 km ) in a few days . The experiment proved that the older ballistic tables used by the Navy were inaccurate . <unk> compiled the data from the 1908 exercise into the new tables adopted by the Navy . Another of Krylov 's initiatives , rapid counter @-@ flooding , was standardized in 1909 . 
 Two plans for modernizing the ship were put forward before World War I. In 1907 the Naval General Staff proposed a major reconstruction aimed at reducing her draft and raising her armor belt higher out of the water . Her above @-@ water torpedo tubes , torpedo nets , auxiliary boilers and 47 @-@ millimeter guns would have been removed , her superstructure cut down and her rigging reduced to a single pole mast . These changes would have reduced her displacement by 250 long tons ( 250 t ) , but the plan was rejected due to a shortage of money . Her above @-@ water torpedo tubes , however , were removed about this time . In 1912 the staff of the Black Sea Fleet proposed to replace all of her 47 mm guns with four 75 @-@ millimetre ( 3 in ) guns and to remove the auxiliary boilers and the submerged torpedo tubes to offset the additional weight . The Naval General Staff did not think that this was worth the cost and rejected the plan . Even though these plans did not come to fruition , other alterations were made to Rostislav before the war . A dozen of her 37 mm guns were removed in 1906 , and she was fitted with 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) rangefinders , probably made by Barr and Stroud , in 1907 and 1908 . 
 In 1909 and 1910 , Rostislav and the rest of the Black Sea Fleet prepared for joint operations with submarines . She was scheduled for an installation of the first Russian underwater acoustic communication system , but the installation was interrupted and her hardware was installed on the battleship Panteleimon ( the former Potemkin ) instead . During an anti @-@ submarine exercise on the night of June 11 , 1909 , Rostislav accidentally rammed and sank the submarine Kambala . Twenty men of Kambala and two rescue divers died . The accident was blamed on reckless maneuvering by the submarine , and Rostislav 's captain was cleared of any negligence or wrongdoing . 
 = = = Diplomatic incidents = = = 
 Before the outbreak of World War I Rostislav was involved in two minor international incidents . On August 11 , 1911 , Evstafi and Panteleimon , two of the Black Sea Fleet battleships paying a state visit to Romania , ran aground on a shoal just off the port of Constanța . Rostislav 's officers had detected the hazard and steered her to safety , but did not alert the other ships . The international embarrassment that followed led to the resignation of fleet commander Admiral Ivan <unk> . During the First Balkan War Rostislav sailed into the Sea of Marmara to protect the Russian Embassy in Istanbul from a mob . Rostislav accidentally fired a live shell into the Turkish defenses . No one was injured during the incident , and the captain defused the situation with a personal apology to the Ottoman government . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Rostislav spent the winter of 1913 – 14 refitting , and in April 1914 she returned to the active fleet with newly overhauled machinery , new rangefinders and new gun sights . The ship made 15 @.@ 37 knots ( 28 @.@ 47 km / h ; 17 @.@ 69 mph ) on her post @-@ refit trials . 
 On November 4 , 1914 , the Black Sea Fleet sailed out on its first combat operation of the war : the bombardment of Zonguldak . The operation was conceived as a retaliation against the Turkish @-@ German attack on Sevastopol . Rostislav , captained by Kazimierz <unk> , was the " designated gunboat " while other Russian battleships formed a defensive screen around her . On November 6 she fired 251 shells at the port of Zonguldak , reducing it to rubble . On November 18 the ship faced Goeben during the Battle of Cape Sarych , but the German ship broke contact before Rostislav , trailing behind the Russian formation , even spotted her . Rostislav had other encounters with Goeben in 1915 and 1916 , but did not engage her directly . In 1915 the ship received four 75 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 After the commissioning of the Imperatritsa Mariya @-@ class dreadnoughts , the old battleships were split into independent combat groups . Rostislav became the flagship of the Batumi Group tasked with supporting the ground operations of the Caucasus Army . Their first joint action began February 5 , 1916 , near <unk> . On the first day alone the ship fired 400 shells against the Turks . On March 4 Rostislav and the gunboats <unk> and <unk> supported the amphibious landing at Atina . Three days later she supported the landing of marines that ended in the capture of Rize . At the end of March Rostislav and Panteleimon forced the Turks to evacuate Trabzon . 
 In the summer of 1916 the Navy seriously considered an all @-@ out amphibious assault on the Bosphorus . Fleet commander Andrei Eberhardt anticipated a high risk of naval mine and torpedo hits in the coastal waters and suggested equipping all pre @-@ dreadnought battleships with anti @-@ torpedo bulges . Sinop had her bulges fitted in Nikolaev in July 1916 , and Rostislav was next in line , but the work was cancelled in August , and she was transferred to the Romanian coast as flagship of the Constanța Group . Constanța temporarily became an important logistical hub for the Russian troops heading to the Romanian Front , and the base for minelayers , submarines and destroyers harassing the enemy in the Bosphorus area . The Germans responded with air raids ; their first aerial success against a Russian naval target was scored against Rostislav . The bomb hit the edge of the aft 10 @-@ inch turret and injured sixteen sailors . The turret itself remained fully operational . The collapse of the Romanian Front in October 1916 forced the Navy to evacuate Constanța . Rostislav returned to Sevastopol for a much @-@ needed overhaul . 
 = = = Revolution = = = 
 The February Revolution of 1917 did not demoralize the Black Sea Fleet as quickly as the Baltic Fleet . Captain Fyodor Stark , a former destroyer commander , maintained Rostislav in combat @-@ ready condition until the end of the year . The battleship sailed out for her last voyage to Batumi in September and October . Stark managed to contain the radical politics , anti @-@ German sentiment and <unk> of the crew , but nevertheless raised the flag of Ukraine on his return to Sevastopol on October 25 . From this moment desertion and " volunteering " into the Red Guards intensified , and by December 21 the crew was reduced to 460 enlisted men and 28 officers . In January 1918 the fleet disintegrated completely : the officers fled from the enraged enlisted men , then the enlisted men abandoned the ships and fled from the advancing German Army . On April 29 , 1918 , the Bolsheviks managed to extricate two battleships and sixteen destroyers from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk , but Rostislav and the rest of the fleet remained in Sevastopol . 
 The German occupation of Crimea from May to November 1918 did not affect the abandoned ship . The Anglo @-@ French forces that replaced the Germans stayed in Sevastopol until April 1919 . Before leaving , the British destroyed Rostislav 's engines on April 25 . The White forces of Baron Wrangel used the disabled ship as a floating battery in the Sea of Azov . The ship , manned by a ragtag volunteer crew , was stationed in the shallow waters of the Strait of Kerch to harass the Reds in Taman and prevent a landing in the Crimea . After the defeat of Wrangel 's land forces , the crew scuttled Rostislav in the Strait of Kerch to prevent the Red forces from breaking through to the Black Sea . 
 When Rostislav sank in the shallows her superstructure remained above water . In 1930 , the EPRON ( a Soviet salvage unit ) retrieved the ship 's guns and partially dismantled the hull . According to diver Alexander <unk> , the remains of the hull are still lying in the strait , around 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 1 @,@ 300 yd ) from the Ukrainian coast , and gradually sinking into the silt . 
 = Common thresher = 
 The Common thresher ( Alopias vulpinus ) , also known by many names such as Atlantic thresher , Big @-@ eye thresher , Fox shark , Green thresher , <unk> , Slasher , <unk> , <unk> thresher , Whip @-@ tailed shark and Zorro thresher shark , is the largest species of thresher shark , family Alopiidae , reaching some 6 m ( 20 ft ) in length . About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin . With a streamlined body , short pointed snout , and modestly sized eyes , the common thresher resembles ( and has often been confused with ) the pelagic thresher ( A. pelagicus ) . It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins . The common thresher is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters , though it prefers cooler temperatures . It can be found both close to shore and in the open ocean , from the surface to a depth of 550 m ( 1 @,@ 800 ft ) . It is seasonally migratory and spends summers at lower latitudes . 
 The long tail of the common thresher , the source of many fanciful tales through history , is used in a whip @-@ like fashion to deliver incapacitating blows to its prey . This species feeds mainly on small schooling forage fishes such as herrings and anchovies . It is a fast , strong swimmer that has been known to leap clear of the water , and possesses physiological adaptations that allow it to maintain an internal body temperature warmer than that of the surrounding sea water . The common thresher has an aplacental viviparous mode of reproduction , with oophagous embryos that feed on undeveloped eggs ovulated by their mother . Females typically give birth to four pups at a time , following a gestation period of nine months . 
 Despite its size , the common thresher is minimally dangerous to humans due to its relatively small teeth and timid disposition . It is highly valued by commercial fishers for its meat , fins , hide , and liver oil ; large numbers are taken by longline and gillnet fisheries throughout its range . This shark is also esteemed by recreational anglers for the exceptional fight it offers on hook @-@ and @-@ line . The common thresher has a low rate of reproduction and cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure for long , a case in point being the rapid collapse of the thresher shark fishery off California in the 1980s . With commercial exploitation increasing in many parts of the world , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Vulnerable . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The first scientific description of the common thresher , as Squalus vulpinus , was written by French naturalist Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre in the 1788 Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique des trois règnes de la nature . In 1810 , Constantine Samuel Rafinesque described Alopias <unk> from a thresher shark caught off Sicily . Later authors recognized the genus Alopias as valid while synonymizing A. <unk> with S. vulpinus , and thus the common thresher 's scientific name became Alopias vulpinus . 
 The specific epithet vulpinus is derived from the Latin vulpes meaning " fox " , and in some older literature the species name was given incorrectly as Alopias vulpes . " Fox shark " is the earliest known English name for this species and is rooted in classical antiquity , from a belief that it was especially cunning . In the mid @-@ 19th century , the name " fox " was mostly superseded by " thresher " , referencing the shark 's flail @-@ like use of its tail . This species is often known simply as thresher shark or thresher ; Henry Bigelow and William Schroeder introduced the name " common thresher " in 1945 to differentiate it from the bigeye thresher ( A. superciliosus ) . It is also known by many other common names , including Atlantic thresher , <unk> , green thresher , long @-@ tailed shark , sea ape , sea fox , slasher , <unk> , <unk> thresher , thrasher shark , and whiptail shark . 
 Morphological and allozyme analyses have agreed that the common thresher is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye thresher and the pelagic thresher ( A. pelagicus ) . The closest relative of this species within the family may be a fourth , unrecognized thresher shark species off Baja California , reported from allozyme evidence by Blaise Eitner in 1995 . However , the existence of this fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources . 
 = = Description = = 
 The common thresher is a fairly robust shark with a torpedo @-@ shaped trunk and a short , broad head . The dorsal profile of the head curves evenly down to the pointed , conical snout . The eyes are moderately large and lack nictitating membranes . The small mouth is arched and , unlike in other thresher sharks , has furrows at the corners . There are 32 @-@ 53 upper and 25 @-@ 50 lower tooth rows ; the teeth are small , triangular , and smooth @-@ edged , lacking lateral cusplets . The five pairs of gill slits are short , with the fourth and fifth pairs located over the pectoral fin bases . 
 The long , falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) pectoral fins taper to narrowly pointed tips . The first dorsal fin is tall and positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins . The pelvic fins are almost as large as the first dorsal fin and bear long , thin claspers in males . The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny , with the former positioned ahead of the latter . There are crescent @-@ shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin . The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers , measuring about as long as the rest of the shark ; the thin , gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip . 
 The skin is covered by small , overlapping dermal denticles , each with three horizontal ridges and three to five marginal teeth . This species is metallic purplish brown to gray above , becoming more bluish on the flanks . The underside is white , which extends over the pectoral and pelvic fin bases ; this pattern is in contrast to the pelagic thresher , which is solidly colored over these fins . The meeting line between the dorsal and ventral coloration is often irregular . There may be a white spot at the tips of the pectoral fins . The common thresher is the largest thresher shark species , commonly reaching 5 m ( 16 ft ) long and 230 kg ( 510 lb ) in weight . The confirmed length record for this shark is 5 @.@ 7 m ( 19 ft ) , while the maximum possible length may be 6 @.@ 1 – 6 @.@ 5 m ( 20 – 21 ft ) . The heaviest individual on record is a 4 @.@ 8 m ( 16 ft ) female that weighed 510 kg ( 1 @,@ 120 lb ) . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 The range of the common thresher encompasses tropical and cold @-@ temperate waters worldwide . In the western Atlantic , it is found from Newfoundland to the Gulf of Mexico , though it is rare south of New England , and from Venezuela to Argentina . In the eastern Atlantic , it has been reported from the North Sea and the British Isles to Ghana ( including Madeira , the Azores , and the Mediterranean and Black Seas ) , as well as from Angola to South Africa . In the Indo @-@ Pacific , this species is known from Tanzania to India and the Maldives , Japan and Korea to southeastern China , Sumatra , eastern Australia , and New Zealand ; it also occurs around a number of Pacific islands including New Caledonia , the Society Islands , <unk> , and Hawaiian Islands . In the eastern Pacific , it has been recorded from British Columbia to Chile , including the Gulf of California . 
 The common thresher is migratory , moving to higher latitudes following warm water masses . In the eastern Pacific , males travel further than females , reaching as far as Vancouver Island in the late summer and early fall . Juveniles tend to remain in warm nursery areas . There appear to be separate populations with different life history characteristics in the eastern Pacific and western Indian Ocean and possibly elsewhere ; this species is not known to make transoceanic movements . In the northwestern Indian Ocean , males and females segregate by location and depth during the pupping season from January to May . Analysis of mitochondrial DNA has revealed substantial regional genetic variation within common threshers in all three oceans . This could support the idea that , despite being high mobile , sharks from different areas rarely interbreed . 
 = = Habitat = = 
 Common threshers are inhabitants of both continental waters and the open ocean . They tend to be most abundant in proximity to land , particularly the juveniles which frequent near @-@ coastal habitats such as bays . Most individuals are encountered near the surface , but this species has been recorded to at least a depth of 550 m ( 1 @,@ 800 ft ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Common threshers are active , strong swimmers ; there are infrequent reports of them leaping completely out of the water . Like the fast @-@ swimming sharks of the family Lamnidae , the common thresher has a strip of aerobic red muscle along its flank that is able to contract powerfully and efficiently for long periods of time . In addition , they have slow @-@ oxidative muscles centrally located within their bodies and a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system called the rete mirabile ( " wonderful net " ) , allowing them to generate and retain body heat . The temperature inside the red muscles of a common thresher averages 2 ° C ( 3 @.@ 6 ° F ) above that of the ambient seawater , though there is significant individual variation . Unlike the pelagic and bigeye threshers , the common thresher lacks an orbital rete mirabile to protect its eyes and brain from temperature changes . 
 Immature common threshers fall prey to larger sharks . Aside from observations of killer whales feeding on common threshers off New Zealand , adults have no known natural predators . Parasites documented from the common thresher include the protozoan Giardia intestinalis , the trematodes <unk> <unk> ( not usual host ) and <unk> <unk> , the tapeworms Acanthobothrium coronatum , Anthobothrium <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Paraorygmatobothrium exiguum , P. <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and the copepods <unk> <unk> , Echthrogaleus <unk> , <unk> pyriformis , <unk> <unk> , Nemesis <unk> , N. robusta , N. tiburo , Nesippus orientalis , and Pandarus smithii . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The long upper tail fin lobe of the common thresher is used to strike and incapacitate prey . Some 97 % of the common thresher 's diet is composed of bony fishes , mostly small schooling forage fish such as mackerel , bluefish , herring , needlefish , and lanternfish . Before striking , the sharks compact schools of prey by swimming around them and splashing the water with its tail , often in pairs or small groups . Threshers are also known to take large , solitary fishes such as lancetfish , as well as squid and other pelagic invertebrates . Off California , common threshers feed mostly on the northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ) , with Pacific hake ( <unk> productus ) , Pacific sardine ( Sardinops sagax ) , Pacific mackerel ( Scomber japonicus ) , market squid ( Loligo <unk> ) , and pelagic red crab ( <unk> <unk> ) also being important food items . The sharks concentrate on a few prey species during cold water years , but become less discriminating during less productive , warmer El Niño periods . 
 There are numerous accounts of common threshers using the long upper lobes of their tail fins to stun prey , and they are often snagged on longlines by their tails after presumably striking at the bait . In July 1914 , shark @-@ watcher Russell J. Coles reported seeing a thresher shark use its tail to flip prey fish into its mouth , and that one fish that missed was thrown a " considerable distance " . On April 14 , 1923 , noted oceanographer W.E. Allen observed a 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) thresher shark pursuing a California smelt ( <unk> californiensis ) off a pier at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography . The shark overtook the small fish and swung its tail above the water like a " coachwhip " with " confusing speed " , severely injuring its target . In the winter of 1865 , Irish ichthyologist Harry Blake @-@ Knox claimed to have seen a thresher shark in Dublin Bay use its tail to strike a wounded loon ( probably a great northern diver , Gavia immer ) , which it then swallowed . Blake @-@ Knox 's account was subsequently disputed by other authorities , who asserted that the thresher 's tail is not rigid or muscular enough to effect such a blow . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other mackerel sharks , common threshers are aplacental viviparous . They give birth to litters of two to four ( rarely six ) pups in the eastern Pacific , and three to seven pups in the eastern Atlantic . They are believed to reproduce throughout their range ; one known nursery area is the Southern California Bight . Breeding occurs in the summer , usually July or August , and parturition occurs from March to June following a gestation period of nine months . The developing embryos are oophagous , feeding on eggs ovulated by the mother . The teeth of small embryos are peg @-@ like and non @-@ functional , being covered by a sheath of soft tissues . As the embryos mature , their series of teeth become progressively more like those of adults in shape , though they remain depressed and hidden until shortly before birth . 
 Newborn pups usually measure 114 – 160 cm ( 3 @.@ 74 – 5 @.@ 25 ft ) long and weigh 5 – 6 kg ( 11 – 13 lb ) , depending on the size of the mother . The juveniles grow about 50 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) a year while adults grow about 10 cm ( 0 @.@ 33 ft ) a year . The size at maturation appears to vary between populations . In the eastern North Pacific males mature at 3 @.@ 3 m ( 11 ft ) and five years old , and females at around 2 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 5 – 14 @.@ 8 ft ) and seven years old . They are known to live to at least 15 years of age and their maximum lifespan has been estimated to be 45 – 50 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 While any large shark is capable of inflicting injury and thus merits respect , the common thresher poses little danger to humans . Most divers report that they are shy and difficult to approach underwater . The International Shark Attack File lists a single provoked attack by the thresher shark and four attacks on boats , which were probably incidental from individuals fighting capture . There is an unsubstantiated report of a common thresher acting aggressively towards a <unk> off New Zealand . 
 Famed big @-@ game angler Frank Mundus , in his book <unk> for Sharks , recounted a tale in which a longline fisherman off the Carolinas leaned over the side of his boat to examine something large that he had hooked , and was decapitated by the caudal fin of a thresher shark estimated to be 5 m ( 16 ft ) long . The head supposedly fell into the water and was never recovered . This account is considered highly improbable by most authors . 
 = = = Commercial fishing = = = 
 The common thresher is widely caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries , especially in the northwestern Indian Ocean , the western , central , and eastern Pacific , and the North Atlantic . Participating countries include the former USSR , Japan , Taiwan , Spain , the United States , Brazil , Uruguay , and Mexico . The meat is highly prized for human consumption cooked , dried and salted , or smoked . In addition , their skin is made into leather , their liver oil is processed for vitamins , and their fins are used for shark fin soup . The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006 . 
 In the United States , a drift gillnet fishery for the common thresher developed in southern California in 1977 , beginning with 10 vessels experimenting with a larger @-@ sized mesh . Within two years the fleet had increased to 40 vessels , and the fishery peaked in 1982 when 228 vessels landed 1 @,@ 091 metric tons . The common thresher population rapidly collapsed from overfishing , with landings decreasing to less than 300 metric tons a year by the late 1980s and larger size classes disappearing from the population . Common threshers are still taken commercially in the United States , with about 85 % coming from the Pacific and 15 % from the Atlantic . The largest catches remain from the California @-@ Oregon gillnet fishery , which had shifted its focus to the more valuable swordfish ( Xiphius gladius ) but still take threshers as bycatch . Small numbers of Pacific threshers are also taken by harpoons , small @-@ mesh driftnets , and longlines . In the Atlantic , threshers are primarily taken on longlines meant for swordfish and tuna . 
 = = = Recreational fishing = = = 
 Common threshers are well regarded by sports fishers as one of the strongest fighting sharks alongside the shortfin mako shark ( Isurus <unk> ) , and are ranked as game fish by the International Game Fish Association ( IGFA ) . They are pursued by anglers using rod and reel off California , South Africa , and elsewhere . Frank Mundus has called thresher sharks " exceedingly stubborn " and " pound for pound , a harder fish to whip " than the mako . Fishing for the common thresher is similar to that for the mako ; the recommended equipment is a 24 kg ( 53 lb ) rod and a big @-@ game reel holding at least 365 m ( 400 yd ) of 24 kg ( 53 lb ) line . The ideal method is trolling with baitfish , either deep or allowing it to drift . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 All three thresher shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) in 2007 . The rapid collapse of the Californian subpopulation ( over 50 % within three generations ) prompted concerns regarding the species ' susceptibility to overfishing in other areas , where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little @-@ known . In addition to continued fishing pressure , common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps , and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets . 
 The United States manages common thresher fisheries via regulations such as commercial quotas and trip limits , and recreational minimum sizes and retention limits . Shark finning is illegal under U.S. federal law . The Atlantic common thresher fishery is regulated by the National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) Highly Migratory Species Management Division through the 2006 Consolidated Atlantic Highly Migratory Species ( HMS ) Fishery Management Plan ( FMP ) , and the Pacific common thresher fishery is regulated by the Pacific Fishery Management Council through the Fishery Management Plan ( FMP ) for U.S. West Coast Fisheries for Highly Migratory Species ( HMS ) . In the 1990s , after the depletion of common thresher stocks by the California gillnet fishery , the fleet was limited to 70 boats and restrictions were placed on season , operation range , and landings . There is evidence that the California subpopulation is recovering , and the potential population growth rate has been estimated to be 4 – 7 % per year . 
 = = Historical perceptions = = 
 The Greek philosopher Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BCE ) wrote some of the earliest observations about the common thresher . In his Historia Animalia , he claimed that hooked threshers had a propensity for freeing themselves by biting through fishing lines , and that they protected their young by swallowing them . These " clever " behaviors , which have not been borne out by science , led the ancient Greeks to call it <unk> ( meaning " fox " ) , on which its modern scientific name is based . 
 An oft @-@ repeated myth about the common thresher is that they cooperate with swordfish to attack whales . In one version of events , the thresher shark circles the whale and distracts it by beating the sea to a froth with its tail , thereby allowing the swordfish to impale it in a vulnerable spot with its rostrum . In an alternate account , the swordfish positions itself beneath the whale , while the thresher leaps out of the water and lands on top of the whale , hammering it onto the swordfish 's rostrum . Yet other authors describe the thresher " cutting huge gashes " in the side of the whale with its tail . Neither threshers nor swordfish however are known to feed on whales or indeed possess the dentition to do so . The story may have arisen from mariners mistaking the tall dorsal fins of killer whales , which do attack large cetaceans , for thresher shark tails . Swordfish bills have also been found embedded in blue and fin whales ( likely accidents due to the fast @-@ moving fish 's inertia ) , and thresher sharks do exhibit some of the aforementioned behaviors independent of whales . 
 = New York State Route 18 = 
 New York State Route 18 ( NY 18 ) is an east – west state highway in western New York in the United States . It runs parallel to the south shore of Lake Ontario for most of its length between Niagara County and Monroe County . NY 18 , which also passes through Orleans County , acts as a northerly alternate to NY 104 , another east – west route that parallels NY 18 to the south on Ridge Road . The western terminus of NY 18 is at a complex grade @-@ separated interchange with NY 104 outside the village of Lewiston . Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 104 in an area of Rochester known as Kodak Park . 
 NY 18 was assigned in 1924 and originally extended from the Pennsylvania state line near Salamanca to downtown Buffalo via Dayton and Hamburg . It was extended northeast to Rochester via Niagara Falls as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York and east to NY 250 in the town of Webster by the following year . NY 18 was truncated on its west end to the town of Lewiston in the early 1960s and on its east end to Rochester in the early 1970s . 
 Although NY 18 is signed as east – west , it runs primarily north – south through the western portion of Niagara County . After leaving Niagara County , NY 18 shifts farther south , gradually moving away from the shore of Lake Ontario . In central Orleans County , NY 18 meets the Lake Ontario State Parkway at the Lakeside Beach State Park . The parkway then becomes the lakeside road , and NY 18 veers south to follow a more inland routing .

 NY 18 begins at a junction with NY 104 south of a complex grade @-@ separated interchange that includes NY 18F , NY 104 , and the Niagara Scenic Parkway on the eastern edge of the village of Lewiston . From NY 104 east , a right @-@ turn ramp allows access to Creek Road Extension , the first street that modern @-@ day NY 18 occupies . NY 104 continues north from the ramp , passing over NY 18 westbound ( which terminates at the merge ramp with NY 104 west ) on its way to the village while NY 18 proceeds to the northeast on Creek Road Extension , bypassing Lewiston to the southeast . After 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) , the highway curves to the north and meets NY 104 at an unconventional grade @-@ separated interchange that has a pair of two @-@ way ramps connecting the two state routes . NY 18 continues on , passing under NY 104 and paralleling the Robert Moses State Parkway as it proceeds north . 
 At a wye in the Porter hamlet of <unk> , NY 18 breaks from its north – south alignment and turns to the northeast before curving northward once more , returning to a perfect north – south alignment at an intersection with NY 93 in the hamlet of Towers Corners . Southwest of the Four Mile Creek State Park , NY 18 turns a full 90 degrees to the east and begins to parallel the southern shore of Lake Ontario . Here , NY 18 meets the northern terminus of NY 18F , changes names from Creek Road to Lake Road , and becomes part of the Seaway Trail , a National Scenic Byway . The route proceeds northeast to Four Mile Creek State Park , where it intersects the northern end of the Robert Moses State Parkway . East of the park , NY 18 gradually moves to the north , decreasing the area between the route and the lakeshore as it proceeds east . 
 Now in Wilson and less than 100 yards ( 91 m ) from the lakeshore , NY 18 meets the northern terminus of NY 425 . Farther east , in Olcott , NY 18 intersects the northern extent of NY 78 . On the eastern edge of town , the route intersects Transit Road , which runs along the transit line first surveyed by the Holland Land Company . This portion of Transit Road does not meet the NY 78 @-@ occupied portion in Lockport , however . After meeting the northern end of NY 148 in Somerset , NY 18 intersects the northern terminus of NY 269 at the Niagara – Orleans County line . 
 = = = Orleans County = = = 
 Across the county line , NY 18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway . It continues across the northern edge of the county and the southern fringe of Lake Ontario , meeting the northern terminus of NY 63 in Yates Center , north of Lyndonville . While NY 63 ends here , Lyndonville Road continues north to the lake as County Route 63 @-@ 1 ( CR 63 @-@ 1 ) . This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY 63 . In Carlton , NY 18 intersects the northern terminus of NY 279 , the last in a series of north – south routes that terminate at NY 18 . Not far to the east , the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway . At this point , the Seaway Trail leaves NY 18 to follow the parkway along the lakeshore . 
 East of the park , NY 18 breaks from the Lake Ontario shore and begins to make its way southward , curving to the southeast as it meets NY 98 north of the hamlet of Baldwin Corner . The routes converge to form a concurrency south to the hamlet , where NY 18 continues east . At the Carlton – Kendall town line , NY 18 curves southeastward once again before reverting to an easterly alignment in Kendall . After passing NY 237 south of the hamlet of Kendall , NY 18 intersects NY 272 at the Orleans – Monroe County line . NY 18 merges onto the county line road , overlapping NY 272 along the county line for just under 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the continuation of Roosevelt Highway , where NY 18 continues east into Monroe County . 
 = = = Monroe County = = = 
 NY 18 remains Roosevelt Highway until Hamlin – Parma Town Line Road , where is becomes West Avenue . In the hamlet of Hamlin , it meets NY 19 . NY 18 passes NY 260 before swerving northward onto West Avenue at the Hamlin – Parma town line and proceeding eastward toward the village of Hilton . In Hilton , NY 18 meets NY 259 ( Lake Avenue ) in the center of the village . The two routes overlap for a short distance east along Main Street before turning south to exit the village on South Avenue . 
 NY 18 and NY 259 , now named Hilton – Parma Corners Road , remain concurrent until Parma Center , where NY 18 turns east to follow Parma Center Road for roughly 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) through a rural portion of Parma . Parma Center Road ends upon intersecting NY 261 ( Manitou Road ) at the Parma – Greece town line ; as a result , NY 18 joins NY 261 for one block southward before returning east on Latta Road and entering the Rochester suburb of Greece . NY 18 passes through the rural northwestern part of the town and the more developed , densely populated northeastern section , meeting NY 390 at exit 26 in the latter . The junction is the northernmost exit on NY 390 prior to its merging with the Lake Ontario State Parkway to the north . 
 A small distance east of NY 390 , NY 18 passes Greece Arcadia High School and intersects Mount Read Boulevard in the hamlet of Mount Read before intersecting Dewey Avenue a half @-@ mile to the east . NY 18 turns south onto Dewey Avenue ; however , state maintenance continues to follow Latta Road east to where it crosses into the Rochester city limits at Charlotte . This section of Latta Road is designated as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . NY 18 , meanwhile , becomes maintained by Monroe County as part of CR 132 , an unsigned designation that follows Dewey Avenue north to its end at the Lake Ontario shoreline . The route continues south on Dewey Avenue to the Rochester city line , where CR 132 ends and maintenance of the route shifts to the city of Rochester . NY 18 ends about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) later at a junction with NY 104 in an industrialized area known as Kodak Park .

 In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 18 , an unsigned legislative route that ran from the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley to the mouth of the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city of Buffalo . North of Buffalo , Route 18 followed Niagara Falls Boulevard ( modern NY <unk> and U.S. Route 62 or US 62 ) to Niagara Falls and current NY 104 and NY 18F between Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario . When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , the portion of legislative Route 18 north of Buffalo became the basis for NY 34 , which began at Main Street ( NY 5 ) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route 18 through Niagara Falls and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario . NY 18 was assigned at the same time ; however , it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US 219 , NY 417 , NY 353 and US 62 . In Cattaraugus County , NY 18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley . 
 NY 18 was extended northeastward to Rochester as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , effectively doubling the route 's length . Instead of ending at the junction of Ohio and Main Streets ( the latter then part of NY 5 ) in downtown Buffalo , NY 18 now overlapped with NY 5 along Main Street north to Niagara Falls Boulevard , where it turned north and proceeded to Lake Ontario over NY 34 . At Youngstown , the route turned east , following a previously unnumbered alignment along the lakeshore to Rochester , where it ended at NY 31 ( now NY 104 ) in Kodak Park . The route was extended further eastward to NY 250 in Webster by the following year by way of East Ridge Road , Culver Road , and Lake Road . NY 18 was never extended eastward past its junction with NY 250 . 
 While the general routing of NY 18 between Youngstown and Rochester was the same in 1930 as it is now , it initially followed a slightly different alignment through eastern Orleans County and western Monroe County . NY 18 broke from its current alignment at Carr Road and followed Carr , Kenmore and Kendall Roads through the town of Kendall to the hamlet of Morton , from where it continued to Hamlin via the now @-@ decommissioned NY 360 and NY 19 . Additionally , NY 18 utilized Hamlin Center Road and what is now NY 260 between Hamlin and Roosevelt Highway . 
 The majority of NY 18 's routing south of the village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US 62 and US 219 were extended into New York and US 104 was assigned . NY 18 now began concurrent to US 219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward to the city of Salamanca . US 219 left NY 18 here , and the latter continued independently to the town of Dayton , where it intersected US 62 . From there , US 62 followed NY 18 north to a junction with US 104 ( Main Street ) in Niagara Falls . US 62 ended here , and NY 18 became concurrent to US 104 upon turning onto Main Street . The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston , where US 104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead .

 By 1931 , NY 18 was realigned to follow its current alignment between Hamlin and the Parma town line while the modern routing of NY 18 between the Orleans County line and Hamlin was designated as NY 360 . The alignments of NY 360 and NY 18 between NY 272 and Hamlin were flipped c . 1933 , placing both routes on their modern routings through Hamlin . NY 18 was moved onto its present routing through Kendall c . 1938 , bypassing the hamlets of Kendall and Morton to the south . In the Buffalo area , NY 18 was realigned twice in the 1930s : first by 1935 to bypass downtown to the east on Bailey Avenue between Abbott Road and Main Street and again in the late 1930s to use Bailey Avenue and Eggert Road between Main Street and Niagara Falls Boulevard . The Cattaraugus – Little Valley segment of the route was realigned c . 1934 to travel directly between the two locations . Its former routing via New Albion became NY 18F ; however , that designation was eliminated c . 1938 . 
 NY 18 was rerouted between Lewiston and Youngstown on January 1 , 1949 , to follow a more inland highway through western Niagara County . The former routing of NY 18 alongside the Niagara River was redesignated as NY 18F . To the east in Rochester , NY 18 was realigned in the early 1950s to follow East Ridge Road east to the then @-@ southern terminus of the Sea Breeze Expressway . The route turned north , following the highway to its end at Culver Road , where it rejoined its pre @-@ expressway alignment . The western terminus of NY 18 was moved north to its present location in Lewiston c . 1962 , eliminating the three lengthy overlaps that existed between Pennsylvania and Lewiston . The lone independent portion of NY 18 south of Lewiston became an extension of NY 353 . 
 On January 1 , 1970 , NY 47 was extended northward to encompass the entirety of the now @-@ complete Sea Breeze Expressway , creating an overlap with NY 18 between Ridge and Culver Roads . Prior to the extension , NY 47 had ended at Empire Boulevard ( US 104 , now NY 404 ) . The overlap proved to be temporary as NY 18 was truncated westward c . 1973 to its current eastern terminus in Kodak Park . The former routing of NY 18 between NY 590 and NY 250 was redesignated as NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . East Ridge Road , meanwhile , was now devoid of any designations as US 104 had been shifted onto the Keeler Street Expressway several years before . As a result , ownership and maintenance of the Irondequoit section of East Ridge Road was transferred to Monroe County , which designated it as the unsigned CR 241 . Culver Road , meanwhile , is now CR 120 . 
 = = Suffixed routes = = 
 NY 18 has had seven suffixed routes using six designations ; only one , NY 18F , still exists . Most of the routes were renumbered when NY 18 was truncated to Lewiston c . 1962 . 
 NY 18A was an alternate route of NY 18 between Collins and Hamburg . It was assigned c . 1931 and mostly replaced with an extended NY 75 c . 1962 . 
 NY 18B was an alternate route of NY 18 through the eastern suburbs of Buffalo . It was assigned c . 1935 and mostly replaced with an extended NY 277 c . 1962 . 
 NY 18C was a short @-@ lived alternate route of NY 18 through the eastern Buffalo suburbs . It was assigned c . 1932 and began at NY 18 ( now US 62 ) at Big Tree in Hamburg and followed Big Tree Road and modern US 20 to NY 35 ( now US 20 and NY 130 ) in Depew . The Transit Road portion of the route overlapped with NY 78 . NY 18C was truncated to consist only of the Transit Road portion c . 1935 and removed entirely c . 1938 as part of US 20 's realignment through western New York . 
 NY 18D was a spur route linking NY 18 to the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge north of downtown Niagara Falls . It was assigned c . 1932 and renumbered to NY 182 c . 1962 . 
 NY 18E was a short spur assigned in the early 1930s to a connector between then @-@ NY 18 ( now NY 18F ) and the original Queenston – Lewiston Bridge in Lewiston . It was removed in the early 1960s when the original bridge to Queenston was replaced with the modern Lewiston – Queenston Bridge a short distance upstream . 
 The NY 18F designation has been used for two distinct highways : 
 The first NY 18F was assigned c . 1934 to NY 18 's original routing between Cattaraugus and Little Valley . The designation was removed c . 1938 . 
 The current NY 18F ( 9 @.@ 80 miles or 15 @.@ 77 kilometres ) is an alternate route of NY 18 in western Niagara County that serves the riverside villages of Lewiston and Youngstown . It was assigned in 1949 .

 = Liverpool F.C. in European football = 
 Liverpool Football Club , an English professional association football club , is Britain 's most successful team in Union of European Football Associations ( UEFA ) competitions . Since 1964 , they have won eleven European trophies : the UEFA Champions League ( formerly known as the European Cup ) five times , the UEFA Europa League ( formerly known as the UEFA Cup ) three times , and the UEFA Super Cup three times . 
 Qualification for European competitions is determined by a team 's success in its domestic league and cup competitions from the previous season . Liverpool competed in European competitions for 21 consecutive seasons until the 1985 European Cup Final , the occasion of the Heysel Stadium disaster , following which the club was banned from European competitions for six seasons . Since being readmitted in 1991 , they have qualified for the Champions League ( the successor to the European Cup ) eight times and the UEFA Cup ( the predecessor to the Europa League ) seven times . 
 As a result of their victory in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final , Liverpool won the European Champion Clubs ' Cup trophy outright , and were awarded a multiple winner badge . Only Real Madrid ( ten ) and Milan ( seven ) have won the competition on more occasions . Liverpool 's total of three UEFA Cup wins has been bettered only by Sevilla , who have won the competition five times . They have also won the UEFA Super Cup on three occasions , a total only Milan and Barcelona ( five titles each ) have bettered . 
 Bob Paisley is the club 's most successful manager in Europe , with five trophies . Liverpool 's biggest @-@ margin win in Europe is an 11 – 0 victory over Strømsgodset in the 1974 – 75 European Cup Winners ' Cup . In European competitions , Jamie Carragher holds the club record for the most appearances , with 150 , and Steven Gerrard is the club 's record goalscorer , with 41 goals .
