 Sheet Harbour is a rural community on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia , Canada . It is part of the Halifax Regional Municipality and lies along the Marine Drive on Trunk 7 approximately 117 kilometres ( 73 mi ) northeast of Halifax . Sheet Harbour is the commercial , employment and educational hub for around 5 @,@ 500 people . The community is located along the shores of Sheet Harbour , which has two arms : the Northwest Arm and the Northeast Arm . Two rivers flow into the harbour : West River into the Northwest Arm , and East River into the Northeast Arm . Little West River , a minor river , also flows into the Northwest Arm . The Grand Lake , a large lake west of Sheet Harbour , empties into the Atlantic Ocean , via the Little West River . Adjacent to the community is the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port , an important regional deep @-@ water port . The majority of the land was granted in 1773 and the colony was established in 1784 . Forestry was prominent in Sheet Harbour during its early years . The first sulphide pulp mill in the Dominion of Canada was constructed along the East River in 1885 . However , it was closed in 1891 , due to the high prices of importing sulphide . Another pulp mill was constructed beside the West River Falls in 1925 , but it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971 . The community today relies on forestry , fishing and tourism . 
 Trunk 7 runs directly through Sheet Harbour . Route 224 and Route 374 both have junctions in Sheet Harbour . A new bridge was built across the Northeast Arm . It was named the East River Bridge , after its predecessor . Construction started in September 2014 and it was opened on 17 December 2015 , with a bridge walk to commemorate the event . Sheet Harbour has a hospital , named Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital ( <unk> ) , which is connected to Harbourview Lodge . The community is located about ten minutes northeast of Taylor Head Provincial Park . Sheet Harbour has two schools : Sheet Harbour Consolidated School ( SHCS ) and Duncan MacMillan High School ( DMHS ) . There is a plan currently proposed by the Halifax Regional School Board to replace the four schools in the Sheet Harbour area , one of which is defunct , with one P @-@ 12 school . Tom McInnis , a former Conservative Party politician and member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1978 @-@ 1993 , resides in Sheet Harbour .

 Sheet Harbour is a small rural community located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia , in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality . It is the major community in the area as it is the commercial , employment and educational hub for about 5 @,@ 500 people . Sheet Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area , due to the shape of the harbour . The population of Census Tract <unk> @.@ 00 , which includes Sheet Harbour and a large amount of land around Sheet Harbour 's land borders , is 3 @,@ 478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census . Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2 @,@ 500 to 8 @,@ 000 . Each census tract has a numerical designation . The population of the community of Sheet Harbour is about 800 . Immediately west of Sheet Harbour is Sheet Harbour 36 , a small Mi 'kmaq reserve . 
 = = Topography = = 
 The community of Sheet Harbour is located along the shores of Sheet Harbour , a saltwater harbour , which has two arms : The Northwest Arm and the Northeast Arm . 
 The western and the wider arm is referred to as the Northwest Arm , while the eastern arm is known as the Northeast Arm . The two arms connect just below Church Point , southeast of where West River meets the Northwest Arm . The harbour continues southeast @-@ ward , then southward toward the Atlantic Ocean . The Northwest Arm extends northwest until it meets the mouth of West River at the West River Falls . The Northeast Arm extends north , then curves northeast under the East River Bridge , until it meets the mouth of the East River . There is a very small island in the arm , named Hen Island . 
 The harbour from Church Point , where the two arms meet , to the Atlantic Ocean is referred to as Sheet Harbour . It is wider than either arm . It is approximately 11 @-@ 15 metres ( 36 @-@ 49 ft ) deep at low tide . It gradually widens as it flows southward the Atlantic Ocean . After Church Point , it flows southeast @-@ ward past the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port and west of the small community of Watt Section . It then curves and flows southwest @-@ ward to southward toward the Atlantic . 
 The area around Sheet Harbour is heavily forested and rich in lakes . The coastline is also very rocky and eroded by the Atlantic Ocean , as is typical with most of the Eastern Shore . Sheet Harbour has average tides of about 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 to 5 ft ) . 
 = = Rivers = = 
 Two major rivers , one minor river and several small streams empty into the harbour . West River flows into the Northwest Arm , and East River empties into the Northeast Arm . 
 = = = Northwest Arm = = = 
 West River , formally West River Sheet Harbour , begins near the <unk> Valley . The main branch of the river , named West River Main , is 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) long . The river has two secondary branches , the <unk> River , which is 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) long , and Little River , which is 16 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 10 @.@ 3 mi ) long . Several smaller streams flow into the river as it progresses southeast @-@ ward toward Sheet Harbour . Lake Alma flows into West River via Little River . A while downstream , the river flows into Sheet Harbour Lake . Sheet Harbour Lake ends just before the West River Bridge , where Trunk 7 passes over the West River , just before the West River Falls . The falls carry water from 22 metres ( 72 ft ) elevation down to sea level . The river then empties into the Northwest Arm . The river area has been deforested and is prone to flash @-@ flooding . 
 Sheet Harbour was the first community in North America to use a lime <unk> , which sprays limestone in to the water , to lower acid rain levels , starting in September 2005 in the West River . It was successful in stabilizing the pH of the river at 5 @.@ 5 , a healthy level for salmon and other aquatic life . 
 The Grand Lake , a large lake west of Sheet Harbour , also empties into the Northwest Arm via West Lake and Little West River in West Sheet Harbour . The river empties into West Cove , then into the Northwest Arm . 
 = = = Northeast Arm = = = 
 East River , formally East River Sheet Harbour , is the other main river that discharges into Sheet Harbour . It flows through the Marshall <unk> , a large <unk> , then past the Ruth Falls Power Plant , a hydropower generating station . It narrows back into a river for a short while , then flows into the head of the Northeast Arm . 
 = = History = = 
 Almost all of the present land area of Sheet Harbour was granted in 1773 , and the settlement was established around 1784 , by Loyalist refugees and British veterans of the American Revolution and became a prosperous centre for the lumber industry . The Mi 'kmaq name for the settlement was <unk> , which translates to " flowing wildly " . Sheet Harbour was named " Port North " on the Royal Navy Chart that was published in 1778 . The settlement was called Port North until 1807 . Alternate names for the settlement were Campbelltown and Manchester . Campbelltown would have been named after Lord William Campbell , who was a Captain General as well as a Governor @-@ in @-@ Chief in 1776 – 1773 . It was decided that " Port North " was not descriptive enough , so the name was changed to Sheet Harbour , starting in 1818 because of a white , flat rock that looks like a sheet , named Sheet Rock ; the rock is located at the entrance of the harbour . Sheet Harbour was known as Cambell Town for about two decades , after which this name fell into disuse and became known by its present name . 
 Around 1863 , a sawmill was built at the tide head of the East River Sheet Harbour , by <unk> and McFarlane , a lumber company . However , they did not succeed financially , and they dissolved a few years later . 
 In October 1885 , the Halifax Wood Fibre Company built the first sulphide pulp mill in Canada , which at the time was the Dominion of Canada , at East River , Sheet Harbour . Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866 , the news had traveled to William Chisholm , who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax . He decided to try the sulphite method out for himself at the head of the East River . He had 60 @,@ 000 acres ( 24 @,@ 281 hectares , or 242 km2 ) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers . The mill closed in January 1891 , due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States . The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community . 
 In 1922 , a ground @-@ wood pulp mill , owned by the American Pulp and Wrapping Paper Co. of Albany , began operation on the West River at the head of the Northwest Arm of Sheet Harbour . They had purchased it from Rhodes and Currie , the previous owners who were a lumber company . It produced its first ground @-@ wood pulp on October 5 , 1925 . It remained in operation until it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971 . 
 A steel arch bridge was built in the 1950s over the Northeast Arm . It was named the East River Bridge . It was replaced by a new bridge in December 2015 . 
 = = Industry = = 
 The economy of Sheet Harbour is primarily based on fishery and forestry , as well as tourism , to a lesser extent . 
 Sheet Harbour has a Chamber of Commerce . The <unk> was formed more than 75 years ago , in 1935 , and were formerly known as the Sheet Harbour Board of Trade . They comprise 25 of the businesses in Sheet Harbour and they also operate a Visitor Information Centre at the MacPhee House , situated on the site of the ground @-@ wood pulp mill just east of the West River Bridge , where Trunk 7 crosses the West River at the entrance to Sheet Harbour . There is a community museum at the MacPhee House and they have a collection interpreting " Life before plastic " . 
 In the 1990s , the Government of Nova Scotia built a common user deep water dock and industrial park just west of Sheet Harbour , named the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port . It was purchased by and is currently operated by the Halifax Port Authority . It currently ships wood chips for the pulp industry and imports wind turbine segments , which are then transported across Nova Scotia and to the rest of North America . The port was used to service the Sable Offshore Energy Project with natural gas pipes processed at coating plant therefore making them suitable for placement on the ocean floor . The port is the closest marine terminal to the fields , at a distance of 240 kilometres ( 150 mi ) . It is also approximately 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) west of the Great Circle Route , a major shipping lane between North America and Europe . The docking area is 152 metres ( 499 ft ) long and 36 @.@ 5 metres ( 120 ft ) wide . It also has 10 @.@ 3 metres ( 34 ft ) of draft , which is connected to a concrete pad .

 The community is situated at the junction of Route 374 and Route 224 with Trunk 7 . The community has sidewalks that run from West River Bridge to East River Bridge , through the main part of Sheet Harbour . They were opened in 2010 , and cost $ 2 @,@ 895 @,@ 040 ( US $ 2 @,@ 204 @,@ 569 @.@ 46 ) . 
 = = = 2014 – 15 East River Bridge replacement = = = 
 A new bridge was built across the Northeast Arm from September 2014 to December 2015 , to replace the East River Bridge . 
 The bridge was built because the previous bridge , built in 1956 , was nearing the end of its life span . The Nova Scotia Government had proposed minor repairs , but it was decided by the N.S. Government that an entirely new bridge would be more cost @-@ effective . The new bridge was designed , unlike its predecessor , without large , overhead steel arches , because it would have been twice as costly to build . The new bridge was constructed on the same site as the old bridge 's predecessor which was constructed just south of the East River Bridge in 1907 . 
 The bridge cost $ 19 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( US $ 14 @,@ 671 @,@ 644 ) to build and construction began in September 2014 . The contractor , Dexter Construction , poured 2 @,@ 260 cubic metres ( 79 @,@ 811 cubic feet ) of concrete over 650 @,@ 000 kg ( 1 @,@ 430 @,@ 000 lb ) of rebar . The new bridge relies on two pillars set in the granite below the Northeast Arm . When it was near completion in December 2015 , a deck , along with railings and sidewalks , were laid . 
 Construction was completed and the bridge was opened on 17 December 2015 to pedestrians and opened the next day to traffic . 
 There were also a few road modifications on the Sheet Harbour side of the bridge as a result of the new bridge . Trunk 7 was aligned with what was Riverside Drive , which is now nonexistent . Church Point Road and Pool Road were slightly modified . The access road to Sheet Harbour Consolidated School and Duncan MacMillan High School was slightly modified . Sprott Lane , a minor loop , was extended along a part of the old Trunk 7 for a few households . 
 Shortly after the new bridge was opened , the old East River Bridge was closed and is currently being demolished as of July 2016 . Demolition is expected to be complete in mid @-@ late 2016 .

Twelve years later , the corps was reformed on 1 February 1985 and is still active today . They have earned fame by winning the Strathcona cup five times . The Strathcona cup is an award given to the best performing cadet corps in Nova Scotia . 
 Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital is a hospital located in Sheet Harbour . Construction began in 1947 , and was opened on May 24 , 1949 . It is owned and operated by the Capital District Health Authority , which amalgamated in to the Nova Scotia Health Authority in 2015 . It has sixteen beds for patients . There is a cenotaph and gardens in front of the site where Duncan MacMillan Nursing Home ( DMNH ) once stood . The hospital offers quite a few services .

 = = = Education = = = 
 There are two schools in Sheet Harbour : Sheet Harbour Consolidated School ( SHCS ) and Duncan MacMillan High School ( DMHS ) . 
 SHCS is a feeder school of DMHS . When students graduate from SHCS , they move on to DMHS . In 2015 , there was 95 students enrolled in the school . The school offers Canadian French . SHCS teaches grades primary through six . The school was built in 1957 . 
 DMHS is the only high school in the Sheet Harbour area . Consequently , it has three feeder schools : SHCS and Lakefront Consolidated School ( LCS ) , which is located in Tangier , and Eastern Consolidated School ( ECS ) , which is located in Moser River . But , as of 2016 , ECS is closed , due to zero student enrollment . The school offers Integrated French for all grades . DMHS teaches grades seven through 12 . There was 174 students enrolled in the school in 2015 . The school was built in 1963 . 
 Since early 2013 , a plan has been in the works for the Halifax Regional School Board to close and possibly demolish all three of the DMHS feeder schools and replace them with a larger , more modern grade primary @-@ 12 school somewhere in Sheet Harbour . This new school would teach about 350 students and would serve a large area around Sheet Harbour . On 26 April 2016 , the site for the project was chosen . The new school will be built on the site that Duncan MacMillan High School occupies . A school steering team will be established thereafter and will cooperate with work with the design team for the new school , the Halifax Regional School Board and two government departments ; the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal and the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development for the design and planning phases .

From the southern terminus , route runs west through residential areas of Long Neck before heading north through rural areas with some development . DE 23 is concurrent with DE 5 between the DE 24 intersection in Long Neck and Fairmount . It is also concurrent with DE 24 Alternate ( DE 24 Alt . ) between Hollymount and the DE 1D intersection in Five Points . The road originally existed as an unnumbered road except along the DE 5 concurrency , becoming fully paved by 1970 . The DE 23 designation was assigned by 1994 .

 DE 23 begins at a boat ramp parking lot at Massey 's Landing in Long Neck , near the confluence of the Rehoboth Bay and the Indian River Bay . From here , the route heads west on two @-@ lane undivided Long Neck Road , passing through a mix of residential areas and marshland between Rehoboth Bay to the north and Indian River Bay to the south . The road winds west through homes , commercial development , and a few farms . Farther west , DE 23 comes to an intersection with DE 5 / DE 24 . At this intersection , the name changes to Indian Mission Road , and DE 23 begins a concurrency with DE 5 .

 " Lord of the Flies " is the fifth episode of the ninth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , and the show 's 187th episode overall . It first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on December 16 , 2001 , and was subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on BBC Two . The episode was written by Thomas Schnauz , and was directed by Kim Manners . The episode is a " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week " episode , a stand @-@ alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology , or overarching fictional history , of The X @-@ Files . " Lord of the Flies " earned a Nielsen household rating of 6 @.@ 2 , and was watched by 9 @.@ 9 million viewers . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics , with many critical of the episode 's reliance on humor . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . In this episode , an amateur stunt performer is killed while performing a daring act for a local cable reality show , Scully , Doggett and Reyes discover that the culprit was apparently a swarm of killer flies hidden in the victim 's brain . 
 " Lord of the Flies " marked a return of comedic episodes to the series . Due to this , Patrick had issues with his acting because , initially , he felt the entry was too foolish . The aggressiveness of flies in the episode was inspired by the actual habits of Australian blow flies . The episode 's title , " Lord of the Flies " , is an English translation for the name of the semitic demon Beelzebub , and may be a reference to the classic novel Lord of the Flies by William Golding . In addition , the episode makes several references to musician Syd Barrett , the original singer and guitarist for Pink Floyd .

 A group of teenagers , led by " Sky Commander Winky " ( Aaron Paul ) , film one of their friends , nicknamed " Cap 'n Dare " ( played by Branden Williams ) , doing stunts for a cable TV show called Dumbass . The last stunt of which involves a ramp @-@ jump in a shopping cart . During the stunt , Dare veers off and falls out of the cart and is found dead after part of his skull collapses . The local coroner calls in John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) to investigate the death . During the autopsy , flies erupt from Dare 's eye sockets . Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) examines the body and finds that the insects had fed on Dare 's brain to such a degree that it simply collapsed . 
 At a local high school , Winky and his brother film a memorial service for Dare , much to the annoyance of his girlfriend Natalie . The teens harass Dylan <unk> , the son of the principal and a social outcast . Doggett and Reyes arrive at the school to talk to Winky . During their interview , body lice mysteriously attack him and bite " Dumbass " into his flesh . While watching the Dumbass recordings , Doggett notices that Dylan was at each of the stunts and decides to question him . While the two agents talk to Dylan , his mother appears and tries to stop the questioning . During the proceedings , Dylan becomes covered in flies ; subsequently , Reyes starts to believe that Dylan is behind the attack . The agents take a tissue soaked with Dylan 's sweat back for Scully to analyze . The results show that Dylan 's body fluids contain a high number of insect pheromones . 
 That night , Natalie sneaks into Dylan 's house . When they kiss , something apparently cuts her mouth , causing her to leave in tears . Dare 's friends , who believe Dylan is responsible for his death , pull up moments later and abduct him . During the drive , an insect like protrusion comes out of Dylan 's mouth and sprays webbing everywhere , causing the car to flip and crash . Doggett and Reyes arrive at the scene , and are told that Dylan chewed his way out the back window . Meanwhile , Scully and a bug specialist search Dylan 's home . Scully leaves to help Reyes find the teenager while the specialist stays behind ; the specialist is subsequently attacked by Dylan 's mother . 
 Reyes tracks down Natalie , but Reyes is attacked and cocooned by Dylan . Dylan 's mother approaches him , and tells him that he is not like other kids and never will be . Doggett arrives at the girl 's home and finds Reyes and Natalie alive . Dylan and his mother , however , are nowhere to be found . A subsequent search of the <unk> home reveals other bodies , including the bug specialist , cocooned but survived , and Dylan 's father , who supposedly ran off years earlier . After leaving with his mother , Dylan sends Natalie one last message in the form of fireflies : " I love you . "

 The episode was written by Thomas Schnauz , and was directed by Kim Manners . It was Schnauz 's first writing credit , and Manner 's second directing credit for the season . The episode marked a return of " the comedy episode " for the series . According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X @-@ Files , the episode " revisit [ s ] [ the ] themes of genetic grafting experiments from ' Travelers ' in a humorous context . " Series co @-@ star Robert Patrick had a difficult time with the episode ; he later explained , " I couldn 't deal with some of the material . As an actor , I found some of it to be a little silly . " Accordingly , Manners helped Patrick traverse the script , an action that helped him achieve the desired delivery for his lines . 
 A few of the flies on the dead body of " Cap 'n Dare " were real , but the rest were created via CGI , according to special effects supervisors John Wash . The eye of the body was opened by a cable . Hank Harris , the boy who played Dylan , wore a suit made of rubber for the swarming scene . 30 @,@ 000 live flies were then " dumped " onto him during filming . The opening for the episode was filmed at Cheviot Hills Park in Los Angeles . The site had previously been used for various shots in the sixth season episode " The Unnatural " and the eighth season episode " Three Words " . Garfield High School in Sherman Oaks , California , stood in for Grant High School . During filming breaks , Robert Patrick spent his time listening to his brother Richard Patrick 's industrial rock band , Filter . 
 The aggressiveness of flies in the episode was inspired by the actual habits of Australian blow flies . The episode 's title , " Lord of the Flies " , is an English translation for the name of the semitic demon Beelzebub . The name was also used as the title for 1954 novel of the same name by British author William Golding . The episode makes several references to Syd Barrett . Barrett was the original singer , songwriter , and lead guitarist for British band Pink Floyd . Two of his songs , " No Good Trying " and " Terrapin " , are featured in the episode .

John Keegan from Critical Myth wrote that the episode " ranks right in the mediocre range " and awarded it a 5 out of 10 . He noted , " Overall , this episode did very little for me . I ’ m sure that the writing staff could have come up with something better than a bad sixth season plot when the idea of a humorous ninth season episode came to the table . Is there any hope that there might be a truly memorable episode where Doggett is allowed to be amused ? " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five .

Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson complained that " The X @-@ Files is draining the trough of teenage angst again " . M.A. Crang , in his book Denying the Truth : Revisiting The X @-@ Files after 9 / 11 , felt that the teaser " intrigues for a moment " , but that the competing elements of " quirky humour , body horror and teen love story quickly sink this disappointing outing .

 = Hurricane Alex ( 2010 ) = 
 Hurricane Alex was a rare June hurricane and the first tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season . Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June 25 , 2010 , it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm . After entering the Gulf of Mexico , Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development . Early on June 30 , the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico , the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995 , and the storm rapidly intensified just off the coast of Tamaulipas . Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . 
 Alex caused the deaths of at least 51 people along its path , and produced over $ 1 @.@ 8 billion ( 2010 USD ) in damage . The precursor of the hurricane produced substantial rainfall across the Greater Antilles , causing one death in the Dominican Republic . Fourteen people were killed in Central America as a result of flooding during the first landfall of Alex . In Mexico , the storm 's outer rainbands killed three people in Acapulco , one person in Oaxaca , and another in Chiapas . At its final landfall , Alex caused at least fifteen deaths in Nuevo León , eight in Coahuila , six in Guanajuato , and one in both Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosí ; an additional twenty persons were reported missing . 
 Alex triggered widespread power outages throughout northeastern Mexico and southern Texas . Damage was most evident in the Monterrey metropolitan area , which faced what Nuevo León governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz described as , " the worst weather phenomenon in its history . " Following Alex 's final landfall , a state of emergency was declared for most of Nuevo León , portions of Tamaulipas , and Texas . Widespread flooding from the storm affected 500 @,@ 000 people throughout northeast Mexico , and ruined over 200 @,@ 000 hectares ( 500 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops in the region , equivalent to 11 % of the region 's total farmland .

 The weather system from which Hurricane Alex developed was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) on June 17 , 2010 . Over the next few days , most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) first mentioned it as a candidate for tropical cyclone formation on June 20 , while it was crossing the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea ; at the time , some upper @-@ level wind shear was present , leading to conditions only marginally favorable for development . The system moved through the Caribbean , and on June 21 , it developed to the extent that the NHC assessed a 50 % chance of development into a tropical depression within 48 hours . The next day , however , the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles , although the upper @-@ level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment . 
 On June 24 , a low @-@ level circulation had gradually become better established to the south of Jamaica , although it was displaced from its poorly organized convection . By 1800 UTC , a surface low @-@ pressure area had formed about 105 miles ( 165 km ) to the northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios , Nicaragua , but due to a lack of persistent thunderstorm activity , it was not yet considered a tropical cyclone . Later that day , convection increased over the center of circulation , and atmospheric pressures dropped across the region . Late on June 25 , Hurricane Hunters verified the development of a surface low pressure area , which , combined with the increase of thunderstorm activity , indicated the system was a tropical depression . Accordingly , the cyclone was classified as Tropical Depression One at 2200 UTC , while located about 345 miles ( 555 km ) to the east @-@ southeast of Chetumal , Quintana Roo . After the end of the hurricane season , the National Hurricane Center revised their analysis and estimated that the system had actually become a tropical depression at around 1800 UTC . At the time of its formation , the depression was moving to the west @-@ northwest , steered by a high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico . An anticyclone positioned over the storm created an environment of minimal wind shear , and the depression quickly intensified . At 0900 UTC on June 26 , it obtained tropical storm status and was given the name Alex . 
 As Tropical Storm Alex progressed through the western Caribbean Sea towards the Yucatán Peninsula , it developed a large field of clouds accompanied by well @-@ established outflow throughout its circulation . Its inner structure was initially disorganized , although by late on June 26 , it became better defined . At about 2100 UTC , as the tropical storm approached the Belize coast , a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) ; early on June 27 , Alex made landfall just north of Belize City at this intensity . Upon moving ashore , an area of convection increased over the center , and the convection initially became better defined as it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula . While most tropical cyclones weaken and become disorganized after landfall , Alex seemed to become stronger when viewed on radar and satellite imagery — the National Hurricane Center noted in one of its forecast discussions that the cyclone 's structure more closely resembled a hurricane than a deteriorating storm . Still , after enough time over land , convective activity markedly decreased , and Alex weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the peninsula 's western coastline . Late on June 27 , the depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with a large overall convective structure but little thunderstorm activity near the center due to the interaction with land . 
 When Alex was still located over the Yucatán Peninsula , the NHC remarked upon the potential for significant strengthening . Because of low wind shear and very warm water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico , the possibility existed that Alex could intensify into a major hurricane — a Category 3 storm on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale — before its next landfall . Early on June 28 , thunderstorm activity had reformed over the center , and the depression re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm . For the next day , the combination of dry air , increasing wind shear and slightly cooler water temperatures prevented significant convection from developing over the center . At the same time , Alex was moving slowly off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula , and the environment 's conditions became more favorable for intensification as the tropical storm tracked away from the coast . The circulation envelope of Alex remained very large , and by June 29 , the storm 's rainbands covered the entire western half of the Gulf of Mexico ; rainfall was reported along the Texas and Louisiana coasts , even while the center was still several hundred miles offshore . The tropical storm continued to strengthen , and based on reports from Hurricane Hunters , it is estimated that Alex attained hurricane status at 0300 UTC on June 30 , about 255 miles ( 415 km ) southeast of Brownsville , Texas . 
 Upon becoming a hurricane , Alex was located in a moist , low shear environment , which led to steady intensification on June 30 . The pressure continued to fall — a sign of an intensifying cyclone — with a more rapid drop occurring that afternoon and evening . The hurricane strengthened into a Category 2 storm late on June 30 as it approached the northeastern Mexican coast . At 0200 UTC on July 1 , Alex made landfall at peak strength , with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , gusts of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) and an unusually low central pressure of 947 millibars ( 28 @.@ 0 inHg ) in the municipality of Soto la Marina in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas . After the storm , the National Hurricane Center revised the landfall intensity estimate , showing Alex was even stronger when it struck the Mexican coast , with sustained winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) and a central pressure of 946 millibars ( 27 @.@ 9 inHg ) . Several hours after moving ashore , the storm weakened to Category 1 status , and its structure began to deteriorate . However , deep convection persisted around the center . By 1200 UTC , Alex had weakened into a tropical storm ; by 0000 UTC July 2 , the Sierra Madre Oriental disrupted Alex 's core , causing the storm to weaken into a tropical depression and dissipate over San Luis Potosí . However , the interaction with the mountain range caused orographic lift on the eastern side of the storm after the center of circulation had ceased to exist , producing torrential rainfall throughout northern and central Mexico . Following the dissipation of Alex , divergence at the 200 mb atmospheric pressure level ( approximately at 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) of altitude ) , a ridge of high pressure located over southern Texas , and Alex 's residual moisture interacted to produce intense convection over Nuevo León , Tamaulipas and Coahuila for the next 72 hours .

 Immediately after the storm formed on June 25 , a tropical storm warning was issued for the entire east coast of Quintana Roo on Mexico 's Yucatán Peninsula . Shortly thereafter , the tropical storm warning was extended to include the east coast of Belize . Late on June 25 , the Government of Honduras issued a tropical storm warning for the islands of <unk> , Guanaja and Utila . A tropical storm watch was also issued from Limón to the border with Guatemala .

 As Alex neared hurricane strength on the evening of June 28 , a hurricane warning was issued for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande . The Mexican government also issued a hurricane warning from the Rio Grande south to La Cruz . A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal Texas from Baffin Bay northward to Port O 'Connor . Governor of Texas Rick Perry declared a state of disaster in 19 counties and ordered the deployment of Texas Military Forces personnel ( including 80 citizen @-@ soldiers of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade ) to the Rio Grande Valley . President Barack Obama also declared a state of emergency , freeing federal funds for 25 counties in Texas . 
 On June 29 , authorities began evacuations of residents of coastal areas in the Tamaulipas municipalities of Soto la Marina , Matamoros and San Fernando municipalities . On June 30 , the state 's civil defense agency and education secretary announced that schools would be closed throughout the state during the storm . Thirteen shelters were opened in Reynosa , twenty @-@ two in Matamoros , and ten in San Fernando ; a total of 3 @,@ 000 people sought protection from the storm in the three municipalities . Throughout the state , 20 @,@ 000 people were asked to evacuate to safer areas . Nuevo León schools were also ordered to be closed for at least 24 hours ; the Universidad <unk> , Universidad de Monterrey and Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León followed suit . In Monterrey , mandatory evacuations alongside the Santa Catarina River were ordered , as well as the evacuation of 5 @,@ 000 families in the highlands of the city . Throughout the state , a total of 90 shelters were opened . Coahuila did not close its schools , expecting Alex to reach the state as a tropical depression or weaker , but asked its schools to not take attendance . 
 Prior to Alex making landfall , the Brownsville , Texas National Weather Service issued a flood watch for the southernmost region of the state . The storm was expected to produce heavy rainfall for up to 18 hours , which had the potential to cause significant flooding in poor drainage areas , especially those flooded by Hurricane Dolly in 2008 . Officials opened hurricane shelters , and voluntary evacuations were put into place for South Padre Island ; at least 1 @,@ 000 people sought shelter in Cameron and Hidalgo counties .

 The tropical wave from which Alex developed produced rainfall across the Greater Antilles in the central Caribbean Sea . In the Dominican Republic , the rainfall triggered flooding that prompted the evacuations of over 3 @,@ 000 people , mostly due to swollen rivers . In the capital city of Santo Domingo , 160 houses were flooded , and one person was killed by the storm ; one additional person was reported missing . In nearby San Juan de la <unk> , more than 500 homes were inundated . In neighboring Haiti , minor flooding was reported in Gonaïves . The Jamaica Meteorological Service issued a flash flood warning for its entire island in response to the tropical wave producing thunderstorms across the nation . 
 Fourteen people were killed in Central America as a result of flooding related to Alex : six in Nicaragua , six in El Salvador , and two in Guatemala . In El Salvador , the national chapter of the Red Cross evacuated over 150 families from La Paz and <unk> departments . The El Salvador government reported nine injuries , and 5 @,@ 000 people in the country evacuated their residences ; the majority of the evacuees was temporarily relocated to 55 shelters . Alex inflicted damage to 349 homes , 31 schools and 10 bridges , and 27 highways were compromised or blocked . In Guatemala , 350 homes and eight highways were damaged , affecting 9 @,@ 000 people ; 2 @,@ 000 sought shelter in the country . A landslide was reported in a village in Santa Lucía Utatlán , along with flooding in Flores . Corn , bean , and potato crops were damaged in <unk> , San Marcos and Jutiapa departments . The National Emergency Management Organization of Belize reported that property damage in the country was minimal .

 According to the Mexican government , Alex stopped the production of 420 @,@ 000 barrels ( 67 @,@ 000 m3 ) of oil per day from the Gulf of Mexico , which corresponds to a quarter of the country 's total oil production . Pemex evacuated 66 personnel from oil rigs offshore of Tamaulipas and Veracruz , Petrobras evacuated its oil rig in the Gulf , while Royal Dutch Shell evacuated 930 personnel from its rigs in the area . In total , six rigs and 69 production platforms faced evacuations , causing 21 % of U.S. Gulf oil output and 14 % of U.S. Gulf natural @-@ gas flows to remain offline . 
 The storm was expected to impact operations regarding the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill , with both containment and cleanup operations being affected by repercussions from the storm ( such as wave action and wind direction ) . Although Alex stayed relatively away from the site , the storm caused BP to delay plans to increase oil capture from the leak by a week . <unk> from the spill as large as apples washed onshore around Grand Isle , as well as other parts of Louisiana , Alabama and Florida , from high storm tides created by the hurricane .

 In Chiapas , one person from Guatemala died and four others were injured when their bus rolled over as it traveled over a damaged highway . The state 's civil defense system reported that 984 families from 17 municipalities were evacuated to shelters , and that Alex 's torrential rainfall also produced 23 landslides in six counties of the state . On June 30 , a mudslide knocked down a tree onto a 115 @-@ kV transmission line near El <unk> , causing 82 cities and towns in the municipalities of <unk> and Villa Corzo to lose power ; 32 @,@ 000 residents were left without electricity from this outage alone . Power was restored the same evening . In Yucatán , a boat carrying seven passengers capsized ; all were eventually rescued . In Campeche , 937 dwellings suffered minor damage as a result of the storm . 
 Prior to its second landfall , Alex caused one death in the state of Oaxaca when a wall collapsed on a dwelling in San Juan Chapultepec , killing the woman who was sleeping inside . Near San Francisco <unk> , the <unk> river breached its banks , flooding 1 @,@ 000 homes . Farther upstream , in Reforma de Pineda , over 100 families were affected by the river 's rise , which flooded their homes with 3 @.@ 3 ft ( 1 m ) of water . Overall , 3 @,@ 500 families were affected by the storm in the state . 
 The outer rainbands of Alex caused three deaths in Acapulco , Guerrero , after a retaining wall collapsed over the occupants of an improvised shack in a vacant lot . The investigation that followed found that the wall had been built without structural enforcements , and that the torrential rainfall had weakened the wall 's foundation .

 The storm 's most significant effect in the region was excessive rainfall , which was reported throughout the region . In Tamaulipas , between 3 @.@ 829 to 12 @.@ 421 in ( 97 @.@ 25 to 315 @.@ 5 mm ) of precipitation were reported at weather stations statewide . In Nuevo León , an average of 9 @.@ 5 in ( 242 mm ) of rain was reported statewide up to July 1 . The <unk> at <unk> reported that a total of 35 in ( 890 mm ) of rainfall were recorded ; in Arroyo Seco , in San Pedro Garza García , a total of 23 @.@ 1 in ( 588 mm ) of precipitation was recorded between June 29 and 6 a.m. on July 1 . Other rainfall stations in Monterrey recorded between 14 @.@ 163 in ( 359 @.@ 75 mm ) and 24 @.@ 4 in ( 619 mm ) of rain , while Santa Catarina recorded 23 @.@ 297 in ( 591 @.@ 75 mm ) of precipitation . The Comisión Nacional del Agua ( CNA ) noted that the storm rainfall totals greatly exceed the totals produced by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 , which only produced 11 in ( 280 mm ) of rain in the city . 
 The historic rainfall caused several dams to fill throughout northeast Mexico . In Nuevo León , due to the heavy rainfall , CNA also began water discharges of 25 @,@ 200 cubic feet per second ( 713 m3 / s ) from the La Boca Dam in Santiago , 58 @,@ 200 cu ft / s ( 1 @,@ 648 m3 / s ) from Cerro Prieto in Linares , and 109 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 3 @,@ 080 m3 / s ) from Cuchillo Dam in China ; the dams were at 98 % , 114 % , and 124 % of operating maximum capacity , respectively . Cuchillo Dam saw water inflows of 145 @,@ 400 cu ft / s ( 4 @,@ 118 m3 / s ) . The water releases from these dams raised a state of alert in Tamaulipas , which was slated to receive the discharged water . In Coahuila , the rainfall caused La <unk> Dam to release 35 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 1 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) of water into the Rio Grande , and Amistad Dam to reach 119 % of normal operating capacity . In the case of the latter dam , the excess storage in Amistad Lake sparked fears of flooding in downstream municipalities , although the possibility of overtopping of the dam was discarded by the Mexican section of the International Boundary and Water Commission . However , contingency plans were put in place to prepare for the crest of the Sabinas River , a tributary of the Rio Grande , and the subsequent crest on the Rio Grande itself , which was expected to carry at least 140 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 4 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) due to additional inflows from other tributaries . At one point , the Rio Grande was clocked at 195 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 5 @,@ 530 m3 / s ) due to its many flooded tributaries . The river 's rise forced the evacuation of 40 families in Piedras Negras , and required the closure of the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge and Colombia – Solidarity International Bridge between Nuevo Laredo , Tamaulipas and Laredo , Texas on July 8 . The bridges were expected to be closed until at least July 10 . The rise of the Escondido River forced the evacuation of 1 @,@ 000 families in Villa de Fuente , as the river rose to carry 23 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 650 m3 / s ) through the town . 
 The rainfall also caused Venustiano Carranza Dam in Coahuila to fill completely ; the large water pressure in the dam forced the dam 's gates shut , and cranes were employed to open them . The rest of the gates were unable to be opened due to lack of electrical power , sparking fears of a potential dam overtopping or rupture . The municipality of Anáhuac in Nuevo León was evacuated after reports early on July 6 that the dam had overtopped ; Anáhuac 's municipal president stated that the flood could cause the " total destruction " of the city . On July 7 , as water releases from the dam were increased to 120 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 3 @,@ 300 m3 / s ) , the town was reported to be 9 @.@ 8 ft ( 3 m ) underwater , with more discharge expected . Personnel from the Mexican Army and the city 's prison population were evacuated from Anáhuac that same day . In San Luis Potosí , the rainfall from Alex was beneficial , as it caused increases in dam water levels of up to 20 % in very dry areas . 
 = = = = Tamaulipas = = = = 
 Along the coast , 13 ft ( 4 m ) waves were reported when the storm came ashore . Following the hurricane 's landfall in Tamaulipas , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man was rescued from a storm drain . 60 @,@ 000 people in San Fernando lost power , as did all of Ciudad Victoria , the capital of the state . Throughout the state , 256 @,@ 000 people were left without electricity . Heavy winds and rainfall knocked down billboards and trees in the capital , but no injuries were reported in the city . The storm dropped 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of rainfall in Matamoros , flooding 120 colonias , and leaving six of the 120 underwater . About 400 neighborhoods of Matamoros , comprising 80 % of the city , were flooded . Some areas of the city were under 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water , forcing 4 @,@ 000 people to shelters . In Reynosa , 80 colonias were flooded , and 15 trees were uprooted ; in Río Bravo , seven neighborhoods were flooded . In Nuevo Laredo , three young persons were rescued from a flooded arroyo . The San Fernando River also breached its banks , flooding communities in San Fernando and Méndez . The overflow of the Rio Grande following water discharges from Nuevo León isolated two communities in Miguel Alemán . One death was reported in the state on July 7 when a man died while trying to cross a flooded river . 
 Throughout the state , the storm and resultant floods damaged at least 6 @,@ 000 homes , 202 schools , and 500 businesses . Additionally , 28 roadways and bridges were damaged , and left over 193 @,@ 000 power consumers lost electric service . Property damage was placed at $ 1 @.@ 084 billion ( 2010 MXN ; 83 @.@ 8 million USD ) in the 19 municipalities of the state that were declared federal disaster areas .

 In Nuevo León , fifteen people were confirmed to have died : one bricklayer who died after a housing unit under construction collapsed on top of him ; two men and a woman who died after their vehicle rolled over and crashed into a semi @-@ trailer truck due to the intense rainfall ; a 25 @-@ year @-@ old who was swept away by swift currents and pinned against a fence ; an elderly man who died after a wall toppled over him , a woman who died after a large boulder from a rock slide fell on her home , and a young man who fell onto the Arroyo Topo Chico . Eight more bodies were found after floodwaters began receding , although one is believed to have been washed away from a cemetery . Twenty people in Nuevo León were reported missing . 
 According to the Comisión Federal de <unk> , 4 @,@ 000 customers lost electric power in the Monterrey metropolitan area , as did 61 @,@ 000 people statewide . 18 wells lost power , leaving 110 @,@ 000 without water service in the municipalities of Santa Catarina and García . Heavy flooding occurred along the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey , normally a dry river bed that flows into the Rio Grande , causing it to reach a record flow of 88 @,@ 000 cu ft / s ( 2 @,@ 500 m3 / s ) . The flooded stream washed away multiple parked vehicles , a popular flea market , and sport facilities built within a riverside greenway . The Santa Catarina River also destroyed about 45 kilometres ( 28 mi ) of Monterrey 's main arterial streets . Multiple washouts caused the closure of the divided highway between Monterrey and Saltillo , Coahuila . In San Nicolás de los Garza , the Arroyo Topo Chico exceeded its banks , forcing multiple street closures . An explosion and fire occurred on a bridge in the Guadalupe municipality when a transformer fell on an old gas pipe . No injuries were reported due to the fire . In Linares , the rainfall from Alex 's remnants caused a wing of the municipal townhouse , which was built in 1896 , to collapse . The building was listed as a protected historic building . A bridge on the <unk> River collapsed in Montemorelos , rupturing a 24 @-@ inch oil pipeline in the process . However , the valves on both ends of the pipeline section were closed , minimizing the leak over the river , and the leak was not expected to adversely impact drinking water supplies in El Cuchillo Dam . Hurricane Alex affected the infrastructure of 1 @,@ 077 schools in the state , 60 of which were severely damaged and 552 held intermediate damage . Nationwide disruption in Internet connection and cell phone services was caused by damage to optical fibers , backbone nodes and telephonic central stations in Monterrey . Additionally , Telefónica reported damage to its network in Monterrey and Saltillo , causing intermittent unavailability of telecommunication services . Preliminary estimates of the damage in the state rose to $ 10 billion ( 2010 MXN ; $ 762 million USD ) ; final damage estimates released on August 5 totaled $ 16 @.@ 9 billion ( 2010 MXN ; 1 @.@ 35 billion USD ) statewide .

 In Coahuila , rainfall from Alex 's remnants caused a small dam in an <unk> in Castaños to overtop , forcing the evacuation of 50 people in the municipality 's seat . The ensuing flood rose 3 @.@ 3 ft ( 1 m ) and damaged 15 homes . The coal @-@ producing region of the state was left isolated after the Álamos River broke its banks . Hundreds of residents in Nueva Rosita and Sabinas were evacuated ; in the latter case , the Sabinas River flooded to become 980 ft ( 300 m ) in width , causing 400 – 500 homes to go underwater . Some bridges on Mexican Federal Highway 57 were covered in water . Thousands of citizens in Ciudad Acuña were evacuated when the Arroyo Las <unk> flooded after 40 in ( 1 @,@ 000 mm ) of rain fell on nearby mountain ranges . The flood damaged 1 @,@ 000 homes , damaging urban infrastructure , power , water and telecommunication services ; 500 people sought refuge in shelters . The loss of power caused 40 <unk> to suspend their activities , stopping 16 @,@ 000 workers . The rainfall caused damage in 15 municipalities of Coahuila , affecting 10 @,@ 000 people , and causing at least $ 1 billion ( 2010 MXN ; $ 76 million USD ) in damage in the state .

 In southern Texas , the feeder bands on the northern side of the hurricane began producing tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds throughout Cameron , Willacy and Kenedy Counties starting on June 30 . The highest reported sustained wind was of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) at the southeast tip of Port Isabel . The strongest gust occurred over the Queen Isabella Causeway , where a wind speed of 66 mph ( 106 km / h ) was measured . Sustained winds of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) and gusts of 53 mph ( 85 km / h ) were measured in Bayview . 
 The feeder bands also produced heavy rainfall , leading to flooding on South Padre Island . A storm surge of 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) was reported on the island , causing moderate beach erosion . However , more significant damage was avoided as the bulk of the 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) storm tide hit South Padre and Port Isabel at low tide . Nine tornadoes were confirmed to have touched down in the state in association with the storm , one of which overturned a mobile home . Other tornadoes caused mainly minimal damages to trees and shrubbery . About 9 @,@ 000 customers lost power throughout Texas . 
 Large amounts of precipitation fell throughout the Lower Rio Grande Valley , with 6 to 9 inches ( 150 to 230 mm ) of rainfall recorded throughout the region . Brownsville Airport had 6 @.@ 80 inches ( 173 mm ) of precipitation in a 36 @-@ hour period . The 5 @.@ 86 inches ( 149 mm ) of rain that fell alone on June 30 broke the daily rainfall record of 3 @.@ 80 inches ( 97 mm ) from 1995 . McAllen , Texas , measured 6 @.@ 66 inches ( 169 mm ) of rain on June 30 , which now constitutes the city 's wettest June day on record . In Houston , more rain fell on the first two days of July than the average rainfall for the entire month of July . Some parts of the city received nearly 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of rain over three days , causing scattered street flooding . 
 Flooding caused by the rainfall from the remnants of Alex caused the Rio Grande at Foster Ranch , in far western Texas , to exceed 31 ft ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) , well above the flood stage at 14 ft ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) and the record stage at 25 @.@ 9 ft ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) . Combined with the rainfall produced by Tropical Depression Two , the Rio Grande was under flood conditions for much of the month of July . About $ 10 million ( 2010 USD ) of agricultural damage was reported in Hidalgo County from Alex .

 Following the storm 's final landfall , Mexico 's Secretariat of National Defense deployed 800 troops to Nuevo León and Tamaulipas under Plan DN @-@ III @-@ E to help aid operations . The troops enforced mandatory evacuations of 3 @,@ 337 residents of San Fernando and Soto la Marina in Tamaulipas . Throughout Nuevo León , 60 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from their homes . In Tamaulipas , 263 @,@ 000 people were affected by Hurricane Alex , and 2 @,@ 260 homes were flooded . In Coahuila , 80 @,@ 000 were affected by Alex 's remnants , leaving 30 % of the municipalities of the state without communication with the outside world . 20 @,@ 000 were considered total losses , most of them in Sabinas . Approximately 500 @,@ 000 people were affected by floods throughout northeastern Mexico . 
 The Secretaría de <unk> declared a state of emergency in 21 of Nuevo León 's 51 municipalities , freeing federal disaster funds for use in aid operations . An additional 10 municipalities were placed under the state of emergency on July 8 . A similar declaration was made for 8 municipalities in Oaxaca , and for 14 municipalities in Tamaulipas ; the state of emergency in Tamaulipas was later expanded to 30 municipalities . Mexican President Felipe Calderón requested adding resources to the federal disaster fund , as the $ 3 billion ( 2010 MXN ; $ 235 million USD ) it held would not be sufficient to face the damage in Coahuila , Nuevo León and Tamaulipas . In the months following the storm , a total of $ 4 @.@ 8 billion ( 2010 MXN ; $ 375 million USD ) was released by the federal and state governments to aid in the reconstruction of the disaster areas in Nuevo León and Tamaulipas . In Texas , Governor Rick Perry activated the state 's search and rescue capabilities in Laredo and San Antonio . This activation was due to the flooding on the Rio Grande Valley , which was expected to worsen due to the approach of Tropical Depression Two to the area affected by Alex . 
 Even after its dissipation , Alex continued causing deaths throughout Mexico , particularly due to flooding . One death was reported in Tamaulipas and another one in San Luis Potosí ; another six were reported to have died in Guanajuato as a result of Alex . In Coahuila , eight people died after a plane crashed while surveying the water discharges from dams in the state ; the Coahuila secretary of public works and the municipal president of Piedras Negras were among the victims .

 The storm caused severe devastation in Nuevo León , and in particular throughout the Monterrey metropolitan area . State governor Rodrigo Medina de la Cruz noted that the city of Monterrey had " collapsed due to the worst weather phenomenon in its history . " In the municipality of Santa Catarina alone , 50 @,@ 000 people were affected , with property damage being estimated at $ 1 @.@ 2 billion ( 2010 MXN ; 93 @.@ 5 million USD ) . Residents from three colonias in García had to be permanently relocated as 800 homes were destroyed ; the storm caused $ 900 million ( 2010 MXN ; 70 million USD ) in damage in the municipality . The flooding Santa Catarina River destroyed four bridges in Monterrey ; at least 60 bridges were damaged statewide . Governor Medina also announced on July 3 the allocation of $ 1 @.@ 4 billion ( 2010 MXN ; $ 107 million USD ) for repairs to Monterrey 's arterial streets . Municipalities in the metropolitan area used contraflow during part of the day to re @-@ establish traffic in sections where the arterial streets bordering the Santa Catarina River were damaged only in one direction . The repairs to Monterrey 's main roadways were estimated to take up to three months to complete . 
 Railway traffic throughout the state was paralyzed , as some train bridges collapsed , and extensive damage was found in the track ballast in multiple rail lines . Kansas City Southern Railway reported it expected a net loss of five cents per share on its annual earnings due to the stoppage affecting its Mexican subsidiary . The company later reported a drop of $ 33 million ( 2010 USD ) in revenue due to hurricane damage . The damage to the railway infrastructure caused automotive part shortages throughout North America . General Motors was forced to cancel shifts at plants in Michigan , Missouri and Kansas . Ford also idled production in its Oakville , Ontario assembly plant , and suffered two @-@ week delays in U.S. deliveries of its Fiesta model due to the rail track damage . The damage to the road system paralyzed a route used by 40 % of the trade between the United States and Mexico , as 22 @,@ 000 trucks were stalled after damage to the Nuevo Laredo – Monterrey highway . 
 Alex destroyed the potable water infrastructure in portions of Nuevo León , causing widespread shortages of water . The damage to the water infrastructure was described as being of " unexpected magnitude , " with 160 @,@ 000 left without water a week after the storm made landfall . The standing water left following the rainfall caused concern of outbreaks of various diseases , including cholera . Consequently , the population was warned to boil or otherwise disinfect water to prevent disease .

 Roman <unk> Lyashenko ( May 1 , 1979 – July 7 , 2003 ) was a Russian ice hockey player . He played professionally in North America for the Dallas Stars and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , and also spent time with affiliate teams in the American Hockey League ( Utah Grizzlies and Hartford Wolfpack ) and the now @-@ defunct International Hockey League ( Michigan K @-@ Wings ) . Lyashenko also played professionally in Russia for Yaroslavl Torpedo before joining the Stars . He was drafted by the Stars in the second round ( 52nd overall ) of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft . 
 Lyashenko represented Russia internationally at both the junior and senior levels , capturing three medals ( gold , silver and bronze ) at the World Junior Championships and a silver medal at the World Championships . Lyashenko committed suicide while on vacation with his family on July 7 , 2003 . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 Lyashenko spent three seasons playing with Yaroslavl Torpedo in his home country of Russia . In 130 games , he recorded 22 goals and 22 assists for 44 points . While playing with Yaroslavl , he was selected in the second round ( 52nd overall ) of the 1997 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars . Leading up to the draft , scouts described him as a defensive forward with good character and leadership skills . He was considered an atypical Russian prospect due to his attention to defensive play . One source had him ranked as a first round prospect . He signed with the Stars in July 1999 . 
 Lyashenko made his NHL debut with the Dallas Stars during the 1999 – 2000 season , seeing action in 58 games , while recording six goals and six assists . He also spent time with the Stars ' International Hockey League ( IHL ) affiliate Michigan K @-@ Wings , notching five points in nine games . During his rookie season in the NHL , Lyashenko played center on the Stars second line , earning praise from coach Ken Hitchcock , " His game has risen beyond his years . He 's 20 years old in age only . He looks like a real good fit for us . " The Stars went to the Stanley Cup Finals that season , but lost to the New Jersey Devils . In the Stars ' first round playoff series against the Edmonton Oilers , Lyashenko scored the winning goal in the first game of the series . During the 2000 Western Conference final against the Colorado Avalanche , Lyashenko scored the series clinching goal in game seven . Lyashenko played in 16 playoff games for the Stars . During the playoffs in his rookie season , Hitchcock was happy with Lyashenko 's play , saying , " He 's an exceptional defensive player -- his offensive skills have improved as the season 's gone on . " 
 During the 2000 – 2001 season , Lyashenko again split time between the Stars and the Utah Grizzlies , who were the Stars ' new IHL affiliate . At the end of the season , Lyashenko had played 60 games with the Stars and recorded nine points . At the IHL level , he played in six games and had one assist . Lyashenko was popular with his teammates in Dallas , at one point his teammates lobbied Hitchcock to get him more playing time . 
 On March 12 , 2002 , Lyashenko and Martin Rucinsky were traded to the New York Rangers for Manny Malhotra and Barrett <unk> . During the 2001 – 2002 season , Lyashenko played for four different teams , the Stars and Rangers at the NHL level as well as the IHL 's Grizzlies , and the Hartford Wolfpack of the American Hockey League ( AHL ) . In his last season of professional hockey , Lyashenko played two games with the Rangers , and 71 with the Wolfpack . He put up the best numbers of his career in North America , with 23 goals and 35 assists . He played in the 2003 AHL All @-@ Star Game , despite having asked for a release midway through the season to return to Russia .

 = Presidential Council ( Benin ) = 
 The Presidential Council ( French : Conseil <unk> ) was a triumvirate system of government in the Republic of Dahomey ( present @-@ day Benin ) from 7 May 1970 until 26 October 1972 . The Presidential Council included Hubert Maga ( former president from 1960 @-@ 1963 ) , Justin Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin ( former prime minister from 1964 @-@ 1965 ) , and Sourou @-@ Migan Apithy ( former president from 1964 @-@ 1965 ) as equal members of a council which held all legislative and executive power in the state of Dahomey . 
 Following independence from France , the Republic of Dahomey saw a division of the country between different political / ethnic parties with one party representing the northern part of the country , one party representing the former Kingdom of Dahomey in the southwest , and one party representing Porto @-@ Novo in the southeast . The result was a highly unstable system of governance with the leaders of each of these different parties struggling with each other for power . Hubert Maga from the north was deposed in a military coup in 1963 which eventually appointed Apithy from Porto @-@ Novo and Ahomadégbé from the former kingdom of Dahomey as the divided rulers of the country . Ahomadégbé was eventually able to gain the support of Maga to gain the upper hand over Apithy and become the leader in the country only to be deposed two days later by the military . Five years of political instability , including multiple other military coups and a failed election eventually resulted in the 1970 Presidential election which largely divided the country and , when there was violence , the military annulled the results . In the political crisis that resulted , the military was able to get the three main candidates , Maga , Ahomadégbé , and Apithy to agree to form a Presidential Council with all three holding all executive and legislative authority . 
 In the charter of the Presidential Council , each of the three leaders would sit on a Presidential Council which would be tasked with approving all major policy decisions of the country . At the same time , each would get two years as the President of the country able to implement many of the ongoing tasks of managing the military and civil service in the country . The various ministerial positions would be divided between the three leaders ; however , the Ministry of the Interior and the Minister of the Army would be appointed by the sitting president . It was decided that Maga would be the first President from 1970 until 1972 , followed by Ahomadégbé until 1974 , and then Apithy until 1976 . One peaceful transition occurred with Hubert Maga giving power to Justin Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin on 7 May 1972 . However , stalled politics ensued with Maga and Apithy working to undermine Ahomadégbé 's ability to govern and the Presidential Council was ended on 26 October 1972 when a military coup led by Mathieu Kérékou assumed power and ruled the country until 1991 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The colony of French Dahomey was created as a part of French West Africa in 1904 . The colony was constructed of two coastal kingdoms with a long history of antagonism with one another ( Dahomey and Porto @-@ Novo ) with a large area to the north controlled by a variety of mostly Mahi and <unk> peoples . 
 After World War II , the colonies of French West Africa began a 15 year process towards independence . French Dahomey , like many other colonies , saw domestic political parties emerge in the mid @-@ 1950s . However , in contrast to many of the other colonies , political parties in French Dahomey did not become predominant through the whole colony , but largely adhered to the precolonial regions . In the northern part of the country , the Groupement <unk> du Nord and then the Rassemblement Démocratique du <unk> led by Hubert Maga were the most dominant party . In the area that was formerly the kingdom of Dahomey , the Union Démocratique du <unk> led by Justin Ahomadégbé @-@ Tomêtin became the most powerful party . And in Porto @-@ Novo , the Parti des <unk> <unk> led by Sourou @-@ Migan Apithy was the major party . Although there were some efforts by the various parties to become predominant throughout the colony , the division of the colony into three distinct spheres for the different parties had largely solidified by 1957 . Apithy was the major political leader in the colony , being elected twice to the French National Assembly in 1946 and 1951 . Maga was also elected in 1951 as the colony 's second representative to the National Assembly . 
 Apithy won the 1958 election in the colony to select the Premier who would guide the country to independence and lead until the first elections . 
 = = = Musical chairs ( 1960 @-@ 1965 ) = = = 
 Following independence in 1960 , Dahomey had its first elections in December . As a result of Fon ethnic identification with Ahomadégbé and perceived corruption and ineffectiveness of the Apithy administration , Ahomadégbé made large gains in the Porto @-@ Novo region traditionally aligned with Apithy . Apithy responded to this by making a parliamentary alliance with Maga which made Maga the first President of Dahomey and made Apithy the first Minister of Finance and then later the Vice President . To consolidate his power , Maga promoted a number of allies and people from the north through the new positions in the country 's civil service . In addition , he tried to weaken his ally 's political power by appointing Apithy to be the Ambassador of France while he was still the Vice President . Unfortunately giving political positions and channeling money to the north caused severe budgetary problems in the country which eventually led Maga to freeze wages for public employees leading to a general strike by unionists and students in October 1963 . On 28 October , Christophe Soglo , the Army Chief of Staff , removed Maga from power and created a new system of government with Apithy being appointed the head of state and Ahomadégbé the head of government . However , the division between these roles and the responsibilities between the two leaders was not clearly defined . During the 1963 coup , Maga and many of his inner circle were arrested and tried for mismanagement of public funds . 
 In the new arrangement , Apithy and <unk> wrestled constantly with one another for power . Seeing an opportunity to become the primary political power in the government , Ahomadégbé released Maga from prison and the coalition between the two leaders named Ahomadégbé the provisional president of the legislature on 27 November 1965 . Soglo grew increasingly concerned with the situation and believed that Ahomadégbé was forming an alliance with Soglo 's second in command ( Colonel Philippe Aho , who was a Fon like Ahomadégbé ) . The result was that Soglo suspended the constitution and removed Ahomadégbé from power on 29 November . Following the 1965 coup , Apithy , Ahomadégbé , and Maga all went into exile in France . Soglo ruled for two years until union strikes and dissatisfaction within the ranks of the military led to the 17 December 1967 coup where two junior military officers , Maurice Kouandété and Mathieu Kérékou , overthrew Soglo and sent him into exile in France . Following the removal of Soglo from power , the military decided to transition to a civilian government and appointed Colonel Alphonse Alley , Soglo 's chief of staff , as the provisional president until such a transition could occur . A new constitution was prepared and approved in a vote by 92 % of the population in March 1968 . 
 In the elections which followed to elect a civilian president , all former presidents , prime ministers , and ministers were prohibited from running . This excluded Apithy , Ahomadégbé , Maga , and former foreign minister Émile <unk> Zinsou from running for the position . Apithy , Ahomadégbé , and Maga declared a general boycott of the election which proved highly successful with only 33 % of the eligible voters casting ballots . With such low turnout , the military invalidated the election results and , after consulting with unions and other activists in the country , the military selected Zinsou as the new president . 
 With the appointment of Zinsou as a civilian leader of the country , Apithy , Ahomadégbé , and Maga tried to return to the country but were informed that their plane would be shot down if they entered Dahomey airspace ; they instead flew to neighboring Togo . Zinsou , who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military , quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them . In addition , to control continued deficits , Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population . The result was that on 10 December 1969 , Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near <unk> . Following the coup , Kouandété found that he did not have the support to rule throughout the entire military , and so instead Paul @-@ Emile de Souza ( the director of military affairs for Zinsou 's government ) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate ( with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît <unk> holding the other seats ) . The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections , thus allowing Apithy , Ahomadégbé , and Maga to run . 
 = = = 1970 Election = = = 
 The 1970 election included all of the civilian leaders of the country since independence with Apithy , Ahomadégbé , Maga , and Zinsou running against one another . The military decided to hold the elections on a staggered schedule with different areas of the country voting on different dates . This staggering meant that each of the candidates strategically tried to gain votes in later voting regions based upon the earlier results : bribery and irregularities in the election were rampant . Just before voting began in the final region of <unk> , which was a stronghold for Maga , Ahomadégbé supporters instigated violence to undercut the turnout for Maga in the region . Maga would have won the presidency if he had earned the most votes in <unk> , but instead of allowing the vote to go forward , de Souza suspended the election and immediately called on all sides to come to an agreement forming the next government . 
 The situation became quite tense with each of the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other . Maga threatened that the north would secede if his victory was not validated , and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto @-@ Novo would join with Nigeria . Ethnic tensions increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories . Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war . 
 On 16 April 1970 , Ahomadégbé and Maga met in the town of <unk> , under French pressure , and agreed to the notion of a single party controlling government with a rotating presidency . Apithy did not attend the meeting and rejected the proposal , suggesting to the military that they instead pick one of their own to be the next president . The military leaders rejected this proposal and endorsed the shared presidency idea . Apithy then agreed to participate in the Presidential Council . Zinsou , with only 3 % of the vote , was ignored in the discussions and left the country for France . Historian Samuel Decalo commented that although coups and crises were regular in the country 's short history , " the April 1970 crisis was the most ominous Dahomey had ever faced . " 
 = = The triumvirate = = 
 To reduce the tension throughout the country , all three candidates accepted the military governing council 's resolution ( written closely with Maga ) , which stipulated that starting in May 1970 , each of the three main candidates would be part of a Presidential Council that would hold all legislative and executive power in the government and decide on all major policy issues . The charter of the Council established that one member of the council would serve as the head of state for two @-@ year periods before rotating to other members until all three leaders had held the position of president . The individual president would govern some of the affairs of the state , managing the civil service , military and bureaucracy . However , policy decisions would be set by unanimous decision of the entire Presidential Council , and if a unanimous decision could not be reached , a vote of the majority could pass policies . Ministry posts in the country would be divided evenly between the three members of the council with each one appointing four ministers , and the sitting president would have the power to appoint the Minister of the Military and the Minister of the Interior . Each individual also pledged not to abuse their control of the military to try and remain in power after the two @-@ year period had ended . Under the chairmanship of de Souza , the military was largely stabilized in its leadership and returned to the barracks . 
 On 7 May 1970 , Maga became the head of state and began governing the country . Although unions and the military had agreed to the agreement and all three candidates supported it , there remained tension between the various powers in the new arrangement . In order to appease unions , Maga promised that public service union salaries would be immune from any budget cuts . Although there were forces in the military opposed to the government , many of the coup leaders of the 1960s had largely left the country or withdrawn from politics . The relationship between the three leaders remained tense , but a Maga @-@ Ahomadégbé alliance against Apithy on a number of issues kept the triumvirate functioning during Maga 's tenure . With unions largely docile , the high ranks of the military committed to the council , and the members of the council waiting for their turns to govern , domestic and foreign policy were able to come to the fore in 1971 ( the first year without a major political crisis in the government since 1966 ) . Although some small policies were began , the council passed few policies and largely simply " froze the status quo . " 
 Various development attempts dominated the domestic agenda during Maga 's administration . Unlike many other countries in Africa at the time , this did not involve nationalizing many of the industries in the country . Instead the country sought to expand its foreign tourism sector and oil exploration along the coast . The country , using French and German investment , began a series of projects to create resorts and tourist potential along the coast of the country . Union Oil had begun oil exploration off the coast of the country in the 1960s but had withdrawn in the chaos of 1970 . Maga was able to secure a new contract with Shell Oil to begin a 9 @-@ year exploration deal in 1971 . The agreement with the unions and other investments within the country were largely financed through a significant loan from the French government . However , at the same time , the three members of the council were provided significant personal wealth through the arrangement . Each was provided significant funds to spend on their presidential residences , payment for a many members of a personal staff , and given identical Mercedes @-@ Benz <unk> . Trade from the country increased by 14 % during the Presidential Council although large trade and budget deficits remained . 
 On foreign policy , the Republic of Dahomey split with France and other African countries on the issues of China and South Africa . On the recognition of China , Dahomey broke with France and sided with the United States in voting against the recognition of Communist China in the United Nations . On the issue of South Africa , Dahomey was one of five countries to walk out of discussions in the Union of African States on opening contact with the apartheid regime in South Africa . Dahomey supported opening contact and trade relations with the regime , unlike much of the rest of the African states , and abstained on the final vote . 
 Military tension increased with a mutiny in the Ouidah barracks on 28 January 1972 by young officers demanding the removal of de Souza from his position at the head of the military . This coup was ended when Maga sent two military officers to discuss with the mutineers and made them some agreements which have never bee disclosed . This was followed on 23 March with a double coup attempt ( two simultaneous coups organized by two different factions within the military ) which only resulted in an attempted assassination attempt against de Souza who was slightly injured in the attack . The leaders of the two different factions ( one faction led by Kouandété and one led by supporters of Zinsou ) , included 20 different officers and many civilians . Many were tried and six were sentenced to death , including Kouandété , although he was never executed by Maga or Ahomadégbé for fear of a hostile military reaction . 
 With the scheduled transfer of power from Maga to Ahomadégbé on 7 May 1972 , there were rumors throughout the country that the transfer would not occur ( often rumored that troops loyal to Maga would march south and prevent the transfer ) . Maga had promoted many northerners through the civil service and military ranks and many of them saw Ahomadégbé as a threat to these new positions . However , all three members stood together for the ceremony and power was transferred from Maga to Ahomadégbé . Maga declared the Presidential Council to be " one of the most beneficial institutions " because it allowed the country to heal . The alliance between Maga and Ahomadégbé which had allowed Maga to govern the country quickly broke apart , and instead Maga and Apithy made an alliance which kept Maga 's associates in their ministerial positions and prevented Ahomadégbé from effectively governing . The only major policy effort pushed by Ahomadégbé was the declaration to create a single political party from the various regional political parties which would be the only party allowed when the Presidential Council would end , although in practice the divisions between the parties largely remained . The tensions between the three members reportedly became their most tense with the planned visit of French President Georges Pompidou in November . 
 After almost 6 months in power , a military coup was started on 26 October 1972 which removed Ahomadégbé from power and ended the Presidential Council . Major Kerekou , a protege of Kouandété , led the first armor company of the military to break into a Presidential Council meeting , where he declared the end of the Presidential Council . Kerekou announced the coup on national radio by saying that the " three headed figure [ was ] truly a monster " beset by " congenital deficiency ... notorious inefficiency and ... unpardonable incompetence . " Similarly to the coup in 1963 , the military intervention was viewed favorably by much of the population of the country . Kouandété was released from prison and Kerekou named himself the new head of state appointing military officers to the various ministerial posts . All the senior military officers were discharged from their positions . An alleged counter @-@ coup led in May 1973 by Colonel Alley was suppressed by Kerekou and Alley was sentenced to 20 years in prison . The members of the Presidential Council and other prominent political figures were arrested and imprisoned or placed under house arrest until 1981 . After they were released from house arrest in 1981 , Apithy , Ahomadégbé , and Maga all moved to Paris . Following the coup , Kerekou proceeded to rule the country as a military dictator until 1991 .

 Thrones and Patriots expanded on a variety of features in the original game , such as new monuments ( called " Wonders " ) , nations , governments , and campaigns . Gameplay still remains similar to Rise of Nations , with its wide span of ages and players still manage and expand their nations at the macro and micro levels . However , Thrones and Patriots has campaigns which offer more turn @-@ based strategy features than the original and the ability to make decisions outside of combat . Up to eight players can play in multiplayer matches , with artificial intelligence being able to fill slots at the server host 's choice . 
 Tim Train , executive producer of Thrones and Patriots , stated that various features were added to the game in an attempt to balance gameplay , including the addition of armed caravans and merchants . IGN claimed that Thrones and Patriots is " a great game [ which ] gets better , " in reference to its predecessor Rise of Nations and other critical reviews also praised many features of the game , though some noted deficiencies .

 Within Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots players control various units during battles , including land , sea , and aerial units . Units used during gameplay include slingers , musketeers , tanks , large Persian war elephants , aircraft carriers , and nuclear missiles . Players progress in different ways in Thrones and Patriots by using various means including espionage , political strategy , technology races and population growth . The gameplay takes place from ancient history to modern times . Players are able to lead their nations at the macro and micro levels , and build their nation up and expand it throughout the game . 
 Thrones and Patriots added six new nations to the original Rise of Nations game . The ' New World ' situation playable in the game was enhanced by the introduction of the European nation — the Dutch . Three North American nations were added , the Americans , referring to the ex @-@ colonial civilization , and two Native American nations were added , which were the Lakota and the Iroquois . Two Asian nations , the Indians and the Persians , were introduced . The other nation to be added was the Dutch . New Wonders were made available for building , such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , the Forbidden City , and the Red Fort . 
 New features of the game were added to the new nations , for instance the Lakota , which is unable to build farms to generate food , instead receive a constant food supply for each of their citizens , scouts , and cavalry units . They can make buildings in any region that is not possessed by their enemy , can raze buildings quickly , receiving a full refund . Additionally , they receive resources when enemy resources are destroyed .

 Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots added four new " Conquer the World " campaigns : Alexander the Great , Napoleon , the New World , and the Cold War . The Alexander the Great campaign allows the player to choose whether or not to raze or incorporate conquered territories . A player 's decision to raze may cause the rest of the enemies to either fight harder , or question their casus belli and ally with you . The Napoleon campaign challenges the player to conquer Europe in a limited amount of time , with diplomacy , alliances , conquest , and bribing with land . Players must have intuitive leadership in this campaign because faulty decisions by the player can force themselves , that is to say , Napoleon , into exile . The New World campaign allows the player to choose either the Americans , a European power , or a Native American tribe . If the player chooses to lead the Americans , they must pay taxes to Great Britain , until they declare independence . The map of a battle incorporates the region 's environment , for example large forests in the Pacific Northwest . The Cold War introduces the ability to fire nuclear missiles in the main map and initiate espionage missions . Armies can also move anywhere in their nation 's territory without using up a <unk> of Nations : Thrones and Patriots ' campaigns now offer more turn @-@ based strategy into the game rather than real @-@ time strategy being the only gameplay aspect .

 Big Huge Games added multiple new features to the game during its development , in an attempt to fix issues with the original version . In an interview with GameSpot , executive producer Tim Train explained the development of the expansion pack .

He said Big Huge Games brought in professional players in order to get suggestions on how to improve the game . 
 The expansion pack Thrones and Patriots was released for Microsoft Windows in North America on April 27 , 2004 , and subsequently in Europe on May 21 , 2004 .

 Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots has received a compilation score of 88 % on both Game Rankings and Metacritic . In its review , IGN claimed that Thrones and Patriots is " a great game [ which ] gets better , " in reference to its predecessor Rise of Nations . 1UP.com stated that the game is what expansion packs should try to mimic . Game Informer declared that Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots is " one of the essential pieces of any strategy gamer ’ s collection . " GameSpot commented that the game is a terrific experience and it not only provides exceptional content , but that it also improves an already good game . 
 In the expansion pack , many insignificant changes were introduced to complement the existing game structure , rather than radically alter it , and critics considered the continuing of the original game format to be good . GameSpy claimed that , even with all of Thrones and Patriots ' additions , the framework of the game still feels excellent . However , IGN declared that the developers only added many features into the game " in the hopes that it would seem coherent , " rather than actually giving the game a " central theme . " 
 Both IGN and GameSpot claimed the game 's government mechanics were similar to those of the game series Civilization . However , GameSpy stated the game 's artificial intelligence for " managing the individual movements of units and citizens ... [ was ] strategically brain dead . " Their review explained that the wide range of upgrades , units , and technology research in different buildings requires micromanagement and the use of hotkeys , especially during online play . The review stated that the game had biased gameplay times in single @-@ player with different nations , such as Lakota having very limited use , and Americans having a massive amount of playtime . 
 GameSpot stated that the multiplayer functionality of Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots had some lag , even when on a local network . 1UP.com reported problems with crashes in both the single and multiplayer modes of Thrones and Patriots . 
 In awarding Rise of Nations : Thrones and Patriots " Best Expansion Pack " of 2004 , IGN acclaimed the additions of more playable nations and new government mechanics that Rise of Nations didn 't have , and the new " Conquer the World " campaigns . 
 = Worcester Castle = 
 Worcester Castle was a Norman fortification built between 1068 and 1069 in Worcester , England by Urse d 'Abetot on behalf of William the Conqueror . The castle had a motte @-@ and @-@ bailey design and was located on the south side of the old Anglo @-@ Saxon city , cutting into the grounds of Worcester Cathedral . Royal castles were owned by the king and maintained on his behalf by an appointed constable . At Worcester that role was passed down through the local Beauchamp family on a hereditary basis , giving them permanent control of the castle and considerable power within the city . The castle played an important part in the wars of the 12th and early 13th century , including the Anarchy and the First Barons ' War . 
 In 1217 , Henry III 's government decided to break the power of the Beauchamps and reduce the ongoing military threat posed by the castle by returning much of the castle 's bailey to the cathedral . Without an intact bailey the castle was no longer valuable militarily , although it played a small part in the Second Barons ' War in the 1260s . A gaol had been built in the castle by the early 13th century and the castle continued to be used as Worcestershire 's county gaol until the 19th century , when a new prison was built on the north side of Worcester and the old site completely redeveloped . Today nothing remains of Worcester Castle with the exception of Edgar 's Tower , a cathedral gatehouse built on the former entrance to the castle .

 Worcester Castle was built after the Norman conquest of England in the Anglo @-@ Saxon city of Worcester . The castle was constructed between 1068 and 1069 on the orders of William the Conqueror as part of a wave of royal castle building in major Roman or Anglo @-@ Saxon towns across England . Constructed in timber , the castle had a motte @-@ and @-@ bailey design , with a bailey to the north and south of the motte . The top of the motte was later recorded as being around 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) in diameter . The castle was defensively well situated on the eastern bank of the River Severn in the south @-@ west corner of the borough , taking advantage of the old burh walls and ditches . Urse d 'Abetot was appointed as the sheriff of Worcester and the constable of the new castle . 
 Worcester was an urban castle , built within an existing settlement . Many such castles required the clearance of local properties , but unusually at Worcester Castle the ditch of the outer bailey cut through part of Worcester Cathedral 's cemetery . It is unclear whether the cemetery was still in use at that time , but the desecration resulted in Ealdred , the Archbishop of York , with extensive interests in Worcester , complaining about the seizure of the land and formally cursing Urse . 
 = = = 12th – 13th centuries = = = 
 Worcester remained a royal castle , but within a few years the post of sheriff and that of constable became hereditary in the Beauchamp family , the successors to Urse d 'Abitot . Urse 's son , Roger , inherited them , followed by Walter de Beauchamp , who married Urse 's daughter , and William de Beauchamp . The castle was effectively run by the Beauchamps , largely independent of the king . Despite controlling Worcester , the Beauchamps preferred to use Elmley Castle , 12 miles ( 20 k ) away , as their main residence . In 1113 Worcester was attacked by Welsh raiders , who broke into the outer bailey of the castle and set fire to the buildings there ; the timber castle was destroyed and had to be rebuilt , again in wood . 
 In the late 1130s a period of civil war – the Anarchy – broke out in England , in which the rival factions of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda contested the kingdom ; Worcestershire proved to be a key battleground in the war . The first attack on Worcester itself occurred in late 1139 , when an Angevin army from Gloucestershire assaulted the city ; after an attempt to take the castle on the south side of the city , the Gloucester forces entered from the north , looting and burning the city . As a result , Walter de Beauchamp chose to side with Matilda . Worcester became a base for Stephen 's forces for a period , with Stephen replacing Walter as the constable with <unk> de Beaumont , before the city and castle were reclaimed for the Empress by Robert of Gloucester . In response , Stephen first stormed and burnt the city in 1148 , and then attacked it again in 1150 , shortly before the end of the conflict . Two neighbouring siege castles were built by Stephen as part of these operations , designed to contain Worcester Castle itself , one at <unk> Hill the other at Red Hill . After the conflict , Walter was finally reaffirmed as the constable of Worcester Castle by Henry II , the Empress 's son . 
 By the end of the 13th century , William de Beauchamp – the grandson of Walter de Beauchamp – controlled the castle on behalf of the king . In the 12th century there was a trend in England for stone castles to replace their earth and timber counterparts , and in 1204 King John ordered the sheriff of Worcester to rebuild the gatehouse " which is now of timber , with good and fine stone " . John 's work cost £ 25 , and was one of a number of repairs and improvements during the period : £ 12 was spent maintaining the castle in 1183 , for example , while in 1192 £ 5 4s was spent on the internal buildings and in 1203 work on the stables came to £ 6 3s . 
 Civil war broke out again in England in 1215 between forces loyal to King John and rebel barons , supported in due course by Prince Louis of France . John annexed the castle in 1214 and William sided with the rebels in 1216 . King John responded by sending forces to attack the castle and successfully retook it . Despite John 's death , the war continued until forces loyal to John 's young son , Henry III , finally achieved victory over the rebels in 1217 . 
 Meanwhile , the 11th century dispute over the cathedral graveyard had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III 's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral . A panel met to agree exactly how the land should be divided , concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey ; the far side was returned to the cathedral , making the remainder of the castle unusable from a military perspective . Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress . 
 The castle nevertheless continued in use for a time , partially because the Worcestershire County gaol was situated in the outer bailey ; the earliest record of this gaol is from 1221 , when a porter was recorded as being employed as a gaoler . The gaol appears to have been built of wood during the medieval period . Escapees remained a problem ; some were recorded during the 1220s , and during Second Barons ' War , Worcester was captured and all the prisoners released . Later in the same war , Henry III was imprisoned there for a period by Simon de Montfort . The castle was also used as one of the locations for the Worcestershire county court and election of local officials . 
 = = = 14th – 19th centuries = = = 
 The sheriffs of Worcestershire continued to control the castle as constables , and the property passed along hereditary lines from the Beauchamps to the Earls of Warwick until Richard Neville , also known as the " Kingmaker " , died during the Wars of the Roses in 1471 . The victorious Edward IV divided up the various estates that Neville had owned and gave the castle to his son , severing the link between Worcester and the earldom of Warwick . The final constables were appointed during the 1540s , after which the practice of appointing constables ceased altogether . The castle 's walls were quarried for stone , the motte was used to keep animals on and only the sheriff 's county gaol remained intact . The antiquarian John Leland recorded in the 1540s that the castle was " now clean down " , and that the motte was still of an impressive size but heavily overgrown . A gatehouse known as Edgar 's Tower was built by the cathedral on the site of the earlier castle gatehouse , to control access to the former bailey . 
 In 1628 the castle site was granted by the Crown to Giles Clutterbuck ; the local gentry complained , leading to a legal case in which the county successfully reclaimed the site . In 1642 England descended into a period of civil war between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament . Worcester 's city walls were refortified and a sconce , or small fort , was built on top of the motte of Worcester Castle . 
 The castle continued to be used as the county gaol after the war and in 1653 a new gaol , built from stone and brick , was constructed in the castle grounds . In the 1770s the prison reformer John Howard inspected the gaol and was very critical of the facility . In particular he complained about the castle 's underground dungeon , accessed down a flight of 26 steps ; the room was circular , 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) across , and guarded by an iron grill . Worcester conducted extensive work after the report at a cost of £ 3 @,@ 431 ( £ 364 @,@ 000 at 2009 prices ) , and by 1788 the prison had 18 new cells for men and two for women , in addition to the dungeon and the sick @-@ rooms . Nevertheless it was housing 74 inmates at the time of Howard 's inspection , with two prisoners routinely sharing each cell , sleeping together on the floor . Like other prisons of the time , Worcester Castle was run as a private enterprise , in this case by a local butcher , who was paid £ 150 a year ( £ 15 @,@ 400 ) to run the facility . The prison was known to suffer from outbreaks of gaol fever , which claimed the life of a local doctor who visited the facility . 
 A new county gaol was built in 1814 , at a cost of £ 20 @,@ 000 ( £ <unk> ) with a more modern system of radiating wings ; this was constructed on the north side of Worcester where the local street was named " Castle Street " as a result . The Dean and Chapter of Worcester Cathedral acquired the old gaol in 1823 . The outer bailey of the castle became known as the College Green ; the College Green was accessed through Edgar 's Tower . The motte was slowly demolished between 1823 and 1846 . 
 = Spider @-@ Man ( Miles Morales ) = 
 Miles Morales is a fictional superhero who appears in comic books published by Marvel Comics , as one of the characters who goes by the identity of Spider @-@ Man . The character was created by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli , with Bendis and Marvel editor @-@ in @-@ chief Axel Alonso drawing inspiration from both U.S. President Barack Obama and American actor Donald Glover . 
 Miles Morales first appeared in Ultimate Fallout # 4 ( August 2011 ) , following the death of Peter Parker . A teenager of Black Hispanic descent , Miles is the second Spider @-@ Man to appear in Ultimate Marvel , an imprint with a separate continuity from the mainstream Marvel Universe . Although Morales featured in the Ultimate Comics : Spider @-@ Man comic book series , he is not the lead character in the Ultimate Spider @-@ Man animated TV series that debuted in April 2012 on Disney XD , but he was later added to the main cast in 2016 . After Marvel ended the Ultimate imprint in 2015 , Miles was made a character in the main Marvel Universe , beginning with stories under the All @-@ New , All @-@ Different Marvel brand published that same year . 
 Reaction to the character varied , with some , including Spider @-@ Man 's creator , Stan Lee , approving the creation of a positive role model for non @-@ white children , to displeasure at the replacement of Peter Parker , with some decrying it as a publicity stunt motivated by political correctness , a charge Alonso denied . Alexandra Petri of The Washington Post called for the character to be judged on the quality of its stories , which have garnered positive reviews . 
 The character possesses powers similar to those of the original Spider @-@ Man , which were derived from the bite of a spider genetically engineered by Spider @-@ Man 's nemesis Norman Osborn in an attempt to duplicate those abilities . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The concept of a black Spider @-@ Man was first discussed a few months before the November 2008 election of Barack Obama as President of the United States . Marvel Comics editor @-@ in @-@ chief Axel Alonso describes the catalyst , " When we were planning “ Ultimatum , ” we realized that we were standing at the brink of America electing its first African @-@ American President and we acknowledged that maybe it was time to take a good look at one of our icons . " This new Spider @-@ Man was considered a possible part of the 2008 @-@ 09 " Ultimatum " story arc that restructured much of the Ultimate Marvel universe , but those early thoughts were abandoned because the story for that character had not yet been developed . Bendis said thoughts about the character were further reinforced by African American actor Donald Glover 's appearance wearing Spider @-@ Man pajamas in " Anthropology 101 " , the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community . This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider @-@ Man . Bendis said of Glover , " I saw him in the costume and thought , ' I would like to read that book . ' So I was glad I was writing that book . " 
 When the Marvel Comics staff decided that the Ultimate universe 's Peter Parker would be killed in the 2011 storyline " Death of Spider @-@ Man " , the character Miles Morales was created . Although Morales is the first black Spider @-@ Man , he marks the second time a Latino character has taken the Spider @-@ Man identity . Miguel O 'Hara , who is of half Mexican descent , was the title character in the series Spider @-@ Man 2099 . Morales has replaced Parker as Spider @-@ Man only in Ultimate Marvel , a parallel universe that re @-@ imagines the characters . 
 Miles Morales was created by comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli . Morales was born and raised in Brooklyn , New York City , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old son of an African American father and a Puerto Rican mother . Axel Alonso has described Miles as an intelligent nerd with an aptitude for science similar to his predecessor , Peter Parker . The character made his debut in the fourth issue of the Ultimate Fallout limited series , which was released on August 3 , 2011 . He later starred in the relaunched Ultimate Comics : Spider @-@ Man series , written by Bendis and drawn by Pichelli , in September 2011 . 
 In contrasting Miles with Peter Parker , Bendis has depicted different conflicts and anxieties for the character . Right after acquiring his superhuman abilities from a spider bite at the home of his uncle , Aaron , whom Miles admires but he does not initially know is a career criminal , Miles ' father , Jefferson , explains to Miles that before Miles was born , Jefferson and Aaron were thieves who spent time in prison , and that while Jefferson reformed when he got older , Aaron has not . According to Bendis , this gives Miles cause to wonder if the traits that lead to criminal behavior are hardwired into his DNA , leading him to question whether he is essentially a good person or not , and what his future holds for him . These issues further haunt Miles after he becomes disillusioned with Aaron , and Aaron dies from an accidental explosion triggered during a battle between the two of them , saying , " You are just like me " to Miles before dying . 
 In creating the visual look for Miles , Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving thought to the character 's personality , including the background that influenced it , and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit , such as the clothing he wears , his body language and expressions . Pichelli also designed Spider @-@ Man 's new costume , a mostly black outfit with red webbing and a red spider logo . Pichelli had worked on four issues of Ultimate Spider @-@ Man before she was approached to work on the new title with Miles Morales . Pichelli , who works with a Cintiq <unk> graphic tablet , added more <unk> to her illustrations to give what she called " a more ' pop ' feeling to the book , because I think it would fit perfectly with the new series " . 
 In 2012 , Morales appeared in the miniseries Spider @-@ Men , in which he encounters the Spider @-@ Man of the original Marvel universe . 
 In June 2013 , the character appeared in the climax of Age of Ultron # 10 ( also written by Brian Michael Bendis ) . In the storyline , which depicts major changes to the space @-@ time continuum as a result of the time travel on the part of the original Marvel versions of Susan Richards and Wolverine , Miles witnesses the coming of the mainstream Marvel Galactus to Earth . 
 Despite its initial press and critical reception , Ultimate Comics Spider @-@ Man was not a huge hit in the direct market . By August 2013 , sales on the title had slipped , and sales for the other two Ultimate titles , Ultimate Comics X @-@ Men and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates , had dropped to numbers at which mainstream Marvel titles are cancelled . That November , Ultimate Comics Spider @-@ Man ended its run with issue # 28 , and the other two titles ended along with it , to make way for the miniseries Cataclysm : Ultimate Spider @-@ Man , one of the books in the crossover storyline " Cataclysm " , in which the heroes of the Ultimate universe face the threat of the Marvel 616 Galactus , and Miles is transported to the mainstream Marvel universe . 
 In January 2014 , it was announced that following " Cataclysm " , Miles would begin starring in a new title called Miles Morales : Ultimate Spider @-@ Man , as part of Ultimate Marvel Now , an initiative with which Marvel will relaunch the Ultimate Marvel line . Miles Morales will also be a main character in the All @-@ New Ultimates , in which he will join a team of young heroes that will include Kitty Pryde , Bombshell , Cloak and Dagger , and a new Black Widow . The former title is written by Bendis , while the latter is written by Michel <unk> and drawn by <unk> <unk> both series ran for 12 issues . The twelfth and final issue of Miles Morales : Ultimate Spider @-@ Man concluded with a cliffhanger that led directly into the 2015 " Secret Wars " storyline . 
 Marvel ended the Ultimate Marvel imprint with the " Secret Wars " storyline , in which the Marvel Universe was merged with other alternate universes , including the Ultimate Universe . Following " Secret Wars " , Miles become a character of the mainstream Marvel Universe , and a member of the titular team in All @-@ New , All @-@ Different Avengers . He also headlines a new series , titled simply Spider @-@ Man , which debuted February 3 , 2016 , with Bendis and Pichelli returning as the creative team . In the storyline , the now @-@ 16 @-@ year @-@ old Miles continues to patrol New York City , while Peter Parker will expand the scope of his activities globally . Issues that Miles deals with will include the confrontations with Parker 's rogues gallery , the public 's reaction to his ethnicity , and his love life .

 = = = Ultimate Comics : Spider @-@ Man = = = 
 The opening story arc of Ultimate Comics : Spider @-@ Man , which premiered in September 2011 , is set prior to Ultimate Fallout # 4 , and details how Miles received his superhuman abilities . After Oscorp scientist Dr. Markus uses Parker 's blood to recreate the Oz formula that created Spider @-@ Man , the Prowler ( Aaron Davis ) steals the formula , and in the process , one of the spiders created by Markus crawls into the Prowler 's duffel bag . Days later , the Prowler 's nephew , grade @-@ schooler Miles Morales , is bitten by the spider during a visit to Aaron 's apartment . Morales develops superhuman abilities similar to those Peter Parker has , but does not tell his parents , Jefferson and Rio , due to his father 's distrust of superheroes , confiding only in his best friend , Ganke Lee . 
 Miles , who just wants a normal life , is unhappy about having these abilities , and initially nauseated at the idea of risking his life to engage in superheroics , a reaction that Bendis wrote to further contrast Miles with Parker . However , after witnessing Spider @-@ Man 's death at the hands of the Green Goblin , the guilt @-@ ridden Miles realizes he could have helped . After Ganke suggests he assume the mantle of Spider @-@ Man , and learns from Gwen Stacy why Parker did what he did , Miles is inspired to try his hand at costumed crimefighting . During his first foray into costumed superheroics , he is confronted not only by those who feel his use of the Spider @-@ Man costume is in bad taste , but also by Spider @-@ Woman , a member of the government superhuman team , the Ultimates , over his use of the Spider @-@ Man identity . 
 Spider @-@ Woman unmasks and arrests Miles and takes him to S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters , where Nick Fury reveals that he knows all about Miles and his family , including his uncle 's criminal activity . After he helps S.H.I.E.L.D. subdue the escaped supervillain Electro , S.H.I.E.L.D. releases Miles and gives him a modified black and red version of the Spider @-@ Man costume , which Ganke feels makes Miles " officially " the new Spider @-@ Man . He also receives the blessing of the Earth @-@ 616 Peter Parker during the 2012 Spider @-@ Men miniseries , in which Parker briefly visits the Ultimate Marvel universe and meets Miles . After the newspapers begin reporting the emergence of a new Spider @-@ Man , Aaron deduces that it is really Miles , and offers to train Miles and work with him . After Aaron uses Miles in his ongoing conflict with the Mexican crime lord Scorpion , Miles realizes he is being exploited , and refuses to assist his uncle further , despite Aaron 's threat to inform Miles ' father of his secret . This leads to an altercation between the uncle and nephew that results in the malfunction of Aaron 's weapons , which explode , killing Aaron . 
 In subsequent storylines , Miles subsequently becomes acquainted with Peter Parker 's loved ones , May Parker , Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson , who know of his secret identity , and give him Parker 's web shooters . He also encounters Captain America , who reluctantly agrees to train Miles . 
 In a 2013 storyline , investigative reporter Betty Brant incorrectly concludes that Miles ' father , Jefferson , is the new Spider @-@ Man . However , publisher J. Jonah Jameson , in light of the death of Peter Parker , refuses to publish her theory , on the grounds that it will merely ruin a family 's life and deprive the city of another hero . When Brant tries to publish her findings in a book , she is murdered by former Oscorp and then @-@ Roxxon scientist Dr. Conrad Marcus , who has become the newest host to the Venom symbiote . In the subsequent " Venom War " storyline , Venom learns of Brant 's findings , and confronts Jefferson at his home , where Spider @-@ Man repels the creature . Jefferson is critically injured and hospitalized in this battle , and Miles is confronted by former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent turned New York Police detective Maria Hill , who has also deduced his secret . When Venom later appears at the hospital , Spider @-@ Man again confronts him , during which Miles ' mother , Rio , also learns that her son is Spider @-@ Man . By the end of the brawl , Marcus is separated from the symbiote and killed by police gunfire , as is Rio , who tells Miles not to reveal his secret to his father before dying . 
 The storyline then jumps ahead one year . Miles has a girlfriend named Katie Bishop , and is planning on telling her about his former life as Spider @-@ Man . Though he has not engaged in heroics in a year , he is pressured to return to that life , by S.H.I.E.L.D. He reluctantly does so , after Ganke and Spider @-@ Woman convinces him that there needs to be a Spider @-@ Man . Along with Spider @-@ Woman , Bombshell and Cloak and Dagger , Miles helps arrest Donald Roxxon , the head of the Roxxon corporation , who reveals that he knows of Miles ' identity , and that he was the one who hired Aaron to break into Oscorp the night that the spider who gave Miles his powers was accidentally brought to Aaron 's home . He also reveals that he was responsible for the creation of Bombshell , Cloak and Dagger , which involved kidnapping underage people and experimenting on them using untested genetic technology . After Roxxon 's arrest , Miles thanks Ganke for his support , and affirms in earnest that he is Spider @-@ Man .

After witnessing Miles courageously battles Osborn , Peter acknowledges Miles a worthy successor , and decides to retire from superheroics for a life with his family and Mary Jane . 
 Miles ' father also reappears , and relates to his son that as a young man , he and Aaron went to work for a criminal named Turk after Jefferson was recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a spy in order to infiltrate the organization of the then @-@ up @-@ and @-@ coming international criminal Wilson Fisk . Jefferson did this for a time , but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes , and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full @-@ fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent , he refused , not wanting any part of his brother 's world . He met Rio a week later and fell in love with her . Jefferson fled after learning that Miles was Spider @-@ Man because it brought back unresolved from that earlier time in his life , and tells Miles that he does not blame Miles for his mother 's death , and regrets abandoning him . 
 When Miles reveals his secret identity to his girlfriend , Katie Bishop , she and her parents are revealed to be sleeper agents for the terrorist group Hydra , who then kidnap Miles , his father and Ganke , as part of a plan involving Dr. Doom .

 = = Powers and abilities = = 
 Bitten by a slightly different genetically engineered spider than the one that granted Peter Parker 's powers , Miles Morales possesses abilities similar to the original Spider @-@ Man 's , including enhanced strength and agility , the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings with his hands and feet , and a " spider sense " that warns him of danger with a buzzing sensation in his head . Though his strength and agility are similar to those of the original Spider @-@ Man , his spider @-@ sense is not as strong , as it only warns him of immediate danger . 
 He has two abilities that the original Spider @-@ Man did not have : the ability to camouflage himself , including his clothing , to match his surroundings , and an electrical " venom strike " that can paralyze almost anyone with just a touch , including the electrically powered Electro . The venom strike can be conducted through Miles ' gloves , and can be used against an opponent at a distance by conducting it through a material in which both Miles and his opponent are in contact , such as the webbing of the Earth @-@ 616 's Spider @-@ Man . It can break chains being used to restrain Miles , and even repels non @-@ ferrous objects , such as plastic Lego bricks . The venom strike is powerful enough to render unconscious a person as large as Hank Pym 's Giant Man . It is powerful enough to drive away the villain Venom during Miles ' first encounter with the creature , but by their second encounter , Venom has developed such a tolerance to the strike that Miles has to be completely enveloped by the symbiote before the venom strike can separate the symbiote from its host . The effect of the venom strike manifests itself a few seconds after it is implemented , and is described by Bendis as being comparable to the feeling of being kicked in the testicles . Some uses of the venom strike , as when Miles freed himself from chains , require much power , and cannot be used multiple times in rapid succession without a " recharging " period for Miles , though he can still make conventional use of it against people . 
 Miles ' body also possesses a strong resistance to injury . During an altercation with the Roxxon mercenary Taskmaster , Miles is hurled toward a low brick wall , shattering it , without any apparent serious injury , though the experience was painful for him . 
 Miles wears a costume given to him by S.H.I.E.L.D. , and initially uses Peter Parker 's web shooters , which are given to him by May Parker . He is eventually given a new set of webshooters by S.H.I.E.L.D. as well . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The character Miles Morales was first reported by USA Today on August 2 , 2011 , shortly before the character officially debuted in Ultimate Fallout # 4 . The announcement received international coverage in the mainstream media and was met with mixed reactions by audiences . Chris Huntington of The New York Times lauded the creation of Morales , relating that it gave his adopted Ethiopian son <unk> a superhero who looks like him . Some fans and commentators felt the decision was an attempt by Marvel Comics to be politically correct and that the introduction of a minority Spider @-@ Man was simply a publicity stunt to attract more readers , while others felt that a person of color as Spider @-@ Man would set a positive example for minority readers , particularly children . Many Spider @-@ Man fans were disappointed that Peter Parker was killed , regardless of who replaced him . The wide @-@ ranging critical reception prompted The Washington Post to run an article called , " Sorry , Peter Parker . The response to the black Spider @-@ Man shows why we need one " , in which writer Alexandra Petri wrote that the character should be judged on the quality of its stories rather than on his appearance or ethnicity . 
 Similarly , conservative talkshow host Glenn Beck , claiming that Miles resembled President Barack Obama , argued that the new Spider @-@ Man was a result of a comment from Michelle Obama about changing traditions . However , Beck said he did not care about Miles ' race , and also acknowledged out that this was not the mainstream Spider @-@ Man . Axel Alonso denied the character was created out of political correctness , stating " Simple fact is Marvel comics reflect the world in all its shapes , sizes and colors . We believe there 's an audience of people out there who is thirsty for a character like Miles Morales . " Original Spider @-@ Man co @-@ creator Stan Lee approved of Miles , stating that " Doing our bit to try to make our nation , and the world , color blind is definitely the right thing . " 
 In a review for the first issue , David <unk> of Newsarama wrote , " The biggest victory that Bendis scores with Miles Morales is that he makes us care about him , and care about him quickly . Even though we 're still scratching the surface of what makes him tick , we 're seeing the world through his eyes , and it 's similar to Peter Parker 's but a whole lot tougher . But that kind of Parker @-@ style guilt — that neurotic , nearly masochistic tendency for self @-@ sacrifice that comes with great power and greater responsibility — is still intact . " Jesse Schedeen of IGN wrote that " Miles still feels like a bit of an outsider in his own book . Bendis never quite paints a complete picture of Miles — his thoughts , motivations , personality quirks , and so forth . Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles . " Schedeen also opined that " Miles occupies a more urban , racially diverse , and tense landscape . All the story doesn 't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward . Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience , and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter 's " . James Hunt of Comic Book Resources rated the issue # 1 four and a half out of five stars , lauding Bendis for emphasizing Morales ' character and his supporting cast instead of rushing him into costume . The first issue holds a score of 7 @.@ 8 out of 10 at the review aggregator website Comic Book Roundup , based on 11 reviews , while the final issue , # 28 , holds a score of 8 @.@ 3 , based on 9 reviews , and the series overall holds an average issue rating of 8 @.@ 2 .

 = Rhodes blood libel = 
 The Rhodes blood libel was an 1840 event of blood libel against Jews , in which the Greek Orthodox community accused Jews on the island of Rhodes ( then part of the Ottoman Empire ) of the ritual murder of a Christian boy who disappeared in February of that year . 
 Initially the libel garnered support from the consuls of several European countries , including the United Kingdom , France , the Austrian Empire , Sweden , and Greece , although later several supported the Jewish community . The Ottoman governor of Rhodes broke with the long tradition of the Ottoman governments ( which had previously denied the factual basis of the blood libel accusations ) and supported the ritual murder charge . The government arrested several Jewish subjects , some of whom were tortured and confessed . It blockaded the entire Jewish quarter for twelve days . 
 The Jewish community of Rhodes appealed for help from the Jewish community in Constantinople , who forwarded the appeal to European governments . In the United Kingdom and Austria , Jewish communities gained support from their governments . They sent official dispatches to the ambassadors in Constantinople unequivocally condemning the blood libel . A consensus developed that the charge was false . The governor of Rhodes sent the case to the central government , which initiated a formal inquiry into the affair . In July 1840 , that investigation established the innocence of the Jewish community . Finally , in November of the same year , the Ottoman sultan issued a decree ( firman ) denouncing the blood libel as false . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Jewish community = = = 
 The existence of a Jewish community in Rhodes was first documented toward the end of the Hellenistic period . In a Roman decree dated to 142 BC , Rhodes is listed among the areas notified of the renewal of the pact of friendship between the Roman senate and the Jewish nation . The Jews of Rhodes are mentioned in documents at the time of the Arab conquest of the island in the 7th century . In the 12th century , Benjamin of Tudela found some 400 Jews in the city of Rhodes . 
 In 1481 and 1482 , earthquakes destroyed the Jewish quarter , so that only 22 families remained in the city . After an epidemic of plague in 1498 – 1500 , the Knights Hospitaller , who ruled the island at that time , expelled those of the remaining Jews who would not be baptized . In the next two decades , the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications . 
 In 1522 , these Jews and their descendants helped the Ottomans seize Rhodes . Under the Ottoman rule , Rhodes became an important Sephardi center , home to many famous rabbis . By the 19th century , the wealthier Jews were merchants in cloth , silk , sulfur , and resins . The rest were small shopkeepers and artisans , street vendors , and fishermen . The community was governed by a council of seven officials . Sources give the number of Jews during the 19th century between 2 @,@ 000 and 4 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Blood libel against the Jews in the Ottoman Empire = = = 
 The blood libel against Jews originated in England in 1144 with the case of William of Norwich . The accusation that Jews used the blood of Christian children to prepare matzos for the Passover became a staple of Christian antisemitism of the Middle Ages , with the total number of recorded ritual murder accusations reaching 150 . With the strengthening of standards of evidence in legal cases , the number of charges began to decline , and few blood libel cases reached European courts after 1772 . Nevertheless , some instances of ritual murder accusation arose as late as the 19th century . 
 In the Middle East , the blood libel was deeply ingrained in the consciousness of local Christian communities . Accusations of blood libel were commonplace in the Byzantine Empire . After the Ottomans conquered the Byzantine lands , Greek communities were usually the source of ritual murder charges against Jews , often at times of social and economic tensions . The first appearance of the blood libel under Ottoman rule took place in the reign of Mehmet II . Subsequently , accusations of ritual murder were only sporadic and Ottoman authorities usually condemned them . In the 16th century , Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent issued a firman , formally denouncing blood libel charges against the Jews . 
 With the increase of Christian influence in the Ottoman Empire , the standing of the Jews declined . The sultan 's Hatt @-@ i Sharif of <unk> , proclaimed in 1839 , ushered in an era of liberal reforms known as Tanzimat . This period further enhanced the status of the Christians and eroded the power of authorities to protect the Jews . Before 1840 , cases of blood libel occurred in Aleppo in 1810 and in Antioch in 1826 . 
 In 1840 , contemporaneous with the affair in Rhodes , a more famous case of blood libel , known as the Damascus affair , was developing in Damascus , while the city was under the short @-@ lived control of Muhammad Ali of Egypt . On February 5 , Capuchin friar Thomas and his servant Ibrahim Amara went missing , and the Jews of Damascus were accused of murdering them to collect their blood for Passover matzos . The local Christian community , the governor , and the French consul , who received full support from Paris , actively pursued the ritual murder charge . The accused Jews were tortured , and some of them confessed to having killed Father Thomas and his servant . Their testimonies were used by the accusers as the irrefutable proof of guilt . The case drew international attention , arousing active protests from the European Jewish diaspora .

 = = = Disappearance = = = 
 On February 17 , 1840 , a boy from a Greek Orthodox family in Rhodes went for a walk and did not return . The next day his mother reported the disappearance to the Ottoman authorities . The island 's governor , Yusuf Pasha , ordered a search , but several days ' efforts proved fruitless . The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case : the boy 's family was Christian , though without foreign protection . The Greek Christian population of Rhodes , meanwhile , had no doubts that the boy had been murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes . An eyewitness reported : " It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews . The whole island was agitated from one end to the other . " The assurance of the local Christians having been impressed upon the Ottoman authorities , they began searching the Jewish quarter , again in vain . 
 = = = Arrests , interrogations , and torture = = = 
 Several days later , two Greek women reported having seen the boy walking towards the city of Rhodes accompanied by four Jews . The women claimed that one of the Jews was Eliakim Stamboli , who was arrested , questioned , and subjected to five hundred blows of the bastinado . On February 23 , he was interrogated again and tortured in the presence of many dignitaries , including the governor , the qadi ( Muslim judge ) , the Greek archbishop , and European consuls . Jews of Rhodes reported that Stamboli was " loaded with chains , many stripes were inflicted upon him and red @-@ hot wires were run through his nose , burning bones were applied to his head and a very heavy stone was laid upon his breast , insomuch as he was reduced to the point of death . " Under torture , Stamboli confessed to the ritual murder charge and incriminated other Jews , opening the door to further arrests . Some half dozen Jews were accused of the crime and tortured , and the chief rabbi was intensely questioned as to whether Jews practice ritual murder . 
 = = = Blockade = = = 
 At the instigation of the Greek clergy and the European consuls , the governor Yusuf Pasha blockaded the Jewish quarter on the eve of Purim and arrested Jacob Israel the chief rabbi . The inhabitants could obtain neither food nor fresh water . The Jews thwarted a subversive attempt to smuggle a dead body into the Jewish quarter . The Muslim authorities , on the whole , were not keen to pursue the ritual murder accusation against the Jews . The Muslim official in charge of the blockade was found smuggling bread to the imprisoned residents ; at the insistence of the British consul , he was <unk> and dismissed from service . The qadi openly sympathized with the Jews . At the end of February , he initiated further hearings on the case , after which evidence was declared insufficient to convict the prisoners . The governor , on the other hand , refused to lift the blockade of the Jewish quarter , though he seemed to waver somewhat . In early March he sent to Constantinople asking for instructions . Only after the blockade had lasted for twelve days was the governor forced to lift it by a high treasury official who visited the island on a tour of inspection . At that point , the Jews thought that the affair was over and " returned thanks to the Almighty for their deliverance " . 
 = = = Influence of the Damascus affair = = = 
 The relief , however , was dashed in early March by news of the Damascus affair . Reports that the Jews of Damascus had confessed to having murdered Father Thomas reinforced the belief of the Christian community in the ritual murder charge . The British consul reported that " the Greeks cried loud that justice had not been rendered to them and that the rabbi and chiefs ought to have been imprisoned … In order to keep the populace quiet … it was decided that these should be arrested . " Eight Jews were arrested , including the chief rabbi and David Mizrahi , who were tortured by being suspended swinging from hooks in the ceiling in the presence of the European consuls . Mizrahi lost consciousness after six hours , while the rabbi was kept there for two days until he suffered a hemorrhage . Nevertheless , neither confessed and they were released after a few days . The other six Jews remained in prison in early April . 
 = = = Consular involvement = = = 
 The European vice @-@ consuls in Rhodes were united in believing the ritual murder charge . They played the key role in the interrogation , with J. G. Wilkinson , the British consul , and E. Masse from Sweden being involved . During the interrogation of the chief rabbi , Wilkinson asked , referring to the qadi 's decision to dismiss the case : " What signifies the <unk> 's judgment to us after what happened in Damascus and it is proved that , according to the Talmud , Christian blood must be used in making your Passover bread ? " The consuls were also present during much of the torture . When the chief rabbi , an Austrian subject , was tortured , he appealed to Austrian vice @-@ consul Anton Giuliani , who replied : " What rabbi ? What do you complain about ? So you are not dead yet . " 
 Some Jewish inhabitants of Rhodes accused the consuls of a conspiracy to exploit the case in order to eliminate Elias <unk> , a local Jew , who represented the business interests of Joel Davis , a Jewish businessman from London . Davis was rapidly increasing his share in the profitable sponge exports from the island , and he was a major business rival of the European consuls . Elias <unk> , however , was not among the persons held in the affair , calling that allegation into question . Other Jewish sources claimed that " [ t ] he consuls stated openly … their purpose of exterminating the Jews of Rhodes or to compel them to change their religion . " 
 = = European diplomatic involvement = = 
 In the first days of the blockade , someone managed to smuggle a letter out of the Jewish quarter to the Jewish leadership in Constantinople . It was not until March 27 that the leaders of the Jewish community in the Ottoman capital forwarded it to the Rothschild family , together with a similar call for help from the Jews of Damascus . To these documents , the Jewish leaders attached their own statement in which they cast doubt on their ability to influence the sultan . 
 The intervention of the Rothschilds bore the quickest fruit in Austria . The head of the Rothschild family bank in Vienna , Salomon Mayer von Rothschild , played the key role in raising financing for the Austrian Empire , and he had a very close relationship with the Austrian chancellor von Metternich . On April 10 , Metternich dispatched instruction regarding both the Damascus and Rhodes affairs to Bartholomäus von Stürmer , ambassador in Constantinople , and Anton von Laurin , consul in Alexandria . In his dispatch , Metternich wrote : " The accusation that Christians are deliberately murdered for some blood @-@ thirsty Passover festival is by its nature absurd … " Regarding the Rhodes case , the chancellor instructed von Stürmer " to tip the wink to the Turkish regime , so that they instruct pasha of Rhodes accordingly and that you let [ our ] vice @-@ consul in Rhodes know that in such cases he should work in the spirit of sensible mediation . " Von Stürmer , responded , " [ T ] here have been no persecutions against the Jewish population , at least not by the authorities . " 
 In the UK , it took the Jewish community longer to react to the calls for help from Rhodes and Damascus . The Board of Deputies of the British Jews convened on April 21 to discuss the blood libels . They resolved to request the British , Austrian , and French governments to intercede with the Ottoman government and stop the persecutions . The resolution condemning the ritual murder charges was published as a paid advertisement in 35 British journals ; it appeared twice in the most important newspapers . On April 30 , a delegation elected by the Board met with the foreign secretary Lord Palmerston , who called the blood libel a " calumny " and promised that " the influence of the British government should be exerted to put a stop to [ the ] atrocities . " In his dispatch of May 5 , the foreign secretary told Lord Ponsonby , the British ambassador in Constantinople , to communicate the material on the Rhodes affair to the Ottoman government " officially and in writing " and to " request … an immediate and strict inquiry to be made … especially into the allegation that these atrocities were committed at the instigation of the Christians and the European consuls . " 
 A consensus formed within the European diplomatic community in Constantinople that the persecution of the accused Jews had to be stopped . This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby , but also by von Stürmer , whose correspondence revealed that he was not at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews ; by the French ambassador Edouard <unk> , whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus ; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von <unk> . Consequently , the way was open for Lord Ponsonby , by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople , to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes .

 In response to Yusuf Pasha 's request , the Ottoman government sent its instructions to Rhodes , where they arrived at the end of April . The government would set up an official investigatory commission before which representatives of the Jewish and Greek communities were ordered to present their evidence . In mid @-@ May , the government sent orders to release the six remaining Jewish prisoners . On May 21 , they were ceremoniously called before the court ( shura ) and freed under the guarantees of the elders of the Jewish community . 
 The Christians responded to these actions of the central government with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air . The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks , and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews . When the Jews complained to the governor , he ordered the complainants subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado . The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor , who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls . On top of that , the governor ordered five other Jews arrested . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The Greek and Jewish delegations from Rhodes , each numbering five , arrived at Constantinople on May 10 . In the capital they were joined by the qadi , the French consul , and the Austrian vice @-@ consul . On May 26 , the investigatory tribunal held its first open session chaired by Rifaat Bey . The qadi argued that " the entire affair is the product of hatred ; [ and ] was instigated by the English and Austrian consuls alone . " The consuls insisted on the guilt of the Jews , and they presented a concurring written testimony from their colleagues who stayed on Rhodes . 
 The case dragged on for two more months , as the British ambassador insisted on bringing to light the facts implicating the Rhodes governor of torture . Finally , on July 21 the verdict was announced . In its first part , the case between " the Greek population of Rhodes , the plaintiff , and the Jewish population , defendant " , the result was acquittal . In its second part , Yusuf Pasha was dismissed from his post as governor of Rhodes because " he had permitted procedures to be employed against the Jews which are not authorized in any way by the law and which are expressly forbidden by the Hatt @-@ i Sharif of 3 November " . The British ambassador praised the investigation as one during which " [ t ] he affair of Rhodes was examined with fairness " and called the verdict " a signal proof of the justice and humanity with which the Sublime Porte acts . " 
 = = = Sultan 's firman = = = 
 In July 1840 , a delegation headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt to save the Jews of Damascus . Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali to transfer the investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges . However , their request was denied . The delegation , concerned primarily with the release of the imprisoned Jews of Damascus , decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel . The liberation order was issued on August 28 , 1840 , and , as a compromise , it stated explicitly that it was an act of justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler . 
 After completing his mission to Muhammad Ali , Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople . On October 15 , 1840 , in the Ottoman capital he had a meeting with Lord Ponsonby , to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent , the sultan should issue a decree ( firman ) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus . The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea , and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha . Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha , who responded encouragingly . 
 Montefiore 's audience with the sultan took place at the palace late in the evening on October 28 . Montefiore described in his diary that as he and his party were driving to the palace , " [ t ] he streets were crowded ; many of the Jews had illuminated their houses . " During the audience , Montefiore read aloud a formal address in which he thanked the sultan for his stand in the Rhodes case . In turn , the sultan assured his guests that their request would be granted . The firman was delivered to Montefiore on November 7 , and a copy was subsequently provided to the <unk> Bashi . Citing the judgment in the Rhodes case , the decree stated that a careful examination of Jewish beliefs and " religious books " had demonstrated that " the charges brought against them … are pure calumny . The Jewish nation shall possess the same privileges as are granted to the numerous other nations who submit to our authority . The Jewish nation shall be protected and defended . "

 Marvel Science Stories was a U.S. pulp magazine which published a total of fifteen issues in two separate runs , both edited by Robert O. Erisman . The publisher for the first run was Postal Publications , and the second run was published by Western Publishing ; both companies were owned by Abraham and Martin Goodman . It appeared in August 1938 , and carried stories with more sexual content than was usual for the genre , including several stories by Henry Kuttner , under his own name and also under pseudonyms . Reader reaction was generally negative , with one reader referring to Kuttner 's story " The Time Trap " as " trash " . The magazine was cancelled after the April 1941 issue , but when a boom in science fiction magazines began in 1950 , the publishers revived it . The first issue of the new series was dated November 1950 ; a further six issues appeared , with the last issue dated May 1952 . In addition to Kuttner , contributors to the first run included Arthur J. Burks and Jack Williamson ; the second run published stories by Arthur C. Clarke , Isaac Asimov , Jack Vance and L. Sprague de Camp , among others . The quality of the second incarnation of the magazine was better than the first , but it was unable to compete with the new , higher @-@ quality magazines that had appeared since the magazine 's first series . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Although science fiction ( sf ) had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback . After 1931 , when Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories was launched , no new science fiction magazines appeared for several years . In 1936 Abraham and Martin Goodman , two brothers who owned a publishing company with multiple imprints , launched Ka @-@ Zar , an imitation Tarzan magazine with some borderline sf content . It lasted for three issues , with the last issue dated January 1937 . In addition to this marginal science fiction magazine , in 1937 the Goodmans began publishing several " weird @-@ menace " pulps . These were a genre of pulp magazine known for incorporating " sex and sadism " , with story lines that placed women in danger , usually because of a threat that appeared to be supernatural but was ultimately revealed to be the work of a human villain . The Goodmans ' titles were Detective Short Stories , launched in August 1937 , and Mystery Tales , which published its first issue in March 1938 . These were followed up by Marvel Science Stories , edited by Robert O. Erisman , which was not intended to be a weird @-@ menace pulp , but an sf magazine . The influence of the " sex and sadism " side of the Goodman 's portfolio of magazines was apparent , however : authors were sometimes asked to add more sex to their stories than was usual in the science fiction field at the time . 
 The first issue contained " Survival " by Arthur J. Burks as the lead novel ; this was well received by the readers , and was free of any taint of sex . The first couple of issues contained several stories that did little to offend readers , but they also contained two stories by Henry Kuttner , who was selling regularly to the Goodman 's other publications . Erisman and the Goodmans had asked Kuttner to spice up his submissions to Marvel Science Stories . He obliged with " Avengers of Space " in the first issue , which included " scenes of aliens lusting after unclothed Earth women " , in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley ; and " The Time Trap " in the second issue . Reader reaction was strongly negative : a typical letter , from William Hamling , later to become a publisher and editor of science fiction magazines in his own right , commented , " I was just about to write you a letter of complete congratulations when my eyes fell upon Kuttner 's " The Time Trap " . All I can say is : PLEASE , in the future , dislodge such trash from your magazine " . In addition to these two stories published under Kuttner 's name , there were two more stories in the same two issues by him under pseudonyms which were equally offensive to readers such as Hamling . 
 After five issues , the title was changed to Marvel Tales ; at the same time the number of stories advertised as " passionate " or containing " sin @-@ lost " or " lust @-@ crazed " characters sharply increased . Though some of the stories contained little to match the titillating blurbs , there were some that did , with " women entrapped , burned and otherwise maltreated , and whips cracking into use with uninventive frequency " , according to sf historian Joseph Marchesani . The magazine ceased publication with the April 1941 issue , but in 1950 the Goodmans saw an opportunity to revive it when a new boom in science fiction magazines got under way . Erisman was still working for the Goodmans , and was listed as editorial director of the new version of the magazine , but much of the editorial work was done by Daniel Keyes , who was credited as " Editorial Associate " on the 1951 issues . The first issue of the new incarnation of Marvel Science Stories was dated November 1950 . After two issues Erisman switched the magazine to a digest format , but the final issue , dated May 1952 , was once again a pulp . The post @-@ war issues contained stories by well @-@ known writers , including Arthur C.

 Fairy Cube takes place in a fictional universe in which an Otherworld , inhabited by a variety of fairies and other nonhuman entities , exists alongside present @-@ day Earth . The series focuses on Ian Hasumi ( 羽住 <unk> , Hasumi Ian ) , a timid fifteen @-@ year @-@ old who sees fairies — invisible to normal people — and is stalked by Tokage ( <unk> , Tokage ) , a spiteful spirit only he can see . In his backstory , it is revealed that before the start of the series , his mother , Kureha Hasumi ( 羽住 <unk> , Hasumi Kureha ) left , causing his novelist father , Kazumi Hasumi ( 羽住 <unk> , Hasumi Kazumi ) , to burn wing marks on Ian 's back to prevent him from doing the same . Rin <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> Rin ) , Ian 's abused childhood friend and secret " crush " , later returns to the city where he lives after being separated for years . Stumbling upon the scene of a murder and seeing a man retrieve a cube from the victim 's body , Ian follows him back to an antique shop , where the man , actually a <unk> named Kaito ( <unk> , Kaito ) , gives him Tokage 's fairy cube — a cube belonging to a fairy that can allow the fairy to take over the human who has it . Soon after , Ian is killed by his own father , who was manipulated by Tokage , and now exists as a spirit , with Tokage possessing his body . Returning to Kaito 's shop and after a trip through the Otherworld with Ainsel ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a small yet powerful and vicious fairy in love with Kaito , Ian takes control of the body of a deceased young boy , Eriya Barnett ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Eriya <unk> ) . Moved by his determination , Ainsel agrees to aid him in his quest to regain his body . 
 Along the way , Ian encounters his maternal aunt Lise ( <unk> , Rise ) , a <unk> <unk> like Kureha , who explains that Kureha left before she completely drained the life force of Kazumi ; Shira Gotoh ( <unk> <unk> , Gotō Shira ) , a cross @-@ dressing girl born in the Otherworld who , as the chairperson for the multi @-@ million land development company Gotoh Group , aims to restore the environment for the fairies ; and Raven ( <unk> , <unk> ) , Shira 's supernatural bodyguard whose clan guards a " demon door " . Additionally , Ian learns that Tokage grew up in the Otherworld , abandoned by his parents Kureha and Kazumi , but loved by a non @-@ native fairy ; when his village tried to sacrifice him to the god of war and death , he slaughtered them and the god escaped . To infiltrate Gotoh Group , Rin allows herself to be captured , and under the pretense of a beauty contest , the company plans to harvest the energy of the fairy cubes and bystanders to open a " demon door " to the Otherworld . Ian rescues Rin , and the fairy god Balor is revealed to be inhabiting the body of Shira 's bedridden father and behind the plan . Ian eventually returns to his body through fairy magic , while Eriya 's body accepts Tokage . Having been held captive by Gotoh for most of the series , Kureha appears and before dying , reveals that Tokage is Ian 's stillborn twin . Shira is killed after cutting Balor 's life @-@ line , and Raven realizes that his fiancée , whom Kaito had seduced , had actually unsealed the demon door prior to the start of the series , angry with the two for playing with her feelings . Ainsel , secretly the consciousness of the door 's sealing spell , and Kaito die together as a sacrifice to seal the demon door , as Ian and Rin help by letting the people of earth glimpse the fairies and using the energy of their belief .

 Manga artist Kaori Yuki 's earlier , related short manga " Psycho Knocker " appeared in the October 2004 issues of the Japanese shōjo ( targeted towards girls ) manga magazine Hana to Yume published twice a month . It focuses on a pessimistic , heartbroken teenager who makes a pact with a lonely ghost , <unk> exchanging her life for two wishes . Chasing down spirits that have escaped from the demon door , Raven and Tokage rescue her from the ghost , a young girl who died suddenly , and seal a spirit which feeds on negative emotions . Yuki wrote the story as a reminder to herself not to be so pessimistic , a trait she shares with the teenage protagonist . 
 Yuki started Fairy Cube with the goal of writing a short series . Because of the story 's nature as a serial , she faced page limitations . When deciding on the ending , she considered having Ian and Rin as the sacrifice to close the demon door , but rejected it , feeling that it would be too unpleasant for the readers , although she expressed her fondness for sad endings . She was also unable to include Ian and Tokage 's newfound friendship , because Rin and Ian 's romantic relationship served as the focus of the story .

 The final volume placed at the 221st spot on ICv2 's list of the top 300 bestselling graphic novels for November 2008 , with an estimated 516 copies sold . 
 Writing for School Library Journal , Cara von Wrangel Kinsey found Fairy Cube " more accessible than Yuki 's previous works , " despite covering subjects such as murder and revenge . A. E. Sparrow of IGN gave the first volume a favorable review , enjoying the series ' different view of the fairies . Mania Entertainment 's Danielle Van Gorder wrote that the story reminded her of the pre @-@ Victorian version of the fairytale " Snow White " or the British Sidhe fairies , in her review of the first volume . Van Gorder worried that the cover would mislead readers into believing that it was " a light and fluffy kind of story " and drive away the target audience . In a follow @-@ up review of the final volume , she wrote that the conclusion of the series was less confusing than that of Yuki 's earlier work Angel Sanctuary ( 1994 – 2000 ) and thought the story was " well @-@ executed , " though it still had some flaws . Rating the series 3 out of 4 stars , Jason Thompson , author of Manga : The Complete Guide ( 2007 ) , wrote that while it reminded him of Angel Sanctuary , it covered " more original subject matter " and had " tighter " plotting . Anime News Network 's Casey Brienza highly recommended the first volume , praising her inclusion of Celtic mythology . She enjoyed the plot and described the cover as beautiful , though she disliked the artistic inconsistencies caused by Yuki 's use of assistants . According to Katherine Dacey of PopCultureShock in her review of the first volume , the story succeeded through Yuki 's use of " outlandish touches , " creating " an intoxicating — if occasionally ridiculous — mix of horror , romance , and revenge . " In her review of the final volume , Dacey expressed her feelings of annoyance that the characters spent much of the volume talking with very little action , and wrote that the story , despite a promising start , went downhill with the introduction of the beauty contest in the second volume . <unk> " Psycho Knocker " as " comeuppance theater , " she enjoyed it more than Fairy Cube 's conclusion , though still wrote that " it isn 't her best work . " A reviewer of the French edition disliked how quickly the story progressed , commenting that the protagonists ' personalities were not fully explored as a result . The reviewer praised the covers of the first and third volumes as " magnificent " . 
 = Bob Ferguson ( infielder ) = 
 Robert Vavasour Ferguson ( January 31 , 1845 – May 3 , 1894 ) was an American infielder , league official , manager and umpire in the early days of baseball , playing both before and after baseball became a professional sport . In addition to playing and managing , he served as president of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players from 1872 through 1875 , the sport 's first entirely professional league . His character and unquestioned honesty were highly regarded during a period in baseball history where the game 's reputation was badly damaged by gamblers and rowdy behavior by players and fans . However , his bad temper and stubbornness were traits that created trouble for him at times during his career , and caused him to be disliked by many . His nickname , " Death to Flying Things " , was derived from his greatness as a defensive player . 
 = = Early career = = 
 A native of Brooklyn , Ferguson played for two of New York 's earliest semi @-@ professional clubs in the late 1860s and early 1870s , the Atlantics and Mutuals . On June 14 , 1870 , Ferguson provided the hit that created the tying run and he later scored the winning run in a match against the famous Cincinnati Red Stockings , the first team that was composed entirely of professional players . This win brought to an end the Red Stockings ' 81 consecutive game winning streak . He is credited with being the first player to bat from both sides of home plate , known as switch @-@ hitting , but the practice was not popular at first . Among the explanations for this , it is claimed that , due to his personality , players did not want to emulate him . Managers , however , recognized the practice 's importance soon after , and began to play their players according to the opposing pitcher that day , known today as platooning , and the advantages that switch @-@ hitting posed would later become accepted strategic baseball philosophy , and many players began to experiment with the idea . 
 = = National Association = = 
 In 1871 , Ferguson took over the Mutual team as the player @-@ manager . In 33 games , he batted .241 , while the team finished with a 16 – 17 record , which put them in fifth place at the season 's end . As manager , Ferguson insisted upon implicit obedience from his men , but was forced to leave following the season due to heavy rumors of gambling surrounding the team . For the 1872 season , Ferguson re @-@ joined his Atlantics team , which was now a member of the National Association as well , and he would stay there through the 1874 season . In 1872 , he was elected by the players to be the president of the National Association , an office he held through the 1875 season , the last season of the Association . 
 On September 1 , 1872 , Ferguson arranged a benefit game for Al <unk> , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old left fielder for the Atlantics , who drowned during a fishing trip off Fort Hamilton , in New York Harbor . The old Brooklyn Atlantics and Members of the 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings played against each other in the benefit game . 
 While serving as a substitute umpire during a game between the Baltimore Canaries and Mutuals on July 24 , 1873 , Ferguson received continuous , loud , verbal abuse from Mutuals catcher Nat Hicks . Ferguson and Hicks got into an altercation at the conclusion of the game , which Ferguson ended by hitting Hicks in the left arm with a bat , breaking his arm in two places . Ferguson required a police escort to leave the playing field , and Hicks refused to press charges and the two reconciled afterwards . During the final season of the Association , he played and managed the Hartford Dark Blues . 
 = = National League = = 
 When the Association dissolved , his Hartford team was accepted into the National League for its inaugural season in 1876 , and Ferguson became a League Director . As a league official , he was involved in a landmark decision that season . The case involved Jim Devlin , pitcher for the Louisville Grays . Devlin wanted to be released from his contract , claiming that Louisville had failed to fulfill the terms of his contract . Surrounding Devlin were rumors that he took money from gamblers to throw games , known in the day as " <unk> " . Ferguson , along with fellow league directors , ruled in favor of the Grays ' Vice @-@ President Charles Chase , and Devlin was ordered to remain with the Grays . The following season , Devlin and three other teammates , SS / 2B Bill <unk> , OF George Hall and 3B Al Nichols would receive life suspensions for throwing games . Devlin attempted to gain reinstatement for a number of years , but this was never granted . 
 The Dark Blues had turned to Ferguson to play for and manage the team because of his reputation as the most authoritarian captain in the game . He was an honest and upstanding citizen in a time when not many ballplayers could say the same . However , he was also a domineering , dictatorial captain with a violent streak . Team discipline did improve in his first season , but his overbearing ways proved divisive , causing the team to bicker amongst themselves . Ferguson 's temper would flare up often , even when the team was winning . The Chicago Tribune reported that if anyone on the Hartford nine committed an error , " Ferguson [ would ] swear until everything looks blue . " He was particularly rough on second baseman Jack Burdock , who on more than one occasion heard his captain publicly threaten " to ram his fist down Burdock 's throat . " Some players tolerated his behavior ; others , however , refused to comply . Shortstop Tom Carey and center fielder Jack Remsen did not hesitate to yell back , while Burdock and pitcher Candy Cummings , on the other hand , often sulked . The situation in Hartford came to a head after a tough loss to the Red Stockings , a game in which Ferguson had committed several errors . Hartford 's main pitcher , Tommy Bond , suggested that Ferguson was " crooked " . Ferguson denied the charge , and Bond quickly retracted his statement , claiming that he said it in anger . Bond then requested that he be able to leave the team because he could not play for Ferguson , a request that was granted by league president Morgan Bulkeley , a former owner of the Dark Blues . 
 Hartford finished third in both of its two seasons in the National League , and when the team folded , Ferguson became the new Chicago White Stockings player @-@ manager . It would be his only season in Chicago . Al Spalding had hired Ferguson to captain his Chicago team because of his reputation , openly saying that he admired Ferguson 's style and leadership that made the Hartford teams successful . Ferguson personally had his most successful season as a player that season , as he batted .351 , which was third in the league , led the league in on @-@ base percentage , tied for fourth in runs batted in , and ranked fourth in hits . Unfortunately , the White Stockings finished at .500 , and in Spalding 's memoirs he called Ferguson " tactless " and hopelessly lacking any knowledge " of the subtle science of handling men by strategy rather than by force . " Cap Anson would eventually take over that role in 1879 . 
 Ferguson again moved on , this time accepting the player @-@ manager role with the new Troy Trojans team who began their time in the National League in 1879 , and would stay in that role until the team folded after the 1882 season . In 1883 , he became the first manager in the history of the Philadelphia Phillies franchise , which was known at the time as the Quakers , but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17 games . On August 21 of that season , his Quakers traveled to Providence , Rhode Island to play the Grays . To increase ticket sales , he gave the day 's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes that Hagan 's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game . The strategy worked , but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run . Financially sound decision as it was , a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson was labeled a sadist for not relieving Hagen . 
 = = American Association = = 
 Ferguson 's last two managerial positions were in the American Association . He was player @-@ manager for the Pittsburgh <unk> , who later became the Pittsburgh Pirates , in 1884 and later took over the managerial role for parts of two seasons with the New York Metropolitans . Overall , as manager , his teams won 417 games and lost 516 , for a winning percentage of .447 , and never finished higher than the third @-@ place finishes his Trojans achieved . The totals reflect his time in the National Association as well as the National League and American Association . 
 = = Umpiring career = = 
 Ferguson had , on numerous occasions during his playing and managerial career , served as a substitute umpire , but did not start doing it full @-@ time until after his departure from Philadelphia . In 1888 , he became a full @-@ time professional umpire , working in the American Association , and later in the Players ' League in 1890 . By the end of the 1890 season he had passed Kick Kelly to take over the record for career games as an umpire with 650 ; John Gaffney surpassed his final total of 786 in 1893 . Ferguson officially umpired 804 games if his National Association games are taken into account , and his career came to a close after the 1891 season . On his umpiring philosophy , he once stated " Umpiring always came as easy to me " , he said , " as sleeping on a <unk> . Never change a decision , never stop to talk to a man . Make ' em play ball and keep their mouths shut , and never fear but the people will be on your side and you 'll be called the king of umpires . "

 Ferguson died in Brooklyn of apoplexy at the age of 49 . Initially buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn , he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery , also in the borough of Brooklyn . Despite his career that was filled with incidents of turmoil between him and his players and other baseball people , his funeral , which was held at his home , was quickly crowded , as was the front stoop . Eventually , they had to turn people away . 
 = Too Tough to Die = 
 Too Tough to Die is the eighth studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones . It was released on October 1 , 1984 , and is the first Ramones record to feature Richie Ramone on drums . With ex @-@ member Tommy Ramone producing , the recording process was similar to that of the band 's 1976 debut album , Ramones . Likewise , the record 's style — both lyrically and compositionally — saw the band returning to their roots . The photograph on the album cover , which features silhouettes of the band members , resulted from a " lucky accident " after photographer George DuBose 's camera malfunctioned . 
 The album 's overall style leaned toward that of hardcore punk and heavy metal music , rather than pop music which had been a focus of several of the band 's previous albums . Too Tough to Die borrows upon elements such as guitar riffs from 1983 's Subterranean Jungle . For the second time , after " Time Bomb " on Subterranean Jungle , bassist Dee Dee Ramone performs lead vocals on the album and receives vocal credits for two tracks . The album also contains the band 's only instrumental piece , " Durango 95 " . 
 Critics appreciated the band 's return to earlier methods of writing , recording , and production , noting they had strayed from the pop music genre . Despite critical acclaim , Too Tough to Die performed poorly in album sales . At this point in their career , the album was the band 's lowest peaking record on the Billboard 200 . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 The recording of Too Tough to Die began in the summer of 1984 at the Media Sound Studios in New York City . The album 's recording process used similar techniques which were used to record their 1976 eponymous album , with Rolling Stone 's Kurt Loder describing it as " virtually live in the studio . " The album marked the debut of new drummer Richie Ramone , who replaced Marky Ramone after he was fired for excessive drinking . The album 's lyrics were written mainly by guitarist Johnny Ramone and bassist Dee Dee Ramone , while lead singer Joey Ramone did not participate in the process because he " wasn 't feeling well " prior to recording . Joey did , however , write the lyrics for " Daytime Dilemma ( Dangers of Love ) " after receiving help with the guitar part by Daniel Rey . Johnny Ramone recalled : 
 As we got ready to make Too Tough To Die , we were focused in the same direction , and it made a difference . We knew we needed to get back to the kind of harder material we 'd become known for . The pop stuff hadn 't really worked , and we knew we were much better off doing what we did best . 
 Previous Ramones records featured celebrity record producers in an attempt to gain some sort of popularity . Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting , Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978 's Road to Ruin : Ed Stasium and ex @-@ band member Tommy Ramone . Too Tough to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones . Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams , the band leaned towards a harsher sound . 
 Too Tough to Die was also the first of three studio albums that were licensed from Sire Records to the independent record label Beggars Banquet Records for release in the UK . The deal saw the group 's work promoted better and resulted placings on the UK album and singles charts . The group had not charted in the UK since 1980 's End of the Century .

 The cover photo for the album was taken by photographer George DuBose in a subway in Central Park , New York City , near the Central Park Zoo . In the photo , the band members are standing side @-@ by @-@ side underneath an underpass arch , with their dark silhouettes illuminated in the background with blue lighting and dry ice fog . Johnny wanted the artwork to conceptually refer to the A Clockwork Orange film , released in 1971 . DuBose relates : " Johnny wanted a picture that would evoke memories of the gang in A Clockwork Orange . " DuBose also stated that the band did not need their faces on the cover because they had grown significantly in popularity ; however , he originally intended to include their faces . The photograph on the album cover was a " lucky accident " after DuBose 's camera malfunctioned and he unintentionally shot the band members in silhouette . 
 = = Music and compositions = = 
 Just as the recording methods resembled that of the band 's 1970 's era , the musical style which they produced also favored the band 's earlier approach to punk rock . Even though " Howling at the Moon ( Sha @-@ La @-@ La ) " featured a synthpop feel , the overall genre leaned more so toward heavy metal music rather than pop music , which had been a major focus of the band 's writing process throughout the 1980s . Authors Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz explained : 
 With Tommy Ramone / Erdelyi and Ed Stadium returning as producers , the album was , to some degree , the Ramones ' response to America 's burgeoning hard @-@ core punk scene , and did much to restore the band 's musical <unk> ... Too Tough to Die reclaimed the Ramone 's original values of energy , catchiness , and brevity without resorting to retro pandering . It also featured the band 's strongest set of songs since Rocket to Russia , with Dee Dee ( who wrote or co @-@ wrote nine of the album 's thirteen songs ) demonstrating a thoughtful , introspective edge on ' I 'm Not Afraid of Life ' and an apocalyptic social conscience on ' Planet Earth <unk> 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the album uses the " big guitar riffs " featured on Subterranean Jungle and transfigures them to be " shorter and heavier . " The songs featured on the album are mostly rather short and have a considerably fast tempo , which was a typical quality of the band 's early work . The album features the only instrumental piece which the band released : " Durango 95 , " which clocks in at under a minute , being the shortest Ramones track on a studio album . ( Interestingly , the album also includes one of the longest Ramones studio recordings , " Daytime Dilemma ( Dangers of Love ) " on side two . ) " Durango 95 " ' s name is a reference to a car driven in A Clockwork Orange . 
 Too Tough to Die is also the first Ramones ' release which did not feature lead singer Joey Ramone on each track ; both " Wart Hog " and Endless Vacation " feature bassist Dee Dee Ramone as lead vocalist . Initially , " Wart Hog " ' s appearance on the album was declined by Joey , but Johnny argued for including the song , later stating , " If I hadn 't lobbied for them , they wouldn 't be on the [ album ] . " The lyrics to the song were not included on the initial printing of the album because Sire considered the drug @-@ inspired lyrics to be too explicit for potential fans . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Too Tough to Die was generally well received by critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it " the last great record [ the Ramones ] would ever make " and noted that the use of Tommy Ramone as the album 's producer was beneficial since it aided in the group returning " to simple , scathing punk rock . " He also stated that the album reads " like a reaction to hardcore punk , " while still maintaining their more melodic style in songs . Music critic Robert Christgau also suggested that the album 's sound was a retreat to their earlier styles " with the cleansing minimalism of their original conception evoked , " saying their initial sound is " augmented rather than recycled . " Kurt Loder of the Rolling Stone concluded his review by saying that " Too Tough to Die is a return to fighting trim by the kings of stripped @-@ down rock & roll . " 
 The album was the band 's lowest peaking record at that point in their career , debuting at number 171 on the US Billboard 200 . It also peaked at number 49 on the Swedish Sverigetopplistan chart , and in a revival of fortunes spent three weeks on the UK Albums Chart where it peaked at number 63 . The only single released from the album , " Howling at the Moon ( Sha @-@ La @-@ La ) " ( backed with " Wart Hog " in the US and " Chasing the Night " in the UK ) peaked at number 85 on the UK Singles Chart , where it spent two weeks .

 According to the Nielsen Media Research , " Speak Now or Forever Hold Your Piece " was watched by a total of 4 @.@ 69 million people in its original American broadcast . It earned a 1 @.@ 6 rating / 5 share in the 18 – 49 demographic . It was viewed by 1 @.@ 3 million people within the 18 – 49 demographic , and 1 @.@ 3 million people in 25 – 54 demographic . The installment was the seventh most watched basic cable program for its air date in the 18 – 49 demographic . This was a slight decrease from the show 's previous episode , " Spellingg Bee " , which was viewed by 4 @.@ 71 million viewers , or 3 @.@ 35 million households . After its airing on August 14 on NBC , the episode was viewed by 4 million households , and received a 1 @.@ 3 rating / 4 share in the 18 – 49 demographic . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mixed reviews . In his review for IGN , contributor Colin Moriarty heavily criticized the episode and show , calling them , " at best , a mediocre adventure in detective comedy television " . He considered the episode " mindless " when compared to Monk , which preceded the episode . Moriarty stated that , when not comparing Psych to other shows , the episode is still " making you wonder what the hell is going on in the minds of the show 's writers and producers " . He questioned the show 's ability to last due to having to continue the fake psychic concept , and called detectives Lassiter and O 'Hara " completely unlikeable " . Moriarty stated that things in the installment " simply don 't make any sense " . He questioned whether the show would be able to last more than one season , and said that " we highly recommend you continue to take a pass on Psych and save yourself from the mindlessness of it all " . The installment was given a rating of 6 , or " okay " , tying it for the lowest rated episode of the season , with the preceding episode , " Spellingg Bee " . 
 However , in his review for TV Squad , writer Richard Keller praised the episode , calling it " a very good episode for both James Roday and <unk> Hill " . He stated that he " really liked this week 's episode " , and that " After testing the waters in the first two programs both Shawn and Gus really did some heavy detective work this episode " . He also praised the rotating of Shawn 's abilities , saying that " it showed that Psych could be more than just a one trick pony " . He compared Roday to Ben Stiller , and called the scene involving Gus after the bachelorette party the best of the episode . Keller declared that " Psych is finally settling into its niche and , hopefully , will only get stronger from here " . 
 = Nibiru cataclysm = 
 The Nibiru cataclysm is a supposed disastrous encounter between the Earth and a large planetary object ( either a collision or a near @-@ miss ) which certain groups believe will take place in the early 21st century . Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Planet X or Nibiru . The idea that a planet @-@ sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected as pseudoscience and an internet hoax by astronomers and planetary scientists . 
 The idea was first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder , founder of the website ZetaTalk . Lieder describes herself as a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials from the Zeta Reticuli star system through an implant in her brain . She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003 ( though that date was later postponed ) causing Earth to undergo a physical pole shift that would destroy most of humanity . The prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder 's website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups , most of which linked the event to the 2012 phenomenon . Since 2012 , the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media ; usually linked to <unk> astronomical objects such as Comet ISON or Planet Nine . Although the name " Nibiru " is derived from the works of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin and his interpretations of Babylonian and Sumerian mythology , he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The idea of the Nibiru encounter originated with Nancy Lieder , a Wisconsin woman who claims that as a girl she was contacted by gray extraterrestrials called Zetas , who implanted a communications device in her brain . In 1995 , she founded the website ZetaTalk to disseminate her ideas . Lieder first came to public attention on Internet newsgroups during the build @-@ up to Comet Hale – Bopp 's 1997 perihelion . She stated , claiming to speak as the Zetas , that " The Hale @-@ Bopp comet does not exist . It is a fraud , perpetrated by those who would have the teeming masses quiescent until it is too late . Hale @-@ Bopp is nothing more than a distant star , and will draw no closer . " She claimed that the Hale @-@ Bopp story was manufactured to distract people from the imminent arrival of a large planetary object , " Planet X " , which would soon pass by Earth and destroy civilization . After Hale @-@ Bopp 's perihelion revealed it as one of the brightest and longest @-@ observed comets of the last century , Lieder removed the first two sentences of her initial statement from her site , though they can still be found in Google 's archives . Her claims eventually made the New York Times . 
 Lieder described Planet X as roughly four times the size of the Earth , and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27 , 2003 , resulting in the Earth 's rotation ceasing for exactly 5 @.@ 9 terrestrial days . This would be followed by the Earth 's pole destabilising in a pole shift ( a physical pole shift , with the Earth 's pole physically moving , rather than a geomagnetic reversal ) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth 's core and the magnetism of the passing planet . This in turn would disrupt the Earth 's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth 's crust . 
 After Lieder , the first person to propagate her Planet X idea was Mark Hazlewood , a former member of the ZetaTalk community , who in 2001 published a book titled <unk> : Planet X Passes in 2003 . Lieder would later accuse him of being a confidence trickster . A Japanese cult called the Pana Wave Laboratory , which blocked off roads and rivers with white cloths to protect itself from electromagnetic attacks , also warned that the world would end in May 2003 after the approach of a tenth planet . 
 Roughly a week before the supposed arrival of Planet X in May 2003 , Lieder appeared on KROQ @-@ FM radio in Los Angeles , and advised listeners to euthanize their pets in anticipation of the event as she had done . This led the Fortean Times to conclude that she had put down her dog ( s ) to save them from further suffering during the Pole Shift . Later , in a 2004 interview she said that she had euthanized her dog because it was acting aggressively . After the 2003 date passed without incident , Lieder said that it was merely a " white lie ... to fool the establishment . " She refused to disclose the true date , saying that to do so would give those in power enough time to declare martial law and trap people in cities during the shift , leading to their deaths . Though Lieder herself has not specified a new date for the object 's return , many groups have taken up her idea and cited their own dates . One frequently cited date was December 21 , 2012 . This date had many apocalyptic associations , as it was the end of a cycle ( <unk> ) in the long count in the Mayan calendar . Several writers published books connecting the encounter with 2012 . Despite that date having passed , many websites still contend that Nibiru / Planet X is en route to Earth . 
 In 2012 , Lieder claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama futilely attempted to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun . After 2012 , she claimed that several world leaders had intended to announce the presence of Nibiru near the sun on October 20 , 2014 . Two weeks after the supposed date of announcement , she claimed that it did not occur because of consternation amongst the establishment . 
 = = = Zecharia Sitchin and Sumer = = = 
 Although Lieder originally referred to the object as " Planet X " , it has become deeply associated with Nibiru , a planet from the works of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin , particularly his book The 12th Planet . According to Sitchin 's interpretation of Babylonian religious texts , which contradicts conclusions reached by credited scholars on the subject , a giant planet ( called Nibiru or Marduk ) passes by Earth every 3 @,@ 600 years and allows its sentient inhabitants to interact with humanity . These beings , which Sitchin identified with the <unk> of Sumerian myth , would become humanity 's first gods . Lieder first made the connection between Nibiru and her Planet X on her site in 1996 ( " Planet X does exist , and it is the 12th Planet , one and the same . " ) . 
 However , Sitchin , who died in 2010 , denied any connection between his work and Lieder 's claims . In 2007 , partly in response to Lieder 's proclamations , Sitchin published a book , The End of Days , which set the time for the last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC , which would mean , given the object 's supposed 3 @,@ 600 @-@ year orbit , that it would return sometime around AD 2900 . He did however say that he believed that the <unk> might return earlier by spaceship , and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius , sometime between 2090 and 2370 . 
 = = Scientific rejection = = 
 Astronomers reject the idea of Nibiru , and have made efforts to inform the public that there is no threat to Earth . They point out that such an object so close to Earth would be easily visible to the naked eye . A planet such as Nibiru would create noticeable effects in the orbits of the outer planets . Some counter this by claiming that the object has been concealed behind the Sun for several years , though this would be geometrically impossible . Most photographs showing " Nibiru " by the Sun are in fact of lens flares , false images of the Sun created by reflections within the lens . 
 Astronomer Mike Brown notes that if this object 's orbit were as described , it would only have lasted in the Solar System for a million years or so before Jupiter expelled it , and that there is no way another object 's magnetic field could have such an effect on Earth . Lieder 's assertions that the approach of Nibiru would cause the Earth 's rotation to stop or its axis to shift violate the laws of physics . In his rebuttal of Immanuel <unk> 's Worlds in Collision , which made the same claim that the Earth 's rotation could be stopped and then restarted , Carl Sagan noted that , " the energy required to brake the Earth is not enough to melt it , although it would result in a noticeable increase in temperature : The oceans would [ be ] raised to the boiling point of water ... [ Also , ] how does the Earth get started up again , rotating at approximately the same rate of spin ? The Earth cannot do it by itself , because of the law of the conservation of angular momentum . " 
 In a 2009 interview with the Discovery Channel , Mike Brown noted that , while it is not impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion , such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets . A Mars @-@ sized object could lie undetected at 300 AU ( 10 times the distance of Neptune ) ; a Jupiter @-@ sized object at 30 @,@ 000 AU . To travel 1000 AU in two years , an object would need to be moving at 2400 km / s – faster than the galactic escape velocity . At that speed , any object would be shot out of the Solar System , and then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space . 
 = = Conspiracy theories = = 
 Many believers in the imminent approach of Planet X / Nibiru accuse NASA of deliberately covering up visual evidence of its existence . One such accusation involves the IRAS infrared space observatory , launched in 1983 . The satellite briefly made headlines due to an " unknown object " that was at first described as " possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System " . This newspaper article has been cited by proponents of the Nibiru cataclysm , beginning with Lieder herself , as evidence for the existence of Nibiru . However , further analysis revealed that of several initially unidentified objects , nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was " galactic cirrus " ; none were found to be Solar System bodies . 
 Another accusation frequently made by websites predicting the collision is that the U.S. government built the South Pole Telescope ( SPT ) to track Nibiru 's trajectory , and that the object has been imaged optically . However , the SPT ( which is not funded by NASA ) is a radio telescope , and cannot take optical images . Its South Pole location was chosen due to the low @-@ humidity environment , and there is no way an approaching object could be seen only from the South Pole . The " picture " of Nibiru posted on YouTube was revealed , in fact , to be a Hubble image of the expanding light echo around the star <unk> Mon . 
 Another conspiracy claim regards a patch of missing data in Google Sky near the constellation of Orion , which has often been cited as evidence that Nibiru has been redacted . However , the same region of sky can still be viewed by thousands of amateur astronomers . A scientist at Google said that the missing data is due to a glitch in the stitching software used to piece the images together . 
 Another piece of claimed evidence drawn from Google Sky is the carbon star CW Leonis , which is the brightest object in the 10 μm infrared sky and is frequently claimed to be Nibiru . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Believers in Planet X / Nibiru have given it many names since it was first proposed . All are , in fact , names for other real , hypothetical or imaginary Solar System objects that bear little resemblance either to the planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin . 
 = = = Planet X = = = 
 Lieder drew the name Planet X from the hypothetical planet once searched for by astronomers to account for discrepancies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune . In 1894 , Bostonian astronomer Percival Lowell became convinced that the planets Uranus and Neptune had slight discrepancies in their orbits . He concluded that they were being tugged by the gravity of another , more distant planet , which he called " Planet X " . However , nearly a century of searching failed to turn up any evidence for such an object ( Pluto was initially believed to be Planet X , but was later determined to be too small ) . In 1992 , astronomer Myles Standish showed that the supposed discrepancies in the planets ' orbits were illusory , the product of overestimating the mass of Neptune . Today astronomers accept that Planet X , at least as originally defined , does not exist . 
 = = = Hercolubus = = = 
 In 1999 , New Age author V. M. <unk> wrote in Hercolubus or Red Planet that Barnard 's star is actually a planet known to the ancients as Hercolubus , which purportedly came dangerously close to Earth in the past , destroying Atlantis , and will come close to Earth again . Lieder subsequently used <unk> 's ideas to bolster her claims . 
 Barnard 's star has been directly measured to be 5 @.@ 98 ± 0 @.@ 003 light years from Earth ( 35 @.@ 15 trillion miles ) . While it is approaching Earth , Barnard 's Star will not make its closest approach to the Sun until around 11 @,@ 700 AD , when it will approach to within some 3 @.@ 8 light @-@ years . This is only slightly closer than the closest star to the Sun ( Proxima Centauri ) lies today . 
 = = = Nemesis = = = 
 Believers in Planet X / Nibiru have often confused it with Nemesis , a hypothetical star first proposed by physicist Richard A. Muller . In 1984 , Muller postulated that mass extinctions were not random , but appeared to occur in the fossil record with a loose periodicity that ranged from 26 to 34 million years . He attributed this supposed pattern to a heretofore undetected companion to the Sun , either a dim red dwarf or a brown dwarf , lying in an elliptical , 26 @-@ million @-@ year orbit . This object , which he named Nemesis , would , once every 26 million years , pass through the Oort cloud , the shell of over a trillion icy objects believed to be the source of long @-@ period comets that orbit at thousands of times Pluto 's distance from the Sun . Nemesis 's gravity would then disturb the comets ' orbits and send them into the inner Solar System , causing the Earth to be bombarded . However , to date no direct evidence of Nemesis has been found . Though the idea of Nemesis appears similar to the Nibiru cataclysm , they are , in fact , very different , as Nemesis , if it existed , would have an orbital period thousands of times longer , and would never come near Earth itself . 
 = = = Sedna or Eris = = = 
 Still others confuse Nibiru with Sedna ( 90377 Sedna ) or Eris ( 136199 Eris ) , trans @-@ Neptunian objects discovered by Mike Brown in 2003 and 2005 respectively . However , despite having been described as a " tenth planet " in an early NASA press release , Eris ( Then known only as 2003 UB313 ) is now classified as a dwarf planet . Only slightly more massive than Pluto , Eris has a well @-@ determined orbit that never takes it closer than 5 @.@ 5 billion km from the Earth . Sedna is slightly smaller than Pluto , and never comes closer to Earth than 11 @.@ 4 billion km . Mike Brown believes the confusion results from both the real Eris and the imaginary Nibiru having extremely elliptical orbits . 
 = = = Tyche = = = 
 Others have tied it to Tyche ; the name proposed by John Matese and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette for an object they believe to be influencing the orbits of comets in the Oort cloud . In February , 2011 , Whitmire and his colleagues took their hypothesis to the public in an article in The Independent , in which they named the object " Tyche " and claimed that evidence for its existence would be found once data from the WISE infrared telescope was collated , leading to a spike in calls to astronomers . The name , after the " good sister " of the Greek goddess Nemesis , was chosen to distinguish it from the similar Nemesis hypothesis as , unlike Nemesis , Matese and Whitmire do not believe that their object poses a threat to Earth . Also , this object , if it exists , would , like Nemesis , have an orbit hundreds of times longer than that proposed for Nibiru , and never come near the inner Solar System . In 2014 , NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out the existence of Tyche as its proponents had defined it . 
 = = = Comet Elenin = = = 
 Some associated Nibiru with Comet Elenin , a long @-@ period comet discovered by Russian astronomer Leonid Elenin on December 10 , 2010 . On October 16 , 2011 , Elenin made its closest approach to the Earth at a distance of 0 @.@ <unk> AU ( 34 @,@ 980 @,@ 000 km ; 21 @,@ 730 @,@ 000 mi ) , which is slightly closer than the planet Venus . Nevertheless , in the leadup to its closest approach , claims spread on conspiracy websites concluded that it was on a collision course , that it was as large as Jupiter or even a brown dwarf , and even that the name of the discoverer , Leonid Elenin , was in fact code for <unk> , or an Extinction Level Event . 
 Although the sizes of comets are difficult to determine without close observation , Comet Elenin is likely to be less than 10 km in diameter . Elenin himself estimates that the comet nucleus is roughly 3 – 4 km in diameter . This would make it millions of times smaller than the supposed Nibiru . Comet hysteria is not uncommon . Attempts have been made to correlate Elenin 's alignments with the 2011 Japan earthquake , the 2010 Canterbury earthquake , and 2010 Chile earthquake ; however , even discounting Elenin 's tiny size , earthquakes are driven by forces within the earth , and cannot be triggered by the passage of nearby objects . In 2011 , Leonid Elenin ran a simulation on his blog in which he increased the mass of the comet to that of a brown dwarf ( 0 @.@ 05 solar masses ) . He demonstrated that its gravity would have caused noticeable changes in the orbit of Saturn years before its arrival in the inner Solar System . 
 In August , 2011 , Comet Elenin began to disintegrate , and by the time of its closest approach in October 2011 the comet was undetected even by large ground @-@ based telescopes . 
 = = = Comet ISON = = = 
 On 21 September 2012 , Vitali <unk> and <unk> <unk> , using the International Scientific Optical Network of telescopes ( ISON ) , discovered the comet C / 2012 S1 , popularly known as " Comet ISON " . Its orbit was expected to take it within 0 @.@ 429 AU ( 64 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 km ; 39 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 mi ) of Earth on 26 December 2013 . Nonetheless , believers tied it to the Nibiru cataclysm , claiming it would hit the Earth on that date , or that it would fragment and pieces of it would hit the Earth . Images of the " fragments " of the comet circulating on the internet were shown to be camera artifacts . On April 30 , 2013 , the Hubble Space Telescope took three pictures of the comet over the course of 12 hours , which were published as a composite in Hubble 's archives . This led to speculation on conspiracy sites that the comet had split into 3 pieces , or even that it was a UFO . After ISON passed perihelion on 28 November , it rapidly began to fade , leaving many to suspect that it had been destroyed as it passed the Sun . While a dim remnant did eventually return round the Sun , it was generally accepted to be a cloud of dust , rather than a solid object . On 2 December 2013 , the <unk> ( NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign ) officially announced that Comet ISON had fully disintegrated . The Hubble Space Telescope failed to detect fragments of ISON on 18 December 2013 . On 8 May 2014 , a detailed examination of the comet disintegration was published , suggesting that the comet fully disintegrated hours before perihelion . 
 = = = Planet Nine = = = 
 In March 2014 , astronomers Chad Trujillo and Scott Sheppard published a paper in Nature arguing that the apparent clustering of the arguments of perihelion of distant trans @-@ Neptunian objects suggested the existence of a large trans @-@ Neptunian planet . On January 20 , 2016 , Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin announced that they had corroborated Trujillo and Sheppard 's findings , and that they believed the planet , which they dubbed " Planet Nine " , would have a mass roughly ten times that of the Earth , and a semimajor axis of approximately 400 – 1500 AU ( 60 – 225 billion km ) . Believers in Nibiru and the Nibiru cataclysm immediately argued that this constituted evidence for their claims . However , astronomers pointed out that this planet , if it exists , would have a perihelion ( closest approach to the Sun ) of roughly 200 AU , or 30 billion km . 
 In March 2016 , believers in the Nibiru cataclysm began to suggest that the month marked the true date for Nibiru 's arrival and the destruction of Earth . That same month , the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society published a paper by Daniel Whitmire ( who had proposed the existence of Tyche ) in which he reconsidered a modified version of the Nemesis model he had first proposed in 1985 in light of recent speculations concerning the possibility of a trans @-@ Neptunian planet . The hypothesis argues that an object far closer to the Sun than Nemesis could have a similar effect if its orbit <unk> at a rate thousands of times slower than its actual speed , which would mean it might only interact with the Kuiper belt every 27 million years , potentially sending comets into the inner Solar System and triggering mass extinctions . However , the paper had been initially published online in November 2015 , before Brown and Batygin went public with Planet Nine , and concerns a different object far closer to the Sun ( 100 AU vs. ~ 600 AU ) ; Planet Nine , if it exists , is too far away , says Brown , to have such an effect on the Kuiper belt . Nonetheless , an article in the British tabloid The Sun ( later republished in the New York Post ) conflated the three ideas of Nibiru , Planet Nine and Whitmire 's planet to suggest that not only had Planet Nine been found , but that it would collide with Earth at the end of April , which resulted in Batygin receiving a spike in panicked calls . 
 = = Public reaction = = 
 The impact of the public fear of the Nibiru cataclysm has been especially felt by professional astronomers . In 2008 , Mike Brown said that Nibiru was the most common pseudoscientific topic he was asked about . 
 Before his retirement after 2012 , David Morrison , director of SETI , CSI Fellow and Senior Scientist at NASA 's Astrobiology Institute at Ames Research Center , said he received 20 to 25 emails a week about the impending arrival of Nibiru : some frightened , others angry and naming him as part of the conspiracy to keep the truth of the impending apocalypse from the public , and still others asking whether or not they should kill themselves , their children or their pets . Half of these emails are from outside the U.S. " Planetary scientists are being driven to distraction by Nibiru , " notes science writer Govert Schilling , " And it is not surprising ; you devote so much time , energy and creativity to fascinating scientific research , and find yourself on the tracks of the most amazing and interesting things , and all the public at large is concerned about is some crackpot theory about clay tablets , god @-@ astronauts and a planet that doesn 't exist . " In a similar vein , Professor Brian Cox Tweeted in 2012 that , " If anyone else asks me about " Nibiru " the imaginary bullshit planet I will slap them around their irrational heads with Newton 's Principia . " Prior to the 2012 date , Morrison stated that he hoped that the non @-@ arrival of Nibiru could serve as a teaching moment for the public , instructing them on " rational thought and baloney detection " , but doubted that would happen . 
 Morrison noted in a lecture recorded on <unk> that there was a huge disconnect between the large number of people on the Internet who believed in Nibiru 's arrival and the majority of scientists who have never heard of it . To date he is the only major NASA scientist to speak out regularly against the Nibiru phenomenon . 
 = = Cultural influence = = 
 A viral marketing campaign for Sony Pictures ' 2009 film 2012 , directed by Roland Emmerich , which depicts the end of the world in the year 2012 , featured a supposed warning from the " Institute for Human Continuity " that listed the arrival of Planet X as one of its doomsday scenarios . Mike Brown attributed a spike in concerned emails and phone calls he received from the public to this site . Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier drew inspiration from Nibiru for his 2011 apocalyptic film Melancholia . 
 The 2010 animated television series Scooby @-@ Doo ! Mystery Incorporated features Nibiru as a major plot point in its second season , tying the apocalyptic event with its mythological namesake . 
 = Siege of Güns = 
 The Siege of Güns or Siege of Kőszeg ( Turkish : Güns Kuşatması ) was a siege of Kőszeg ( German : Güns ) in the Kingdom of Hungary within the Habsburg Empire , that took place in 1532 . In the siege , the defending forces of the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy under the leadership of Croatian Captain Nikola Jurišić ( Hungarian : Miklós <unk> ) , defended the small border fort of Kőszeg with only 700 – 800 Croatian soldiers , with no cannons and few guns . The defenders prevented the advance of the Ottoman army of 120 @,@ 000 – 200 @,@ 000 toward Vienna , under the leadership of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ( Ottoman Turkish : سليمان Süleymān ) and Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha . 
 The exact outcome is unknown , since it has two versions which differ depending on the source . In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms , and in the second version , the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender . Suleiman , having been delayed nearly four weeks , withdrew at the arrival of the August rains , and did not continue towards Vienna as he had intended , but turned homeward . 
 Suleiman secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several other forts , but after the Ottoman withdrawal , Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I reoccupied some of the devastated territory . Following this , Suleiman and Ferdinand concluded a 1533 treaty in Constantinople that confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary , but recognised Ferdinand 's possession of some of the reoccupied territory . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 29 August 1526 , at the Battle of Mohács , the Christian forces led by King Louis II were defeated by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent . Louis was killed in the battle , which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary as he died without an heir . Both the Kingdoms of Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires . Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand I , who was a brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V , married the sister of Louis II and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia . 
 The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and John Zápolya from Transylvania , since Suleiman had promised to make Zápolya the ruler of all Hungary . During Hungarian campaign of 1527 – 1528 , Ferdinand captured Buda from John Zápolya in 1527 , only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter @-@ attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528 . The siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital . This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe .

 Following Suleiman 's unsuccessful Siege of Vienna in 1529 , Ferdinand launched a counter @-@ attack in 1530 to regain the initiative and avenge the destruction brought by Suleiman 's 120 @,@ 000 strong army . This campaign is usually considered as the start of the Little War , the period of a series conflicts between the Habsburgs and the Ottoman Empire . An assault of Buda was driven off by John Zápolya , the vassal King of Hungary , but Ferdinand was successful elsewhere , capturing Gran ( Esztergom ) and other forts along the Danube river , a vital strategic frontier .

 During the early period of the Little War in Hungary , Suleiman , as a response to Ferdinand 's counter @-@ attack in 1530 , and as a part of his fifth imperial campaign ( Ottoman Turkish : <unk> <unk> , Sefer @-@ i <unk> ) in 1532 , led a massive army of over 120 @,@ 000 troops to besiege Vienna again . Due to Suleiman 's rapid advances , Ferdinand feared the Christian forces would not be assembled in time to meet him . On 12 July , Suleiman wrote to Ferdinand from Osijek ( German : <unk> ) in Slavonia , to assure him of the Ottoman advance . According to the letter , Suleiman 's fifth campaign was primarily directed against Charles V , and not personally against Ferdinand . After Suleiman crossed the river Drava at Osijek , instead of taking the usual route for Vienna , he turned westwards into Ferdinand 's held Hungarian territory . According to historian Andrew Wheatcroft , on the route for Vienna , the Ottoman army had briefly invested and captured seventeen fortified towns or castles . Ferdinand withdrew his army , leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend Kőszeg . 
 However , in order to make decisive gains , the Ottomans had to take the city quickly , as a large Imperial army , raised in Germany , reinforced by Spanish troops and led by the Emperor Charles V himself was approaching in support of Ferdinand . 
 = = = Siege = = = 
 Located south of Sopron , the small town of Kőszeg was only a few miles from the Austrian border . It was held by a task force commanded by the Croatian soldier and diplomat Nikola Jurišić . Kőszeg was not considered a place of importance . It was an insubstantial obstacle and many stronger places had yielded without a fight . The Grand Vizier of the Ottomans , Ibrahim Pasha , did not realize how poorly defended Kőszeg was . After taking a few minor places , Suleiman came to join Ibrahim Pasha shortly afterwards , when the siege had already started . 
 The Ottomans met stiff resistance at Kőszeg . Suleiman had hoped that the imperial army would come to relieve Kőszeg , affording him an opportunity for a larger engagement . However , during the Ottoman attacks on Kőszeg , the imperial army still formed up in Regensburg . The Ottomans continued with one attack after another ; artillery fire brought down parts of the walls , but brought no surrender . The Ottomans ' mines were sapped by <unk> . The layout of Kőszeg 's walls made mining a feasible strategy , but even though several mines succeeded in blowing holes in the fortifications , the defenders held out . For more than twenty @-@ five days , without any artillery , Captain Nikola Jurišić and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against nineteen full @-@ scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the Ottomans . 
 The outcome has two versions . In the first version , Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms , and the Ottomans retreated . In the second version , the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender . The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag . In either case , Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains , and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned . He had been delayed nearly four weeks , and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna , which Suleiman had not the intention to face . According to historian Paolo Giovio , Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September , too late for fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew . By their defense of Kőszeg , Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved Vienna from a siege . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Although he was stopped at Kőszeg and failed to conquer Vienna , Suleiman additionally secured his possession in Hungary by conquering several forts , since Ferdinand and Charles evaded an open field battle . Immediately after the Ottoman withdrawal , Ferdinand reoccupied devastated territory in Austria and Hungary . Nevertheless , Suleiman concluded a peace treaty with Ferdinand in 1533 , in Constantinople . The treaty confirmed the right of John Zápolya as a king of all Hungary , but recognised Ferdinand 's possession of that part of the country that enjoyed the status quo . 
 This treaty did not satisfy Zápolya or Ferdinand , whose armies began to skirmish along the borders . After Zápolya 's death in 1540 , Suleiman annexed Hungary to the Ottoman realm . Although from 1529 to 1566 the borders of the Ottoman Empire moved further west , none of the campaigns after 1529 achieved the decisive victory that would secure the new Ottoman possessions . 
 = Rwanda women 's national football team = 
 The Rwanda women 's national football team represents Rwanda in women 's association football and is controlled by the Fédération <unk> de Football Association . It had to date been scheduled to compete in one major tournament , the inaugural Women 's Challenge Cup held in Zanzibar in October 2007 , but the event was ultimately canceled .

 Until 2012 , Rwanda had yet to play in a single FIFA recognised match . FIFA did not recognise a senior women 's national team in the period between 2002 and 2006 , with no team existing by 2008 . While Rwanda women 's national under @-@ 20 football team existed and played in matches by 2009 , the senior national team was not competing in matches in the period . There was no senior team competing in the 2010 African Women 's Championships during the preliminary rounds or the 2011 All Africa Games . In March 2012 , the team was not ranked in the world by FIFA and a senior national team still did not existed . However , a senior national team played its first official match on February 16 , 2014 . 
 The inaugural Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations ( CECAFA ) Women 's Challenge Cup was supposed to be held in Zanzibar October 2007 , an event Rwanda was planning to send a national team to compete in , but the competition was ultimately canceled . The competition was to be funded by Confederation of African Football . The Council of East and Central Africa Football Associations secretary , Nicholas Musonye said of the event , " CAF wants to develop women football in this region in recognition of the milestones CECAFA has achieved over the years . CAF appreciates what CECAFA has done despite the hardships the association has gone through , from financial problems to political instability in member states and poor management of associations .

 = = Background and history = = 
 The development of women 's football in Africa faces several challenges , including limited access to education , poverty amongst women in the wider society , and fundamental inequality present in that society that occasionally allows for female @-@ specific human rights abuses . At the same time , if talented women footballers do emerge , many choose to go abroad to maximize playing opportunities . A lack of funding impedes regional development of women 's football as most of the funding for the women 's national team comes from FIFA , not the national football association . 
 Inside Rwanda , the first women 's football programme was developed in 2000 . " Kicking for Reconciliation " was created during the late 2000s , and involved over 100 young players in an attempt at " bringing healing to a nation that saw the worst genocide since World War II " through sport . The programme was open to both Tutsis and Hutus . By 2008 , this included a schools and university competition . Women 's football was supported by a single dedicated national federation staffer by 2006 . Women 's sport , including football , received little press coverage in the Rwandan media . A women 's football league was founded in 2008 , and the country is the only one in the region with a viable league , but the it still faces challenges related to funding for teams , with most of its funding coming from FIFA . Grace <unk> became the first female referee at the senior level in Rwanda in 2004 , and went on to become the first woman to coach a professional team in the country in 2009 . Her professional women 's side went on to win the league championship under her leadership . The lack of high @-@ level football opportunities in Uganda led to some players going from there to Rwanda for opportunities to play in the country 's professional league . 
 International training related to women is limited in Rwanda . Between 1991 and 2010 , there was no FIFA FUTURO III regional course for women 's coaching , no women 's football seminar held in the country , and no FIFA MA course held for women and youth football . Internationally , in 2007 , a representative from the country attended a FIFA sponsored women 's football symposium in China . <unk> <unk> is the head of women 's football in the country . She is credited with developing the sport in the country by founding the Association of Kigali Women in Football amongst other things . 
 = West Coast Express ( ice hockey ) = 
 The West Coast Express was an ice hockey line that played for the National Hockey League 's ( NHL ) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006 . Named after Vancouver 's commuter rail service , the line consisted of Markus Naslund at left wing , Brendan Morrison at centre , and Todd Bertuzzi playing right wing . The West Coast Express was a high scoring line that was considered to be one of the best lines in hockey during its tenure . 
 Each player was acquired by the Canucks through various trades . Once each member arrived in Vancouver it took two years before the line played together regularly . Once they did , they helped to set a Canucks franchise record for points in 2002 – 03 season ( later surpassed ) , a season in which the West Coast Express accounted for 45 % of the team 's goal production . All three players recorded their most individually recognized and best statistical seasons while playing on the line . Despite regular season success , the Canucks were never able to advance past the second round of the playoffs during the West Coast Express years . The line was disbanded when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers after the 2005 – 06 season . Both Morrison and Naslund played through the 2007 – 08 season with the Canucks before leaving the organization via free agency . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Player acquisitions = = = 
 The Vancouver Canucks made the Stanley Cup Finals in 1994 , but proceeded to regress as a franchise progressively finishing worse each season . As such they began attempting to add skill players to the line @-@ up through trades . The Canucks made various deals to " move the program forward and in a different direction " . With the franchise moving in a new direction the first member of the West Coast Express line arrived in Vancouver on March 20 , 1996 when left wing Markus Naslund was traded to the Canucks by the Pittsburgh Penguins for Alek Stojanov . Naslund struggled to start his Canucks career and during the 1997 – 98 season he requested to be traded . It was not until the 1998 – 99 season that Naslund emerged as an offensive leader with the Canucks , leading them in goals ( 36 ) and points ( 66 ) . Todd Bertuzzi was the second member of the line to join the Canucks ' franchise , when he was acquired by Vancouver via a trade during the 1997 – 98 season . The New York Islanders received former Canuck captain Trevor Linden in exchange for right winger Bertuzzi , defenceman Bryan McCabe and a third @-@ round selection in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft ( Jarkko Ruutu ) . Bertuzzi began the 1998 – 99 season playing on a line with Mark Messier at centre and Alexander Mogilny on right wing . Bertuzzi played with the two until he suffered a fractured tibia , an injury that resulted in Naslund gaining increased ice time . The final piece came to the Canucks on March 14 , 2000 with the acquisition of Brendan Morrison . In an attempt to improve their team to make a Stanley Cup run , the New Jersey Devils traded Morrison and centre Denis Pederson for Mogilny at the National Hockey League 's ( NHL ) trade deadline . Upon his arrival Morrison did not begin playing with Naslund and Bertuzzi nor did he begin his Canucks ' career at centre , instead he began on the wing . 
 = = = Express years = = = 
 Although the three did not begin playing together immediately , Bertuzzi and Naslund regularly played together on the top line with centres Mark Messier and Andrew Cassels . Starting with their arrival in 2000 , head coach Marc Crawford often moved Bertuzzi to the second line to play with twin brothers Henrik and Daniel Sedin to complement their cycling game . Morrison spent time on the third line with agitator Matt Cooke . Morrison joined Naslund on the top line due to an injury to Cassels in early November of the 2001 – 02 season , the two were joined by Trent Klatt on right wing , with Bertuzzi playing on a line with the twins . During the game Bertuzzi joined Naslund and Morrison on a power play marking one of the first times the line was together . The Canucks won the game but the line did not remain together as Cassels returned from injury , Klatt was injured and Bertuzzi was returned to the second line . The first game the trio played together as a regular line was on January 9 , 2002 . In the game they registered two first period goals in a 5 – 4 loss to the Detroit Red Wings . Crawford liked the idea of having his two top scorers together , how Morrison worked with them on the power play , and felt Morrison could handle the demands of playing with two players who wanted the puck . In their second game together the line continued to its strong play as each member recorded two points in a 7 – 1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes . After being put together they were given the name West Coast Express , a reference to a commuter train of the same name that provides service along a 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) route between Mission , British Columbia and Vancouver . By the end of the season each player set new career highs in points to that time in their careers . Naslund raised his point total by fifteen finishing the year as the league 's second leading scorer up thirty @-@ one spots from the previous season . Bertuzzi enjoyed the biggest point increase on the line adding thirty points and moving from eighty @-@ first in league scoring to third . Vancouver finished the season as the eighth seed in the Western Conference . The West Coast Express totaled three goals and nine points in the playoffs before being eliminated in six games by the top seeded Detroit Red Wings . In the off @-@ season , Naslund received NHL First Team All @-@ Star honours . 
 The 2002 – 03 season was the West Coast Express ' best season , as each member of the line again increased their point total to career highs . Naslund finished the year with 48 goals and 104 points again ranking him second in the league in points and goals . The fourth highest point total in franchise history to that point in time . Bertuzzi recorded 46 goals and 97 points , his goal total ranked him third in the league in goal scoring . Morrison 's 71 points remains a career high which he has not gotten within 11 points of since . During the year Naslund scored a career @-@ high four goals in a 6 – 3 win over the Edmonton Oilers , tying a Canucks record for most goals in a single game . In the game Bertuzzi added a goal and two assist while Morrison notched two assist of his own giving the line nine points in the game . Later in the season the West Coast Express helped the Canucks go on a 14 @-@ game unbeaten streak highlighted by back to back blowout wins to close out the streak . In the 13 game of the streak , a 7 – 2 win over the Columbus Blue Jackets , the line registered 5 goals and 12 points . The following game the trio increased their output to 5 goals and 14 points . In the contest both Bertuzzi and Morrison registered two goals and two assists . Naslund scored a goal and added five assists for a career @-@ high six point night . The Canucks finished the season with 104 points , a franchise record at the time . The West Coast Express accounted for 45 % of the Canucks ' 264 goals during the season . Finishing fourth in the Western Conference , the Canucks faced the St. Louis Blues in the playoffs . They fell behind St. Louis 3 – 1 in the series , but rallied back to force a game seven . In the deciding game , Naslund scored for the fourth consecutive game in the series and Morrison added the eventual game winner as the Canucks advanced to the second round . Facing off against the Minnesota Wild in game one of round two , the Canucks trailed late in the game . With just 8 @.@ 7 seconds remaining , Bertuzzi won a critical face @-@ off before Naslund took a shot that resulted in Cooke scoring on the rebound to force overtime , where the Canucks eventually ran out 4 – 3 winners . Vancouver took a 3 – 1 series lead before the Wild rallied to tie the series and force a game seven . The Canucks took a 2 – 0 lead in the game after Bertuzzi scored twice in the second period . Following his second goal , Bertuzzi skated by the Wild bench and said " Get your golf clubs out , boys , its over . " The Canucks preceded to surrender four consecutive goals , losing the game 4 – 2 and eliminating them from the playoffs . It was the last playoff game the trio would play together . In the off season Bertuzzi and Naslund were named to the NHL First All @-@ Star Team . Additionally Naslund was awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award ( since renamed the Ted Lindsay Award ) , given to the league 's best player as voted by the NHL Players ' Association . 
 = = = End of the Express = = = 
 The following season each member of the West Coast Express suffered a decline in performance . The trio were unable to complete the season as a unit due to injuries and suspension . On February 16 , 2004 in a game against the Colorado Avalanche , Naslund received a " questionable hit " from the Avalanche 's Steve Moore . Suffering a minor concussion from the hit and a hyper @-@ extended elbow when he fell to the ice , he missed three games due to his injuries . While Moore was unpenalized for the hit , some Canucks players felt that it was a " cheap shot " . In the second rematch of the two teams after Moore 's hit on Naslund , Vancouver allegedly put a " bounty " on Moore and were out to make him " pay a price " . Early in the game , Moore clashed with Cooke , but later refused to fight Bertuzzi , despite being taunted and followed around the ice . After being refused the fight , Bertuzzi punched Moore in the head from behind and slammed him into the ice . Bertuzzi was subsequently suspended indefinitely by the NHL , and the resulting injuries ended Moore 's career and left him suffering from concussion symptoms over the following seven years . Despite the loss of Bertuzzi , the Canucks won the Northwest Division . In the opening round Vancouver faced their division rival Calgary Flames . In the series Vancouver fell behind three games to two . They took a 4 – 0 lead in game six before the Flames came back to tie the game and send it to overtime . The game remained tied into the third overtime when Morrison scored at the 2 : 28 mark to force game seven . In game seven the Canucks were again trailing late into the third period in the closing seconds Naslund went around Flames defenceman Jordan Leopold drove the net and put a shot on goal . Flames goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff , made the save but Cooke scored on the rebound with just 5 @.@ 7 seconds remain to force overtime . The Canucks failed to capitalize on the change in momentum as the Flames ' Martin Gelinas scored 1 : 25 into overtime eliminating Vancouver . Naslund recorded nine points in the seven game series while Morrison chipped in five . During the off @-@ season Naslund received the last of his individual NHL honors being named a First Team NHL All @-@ Star once again . 
 Following the cancellation of the 2004 – 05 season due to a labor dispute , Bertuzzi was reinstated for the 2005 – 06 season . With the return of all three line mate and new rules designed to increase offensive chances the Canucks entered the year with high hopes . Despite this , Naslund and Morrison 's point production again decreased from their last NHL season . Bertuzzi point total increased , however , he played in 13 more games than his previous season . The Canucks missed the playoffs for the first time in four years and the only time during the West Coast Express ' tenure . During the off season , the line was officially dismantled when Bertuzzi was traded to the Florida Panthers , along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen , in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo , defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth @-@ round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft ( Sergei Shirokov ) . Both Naslund and Morrison played two more years with the Canucks , often together ( but not always ) , before signing as free agents with the New York Rangers and the Anaheim Ducks respectively in the summer of 2008 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 During its time , the West Coast Express was widely considered one of the most dominant line combinations in the league . The mid @-@ nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game , limiting scoring and offensive chances . The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest . When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving . The line 's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise . They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road . In the 2002 – 03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years . It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009 – 10 team , which featured the NHL 's leading scorer , Henrik Sedin . The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006 – 07 season . During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47 , a single season win total that is also tied for second most all @-@ time in NHL history .

 = Geography of Scotland in the Middle Ages = 
 The geography of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers all aspects of the land that is now Scotland , including physical and human , between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what are now the southern borders of the country , to the adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century . Scotland was defined by its physical geography , with its long coastline of inlets , islands and inland lochs , high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall . It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions , which were subdivided by geological features including fault lines , mountains , hills , bogs and marshes . This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification , but also for invading armies . 
 Roman occupation of what is now southern Scotland seems to have had very little impact on settlement patterns , with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts in the south and Brochs and wheel houses in the north , continuing to be occupied in the Early Medieval period . The study of place names and archaeological evidence indicates a pattern of early Medieval settlement by the Picts , most densely around the north @-@ east coastal plain ; early Gaelic settlement was predominately in the western mainland and neighbouring islands . Anglian settlement in the south @-@ east reached into West Lothian , and to a lesser extent into south @-@ western Scotland . Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland , with lighter settlement in the Western Islands . 
 From the reign of David I ( r . 1124 – 53 ) , there is evidence of burghs , particularly on the east coast , which are the first identifiable towns in Scotland . Probably based on existing settlements , they grew in number and significance through the Medieval period . More than 50 royal burghs are known to have been established by the end of the thirteenth century and a similar number of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs were created between 1450 and 1516 , acting as focal points for administration , as well as local and international trade . In the early Middle Ages the country was divided between speakers of Gaelic , Pictish , Cumbric and English . Over the next few centuries Cumbric and Pictish were gradually overlaid and replaced by Gaelic , English and Norse . From at least the reign of David I , Gaelic was replaced by French as the language of the court and nobility . In the late Middle Ages Scots , derived mainly from Old English , became the dominant language . 
 In the middle of this period , through a process of conquest , consolidation and treaty , the boundaries of Scotland were gradually extended from a small area under direct control of the kings of Alba in the east , to almost its modern borders . For most of the Medieval era the monarchy and court was itinerant , with Scone and Dunfermline acting as important centres and later Roxburgh , Stirling and Perth , before Edinburgh emerged as the political capital in the fourteenth century . Largely as a result of Viking raids from about 800 , Iona declined as a religious centre . Despite royal attempts to establish a new religious centre at Dunkeld , it was St. Andrews on the east coast , close to the heartland of Pictish settlement , that emerged as the most important religious focus of the kingdom . 
 = = Physical = = 
 Modern Scotland is half the size of England and Wales in area , but with its many inlets , islands and inland lochs , it has roughly the same amount of coastline at 4 @,@ 000 miles . Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level . Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall , today about 700 cm per year in the east and more than 1 @,@ 000 cm in the west . This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog , the acidity of which , combined with high levels of wind and salt spray , made most of the islands treeless . The existence of hills , mountains , quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and may have contributed to the fragmented nature of political power . The early Middle Ages was a period of climate deterioration , with a drop in temperature and an increase in rainfall , resulting in more land becoming unproductive . This was reversed in the period c . 1150 to 1300 , with warm dry summers and less severe winters allowing cultivation at much greater heights above sea level and making land more productive . In the late Middle Ages , average temperatures began to reduce again , with cooler and wetter conditions limiting the extent of arable agriculture , particularly in the Highlands . 
 The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east . The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen . The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands , which included the Cheviot hills , over which the border with England came to run by the end of the period . Some of these regions were further divided by mountains , major rivers and marshes . The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width , and because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications , could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government . The Southern Uplands , and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern . This provided Scotland with a form of protection , as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult Southern Uplands ; two major attempts at conquest by the English , under Edward I and then Edward III , were unable to penetrate the Highlands , from where potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands . But it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence centred on attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism . 
 = = Settlement and demography = = 
 Roman influence beyond Hadrian 's Wall does not appear to have had a major impact on settlement patterns , with Iron Age hill forts and promontory forts continuing to be occupied through the early Medieval period . These often had defences of dry stone or timber laced walls , sometimes with a palisade . The large numbers of these forts has been taken to suggest peripatetic monarchies and aristocracies , moving around their domains to control and administer them . In the Northern and Western Isles the sites of Iron Age Brochs and wheel houses continued to be occupied , but were gradually replaced with less imposing cellular houses . There are a handful of major timber halls in the south , comparable to those excavated in Anglo @-@ Saxon England and dated to the seventh century . In the areas of Scandinavian settlement in the Islands and along the coast a lack of timber meant that native materials had to be adopted for house building , often combining layers of stone with turf . 
 Place @-@ name evidence suggests that the densest areas of Pictish settlement were in the north @-@ east coastal plain : in modern Fife , Perthshire , Angus , Aberdeen and around the Moray Firth , although later Gaelic migration may have erased some Pictish names from the record . Early Gaelic settlement appears to have been in the regions of the western mainland of Scotland between Cowal and Ardnamurchan , and the adjacent islands , later extending up the West coast in the eighth century . There is place name and archaeological evidence of Anglian settlement in south @-@ east Scotland reaching into West Lothian , and to a lesser extent into south @-@ western Scotland . Later Norse settlement was probably most extensive in Orkney and Shetland , with lighter settlement in the Western Islands , particularly the Hebrides and on the mainland in Caithness , stretching along fertile river valleys through Sutherland and into Ross . There was also extensive settlement in Bernicia stretching into the modern borders and Lowlands . 
 From the reign of David I , there are records of burghs ( a Germanic word for a fortress ) , towns that were granted certain legal privileges by the crown . Most of the burghs granted charters during David 's reign probably already existed as settlements . Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England , and early burgesses were usually English or Flemish . They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements . Most of the early burghs were on the east coast . Among them were the largest and wealthiest , including Aberdeen , Berwick , Perth and Edinburgh , whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent . In the south @-@ west Glasgow , Ayr and Kirkcudbright benefited from the less profitable sea trade with Ireland , and to a lesser extent France and Spain . Burghs were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually a market place , with a widened high street or junction , often marked by a mercat cross beside which were houses for the burgesses and other inhabitants . Around 15 burghs can be traced to the reign of David I , and there is evidence of 55 by 1296 . In addition to the major royal burghs , the late Middle Ages saw the proliferation of baronial and ecclesiastical burghs ; 51 were created between 1450 and 1516 . Most were much smaller than their royal counterparts , and excluded from international trade they acted mainly as local markets and centres of craftsmanship . 
 There are almost no written sources from which to re @-@ construct the demography of early medieval Scotland . Estimates have been made of a population of 10 @,@ 000 inhabitants in Dál Riata and 80 – 100 @,@ 000 for Pictland , which was probably the largest region . It is likely that the fifth and sixth centuries saw higher mortality rates owing to the appearance of bubonic plague , which may have reduced the net population . The examination of burial sites for this period like that at Hallowhill , St Andrews indicate a life expectancy of only 26 – 29 . The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high @-@ fertility , high @-@ mortality society , similar to many developing countries in the modern world , with a relatively young demographic profile , and perhaps early childbearing , and large numbers of children for women . The result would have been a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed , making it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop . From the formation of the kingdom of Alba in the tenth century , to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349 , estimates based on the amount of farmable land , suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million . Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague , there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades . If the pattern followed that in England , then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the 15th century . Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the Industrial Revolution , these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom , with roughly half living north of the Tay . Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of burghs . It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2 @,@ 000 , but many would be much smaller than 1 @,@ 000 and the largest , Edinburgh , probably had a population of more than 10 @,@ 000 by the end of the era . 
 = = Language = = 
 Modern linguists divide Celtic languages into two major groups : the P @-@ Celtic , from which the Brythonic languages – Welsh , Breton , Cornish and Cumbric derive – and the Q @-@ Celtic , from which come the Goidelic languages – Irish , Manx and Gaelic . The Pictish language remains enigmatic , since the Picts had no written script of their own and all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script . Most modern linguists accept that , although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear , it belonged to the former group . Historical sources , as well as place @-@ name evidence , indicate the ways in which the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic , Old English and later Norse in this period . By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language , then simply called Scottish , or in Latin , lingua Scotica . 
 In the Northern Isles the Norse language brought by Scandinavian occupiers and settlers evolved into the local Norn , which lingered until the end of the eighteenth century and Norse may also have survived as a spoken language until the sixteenth century in the Outer Hebrides . French , Flemish and particularly English became the main language of Scottish burghs , most of which were in the south and east , an area to which Anglian settlers had already brought a form of Old English . In the later part of the twelfth century , the writer Adam of Dryburgh described Lowland Lothian as " the Land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots " . At least from the accession of David I , Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was replaced by Norman French , to be followed by the Chancery , the castles of nobles and the upper order of the Church . 
 In the late Middle Ages , Middle Scots , often simply called English , became the dominant language of the country . It was derived largely from Old English , with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French . Although resembling the language spoken in northern England , it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century . It was adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French . By the fifteenth century it was the language of government , with acts of parliament , council records and treasurer 's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards . As a result , Gaelic , once dominant north of the Tay , began a steady decline .

 At its foundation in the tenth century , the combined Gaelic and Pictish kingdom of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland . Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries , the term " Scotia " was applied in sources only to the region between the Forth , the central Grampians and the River Spey , and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from the second half of the twelfth century . The expansion of Alba into the wider kingdom of Scotland was a gradual process combining external conquest and the suppression of occasional rebellions , with the extension of <unk> power through the placement of effective agents of the crown . Neighbouring independent kings became subject to Alba and eventually disappeared from the records . In the ninth century the term mormaer , meaning " great steward " , began to appear in the records to describe the rulers of Moray , Strathearn , Buchan , Angus and Mearns , who may have acted as " marcher lords " for the kingdom to counter the Viking threat . Later the process of consolidation is associated with the feudalism introduced by David I , which , particularly in the east and south where the crown 's authority was greatest , saw the placement of lordships , often based on castles , and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms , which overlay the pattern of local thegns . 
 Most of the regions of what became Scotland had strong cultural and economic ties elsewhere : to England , Ireland , Scandinavian and mainland Europe . Internal communications were difficult and the country lacked an obvious geographical centre ; the king kept an itinerant court , with no " capital " as such . Dunfermline emerged as a major royal centre in the reign of Malcolm III , and David I tried to build up Roxburgh as a royal centre , but in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries more charters were issued at Scone than anywhere else . Other popular locations in the early part of the era were nearby Perth , Stirling , Dunfermline and Edinburgh . In the later Middle Ages the king moved between royal castles , particularly Perth and Stirling , but also held judicial sessions throughout the kingdom ; Edinburgh only began to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III , at the cost of considerable unpopularity to the king . Iona was an early religious centre , and was said to be the burial place of the kings of Alba until the end of the eleventh century , but declined as a result of Viking raids from 794 . The transfer of part of the relics of St. Columba from there to Dunkeld in the mid @-@ ninth century , closer to the centre of the kingdom and close to Scone , the ceremonial site of coronations , may have represented an attempt to develop a new religious centre , but it was St. Andrews , with its biblical cult , probably established on the east coast in the centre of their political heartland by Pictish kings as early as the eighth century , and never a major political capital or trading centre , which emerged as the centre of the Scottish church . 
 Until the thirteenth century the borders with England were very fluid . Northumbria and Cumbria were annexed to Scotland by David I , but lost under his grandson and successor Malcolm IV in 1157 . The Treaty of York ( 1237 ) and Treaty of Perth ( 1266 ) fixed the borders of the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively , close to the modern boundaries . The Isle of Man fell under English control in the fourteenth century , despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority . The English were able to annexe a large slice of the Lowlands under Edward III , but these losses were gradually regained , particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses ( 1455 – 85 ) . In 1468 the last great acquisition of Scottish territory occurred when James III married Margaret of Denmark , receiving the Orkney Islands and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry . In 1482 , Berwick , a border fortress and the largest port in Medieval Scotland , fell to the English once again , for what was to be the final change of hands . The only uncertain area was the small region of the <unk> Lands at the south @-@ west end of the border , which would be divided by a French @-@ mediated commission in 1552 .

 The Stanley Cup ( French : La Coupe Stanley ) is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League ( NHL ) playoff winner . Originally commissioned in 1892 as the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup , the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston , then – Governor General of Canada , who awarded it to Canada 's top @-@ ranking amateur ice hockey club , which the entire Stanley family supported , with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game . The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC , and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play . Professional teams then became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906 . In 1915 , the two professional ice hockey organizations , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) , reached a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup . After a series of league mergers and folds , it was established as the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the de jure NHL championship prize in 1947 . 
 There are actually three Stanley Cups : the original bowl of the " Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup " , the authenticated " Presentation Cup " , and the " Replica Cup " on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame . The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks . Nevertheless , the NHL does not actually own the trophy , but instead uses it by agreement with the two Trustees of the Cup . The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup , although the league 's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts . The original bowl was made of silver and is 18 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 28 inches ) in height and 29 centimetres ( 11 @.@ 42 inches ) in diameter . The current Stanley Cup , topped with a copy of the original bowl , is made of a silver and nickel alloy ; it has a height of 89 @.@ 54 centimetres ( 35 @.@ 25 inches ) and weighs 15 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 34 @.@ 5 lb / 2 st 6 ½ lb ) . 
 Unlike the trophies awarded by the other major professional sports leagues of North America , a new Stanley Cup is not made each year ; winners keep it until a new champion is crowned . It is unusual among trophies , in that it has the names of all of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff engraved on its chalice . Initially , a new band added each year caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname " Stovepipe Cup " . In 1958 the modern one @-@ piece Cup was designed with a five @-@ band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom . It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug . The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team . 
 Since the 1914 – 15 season , the Cup has been won a combined 100 times by 18 active NHL teams and five defunct teams . Prior to that , the challenge cup was held by nine different teams . The Montreal Canadiens have won the Cup a record 24 times and are the most recent Canadian @-@ based team to win the cup , having won it in 1993 . The Stanley Cup was not awarded in 1919 because of a Spanish flu epidemic , and in 2005 , as a consequence of the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 After the Lord Stanley of Preston was appointed by Queen Victoria as Governor General of Canada on June 11 , 1888 , he and his family became highly enthusiastic about ice hockey . Stanley was first exposed to the game at Montreal 's 1889 Winter Carnival , where he saw the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club . The Montreal Gazette reported that he " expressed his great delight with the game of hockey and the expertise of the players " . During that time , organized ice hockey in Canada was still in its infancy and only Montreal and Ottawa had anything resembling leagues . 
 Stanley 's entire family became active in ice hockey . Two of his sons , Arthur and Algernon , formed a new team called the Ottawa Rideau Hall Rebels . Arthur also played a key role in the formation of what later became known as the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) , and would go on to be the founder of ice hockey in Great Britain . Arthur and Algernon persuaded their father to donate a trophy to be " an outward and visible sign of the hockey championship " . Stanley sent the following message to the victory celebration held on March 18 , 1892 , at Ottawa 's Russell Hotel for the three @-@ time champion Ottawa Hockey Club : 
 I have for some time been thinking that it would be a good thing if there were a challenge cup which should be held from year to year by the champion hockey team in the Dominion [ of Canada ] . 
 There does not appear to be any such outward sign of a championship at present , and considering the general interest which matches now elicit , and the importance of having the game played fairly and under rules generally recognized , I am willing to give a cup which shall be held from year to year by the winning team . 
 I am not quite certain that the present regulations governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction , and it would be worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from . 
 Soon afterwards , Stanley purchased what is frequently described as a decorative punch bowl , but which silver expert John Culme identified as a rose bowl , made in Sheffield , England , and sold by London silversmith G. R. Collis and Company ( now Boodle and <unk> Jewellers ) , for ten guineas , equal to ten and a half pounds sterling , US $ 48 @.@ 67 , which is equal to $ 1 @,@ 282 today . He had the words " Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup " engraved on one side of the outside rim , and " From Stanley of Preston " on the other side . 
 Originally , Stanley intended that the Cup should be awarded to the top amateur hockey team in Canada , to be decided by the acceptance of a challenge from another team . He made five preliminary regulations : 
 The winners shall return the Cup in good order when required by the trustees so that it may be handed over to any other team which may win it . 
 Each winning team , at its own expense , may have the club name and year engraved on a silver ring fitted on the Cup . 
 The Cup shall remain a challenge cup , and should not become the property of one team , even if won more than once . 
 The trustees shall maintain absolute authority in all situations or disputes over the winner of the Cup . 
 If one of the existing trustees resigns or drops out , the remaining trustee shall nominate a substitute . 
 Stanley appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and Philip D. Ross ( who would serve in his post an unsurpassed 56 years ) as trustees of the Cup . Sweetland and Ross first presented the trophy in 1893 to the Montreal Amateur Athletic Association on behalf of the affiliated Montreal Hockey Club , the champions of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) , since they " defeated all comers during the late season , including the champions of the Ontario Association " ( Ottawa ) . Sweetland and Ross also believed that the AHAC was the top league , and as first @-@ place finishers in the AHAC , Montreal was the best team in Canada . Naturally , the Ottawas were upset by the decision because there had been no challenge games scheduled and because the trustees failed to convey the rules on how the Cup was to be awarded prior to the start of the season . 
 As a result , the Cup trustees issued more specific rules on how the trophy should be defended and awarded : 
 The Cup is automatically awarded to the team that wins the title of the previous Cup champion 's league , without the need for any other special extra contest . 
 Challengers for the Cup must be from senior hockey associations , and must have won their league championship . Challengers will be recognized in the order in which their request is received . 
 The challenge games ( where the Cup could change leagues ) are to be decided either in a one @-@ game affair , a two @-@ game total goals affair , or a best of three series , to the benefit of both teams involved . All matches would take place on the home ice of the champions , although specific dates and times would have to be approved by the trustees . 
 Ticket receipts from the challenge games are to be split equally between both teams . 
 If the two competing clubs cannot agree to a referee , the trustees will appoint one , and the two teams shall cover the expenses equally . If the two competing clubs cannot agree on other officials , the referee will appoint them , and the two clubs shall also pay the expenses equally 
 A league could not challenge for the Cup twice in one season . 
 Stanley never saw a Stanley Cup championship game , nor did he ever present the Cup . Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893 , he was forced to return to England on July 15 . In April of that year , his elder brother Edward Stanley , 15th Earl of Derby died , and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby . 
 = = = Challenge Cup era = = = 
 During the challenge cup period , none of the leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions ; whichever team finished in first place after the regular season won the league title . However , in 1894 , four teams out of the five @-@ team AHAC tied for the championship with records of 5 – 3 – 0 . The AHAC had no tie @-@ breaking system . After extensive negotiations and Quebec 's withdrawal from the championship competition , it was decided that a three @-@ team tournament would take place in Montreal , with the Ottawa team receiving a bye to the Final because they were the only road team . On March 17 , in the first ever Stanley Cup playoff game , the Montreal Hockey Club ( Montreal HC ) defeated the Montreal Victorias , 3 – 2 . Five days later , in the first Stanley Cup Final game , Montreal HC beat the Ottawa Hockey Club 3 – 1 . 
 In 1895 , Queen 's University was the first official challenger for the Cup , although it was controversial . The Montreal Victorias had won the league title and thus the Stanley Cup , but the challenge match was between the previous year 's champion , Montreal HC , and the university squad . The trustees decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match , the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions . The Montreal HC won the match 5 – 1 and their cross @-@ town rivals were crowned the champions . The first successful challenge to the Cup came the next year by the Winnipeg Victorias , the champions of the Manitoba Hockey League . On February 14 , 1896 , the Winnipeg squad defeated the champions 2 – 0 and became the first team outside the AHAC to win the Cup . 
 As the prestige of winning the Cup grew , so did the need to attract top players . Only nine months after winning the Cup , in March 1906 , the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution at the annual meeting of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs . Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time , the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams . The first professional competition came one month later during the Wanderers ' two @-@ game , total goals challenge series , which they won 17 goals to 5 . 
 The smallest municipality to produce a Stanley Cup champion team is Kenora , Ontario ; the town had a population of about 4 @,@ 000 when the Kenora Thistles captured the Cup in January 1907 . Aided by future Hall of Famers Art Ross and " Bad " Joe Hall , the Thistles defeated the Montreal Wanderers in a two @-@ game , total goals challenge series . The Thistles successfully defended the Cup once , against a team from Brandon , Manitoba . In March 1907 , the Wanderers challenged the Thistles to a rematch . Despite an improved lineup , the Thistles lost the Cup to Montreal . 
 In 1908 , the Allan Cup was introduced as the trophy for Canada 's amateurs , and the Stanley Cup started to become a symbol of professional hockey supremacy . In that same year , the first all @-@ professional team , the Toronto Trolley Leaguers from the newly created Ontario Professional Hockey League ( OPHL ) , competed for the Cup . One year later , the Montreal HC and the Montreal Victorias , the two remaining amateur teams , left the ECAHA , and the ECAHA dropped " Amateur " from their name to become a professional league . In 1910 , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) was formed . The NHA soon proved it was the best in Canada , as it kept the Cup for the next four years . 
 Prior to 1912 , challenges could take place at any time , given the appropriate rink conditions , and it was common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year . In 1912 , Cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended at the end of the champion team 's regular season . 
 = = = Organized interleague competition = = = 
 In 1914 , the Victoria Aristocrats from the Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) challenged the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts . A controversy erupted when a letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17 , that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west , as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees . However , on March 18 , Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding . PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge , because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner , whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored . In any case , all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted . 
 Several days later , trustee Foran wrote to NHA president Quinn that the trustees are " perfectly satisfied to allow the representatives of the three pro leagues ( NHA , PCHA , and Maritime ) to make all arrangements each season as to the series of matches to be played for the Cup . " One year later , the NHA and the PCHA concluded a gentlemen 's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other for the Cup , similar to baseball 's World Series , which is played between the American League and National League champions . Under the new proposal , the Stanley Cup Final series alternated between the East and the West each year , with alternating games played according to NHA and PCHA rules . The PCHA 's Vancouver Millionaires won the 1915 series three games to none in a best @-@ of @-@ five series . 
 After the Portland Rosebuds , an American @-@ based team , joined the PCHA in 1914 , the trustees issued a statement that the Cup was no longer for the best team in Canada , but now for the best team in the world . Two years later , the Rosebuds became the first American team to play in the Stanley Cup Final . In 1917 , the Seattle Metropolitans became the first American team to win the Cup . After that season , the NHA dissolved , and the National Hockey League ( NHL ) took its place . 
 In 1919 , the Spanish influenza epidemic forced the Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series , marking the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded . The series was tied at 2 – 2 – 1 , but the final game was never played because Montreal Manager George Kennedy and players Joe Hall , Billy Coutu , Jack McDonald , and Newsy Lalonde were hospitalized with influenza . Hall died four days after the cancelled game , and the series was abandoned . 
 The format for the Stanley Cup Final changed in 1922 , with the creation of the Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) . Three leagues competed for the Cup : two league champions faced each other for the right to challenge the third champion in the final series . This lasted three seasons as the PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) in 1925 . After winning in the 1924 – 25 season , the Victoria Cougars became the last team outside the NHL to win the Stanley Cup . 
 = = = NHL takes over = = = 
 The WHL folded in 1926 , leaving the NHL as the only league left competing for the Cup . Other leagues and clubs occasionally issued challenges , but from that year forward , no non @-@ NHL team has played for it , leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL . In 1947 , the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P.D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the Cup to the NHL , allowing the league to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished to play for the Cup . 
 The Trustees hereby delegate to the League full authority to determine and amend from time to time the conditions for competition of the Stanley Cup , including the qualifications of challengers , the appointment of officials , the apportionment and distribution of all gate receipts , provided always that the winners of this trophy shall be the acknowledged World 's Professional Hockey Champions . 
 The Trustees agree that during the currency of this agreement they will not acknowledge or accept any challenge for the Stanley Cup unless such a challenge is in conformity with the condition specified in paragraph one ( 1 ) thereof . 
 The League undertakes the responsibility for the care and safe custody of the Stanley Cup including all necessary repairs and alterations to the cup and sub @-@ structure as may be required from time to time , and further undertakes to insure the Stanley Cup for its full <unk> value . 
 The League hereby acknowledges itself to be bound to the Trustees in the sum of One Thousand Dollars , which bond is conditioned upon the safe return of the Stanley Cup to the Trustees in accordance with the terms of this Agreement , and it is agreed that the League shall have the right to return the trophy to the Trustees at any time . 
 This agreement shall remain in force so long as the League continues to be the world 's leading professional hockey league as determined by its playing caliber , and in the event of dissolution or other termination of the National Hockey League , the Stanley Cup shall revert to the custody of the trustees . 
 In the event of default in the appointment of a new trustee by the surviving trustee , the " Trustees " hereby delegate and appoint the Governors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston , Ontario , to name two Canadian trustees to carry on under the terms of the original trust , and in conformity with this Agreement . 
 And it is further mutually agreed that any disputes arising as to the interpretation of this Agreement or the facts upon which such interpretation is made , shall be settled by an Arbitration Board of three , one member to be appointed by each of the parties , and the third to be selected by the two appointees . The decision of the Arbitration Board shall be final . 
 This agreement was amended on November 22 , 1961 , substituting the Governors of the International Hockey Hall of Fame in Kingston , Ontario with the Committee of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto , Ontario as the group that would name the two Canadian trustees , if need be . In the 1970s , the World Hockey Association sought to challenge for the Cup – the Trustees denied them the opportunity to do so . However , notwithstanding the aforementioned legal obligation , the NHL quietly discontinued calling its champions the " world champions " during this time , largely in order to avoid having its champion incur at least a moral obligation to play the WHA champion . 
 The Cup was awarded every year until 2005 , when a labour dispute between the NHL 's owners and the NHL Players Association ( the union that represents the players ) led to the cancellation of the 2004 – 05 season . As a result , no Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in 1919 . The lockout was controversial among many fans , who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup . A website known as <unk> ( since closed ) was launched , asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original Challenge Cup format . Adrienne Clarkson , then Governor General of Canada , alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women 's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season . This idea was so unpopular that the Clarkson Cup was created instead . Meanwhile , a group in Ontario , also known as the " Wednesday <unk> " , filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court , claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL , and therefore must award the trophy regardless of the lockout . 
 On February 7 , 2006 , a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non @-@ NHL teams should the league not operate for a season . The dispute lasted so long that , by the time it was settled , the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005 – 06 season , and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004 – 05 season . Furthermore , when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the Trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup in the event of a lost season , and that they were likely to reject any non @-@ NHL challenges for the Cup in the event the 2012 – 13 season were cancelled , which it was not .
