 = = = Law clients with city business = = = 
 In 2007 , although one of eight alderman who were attorneys , only Burke disclosed law clients who were local government contractors . Burke had 37 law clients that did business with the city or other local government agencies , according to his annual ethics statement filed with the city . Burke disclosed 2008 income above the reporting threshold of $ 5 @,@ 000 from each of 31 law clients that do business with the city . 
 Burke has been criticized for alleged conflicts of interest involving law clients and his role as chairman of the Council 's Finance Committee . Burke has helped line up millions of dollars in public subsidies to companies that later hired his firm for property tax assessment appeals . Burke law clients which regularly have legislative issues before the Finance Committee have included communications company Ameritech , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , Yellow Cab Company , and several major airlines and concessionaires at the city @-@ owned O 'Hare and Midway airports . 
 For example , Cotter and Company , a wholesaler to 6 @,@ 000 True Value hardware stores , sought a package of public subsidies to keep their headquarters and operations in Chicago . In February 1996 , while the final components of the package were working their way through City Hall , Burke toured Cotter 's headquarters , at the end of which he handed out his business card from his private law practice and asked for the company 's property tax appeals business . Cotter decided to hire Burke in March 1996 and finalized the arrangement in June 1996 . An unprecedented $ 2 @.@ 8 million cash grant from the City to Cotter , never publicized by the Daley administration , was included in a $ 20 million bond issue approved by the Finance Committee and the City Council by July 31 , 1996 . 
 = = = <unk> and corrections in voting record = = = 
 Burke recuses himself from voting on issues involving clients so often that he was called " Chicago 's most conflicted alderman " by the Chicago Sun @-@ Times . Burke abstains from at least a few votes at almost every Finance Committee meeting . 
 In March 1997 , weeks after hiring defense attorney <unk> , and days after learning from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times of their investigation into Burke 's law firm and clients , Burke invoked a rarely used motion to amend the proceedings of the City Council to change to abstentions four " yes " votes regarding airport facility leases for Midway and American airlines , two of Burke 's seven airline clients . Burke blamed the recording of his " aye " votes on the late Alderman Thomas Cullerton , who chaired the City Council Committee on Aviation , which reviews airport leases . Cullerton had died in February 1993 , three months before Burke cast one of the votes he changed . At the July 2 , 1997 City Council meeting , Burke changed to abstention a June 4 , 1997 vote in favor of a property @-@ tax break for another client , Heinemann 's Inc . , a baked goods company in Burke 's 14th ward . Between 1993 and 1997 , Burke put through six journal corrections on his votes , some dating back seven years , and accounting for more than half the corrections from all aldermen during that period . In 2004 , Burke changed the record of a vote in support of a zoning change favorable to another of his clients , Centrum Properties . 
 Burke 's corrections of his voting history were criticized by other aldermen and Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley . Daley suggested Burke was involved in conflicts of interest that merited investigation by the Illinois Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission and the City Board of Ethics , and Daley advocated more stringent regulation regarding aldermanic conflicts of interest . Burke 's conflicts of interest inspired a strengthening of the City 's ethics laws in October 1998 . The Council passed the ordinance , 40 @-@ 9 . Burke voted " no " in a voice vote , then switched to " yes " for the record . 
 = = = Legislative initiatives = = = 
 In October , 1997 , as Huels resigned in the SDI scandal , and amid calls for Burke 's resignation , Burke sponsored a resolution exonerating Kate O 'Leary and her cow Daisy of culpability for the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 . The resolution cited research blaming the fire on an O 'Leary neighbor , Daniel " Peg Leg " Sullivan . Burke argued in favor of passage of the resolution , 
 In 1871 , journalists , eager to sensationalize the events of the Great Fire , were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O 'Leary an easy scapegoat for the calamitous inferno . As a working @-@ class immigrant and a woman , Kate O 'Leary was an easy target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle @-@ class culture . 
 The resolution was unanimously recommended by the City Council 's Police and Fire Committee on October 6 , 1997 and passed unanimously by the full City Council on October 28 , 1997 . Other Burke legislative initiatives include protecting non @-@ smokers from second @-@ hand smoke , mandating pet @-@ spaying , and regulating fatty restaurant food .

 In April 1999 , Roman Catholic priest and activist Michael <unk> , pastor of St. Sabina parish in Chicago 's Auburn Gresham neighborhood , wrote a letter to Chicago Police Superintendent Terry Hilliard complaining of the glorification of violence on The Jerry Springer Show , a popular television show which was produced in Chicago . Burke showed about ten minutes of clips from the show at the April 28 , 1999 meeting of the City Council 's Police and Fire Committee and convinced aldermen to invite , under threat of subpoena , show host Jerry Springer to testify under oath as to whether the violence on the show was genuine or scripted . If scripted , Burke proposed to force the show to obtain a city entertainment license , and , if genuine , Burke proposed that the off @-@ duty Chicago policemen providing security at the show arrest fighting guests on the set . 
 The hearing attracted more than 21 television news crews from around the country , including Court TV , MSNBC , Fox News , a film crew from The Jerry Springer Show , dozens of print reporters , and about 75 of Springer 's fans . Burke led the questioning of Springer . None of the aldermen asked Springer if the violence was staged until more than an hour into the three @-@ hour hearing . Springer , a former Cincinnati council member and mayor , spent most of his time sparring with Burke , and handled the inquiry . 
 = = = Security detail = = = 
 Burke is the only Chicago alderman who has Chicago police officers assigned to him as bodyguards . In 1986 , Mayor Harold Washington 's acting Chicago police commissioner Fred Rice tried to reduce the number of Burke 's bodyguards from four to two , on the basis that the manpower was no longer necessary . Burke sued the city , arguing that the move was a political retaliation . The court sided with Burke . Rice removed nearly all the aldermanic bodyguards , but was blocked by court orders from taking away the Vrdolyak and Burke contingents . For nine months in 2005 , the police details assigned to the city clerk , city treasurer and Burke did not file any police reports . Andy Shaw , president and chief executive of the watchdog group Better Government Association , asked , 
 This is a city that doesn 't have enough money for basic services right now and doesn 't have enough money to protect regular citizens . The question has to be asked whether a full @-@ time bodyguard detail to one alderman who hasn 't been shown to be in any kind of danger for more than two decades is warranted . 
 An unmarked Chicago police car was assigned to Burke 's city @-@ funded security detail . He is one of several aldermen who lease sports utility vehicles at taxpayer expense .

 In 1980 , Burke sought the Democratic nomination for Cook County State 's Attorney . Burke was aligned with Mayor Jane Byrne and was endorsed by the Cook County Democratic Central Committee . Burke 's loss in the primary to Richard M. Daley was interpreted at the time as a set @-@ back for the Chicago political machine . 
 In 1988 , following the sudden death in office of Mayor Harold Washington , Burke was one of several candidates who sought to fill the vacancy . " I know I would like to be Mayor . It is obviously the Super Bowl of Chicago politics , " Burke said . After polls showed declining support for his candidacy , he dropped out of the race in December 1988 and endorsed Richard M. Daley , who won the nomination in the February 1989 Democratic primary . 
 = = Property tax attorney = = 
 Burke is the lead partner in a Chicago law firm , <unk> and Burke , that specializes in representing clients in property tax appeals before the Cook County Assessor 's Office , the Cook County Board of Review , and in the courts . The firm was successful in several " significant legal challenges " to Illinois real estate law . Burke 's law firm 's senior partner , Melvin <unk> , died on June 5 , 1988 at age 73 . The number of tax appeals Burke 's firm filed for clients with the Board of Tax Appeals increased from 212 in 1982 to 1 @,@ 876 in 1995 . In 2002 , Burke helped pass a city ordinance barring the city from contesting property tax appeals seeking a reduction in property assessment of under $ 1 million , which was most of Burke 's cases . Between 2003 and 2013 , Burke 's firm won more than $ 18 @.@ 1 million in property @-@ tax refunds in Chicago . 
 In a 2006 interview , Burke reflected , 
 The law business is good . I have been fortunate to have the best of both worlds . I have enjoyed the political side of it and also enjoyed my private legal practice . Yes , there have been temptations , [ but ] if you try to conduct yourself under the rules , in the long run you are better off .

 = Japanese cruiser Izumo = 
 Izumo ( <unk> , sometimes transliterated <unk> ) was the lead ship of her class of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself , the ship was built in Britain . She often served as a flagship and participated in most of the naval battles of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . The ship was lightly damaged during the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima . Izumo was ordered to protect Japanese citizens and interests in 1913 during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when World War I began in 1914 . 
 She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America . The ship assisted the armored cruiser Asama in early 1915 when she struck a rock off Baja California . In 1917 , Izumo became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea . After the war , she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex @-@ German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan . 
 The ship spent most of the 1920s as a training ship for naval cadets and became flagship of the IJN 's China forces in 1932 during the First Shanghai Incident . Izumo participated in the Battle of Shanghai five years later and was not damaged , despite repeated aerial attacks . The ship played a minor role in the Pacific War , supporting Japanese forces during Philippines Campaign until she struck a mine . She returned to Japan in 1943 and again became a training ship for naval cadets . Izumo was sunk by American carrier aircraft during the attack on Kure in July 1945 . Her wreck was refloated and scrapped in 1947 . 
 = = Background and description = = 
 The 1896 Naval Expansion Plan was made after the First Sino @-@ Japanese War and included four armored cruisers in addition to four more battleships , all of which had to be ordered from British shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself . Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy . Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships . The revised plan is commonly known as the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " . Unlike most of their contemporaries which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes , Izumo and her half @-@ sisters were intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline . 
 The ship was 132 @.@ 28 meters ( 434 ft 0 in ) long overall and 121 @.@ 92 meters ( 400 ft 0 in ) between perpendiculars . She had a beam of 20 @.@ 94 meters ( 68 ft 8 in ) and had an average draft of 7 @.@ 26 meters ( 23 ft 10 in ) . Izumo displaced 9 @,@ 503 metric tons ( 9 @,@ 353 long tons ) at normal load and 10 @,@ 305 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 142 long tons ) at deep load . The ship had a metacentric height of 0 @.@ 88 meters ( 2 ft 11 in ) . Her crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 Izumo had two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller shaft . Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) . The ship had a designed speed of 20 @.@ 75 knots ( 38 @.@ 43 km / h ; 23 @.@ 88 mph ) and reached 21 @.@ 74 knots ( 40 @.@ 26 km / h ; 25 @.@ 02 mph ) during her sea trials from 16 @,@ 078 ihp ( 11 @,@ 989 kW ) . She carried up to 1 @,@ 527 long tons ( 1 @,@ 551 t ) of coal and could steam for 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The main armament for all of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers was four eight @-@ inch guns in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The secondary armament consisted of 14 Elswick Ordnance Company " Pattern Z " quick @-@ firing ( QF ) , 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . Only four of these guns were not mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields . Izumo was also equipped with a dozen QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 @-@ cwt guns and eight QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Yamauchi guns as close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats . The ship was equipped with four submerged 457 mm ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . 
 All of the " Six @-@ Six Fleet " armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences . The waterline belt of Krupp cemented armor ran the full length of the ship and its thickness varied from 178 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 0 in ) amidships to 89 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) at the bow and stern . It had a height of 2 @.@ 13 meters ( 7 ft 0 in ) , of which 1 @.@ 39 meters ( 4 ft 7 in ) was normally underwater . The upper strake of belt armor was 127 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck . It extended 51 @.@ 18 meters ( 167 ft 11 in ) from the forward to the rear barbette . The Izumo class had oblique 127 mm armored bulkheads that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel . 
 The barbettes , gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by 51 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor . The deck was 63 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 5 in ) thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was 356 millimeters ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 The contract for Izumo , named after the eponymous province , was signed on 24 September 1897 with Armstrong Whitworth . The ship was laid down at their shipyard in Elswick on 14 May 1898 and launched on 19 September . She was completed on 25 September 1900 and departed for Japan on 2 October under the command of Captain Inoue Toshio , who had been appointed to supervise her construction and bring her back to Japan on 29 September 1899 . Izumo arrived in Yokosuka on 8 December and Inoue was confirmed in his command . 
 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Izumo , now under the command of Captain <unk> Naoki , was the flagship of Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō , commander of the 2nd Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russians . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight- and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered some 150 , while the Japanese suffered roughly 90 killed and wounded before Tōgō disengaged . 
 In early March , Kamimura was tasked to take the reinforced 2nd Division north and make a diversion off Vladivostok . While scouting for Russian ships in the area , the Japanese cruisers bombarded the harbor and defenses of Vladivostok on 6 March to little effect . Upon their return to Japan a few days later , the 2nd Division was ordered to escort the transports ferrying the Imperial Guards Division to Korea and then to join the ships blockading Port Arthur . Kamimura was ordered north in mid @-@ April to cover the Sea of Japan and defend the Korea Strait against any attempt by the Vladivostok Independent Cruiser Squadron , under the command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen , to break through and unite with the Pacific Squadron . The two units narrowly missed each other on the 24th in heavy fog and the Japanese proceeded to Vladivostok where they laid several minefields before arriving back at Wonsan on the 30th . 
 The division failed to intercept the Russian squadron as it attacked several transports south of Okinoshima Island on 15 June due to heavy rain and fog . The Russians sortied again on 30 June and Kamimura finally was able to intercept them the next day near Okinoshima . The light was failing when they were spotted and the Russians were able to disengage in the darkness . Jessen 's ships sortied again on 17 July headed for the eastern coast of Japan to act as a diversion and pull Japanese forces out of the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea . The Russian ships passed through Tsugaru Strait two days later and began capturing ships bound for Japan . The arrival of the Russians off Tokyo Bay on the 24th caused the Naval General Staff to order Kamimura to sail for Cape Toi Misaki , Kyūshū , fearing that Jessen would circumnavigate Japan to reach Port Arthur . Two days later he was ordered north to the Kii Channel and then to Tokyo Bay on the 28th . The General Staff finally ordered him back to Tsushima Island on the 30th ; later that day he received word that Jessen 's ships had passed through the Tsugaru Strait early that morning and reached Vladivostok on 1 August . 
 = = = = Battle off Ulsan = = = = 
 On 10 August , the ships at Port Arthur attempted a breakout to Vladivostok , but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them , but the order was delayed . His three armored cruisers , Rossia , Gromoboi , and Rurik , had to raise steam , so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August . By dawn he had reached Tsushima , but turned back when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron . 36 miles ( 58 km ) north of the island he encountered Kamimura 's squadron , which consisted of four modern armored cruisers , Iwate , Tokiwa , Azuma , and Izumo . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting one another and each had reversed course around first light . This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok . 
 Jessen ordered his ships to turn to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 05 : 00 and they followed suit , albeit on a slightly converging course . Both sides opened fire around 05 : 23 at a range of 8 @,@ 500 meters ( 9 @,@ 300 yd ) . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik , the rear ship of the Russian formation . She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships . Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range , but this blinded the Russian gunners with the rising sun and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese . About 06 : 00 , Jessen turned 180 ° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron . Kamimura followed suit around 06 : 10 , but turned to port , which opened the range between the squadrons . Azuma then developed engine problems and the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed . Firing recommenced at 06 : 24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern , flooding her steering compartment ; she had to be steered with her engines . Her speed continued to decrease , further exposing her to Japanese fire , and her steering jammed to port around 06 : 40 . 
 Jessen made another 180 ° turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik , but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen 's ships and the Japanese . Kamimura turned 180 ° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses , but Jessen quickly made another 180 ° turn so that they headed on opposing courses . The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07 : 45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself ; her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later . Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08 : 00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok . Despite this , Jessen turned back once more at 08 : 15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed , about 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 About this time Kamimura 's two elderly protected cruisers , Naniwa and Takachiho , were approaching from the south . Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers while the two new arrivals dealt with Rurik . They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half ; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 5 @,@ 500 yd ) , but Kamimura then opened the range up to 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) . 
 About 10 : 00 , Kamimura 's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three @-@ quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five @-@ minute rapid @-@ fire barrage . He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik . By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho . They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk , but he did not receive the message . Shortly after the Japanese turned back , Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave @-@ to to make repairs . None of the Japanese ships were seriously damaged ; despite Izumo receiving over 20 hits , she only suffered 3 men killed and 16 wounded during the battle . She began repairs at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in mid @-@ September . 
 On 26 January 1905 , Kamimura hoisted his flag again in Izumo at Sasebo and then escorted several troop convoys to Wonsan on February . On 13 April , the 2nd Division , including the armored cruisers Tokiwa and Kasuga , sailed to escort minelayers as they laid 715 mines off Vladivostok . 
 = = = = Battle of Tsushima = = = = 
 As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons approached Japan on 27 May , having sailed from the Baltic Sea , they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning , but visibility was limited and radio reception poor . The preliminary reports were enough to cause Tōgō to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships under the command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11 : 30 . Kamimura closed to about a range of 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 yd ) before sheering off under fire to join Tōgō 's battleships . Izumo was leading the 2nd Division when Tōgō opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14 : 10 and , like most of the ships in the division , engaged the battleship Oslyabya which was forced to fall out of formation at 14 : 50 and sank 20 minutes later . By this time the Russian formation was in disorder and Knyaz Suvorov suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15 : 35 at a range of about 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . All of Kamimura 's ships engaged her for five minutes or so with Azuma and the armored cruiser Yakumo also firing torpedoes at the Russian ship without effect . 
 After 17 : 30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers , leaving Tōgō 's battleships to their own devices . He abandoned his chase around 18 : 03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō . His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18 : 30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8 @,@ 000 – 9 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 – 9 @,@ 800 yd ) . Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19 : 30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20 : 08 as night was falling . The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10 : 30 , staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply . Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range . Over the course of the battle , Izumo was struck by five large shells , mostly 12 @-@ inch , and three smaller shells , mostly 6 @-@ inch . They caused only minor damage , although one 12 @-@ inch shell , which pierced a boiler uptake , could have disabled all of the middle boilers had it detonated . The shells killed 4 men and wounded 26 others . 
 As the IJN was preparing to invade Sakhalin Island in early July , Kamimura 's 2nd Division , now reduced to Iwate , Izumo , and Tokiwa , was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea . In mid @-@ August , the division covered the landing at Chongjin , closer to the Russian border . 
 On 20 September 1909 , under command of Captain Takeshita Isamu , Izumo departed Yokohama for the United States to participate in the Portola Festival at San Francisco , a city @-@ wide fair held on 19 – 23 October to mark the 140th anniversary of the Portolà expedition , the first recorded Spanish ( and European ) land entry and exploration of present @-@ day California , and to proclaim to the world that San Francisco was recovered from its devastating 1906 earthquake . Lieutenant Prince Shimazu <unk> was assigned to the ship during this visit . She made port calls in Hawaii , Monterrey , Santa Barbara , and San Diego en route . On 12 November 1913 , Izumo was ordered to patrol the west coast of Mexico to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the Mexican Revolution . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 When Japan declared war on the Central Powers in August 1914 , Izumo was still off the Mexican coast and was ordered to protect Allied shipping there and search for German commerce raiders . On 1 November , the ship , then off San Francisco , was ordered to join a British task force commanded by Admiral Sir George Patey off San Clemente Island that included the battlecruiser Australia and the light cruiser Newcastle . After the German gunboat SMS Geier was interned by the Americans on 8 November , the ex @-@ Russian battleship Hizen and Asama , which had been patrolling off Honolulu , Hawaii , to prevent the German ship from leaving , rendezvoused with the other ships of the American Expeditionary Squadron at Magdalena Bay , Baja California on 22 November . The squadron , now commanded by Rear Admiral Moriyama <unk> in Izumo , then headed south to search along the western coast of South America for German ships . On 11 December , after the receiving the news of the British victory in the Battle of the Falkland Islands , the squadron moved north to search off the western coast of Central America and then Mexican and U.S. waters in January . 
 While searching Baja California , Asama was badly damaged when she struck an uncharted rock on 31 January . Izumo , delayed by poor communications , arrived on 12 February and Moriyama radioed for repair and salvage ships to be sent from Japan . Izumo was relieved by Tokiwa on 19 March and the ship returned home . 
 Izumo relieved the protected cruiser Akashi in June 1917 at Malta as the flagship of Rear Admiral Kōzō Satō , commander of the Second Special Mission Squadron that controlled the Japanese destroyers that escorted convoys in the Mediterranean Sea . In December 1918 , Izumo , accompanied by the destroyers <unk> and Yanagi , sailed from Malta to Scapa Flow to assume control of seven captured German U @-@ boats as prizes of war . They returned to Malta with the U @-@ boats in March 1919 and the armored cruiser Nisshin accompanied eight destroyers and the U @-@ boats to Japan , while Izumo made port calls at Naples , Genoa and Marseilles before arriving in Japan with the remaining destroyers on 2 July 1919 . 
 = = = Interwar years = = = 
 Izumo participated in the 1919 Naval Review by Emperor Taishō . She was re @-@ designated a 1st class coast @-@ defense ship on 1 September 1921 and used primarily for training duties in long @-@ distance oceanic navigation and officer training for cadets in the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy . In this capacity , she participated six voyages in the 1920s and 1930s to Europe , North and South America , and Oceania , including a circumnavigation of the globe from August 1921 to April 1922 with Yakumo . Two of the naval cadets that participated in this cruise were Princes Kuni <unk> and Kachō Hirotada . While in Vancouver , British Columbia , on 7 February 1925 , on one of these cruises , a tugboat collided with one of the ship 's boats at night , drowning 11 crewmen . 
 In 1924 , four of Izumo 's 12 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as were all of her QF 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder guns , and a single 8 cm / 40 3rd Year Type anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) gun was added . Refitted again in 1930 – 31 , her torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6 @-@ inch guns and their casemates plated over ; she now carried only four 12 @-@ pounders . In 1935 her boilers were replaced by six Kampon water @-@ tube boilers with an output of only 7 @,@ 000 ihp ( 5 @,@ 200 kW ) which reduced her top speed to 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . She now carried 1 @,@ 428 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 405 long tons ) of coal and 329 metric tons ( 324 long tons ) of fuel oil which increased her deep displacement to 10 @,@ 864 metric tons ( 10 @,@ 692 long tons )

 On 2 February 1932 , during the First Shanghai Incident , Izumo became the flagship of the newly re @-@ established 3rd Fleet under Admiral Kichisaburō Nomura and arrived in Shanghai six days later . In 1934 , Izumo was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal . 
 Shortly after the beginning of the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War in July 1937 , Izumo was attacked on 14 August 1937 in a series of raids by Chinese Air Force aircraft during the Battle of Shanghai . Most of the bombs landed in the river without effect , but two bombs landed among spectators , killing hundreds . Izumo 's Nakajima <unk> floatplane and another from the light cruiser Sendai managed to get into the air and they claimed to have shot down one Curtiss Hawk biplane fighter and a Northrop Gamma bomber . Two days later , her <unk> claimed to have shot down another Hawk . Izumo was attacked that same day by a Chinese torpedo boat , but the torpedoes missed and the boat was abandoned by its crew . The ship provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore during the battle . Izumo was repeatedly attacked without effect by Chinese aircraft for the duration of the Battle of Shanghai . 
 Still in Shanghai at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941 , Izumo captured the American river gunboat USS Wake and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat HMS Peterel . On 31 December , the cruiser struck a mine in the Lingayen Gulf while supporting Japanese forces during the Philippines Campaign . She was towed to Hong Kong in February 1942 for repairs . Izumo was re @-@ classified as a 1st @-@ class cruiser on 1 July . She returned to Japan in late 1943 and was reclassified as a training ship for the Kure Naval District . 
 On 19 March 1945 , Izumo was attacked by American carrier aircraft off Etajima , although they failed to inflict any damage . Shortly afterwards , her 8 @-@ inch guns were replaced by four 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of her remaining 6 @-@ inch guns were removed . Her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 14 license @-@ built Hotchkiss 25 @-@ millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in two triple , two twin , and four single @-@ gun mounts and two 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts . The ship was damaged by an American mine on 9 April off Hiroshima . Izumo was not attacked on the first day of the American aerial attack on Kure on 24 July 1945 , but she was near missed three times four days later . The shockwave from the detonations sprang the ship 's seams and the resulting flooding caused her to capsize at coordinates 34 ° 14 ′ N 132 ° 30 ′ E. She was removed from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised and scrapped in 1947 by the Harima Dock Company .

 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " is the eleventh episode in the first season of the American animated television series South Park . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 11 , 1998 . In the episode , the South Park Elementary boys become infatuated with the new substitute teacher Ms. Ellen , making Wendy Testaburger extremely jealous . Meanwhile , Mr. Garrison gets a nose job that makes him resemble actor David Hasselhoff . 
 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " was the first Valentine 's Day @-@ themed episode of the series and was written by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . The episode advocates the concept of inner beauty through the Mr. Garrison subplot , and shows the boys ' efforts to win Ms. Ellen 's affection despite the fact that she is a lesbian . 
 Natasha Henstridge makes a guest appearances as Ms. Ellen , marking the first time a celebrity guest played a major role in a South Park episode . She is credited as " The Chick from Species " in the opening credits . The episode marked the first time a real photographic image of a person 's head ( in this case David Hasselhoff ) was superimposed over a cartoon body , a practice which would become common throughout the series . 
 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " introduced the song " No Substitute " , which was sung by Chef and was later included on Chef Aid : The South Park Album . Trey Parker and Matt Stone said they were initially unhappy with " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " when production of the episode concluded , and were surprised when fans responded positively to it . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Valentine 's Day approaches , and Wendy suggests to her boyfriend Stan ways to spend time together . However , when their schoolteacher Mr. Garrison decides to get a rhinoplasty , a new substitute arrives named Ms. Ellen ( Natasha Henstridge ) and all the boys in class find themselves inexplicably enamored with her , including Stan . Wendy becomes incredibly jealous and warns Ms. Ellen to stay away from Stan , unaware that the substitute teacher does not return Stan 's affection . 
 Concerned about the children 's education , Ms. Ellen reveals she will buy dinner for the winner of a spelling test . The boys actively try to court Ms. Ellen , but Chef ( having beaten them to it ) warns them she is a lesbian and thus only likes other lesbians . The boys do not realise what this means and try to become lesbians in order to attract Ms. Ellen . Meanwhile , Mr. Garrison 's nose job makes him one of the most attractive men in South Park , with his face resembling David Hasselhoff , and he decides to quit teaching and pursue women . Stan wins the dinner ( much to Wendy 's dismay ) , but finds out that Ms. Ellen has no intention of making love with him . Wendy however sees them through the window and leaves distraught . The next day , several Iraqi men burst into the classroom and declare that Ms. Ellen is actually an Iraqi fugitive . As she resists arrest , she inadvertently kills Kenny by impaling him with a sword to his face . The soldiers take her into custody and shoot her into the center of the Sun via a rocket . 
 Mr. Garrison becomes a successful model , but he soon finds himself being chased throughout the streets by a large group of women attracted to him . Frightened by all the attention , Mr. Garrison decides to return to his normal looks . Wendy reclaims Stan as her boyfriend . Wendy speaks with the Iraqi men in fluent Arabic and pays them with a wad of American money . Later , Wendy watches joyfully as the rocket blows up in the sun , and Kyle realizes Wendy hired the Iraqis to kill Ms. Ellen . Outraged by this , Kyle angrily confronts Wendy for this , but Wendy declares , " I told her : ' Don 't ... fuck ... with ... Wendy ... Testaburger ! ' "

 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " was written and directed by South Park co @-@ creator Trey Parker . It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on February 11 , 1998 . It is considered the show 's first Valentine 's Day episode , since it came out three days before Valentine 's Day and involved semi @-@ romantic plot @-@ lines . Natasha Henstridge makes a guest appearance as substitute teacher Ms. Ellen . Following the success of " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " , a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes , allowing Parker and fellow co @-@ creator Matt Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars . Parker asked for Henstridge solely because he found her attractive in Species , the 1995 science fiction horror film in which she starred . Henstridge was nervous performing the role because she had never conducted a voice over performance before . Henstridge was credited as " The Chick from Species " in the opening credits . 
 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " marked the first time a real photographic image of a person 's head ( in this case David Hasselhoff ) was superimposed over a cartoon body , a practice which would become common throughout the series . Parker said the technology was not previously available in the earliest episodes of the series . Comedy Central was required to pay royalties to the photographer of the picture used for Hasselhoff 's head , but was not required to pay Hasselhoff himself . " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " displayed notable improvements in South Park 's animation , which was gradually improving throughout the first season and settling into the defined look the series has maintained throughout the years . One of the exterior scenes in " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " featured the first perspective angle of a street , which were previously only shown sideways or straight angles . Additionally , the simulated rain during a scene with Wendy watching Ms. Ellen and Stan from outside a restaurant was far more sophisticated than any such animation in previous episodes . 
 Chef sings a song called " No Substitute " to Ms. Ellen in an attempt to woo her . The brief song was later expanded and included in Chef Aid : The South Park Album , a South Park soundtrack released in 1998 . " No Substitute " was performed by Isaac Hayes and was written by Parker , Stone and Bruce Howell , a South Park composer and producer . During one montage scene in " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " , a jealous Wendy recalls memories of her relationship with Stan while a sad song plays in the background . The song is performed by actress Courtney Ford , who appeared as an extra in the 1998 comedy film BASEketball , which starred Parker and Stone . Like Henstridge , Parker asked Ford to appear in the episode because he found her attractive . The Indigo Girls @-@ style song in " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " was written and sung by Toddy Walters , who played protagonist Polly Pry in Trey Parker 's 1996 film , Cannibal ! The Musical . The song is called " I Love Domestic <unk> " , and was written " as sort of a lesbian anthem " . 
 During one scene , Wendy tells Stan that she smelled Ms. Ellen taking a " smelly dump " in the bathroom in an attempt to make him less attracted to her . In the original script , Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection , but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line . Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes , they often object to lines about female hygiene problems . During a cafeteria scene , a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker , but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character . The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker 's real @-@ life experiences . At his school , the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded " Student of the Week " . Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience " really , really creepy " because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair . 
 Parker and Stone had trouble deciding how to end " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " in a way that would bring everything back to normal in South Park . Originally , the episode ended with Ms. Ellen being taken away by the Iraqi soldiers , leaving the impression that she was in fact an Iraqi fugitive . They ultimately decided this was a poor way to end the show , so they recast the ending to make Ms. Ellen an innocent woman who was framed by Wendy . Parker and Stone also struggled with how to make Mr. Garrison decide he wanted his old nose back . It was only a few days before the episode aired that these final decisions about the ending were made . 
 = = Theme = = 
 Describing the general tone of the show , Teri Fitsell of The New Zealand Herald explains that " South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality , and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them . " The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior . However , Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show 's language is realistic . " There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet , and it 's just not real ... Don 't people remember what they were like in third grade ? We were little bastards . " 
 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " in general advocates the concept of inner beauty by showing how miserable Mr. Garrison becomes after having his nose job ; as a model , he becomes a burnout and heroin addict who only finds happiness once he sheds his new outer image and becomes his old self . The episode also demonstrates the lack of understanding many have about the gay community by portraying the characters as seeking to become lesbians in order to win Ms. Ellen 's affection , even though they do not know what a lesbian is . 
 = = Cultural references and impact = = 
 After Mr. Garrison gets a nose job , his face resembles that of David Hasselhoff , the actor and singer best known for the series Knight Rider and Baywatch . Mr. Garrison refers disparagingly to the 1997 science fiction drama film Contact . Parker and Stone said they went out of their way to include the reference due to their own strong distaste for the film . 
 The song that plays when Mr. Garrison strolls down the street after his nose job is " Shadow Dancing " by Andy Gibb . When trying to determine how attractive Ms. Ellen is , Chef asks the boys how she compares to a number of celebrities , including Vanessa L. Williams , Toni Braxton , Pamela Anderson and Erin Gray . For the latter actress , he specifically asks if Ms. Ellen is as attractive as Gray was in the second season of the NBC series , Buck Rogers in the 25th Century . When Ms. Ellen asks the class about the last lesson Mr. Garrison taught them , Cartman said they had been learning about how actress Yasmine Bleeth was dating Richard Grieco , the star of television series 21 Jump Street and Booker . 
 The store Tom 's Rhinoplasty first appeared in the background of the short Jesus vs. Santa ; it is regularly shown in the background throughout the rest of the series , as well as in the 1999 South Park film , South Park : Bigger , Longer & Uncut . A South Park drinking game included in the book " The Complete Guide to Television and Movie Drinking " encourages viewers to drink whenever South Park residents walk by or gather in front of the Tom 's Rhinoplasty building .

 When production of " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " ended , Parker and Stone were dissatisfied with the final product and believed audiences would hate it , but were surprised to receive largely positive feedback from fans , some of whom described it as their favorite of the latter half of the season . " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " has been described as one of the classic episodes of South Park . In 2003 , the Chicago Tribune listed it among the top 10 episodes of the series . Walt Belcher of The Tampa Tribune praised the episode and said it " celebrates Valentine 's Day [ as ] only the Comedy Central series can " , although he warned it was not for children . During a brief scene in " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " , Mr. Garrison leans against a mailbox with a United States Postal Service logo printed on the side . The Postal Service contacted Comedy Central after the episode aired and threatened legal action if the logo was used again without permission . 
 " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " was released , along with 11 other episodes , in a three @-@ disc DVD set in November 1998 . It was included in the third volume , which also included the episodes " Starvin ' Marvin " , " Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo " and " Mecha @-@ Streisand " . The DVD commentary recorded by Parker and Stone for " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " has been cited as one of the primary reasons the commentaries were not included in the South Park Season One DVD release . Warner Bros. , which released the DVD set , refused to include the commentaries due to " standards " issues with some of the statements unless Parker and Stone allowed the tracks to be edited , which they refused . Media outlets said the commentary that most bothered Warner Bros. executives was the one for " Tom 's Rhinoplasty " , in which Parker and Stone say they agree with Mr. Garrison 's character that the 1997 film Contact ( also released by Warner Bros. ) was " terrible " . The commentaries were ultimately released on CD separately from the DVDs .

 A retiarius ( plural retiarii ; literally , " net @-@ man " or " net @-@ fighter " in Latin ) was a Roman gladiator who fought with equipment styled on that of a fisherman : a weighted net ( rete , hence the name ) , a three @-@ pointed trident ( fuscina or tridens ) , and a dagger ( pugio ) . The retiarius was lightly armoured , wearing an arm guard ( manica ) and a shoulder guard ( galerus ) . Typically , his clothing consisted only of a loincloth ( subligaculum ) held in place by a wide belt , or of a short tunic with light padding . He wore no head protection or footwear . 
 The retiarius was routinely pitted against a heavily armed secutor . The net @-@ fighter made up for his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent 's attacks and waiting for the opportunity to strike . He first tried to throw his net over his rival . If this succeeded , he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled . Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy 's weapon in the net and pull it out of his grasp , leaving the opponent defenseless . Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it , the retiarius likely discarded the weapon , although he might try to collect it back for a second cast . Usually , the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight . The trident , as tall as a human being , permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance . It was a strong weapon , capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb . The dagger was the retiarius 's final backup should the trident be lost . It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout . In some battles , a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously . For these situations , the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers . 
 <unk> first appeared in the arena during the 1st century AD and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century . The gladiator 's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest ( and most effeminate ) of an already stigmatised ( i.e. gladiators ) class . Passages from the works of Juvenal , Seneca , and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype ( retiarii <unk> ) who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns . Nevertheless , Roman artwork , graffiti , and grave markers include examples of specific net @-@ men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers . 
 = = History and role = = 
 Roman gladiators fell into stock categories modelled on real @-@ world precedents . Almost all of these classes were based on military antecedents ; the retiarius ( " net @-@ fighter " or " net @-@ man " ) , which was themed after the sea , was one exception . Rare gladiator fights were staged over water ; these may have given rise to the concept of a gladiator based on a fisherman . Fights between differently armed gladiators became popular in the Imperial period ; the retiarius versus the scaly secutor developed as the conflict of a fisherman with a stylised fish . The earlier <unk> had borne a fish on their helmets ; the secutores with their scaly armour evolved from them . However , because of the stark differences in arms and armour between the two types , the pairing pushed such practices to new extremes . Roman art and literature make no mention of retiarii until the early Imperial period ; for example , the type is absent from the copious gladiator @-@ themed reliefs dating to the 1st century found at Chieti and Pompeii . Nevertheless , graffiti and artifacts from Pompeii attest to the class 's existence by this time . Fights between retiarii and secutores probably became popular as early as the middle of the 1st century CE , and the net @-@ fighter became one of the standard gladiator categories by the 2nd or 3rd century CE and remained a staple attraction until the end of the gladiatorial games . In addition to the man @-@ versus @-@ nature symbolism inherent in such bouts , the lightly armoured retiarius was viewed as the effeminate counterpoint to the manly , heavily armoured secutor . The retiarius was also seen as water to the secutor 's fire , one constantly moving and escaping , the other determinedly inescapable . Another gladiator type , the <unk> ( " noose @-@ man " ) , was similar to the retiarius but fought with a lasso in place of a net . 
 The more skin left unarmoured and exposed , the lower a gladiator 's status and the greater his perceived effeminacy . Likewise , the engulfing net may have been seen as a feminine symbol . The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest , most disgraced , and most effeminate of the gladiator types . Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to <unk> the fighters ; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade @-@ at @-@ arms , someone he probably lived and trained with every day , his opponent 's helmet added an extra layer of separation . However , the retiarius was allowed no head protection ; his face was visible to all . The emperor Claudius had all net @-@ fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony . The retiarius 's fighting style was another strike against him , as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows . The retiarii lived in the worst barracks . Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites , another gladiator type , in order to improve their status . 
 There is evidence that those net @-@ men wearing tunics , known as retiarii <unk> , formed a special sub @-@ class , one even more demeaned than their loincloth @-@ wearing colleagues . The Roman satirist Juvenal wrote that : 
 So even the <unk> 's establishment is better ordered than yours , for he separates the vile from the decent , and sequesters even from their fellow @-@ retiarii the wearers of the ill @-@ famed tunic ; in the training @-@ school , and even in gaol , such creatures herd apart … . 
 The passage suggests that tunic @-@ wearing retiarii were trained for a different role , " in servitude , under strict discipline and even possibly under some restraints . " Certain effeminate men mentioned by Seneca the Younger in his Quaestiones <unk> were trained as gladiators and may correspond to Juvenal 's tunic @-@ wearing retiarii . Suetonius reports this anecdote : " Once a band of five retiarii in tunics , matched against the same number of secutores , yielded without a struggle ; but when their death was ordered , one of them caught up his trident and slew all the victors . " The reaction of Emperor Caligula showed the disgust with which he viewed the gladiators ' actions : " Caligula <unk> this in a public proclamation as a most cruel murder , and expressed his horror of those who had had the heart to witness it . " The fate of the retiarii is not revealed . This was probably not a standard competition , as real gladiators did not surrender so easily . Rather , such tunic @-@ wearing net @-@ men may have served as comic relief in the gladiatorial programming . 
 Juvenal 's second satire , wherein he deplores the immorality he perceived in Roman society , introduces a member of the Gracchus family who is described as a homosexual married ( in female persona ) to a horn player . Gracchus later appears in the arena : 
 Greater still the portent when Gracchus , clad in a tunic , played the gladiator , and fled , trident in hand , across the arena — Gracchus , a man of nobler birth than the <unk> , or the <unk> , or the descendants of Catulus or Paulus , or the <unk> : nobler than all the spectators in the podium ; not excepting him who gave the show at which that net was flung . 
 Gracchus appears once again in Juvenal 's eighth satire as the worst example of the noble Romans who have disgraced themselves by appearing in public spectacles and popular entertainments : 
 To crown all this [ scandal ] , what is left but the amphitheatre ? And this disgrace of the city you have as well — Gracchus not fighting as equipped as a <unk> , with buckler or <unk> ( for he condemns — yes , condemns and hates such equipment ) . Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet . See ! he wields a trident . When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand , he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators , and , easily to be recognized , flees across the whole arena . We can not mistake the tunic , since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck , and flutters in the breeze from his high @-@ peaked cap . Therefore , the disgrace , which the <unk> had to submit to , in being forced to fight with Gracchus , was worse than any wound . 
 The passage is obscure , but Cerutti and Richardson argue that Gracchus begins the fight as a loincloth @-@ wearing retiarius . When the tide turns against him , he dons a tunic and a <unk> wig ( <unk> ) , apparently part of the same costume , and thus enjoys a reprieve , although this attire may not itself have been considered effeminate as it was also worn by the priests of Mars of whom Gracchus was the chief priest . The change of clothing seems to turn a serious fight into a comical one and shames his opponent . It is unusual to see a gladiator depicted this way in a satire , as such fighters usually take the role of men who are " brawny , brutal , sexually successful with women of both high and low status , but especially the latter , ill @-@ educated if not uneducated , and none too bright intellectually . " The retiarius <unk> in the satire is the opposite : " a mock gladiatorial figure , of equivocal sex , regularly dressed in costume of some sort , possibly usually as a woman , and matched against a secutor or murmillo in a mock gladiatorial exhibition . " 
 Despite their low status , some retiarii became quite popular throughout the early Empire . The fact that spectators could see net @-@ fighters ' faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity . At Pompeii , graffiti tells of Crescens or <unk> the retiarius , " lord of the girls " and " doctor to nighttime girls , morning girls , and all the rest . " Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators , and the retiarius would have been particularly appealing . Roman art depicts net @-@ men just as often as other types . A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the Villa dei <unk> shows a retiarius named <unk> . The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous . The mosaic dates to c . CE 130 , when the <unk> family had the home built ; the emperor Commodus , who fought in gladiatorial bouts as a secutor , acquired the house in CE 182 and used it as a country villa . In modern times , popular culture has made the retiarius probably the most famous type of gladiator . 
 = = Arms and armour = = 
 The retiarius is the most readily identifiable gladiator type , due to his signature equipment : arm guard ( manica ) , shoulder guard ( galerus ) , net ( rete ) , trident ( fuscina or tridens ) , and dagger ( pugio ) . ( Technically , the retiarius was not a " gladiator " at all , since he did not fight with the sword — gladius — after which such fighters took their name . ) His weapons and armour could be decorated . An embellished gladiatorial dagger is held at the Naples National Archaeological Museum . Archaeologists have excavated three engraved shoulder guards from the gladiator barracks at Pompeii : one is engraved with illustrations of an anchor , a crab , and a dolphin ; another with cupids and the head of Hercules ; and a third with weapons and the inscription RET / <unk> ( " retiarius , second rank " ) . 
 Although the net ( rete ) was this gladiator 's signature weapon , few depictions of the device survive . Combat with throwing nets may have occurred on ancient battlefields , but modern experiments and comparisons with modern fishing nets offer the only clues as to how the gladiatorial net was constructed . Such data indicate that the rete was circular , with a wide mesh about 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 5 ft ) in diameter and lead weights along the edges . A rope ran around the perimeter of the mesh , with the ends tied to the gladiator 's wrist . Because it was thrown , the net was sometimes called a <unk> . 
 The retiarius complemented his net with an iron or bronze trident ( fuscina , <unk> or , rarely , tridens ) that stood about as high as a human being . A skull found in a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus , Turkey , shows puncture holes consistent with a trident strike . The wounds are 5 centimetres ( 2 in ) apart and match a bronze trident excavated from Ephesus harbour in 1989 . The trident 's prongs are 21 @.@ 6 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) long . 
 A long , straight @-@ bladed dagger ( pugio ) was the gladiator 's final weapon . A tombstone found in Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes ( known as a <unk> — each spike at the corner of a square guard ) instead of the usual bladed dagger . This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon . 
 The retiarius wore minimal armour ; unlike other gladiator types , he wore no helmet , greaves , or shield . He wore a manica on his left arm , where other gladiators wore it on the right ; this allowed him to more fluidly make a right @-@ handed cast of his net . Attached to the top of this was a long bronze or leather guard over the upper left arm and shoulder , known as a galerus . This guard extended 12 to 13 centimetres ( 4 @.@ 7 to 5 @.@ 1 in ) beyond the shoulder blade and flared outward , allowing free movement of the gladiator 's head . The device protected the upper arm , head and face when the retiarius kept his left side to his opponent . The armour was designed to let the net @-@ man duck his head behind it , and it was curved so as to deflect a blow from the top downwards , not up towards the eyes . Three examples of this protective gear found at Pompeii vary between 30 and 35 centimetres ( 11 @.@ 8 and 13 @.@ 7 in ) in length and about the same in width . They weigh about 1 @.@ 1 to 1 @.@ 2 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 4 to 2 @.@ 6 lb ) . 
 In the Eastern Roman Empire in later years , some retiarii wore a chainmail manica instead of the galerus . This mail covered the arm and upper chest . Equipment styles stayed relatively fixed in the Western Empire . 
 Besides these items , the retiarius wore only a loincloth ( subligaculum ) held in place by a wide belt and gaiters or , as images show in lieu of the loincloth , a tunic that left the right shoulder uncovered . He wore fabric padding on his body to provide minimal additional protection . Artistic depictions show that other options included <unk> , <unk> , a headband , and a medallion . All told , the retiarius 's equipment weighed 7 to 8 kilograms ( 15 @.@ 4 to 17 @.@ 6 lb ) , making him the lightest of the standard gladiator types . Like other arena combatants , the retiarius fought barefoot . 
 = = Fighting style = = 
 The retiarius was traditionally pitted against a secutor or , possibly on rare occasions , a murmillo . Despite the disparity between the nearly nude net @-@ fighter and his heavily armoured adversary , modern re @-@ enactments and experiments show that the retiarius was by no means outmatched . His lack of heavy equipment meant that he could use speed and evasion to his advantage . He also fought with three offensive weapons to his opponent 's one . The net @-@ fighter had to avoid close combat at all costs , keep his distance , and wait for an opening to stab with his trident or throw his net . The name secutor means " pursuer " or " chaser " , because this gladiator had to chase down the retiarius . They were also known as <unk> ( " those against the net @-@ man " ) . The secutor 's strategy was to keep behind his shield ( scutum ) and force his opponent into close combat so that he could strike with his sword . In close quarters , the net @-@ man had only his galerus shoulder guard for defence ; its design forced him to keep his head ducked down behind it . The secutor 's helmet greatly restricted his sight , hearing , and airflow . Coupled with the heavy weight of his arms and armour — the gear of a murmillo , of which the secutor was a variant , weighed 15 to 18 kilograms ( 33 @.@ 1 to 39 @.@ 7 lb ) — this gladiator was in greater danger of exhausting himself in a long fight . One of the retiarius 's tactics was to jab at the secutor 's shield ( the heaviest part of his equipment ) , forcing him to block and wear himself out . Overall , Roman oddsmakers gave an advantage to a retiarius , although skill and experience could affect the odds in individual matches . 
 In skilled hands , the net was a useful weapon . The retiarius 's primary objective with it was to capture his opponent . A ewer found at <unk> demonstrates the throwing technique : the retiarius held the net folded up in his right hand and cast it underhanded . He held his trident and dagger in his left hand , careful to keep the trident 's prongs pointed downward to avoid snagging it in the mesh . If the toss missed , the retiarius used the <unk> tied to his wrist to bring the net back in hand . On a successful cast , the gladiator tightened the <unk> around the net 's perimeter and tried to unbalance or topple his rival . A successful cast of the net could win the battle for the retiarius straightaway . This was not certain , however , as a mosaic at the National Archaeological Museum in Madrid shows : in the first panel , the retiarius Kalendio has caught his opponent , a secutor named Astyanax , in his net . In the later image , however , Kalendio lies on the ground , wounded , and raises his dagger to surrender . The inscription above Kalendio shows the sign for " null " , implying that the match organisers ordered him killed . 
 The net could ensnare the secutor 's weapon to disarm him and snag away his shield to put him at a significant disadvantage . Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent 's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him . The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net . In most cases , the secutor knew to expect the net @-@ man 's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon , possibly <unk> his enemy by yanking on the net . In such danger , the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger . The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it . Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net . Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net , yet the class is named for the device , and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires . The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence ; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance , and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict . The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight . Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets . 
 In most bouts , the retiarius probably had to resort to fighting with just his trident and dagger , placing him at a disadvantage . The trident was his primary weapon in such situations , and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay . He held the weapon two @-@ handed , left nearer the prongs , so that he could parry his enemy 's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends . <unk> two @-@ handed , the weapon could land powerful blows . Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutor 's unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an <unk> . The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal , although a skull found at Ephesus , Turkey , dating to CE 200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent . The secutor 's helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident 's prongs , but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield . This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed . Should the secutor strike with his sword , the retiarius parried with the trident prongs and attempted to disarm him . Likewise , the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net @-@ man to lose it . Another type of gladiator , scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius . Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show <unk> wearing a tubular arm @-@ guard in lieu of a shield . The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked , knife @-@ like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net . <unk> who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword . 
 The retiarius held the dagger in his left hand . The gladiator could use the dagger to cut his net free if it got snagged on his trident . He might fight with the trident in one hand and the dagger in the other , but this negated the advantage of distance afforded by the longer weapon when wielded by itself . The dagger also served as a backup should the retiarius lose both net and trident . He attacked with the dagger when he had the element of surprise and could attempt to wrestle the secutor to the ground . Fights could devolve into straight wrestling matches in such situations , perhaps with daggers . Should the retiarius win and be ordered to kill his rival , he used his knife to stab him or cut his throat . Evidence shows that retiarii could be quite successful combatants ; a tombstone from Gaul reads , " [ For ] the retiarius , L. Pompeius , winner of nine crowns , born in Vienna , twenty @-@ five years of age . His wife put this up with her own money for her wonderful spouse . " Nevertheless , the gladiators themselves were prone to boast : A graffito at Pompeii shows the retiarius Antigonus , who claims a ridiculous 2 @,@ 112 victories , facing a challenger called Superbus , who has won but a single fight . 
 In some contests , a retiarius faced two secutores at the same time . He stood on a bridge or raised platform with stairs and had a pile of fist @-@ sized stones to lob at his adversaries and keep them at bay . The secutores tried to scale the structure and get at him . The platform ( called a pons , " bridge " ) may have been constructed over water . Such scenarios were one of the rare situations where gladiators were not paired one on one . 
 = Lady Charlotte Finch = 
 Lady Charlotte Finch ( née Fermor ; 14 February 1725 – 11 July 1813 ) served as royal governess to the children of King George III and Queen Charlotte for over thirty years , holding the position from 1762 to 1793 . She was born to Thomas Fermor , 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys , both of whom held court appointments . The couple were educated and frequently travelled with their growing brood of children to the continent . Charlotte , like her sisters , was well @-@ educated ; in 1746 , she married the Hon. William Finch and had issue including George Finch , 9th Earl of Winchilsea . 
 An accomplished woman , Finch gained her appointment as royal governess in August 1762 upon the birth of George , Prince of Wales , the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte . Finch 's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein , as well as organising lessons for the children . Finch oversaw the princes ' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors , while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21 . Finch retired from her role in 1793 , though she continued to correspond with members of the royal family and receive gifts from them . 
 = = Early life and marriage = = 
 Lady Charlotte Fermor was born on 14 February 1725 , the second eldest daughter of Thomas Fermor , 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys . The growing family would come to include ten children : four sons and six daughters . Lord and Lady Pomfret held various court appointments during their lifetimes ; the earl served as Master of the Horse to Queen Caroline while his wife was a Lady of the Bedchamber . 
 Charlotte and her family were well travelled and sojourned to cultural and historical landmarks on the continent . While details on Fermor and her sisters ' education are minimal , mention of them in contemporary diaries implies they were well @-@ educated . She and Lady Pomfret were well @-@ read and interested in theology ; Charlotte 's friends included the educated Elizabeth Carter . Charlotte was fluent enough in Italian for Horace Walpole to remark in 1740 , she " speaks the purest Tuscan , like any Florentine " and " the Florentines look on her as the brightest foreigner that has honoured their [ Accademia ] . " According to Walpole , Lord Granville , who had been briefly married to Charlotte 's sister Sophia , was " extremely fond " of Charlotte ; after Sophia 's death in 1745 , Granville gave his deceased wife 's jewels to Charlotte , " to the great discontent of his own daughters " . 
 On 9 August 1746 , Charlotte married the Hon. William Finch ( 1691 – 1766 ) , heir to his brother Daniel Finch , 8th Earl of Winchilsea . Shortly after the wedding , Walpole reported that Charlotte had five thousand pounds from her father , a sum that would increase when " Mr Finch settles fifteen thousand pounds more upon her " . William Finch had previously been married to Lady Anne Douglas but had no issue . He was a diplomat who served as envoy to Sweden and the Netherlands in the 1720s before becoming an MP for Cockermouth and Bewdley . Another of his roles , held from 1742 , was to serve as vice @-@ chamberlain of the royal household . He and Lady Charlotte had one son and four daughters together . One of their daughters died in 1765 . Their only son , George , inherited the earldoms of Nottingham and Winchilsea from his paternal uncle in 1769 . 
 = = Royal governess = = 
 Lady Charlotte Finch 's career as royal governess began in August 1762 , when she was appointed a day after the birth of George , Prince of Wales , the eldest son and heir of King George III and Queen Charlotte . Walpole called the decision " a choice so universally approved that I do not think she will be abused even in the North Briton " . Finch 's biographer , Jill <unk> , writes that the governess was noted for the skill she devoted to the raising of her own children , while Christopher Hibbert suggests that her educated background made her " well @-@ suited " to the position . Lady Charlotte held the role of royal governess for over 30 years , and oversaw 14 of the king and queen 's 15 children . She presided over the royal nursery , overseeing the staff members designated for each child ; the staff included sub @-@ governesses , teachers , personal attendants , and assistant governesses . She oversaw the princes until they became old enough to live in their own households , while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21 . 
 In the mid @-@ 1760s , shortly after her appointment , troubling developments began occurring in Lady Charlotte 's home . One of her daughters died in 1765 . Furthermore , William Finch , who was 34 years older than his wife , had by 1765 become senile and mentally unstable . Rumours circulated that he threw her down a staircase . Fearing for her safety , she obtained a formal separation from her husband , taking their children to live with her in an apartment at St James 's Palace and a house in Kew . He died in late 1766 . Despite these stresses on her personal life , Finch continued to fulfil her position with zeal . However , when another of her daughters became ill in early 1767 , Finch took leave of her job and brought the young girl to various locales in the unsuccessful hope she would survive . Finch left the sub @-@ governess Mrs Cotesworth in charge and returned grieving in November 1767 , in time to care for the fifth addition to the nursery , Prince Edward . 
 = = = Educational approach and lessons = = = 
 Lady Charlotte has been variously described by biographers as warm , competent , and kindly . As was typical for the period , the children were infrequently seen by the king and queen ; Finch was the unvarying adult figure in their lives . While the royal princes endured disciplined lessons in an austere educational environment , Finch was loved by her female charges . They affectionately referred to her as " Lady Cha " , and upon returning from a trip to the continent in 1771 , Queen Charlotte wrote her , " They can never be in better hands than yours " . <unk> says that Finch " supervised a progressive nursery focused on child @-@ centred learning " and shared a passion for education with Queen Charlotte , as is evident in their correspondence and the writings of contemporaries ; the idea of noble mothers encouraging education for their children – a concept advocated by educators and scholars – was becoming popular , and Finch 's approach at court helped spread these new educational theories . Among the methods she employed was the use of " dissected maps " , some of the earliest jigsaw puzzles , to teach geography . 
 The historian Flora Fraser writes that " in many ways , the education ... ordered for the princesses would be as rigorous as " that which the king ordered for the princes . Queen Charlotte felt that a woman equipped with an education was as able as a man . An accomplished woman herself , Finch , alongside Mrs Cotesworth , organised lessons in the arts and sciences which were taught to both the princes and princesses . Subjects included geography , English , grammar , music , needlework , dancing , and art . A tutor , Julie <unk> , taught the children in the French language . Once old enough , the princesses would travel each day to receive their education at Finch 's new house at Kew alongside the river . Conversely , the princes gradually saw less of Lady Charlotte as they became older and entered into the care of governors . 
 In 1774 , Mrs Cotesworth retired due to ill health . While seeking a successor , Lady Charlotte requested that she devote less time to the children . This was opposed by Queen Charlotte . The monarch felt that Cotesworth 's resignation was partly due to Finch decreasing hours with the children , and also thought the other staff would be encouraged by Finch increasing her presence and " make them look upon it as a less confinement " . Finch replied that she had regularly spent many hours with the princesses , both mornings and evenings , adding : 
 How can I without deviating from my own principles undertake an additional duty of a kind for which I am conscious I am growing every day more unfit , as your Majesty must know what an uncommon stock of spirits and cheerfulness is necessary to go through the growing attendance of so many and such very young people in their amusements , as well as behaviour and instruction , besides ordering all the affairs of the nursery . 
 Lady Charlotte threatened to resign so that the queen could hire someone " younger and more fitted for it " , a declaration which ended Queen Charlotte 's quest to increase her hours . Finch remained at her post . A new sub @-@ governess , Martha <unk> – hired on Finch 's recommendation – now spent frequent time with the princesses , chaperoning and supervising their studies in preparation for their lessons with their teacher Miss <unk> . In 1782 , the 14th royal child , Prince Alfred , sickened and died at Windsor near the age of two , despite Lady Charlotte 's devoted nursing . 
 = = = Retirement and death = = = 
 By 1792 , Lady Charlotte Finch had become ill and deaf . Princess Sophia remarked that autumn , " I am grieved to death about her , she is if possible more kind to us than ever . Indeed , both [ Mrs <unk> ] and her are so good to us that we should not be deserving of having such treasures about us , if we did not feel their kindness in the highest degree " . Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793 , though she continued to correspond with members of the royal family and receive gifts from them , particularly the Prince of Wales , the future George IV . She received £ 600 in yearly payment , supplemented by income from the South Sea Company , until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James 's Palace . 
 She was buried in the family vault at Ravenstone , Buckinghamshire and five royal dukes attended her funeral . Her youngest daughter was allowed to maintain their apartments at St James 's . Her will was mainly portioned out between her three surviving children . Her memorial by Francis Leggatt Chantrey ( 1820 ) , is in Holy Cross Church , Burley , adjacent to Burley House , the Rutland mansion of her son , George Finch , 9th Earl of Winchilsea .

 WIN Television is an Australian television network owned by the WIN Corporation that is based in Wollongong , New South Wales . WIN commenced transmissions on 18 March 1962 as a single Wollongong @-@ only station , and has since expanded to 24 owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations with transmissions covering a larger geographical area of Australia than any other television network except for Australia Plus which broadcasts to 44 countries . 
 The network 's name , WIN is a reference to its original Wollongong station WIN @-@ 4 , itself an acronym of Wollongong Illawarra New South Wales . Through its news division , WIN News , WIN Television broadcasts a half @-@ hour news service to twenty regional markets .

 Television Wollongong Transmission Limited ( <unk> ) , was incorporated on 4 October 1955 by a group of local businessmen . Five years later , it was awarded a licence by the Postmaster @-@ General 's Department broadcast to the Illawarra and South Coast regions , over a number of other groups aligned to Sydney @-@ based stations ATN @-@ 7 and TCN @-@ 9 . The new station was to broadcast on the VHF @-@ 4 frequency , using the callsign WIN ( which stood for Wollongong ( and the ) Illawarra Network or alternatively Wollongong Illawarra New ( South Wales ) , in line with other Australian callsigns ) . Soon after , a plot of land was purchased at Fort Drummond , approximately two kilometres south of the Wollongong central business district , for the station 's television studios . 
 Prior to the opening night 's transmissions , WIN @-@ 4 undertook a television conversion program , aimed at encouraging residents to acquire new tuning equipment and converting television sets in the area to receive the station 's allocated frequency . A transmitter was to be erected on Knight 's Hill , however test transmissions were delayed due to rain . 
 = = = 1960s to the 1970s = = = 
 WIN @-@ 4 commenced transmissions at 5 : 15 pm. on 18 March 1962 . The first night was met with a number of technical issues , most notably the complete loss of audio . TCN @-@ 9 and ATN @-@ 7 refused to sell programming to the station , leading to an unstable financial situation which , at its peak left the station with only 42 hours ' programming . 
 In April 1963 , Media Securities , owned by Rupert Murdoch , acquired a controlling interest in the station ( his second television station after NWS @-@ 9 Adelaide ) and soon appointed a new general manager , Bill Lean . Both TCN @-@ 9 and ATN @-@ 7 began purchasing several hours of first @-@ run American television programming from WIN @-@ 4 , following contractual arrangements signed by Murdoch . Throughout this period WIN @-@ 4 expanded its repeater transmissions to include Moruya , Batemans Bay , Narooma , Bega and Eden . Local programming and the station 's near @-@ monopoly in the area meant that by 1973 , viewership had increased to occupy 63 percent of the audience . 
 Murdoch sold the station in 1979 to the head of Paramount Pictures ' international distribution arm , Bruce Gordon , to purchase controlling interests in capital city stations TEN @-@ 10 Sydney and ATV @-@ 0 ( now ATV @-@ 10 ) Melbourne .

 During this period , WIN expanded to include new stations in Victoria , Queensland , and New South Wales . In 1984 , WIN became the first regional television station to transmit in stereophonic sound . Close links between WIN Television and the Nine Network , ensured it the Nine Network affiliation for southern New South Wales when aggregation took place in 1989 thus the logo of the station changed to that of its partner network with the matching nine dots and similar ident packages . The changes meant that WIN expanded into the rest of southern New South Wales , launching new stations in Canberra , Orange , Bathurst , Dubbo and Wagga Wagga , amongst others in 1989 , and at the same time acquiring new facilities in Orange , Wagga and Canberra . It also provided the network with two additional competitors , The Prime Network and Capital Television . 
 In 1990 WIN purchased Queensland station Star TV , with stations in Rockhampton ( <unk> ) and the Darling Downs ( <unk> and <unk> ) , shortly before regional Queensland was to be aggregated . The new station was set to become a Network Ten affiliate , however WIN 's links with the Nine Network caused the Nine affiliation to move from <unk> , which itself became affiliated to Ten , all within days before statewide broadcasts commenced . 
 ENT Limited , a Launceston @-@ based company that owned a number of television and radio stations in regional Victoria and Tasmania , was bought in 1994 . Vic Television and <unk> were , as a result , incorporated into the WIN network and subsequently renamed WIN Television , complete with the nine dots logo of the Nine Network . The network further expanded to Griffith in 1998 , when WIN purchased MTN @-@ 9 Griffith and its supplementary station AMN @-@ 31 from its local owners . Although station had previously been part of the Prime Television network , MTN already had links with WIN and took its feed from the network 's Wollongong base . 
 WIN became regional Western Australia 's second commercial television network on 26 March 1999 after winning rights in 1997 . Prior to the launch of the new station , GWN held a commercial monopoly on the market . GWN became an affiliate of the Seven Network , while WIN took a combination of Nine Network and Network Ten programming . Despite the Nine Network 's traditional ratings dominance throughout most of the country , GWN has remained the market 's most @-@ watched station . The second ratings survey of 2006 placed WIN Television with a 34 @.@ 7 % commercial audience share in prime time , compared to the Golden West Network with 65 @.@ 3 % , thus being no.2 among regional viewers . 
 In the same year , WIN purchased two stations in South Australia , <unk> in Mount Gambier and RTS @-@ 5a in the Riverland region . They became known as WIN South Australia and until recently featured news bulletins presented from studios at both stations ( bulletins are now presented from the set of studios in Mount Gambier ) . In 2002 supplementary licences were granted under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act , allowing the network to launch additional channels , using the callsigns MGS in Mount Gambier and LRS in the Riverland , and known as WIN Ten , thus converting it into the sole Nine affiliate for regional viewers in SA . This was the case until the affiliation moved to the Seven Network due to advertising problems with Nine 's then owners in 2007 .

 WIN Television began to introduce digital television soon after it became available to metropolitan areas in January 2001 . Under Section 38A of the Broadcasting Services Act , the network has been able to introduce , in partnership with other stations , additional digital @-@ only Network Ten affiliates . These have included Tasmanian Digital Television , launched in late 2003 in partnership with Southern Cross Broadcasting , and Mildura Digital Television in January 2006 , with Prime Television Limited . 
 On 30 May 2007 , Southern Cross Broadcasting announced its sale of NWS to the WIN Corporation for A $ 105 million . Similarly , <unk> Perth , owned by Sunraysia Television and affiliated to the Nine Network , was purchased on 8 June 2007 , when the station was sold to WIN Television 's parent company , WIN Corporation , for A $ 163 @.@ 1 million . 
 Despite the station 's ownership of Nine Perth , WIN in Western Australia broadcast Ten News Perth , produced for and shown on rival station Ten Perth up until 27 August 2007 . Preceding this in June 2007 , the network announced their intention to show National Nine News on WIN WA , due to the rise of yet another joint venture station , Ten West . This was its 3rd digital only Ten affiliate with both WIN and GWN taking charge . 
 A conflict between WIN and its long @-@ time metropolitan counterpart the Nine Network arose in mid @-@ 2007 . PBL Media , Nine 's parent company , requested up to 40 % of the network 's advertising revenue in return for program supply . WIN 's owner , WIN Corporation rejected this offer , expecting to pay only 29 % ( a 3 % decrease from the previous contract and in line with many of the network 's competitors , such as Prime Television and Southern Cross Ten ) . The network 's owner , Bruce Gordon , subsequently threatened to sever the network 's affiliation after negotiations stagnated , stating that his previous position at the Paramount Pictures Corporation meant he could program the network independently . On 16 August 2007 WIN Television dropped key Nine Network programs from its daytime television schedule , including Mornings with Kerri @-@ Anne and National Nine News : Morning Edition . The end result was that WIN SA began to change affiliation from Nine to the Seven Network and the change was announced on 4 September 2007 , for the network 's eastern South Australian stations in Mount Gambier and the Riverland . The new program schedule is a mixture of Seven and WIN programming and commenced broadcasting on 1 October 2007 . Two years later , WIN officially relaunched its Nine Network service with the new channel , now known as WIN SA , carrying NWS from Adelaide and all Nine News programs but with local advertisements inserted to serve regional viewers . 
 On 9 August 2009 WIN began transmission of the new digital channel GO ! on channel 88 in Southern NSW , Regional Victoria , Tasmania and Regional Queensland . It soon reached <unk> in 2010 and regional SA in 2011 . 
 = = = 2010s = = = 
 In June 2010 , playout was moved from WIN 's Wollongong headquarters to a new facility shared with ABC Television at Ingleburn in Sydney 's south @-@ west . 
 On 26 September 2010 WIN began transmission of the HD digital channel GEM on channel 80 in Southern NSW , Regional Victoria , Tasmania and Regional Queensland . 
 In Mid @-@ 2011 , The WIN Network stopped using the <unk> logo , and replaced it with the generic Closed Captioning Logo . 
 On 1 May 2012 WIN began transmission of an SD digital infomercial channel , Gold on channel 84 . The second infomercial channel , <unk> began on 13 July 2013 as a five @-@ hour timeshift of Gold . 
 On 21 January 2016 WIN replaced <unk> on channel 82 with Nine 's metropolitan infomercial channel , Extra . 
 After Nine revived 9HD and launched new lifestyle channel 9Life on 26 November 2015 , WIN CEO Andrew Lancaster issued a memo to staff citing that WIN would not be reviving WIN HD or launching 9Life at the same time as Nine , but promised that WIN would do this in future . WIN continued to broadcast the HD feed of 9Gem on channel 80 . On 10 February 2016 , WIN began broadcasting a " coming soon " test pattern on channels 85 and 86 indicating that they will revive WIN HD and carry 9Life from the Nine Network from 1 March 2016 . As a result , their channel listing was reshuffled to match to Nine 's metropolitan with 9Gem on channel 82 , 9Go ! on channel 83 , 9Life on channel 84 , Extra on channel 85 and Gold on channel 86 . 
 After Nine launched its new online catch @-@ up video on demand and live streaming service <unk> on 27 January 2016 , WIN filed a lawsuit against Nine , claiming that live streaming into regional areas breaches their affiliation agreement . Justice <unk> of the NSW Supreme Court dismissed the case on 28 April 2016 , citing that " live streaming is not broadcasting within the meaning of the PSA ( program supply agreement ) , and that Nine is under no express or implied obligation not to do it . " 
 Following WIN 's defeat in the <unk> lawsuit , Nine announced it had signed a new $ 500 million affiliation deal with Network Ten affiliate Southern Cross Austereo , switching its primary Nine affiliation to stations currently affiliated with Ten in Southern NSW , ACT , and regional areas in Victoria and Queensland on 1 July 2016 . With that announcement , WIN was effectively stripped of its 27 @-@ year partnership with Nine . In response , WIN entered affiliation talks with Network Ten , reaching a final agreement on 23 May 2016 . Under the new agreement , beginning 1 July 2016 , WIN would carry Ten programming into regional Queensland , Southern NSW , Victoria , Tasmania , South Australia , Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory . Deals to supply Nine programming to South Australia , and Griffith were secured on 29 June 2016 , a day later Tasmania were secured as well . A supply deal for Western Australia joint venture West Digital Television was not secured before the 1 July 2016 deadline , but a deal was later finalised on 2 July 2016 with programming resuming that night .

 = Homesick ( MercyMe song ) = 
 " Homesick " is a song by Christian rock band MercyMe . Written by Bart Millard , the song is an expression of grief and longing that was written after the band experienced the deaths of nine people they were connected to in a short period of time . " Homesick " was included on MercyMe 's third studio album Undone and was released as the second single from that album . 
 " Homesick " received positive critical reception , with some critics considering the song one of the best off of Undone . " Homesick " was successful on both Christian and mainstream radio , peaking at the top on the Radio & Records Christian AC Indicator and Soft AC / INSPO charts , number 3 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs and Hot Christian AC charts and the Radio & Records Christian AC chart , as well as peaking at number 9 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart .

 " Homesick " was written during a time of hardship for the band — nine people close to MercyMe 's band members had died in a short span of time . Lead singer Bart Millard initially wrote the chorus to " Homesick " following a funeral service for two infants that died in pregnancy , but did not finish the song , as didn ’ t want to fake his way through writing the song . However , following the death of Millard 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , Chris , in a car accident , Millard finished the song so as to play it at Chris 's funeral . Millard and the rest of MercyMe intended the song only to be played once — at Chris 's funeral — but Millard 's mother @-@ in @-@ law encouraged them to record it . Although the record they were going to release , Undone , was essentially complete , the band returned to the studio to record " Homesick " for inclusion on the project . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Homesick " is a ballad with a length of three minutes and forty @-@ one seconds . Lyrically , the song is an expression of grief , pondering Heaven and the time it takes to get there , as well as anger , confusion , and brokenness . The song is set in the key of F major and has a moderate tempo of 72 beats per minute . Millard 's vocal range in the song spans from C4 – A5 . 
 Some comparisons have been made between the lyrical content of " Homesick " and MercyMe 's 2001 single " I Can Only Imagine . " David Jenison of CCM Magazine referred to the song as the ' sequel ' to " I Can Only Imagine . " Regarding these comparisons , Millard said " ’ I Can Only Imagine ’ took the focus off of what you are going through and was comforting because it put the focus on where they were going ... ’ Homesick ’ is the opposite because it completely addresses us that are left here . I don ’ t think as a Christian that it ’ s right for me to say , ‘ I wish you could ’ ve stayed here , ’ because truthfully , we ’ re getting the raw end of the deal if we really believe what we say that heaven is as great as we want it to be . The whole idea is that we ’ re the ones who have to wait . ” Millard has also noted , " The difference with ‘ Homesick ’ [ as compared to " I Can Only Imagine " ] is that it talks about those who are stuck around here after someone passes away . When you lose somebody , you learn what being homesick is really about . "

 = John Philip Sousa = 
 John Philip Sousa ( / <unk> / ; Portuguese pronunciation : [ <unk> ( w ) <unk> ] ; November 6 , 1854 – March 6 , 1932 ) was an American composer and conductor of the late Romantic era , known primarily for American military and patriotic marches . Because of his mastery of march composition , he is known as " The March King " , or the " American March King " due to his British counterpart Kenneth J. Alford also being known by the former nickname . Among his best @-@ known marches are " The Stars and Stripes Forever " ( National March of the United States of America ) , " Semper Fidelis " ( Official March of the United States Marine Corps ) , " The Liberty Bell " , " The Thunderer " and " The Washington Post " . 
 Sousa 's father was of Portuguese and Spanish descent , his mother of Hessian ancestry . Sousa began his career playing violin and studying music theory and composition under John <unk> and George Felix <unk> . His father enlisted him in the United States Marine Band as an apprentice in 1868 . After departing the band in 1875 , Sousa learned to conduct . From 1880 until his death , he focused exclusively on conducting and the writing of music . He eventually rejoined the Marine Band and served there for 12 years as director . On leaving the Marine Band , Sousa organized his own band . He toured Europe and Australia and developed the sousaphone , a large brass instrument similar to the tuba . On the outbreak of World War I , Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant and led the Naval Reserve Band in Illinois . Following his tenure , he returned to conduct the Sousa Band until his death in 1932 . In the 1920s he was promoted to lieutenant commander in the naval reserve , but never saw active service again . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 John Philip Sousa was born in Washington , D.C. , the third of ten children of João António de Sousa ( John Anthony Sousa ) ( Seville , 22 September 1824 - 27 April 1892 ) , who was of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry ( son of João António de Sousa and wife Josefina Blanco , from Seville ) , and wife Maria Elisabeth <unk> ( Darmstadt , 20 May 1826 - 25 August 1908 ) , who was of Hessian ancestry ( daughter of Peter <unk> and wife Catherine <unk> ) . Sousa started his music education by playing the violin as a pupil of John <unk> and George Felix <unk> for harmony and musical composition at the age of six . He was found to have absolute pitch . During his childhood , Sousa studied voice , violin , piano , flute , cornet , baritone horn , trombone , and alto horn . When Sousa was 13 , his father , a trombonist in the Marine Band , enlisted him in the United States Marine Corps as an apprentice to keep him from joining a circus band . 
 = = Career = = 
 Several years long after serving his apprenticeship , Sousa joined a theatrical ( pit ) orchestra where he learned to conduct . He returned to the U.S. Marine Band as its head in 1880 and remained as its conductor until 1892 . Sousa led " The President 's Own " band under five presidents from Rutherford B. Hayes to Benjamin Harrison . Sousa 's band played at two Inaugural Balls , those of James A. Garfield in 1881 , and Benjamin Harrison in 1889 . The marching brass bass , or sousaphone , a modified <unk> , was created by J. W. Pepper – a Philadelphia instrument maker who created the instrument in 1893 at Sousa 's request using several of his suggestions in its design . He wanted a tuba that could sound upward and over the band whether its player was seated or marching . The sousaphone was re @-@ created in 1898 by C.G. Conn and this was the model that Sousa preferred to use . 
 He organized The Sousa Band the year he left the Marine Band . The Sousa Band toured from 1892 to 1931 , performing at 15 @,@ 623 concerts both in America and around the world , including at the World Exposition in Paris , France and at the Royal Albert Hall in London . In Paris , the Sousa Band marched through the streets to the Arc de Triomphe – one of only eight parades the band marched in over its forty years . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 On December 30 , 1879 , Sousa married Jane van <unk> Bellis ( 1862 – 1944 ) . They had three children : John Philip , Jr . ( April 1 , 1881 – May 18 , 1937 ) , Jane Priscilla ( August 7 , 1882 – October 28 , 1958 ) , and Helen ( January 21 , 1887 – October 14 , 1975 ) . All were buried in the John Philip Sousa plot in the Congressional Cemetery . Wife Jane , daughters Jane Priscilla and Helen Abert joined the Daughters of the American Revolution ( DAR ) in 1907 . Their ancestor was Adam Bellis , who served under several different commands for the New Jersey troops in the American Revolutionary War . 
 Late in his life , Sousa lived in Sands Point , New York . Sousa died of heart failure at the age of 77 on March 6 , 1932 , in his room at the Abraham Lincoln Hotel in Reading , Pennsylvania . He had conducted a rehearsal of " The Stars and Stripes Forever " the previous day with the Ringgold Band . He is buried in Washington , D.C. ' s Congressional Cemetery . A school ( John Philip Sousa Elementary ) and a band shell were named after him and there was a memorial tree planted in nearby Port Washington , New York . Wild Bank , his seaside house on Hicks Lane , has been designated a National Historic Landmark , although it remains a private home and is not open to the public . He was posthumously enshrined in the Hall of Fame for Great Americans in 1976 , one of just 102 Americans ever to be honored in such a manner . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Sousa served two periods of service in the United States Marine Corps . He first enlisted on June 9 , 1868 at the age of 13 as an apprentice musician . In official records , his initial rank was listed as " boy " . He re @-@ enlisted on July 8 , 1872 and was promoted to musician . He left the Marine Corps in 1875 at the age of 20 . 
 His second period of Marine service was from 1880 to 1892 . During this period he was the leader of the Marine Band in Washington , D.C. ( Some sources state that Sousa served with the rank of Sergeant Major and was eventually promoted to Warrant Officer but this is erroneous as the leader of the band was a separate rank from sergeant major and the Marine Corps did not have warrant officers until 1916 . ) Sousa 's salary as " leader of the band " ( his official Marine Corps rank ) was $ 83 per month which compared to a second lieutenant at $ 115 @.@ 67 per month and a sergeant major with 20 years of service at $ 30 per month . 
 Under his leadership , the Marine Band became the premier military band in the United States . The Columbia Phonograph Company produced 60 cylinders of recordings of the Marine Band conducted by Sousa . The recordings , along with two tours in 1891 and 1892 , led to Sousa becoming nationally famous . During his time with the Marine Band , Sousa composed several of his famous marches including The Washington Post , The Thunderer and Semper Fidelis which remain staples of marching bands to this day . 
 In July 1892 , Sousa requested , and received , a discharge from the Marine Corps to pursue a financially promising civilian career as a band leader . He conducted a farewell concert at the White House on July 30 , 1892 and was discharged from the Marine Corps the next day . 
 On May 31 , 1917 , shortly after the United States declared war on Germany and entered World War I , Sousa was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve . At that time , Sousa was 62 years old which was then the mandatory retirement age for Navy officers . During the war , Sousa led the Navy Band at the Great Lakes Naval Station near Chicago , Illinois . Being independently wealthy at this point in his life , he donated most of his naval salary , except a token $ 1 per month , to the Sailors ' and Marines ' Relief Fund . 
 Sousa was discharged from active duty after the war 's end in November 1918 . He returned to conducting his own band but continued to wear his naval uniform for many of his concerts and other public appearances . In the early 1920s , he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve but did not return to active duty . 
 For this service during the war , Sousa received the World War I Victory Medal . By right of his wartime service , he was elected as a Veteran Companion of the Military Order of Foreign Wars .

 Sousa was decorated with the palms of the Order of Public Instruction of Portugal . He also received the Royal Victorian Medal from King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in December 1901 for conducting a private birthday concert for Queen Alexandra . 
 During World War II , the Liberty ship SS John Philip Sousa was named after him . The ship 's bell is still used by the Marine Band in concert . 
 Sousa has a star in his honor at 1500 Vine Street on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . 
 In 1976 , Sousa was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans . In 1998 , he was inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in Cincinnati , Ohio .

 Marches and waltzes have been derived from many of these stage @-@ works . Sousa also composed the music for six operettas that were either unfinished or not produced : The Devils ' Deputy , Florine , The Irish Dragoon , Katherine , The Victory , and The Wolf . 
 In addition , Sousa wrote a march based on themes from Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic opera The Mikado , the elegant overture Our <unk> , a number of musical suites , etc . He frequently added Sullivan opera overtures or other Sullivan pieces to his concerts . He was quoted saying , " My religion lies in my composition " .

 Sousa had several additional interests outside of music . He wrote three novels – The Fifth String , <unk> Sandy , and The Transit of Venus – as well as a full @-@ length autobiography , Marching Along and numerous articles and letters @-@ to @-@ the @-@ editor on a variety of subjects . He participated in trapshooting , taking an active role on the national stage in competitions . 
 = = = Trapshooting = = = 
 As a <unk> , he ranks as one of the all @-@ time greats , and is enshrined in the Trapshooting Hall of Fame . He organized the first national trapshooting organization , a forerunner to today 's Amateur Trapshooting Association ( ATA ) . Sousa remained active in the fledgling ATA for some time after its formation . Some credit Sousa as the father of organized trapshooting in United States . He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting . Sousa was a regular competitor representing the United States Navy in trapshooting competitions , particularly against the United States Army . Available records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35 @,@ 000 targets during his shooting career . A quote from his Trapshooting Hall of Fame biography says it best : " Let me say that just about the sweetest music to me is when I call , ' pull , ' the old gun barks , and the referee in perfect key announces , ' dead ' . "

 In his 1902 novel The Fifth String , a young violinist made a deal with the Devil for a magic violin with five strings . The strings can excite the emotions of Pity , Hope , Love and Joy – the fifth string was of Death and can be played only once before causing the player 's own death . He was unable to win the love of the woman he desired . At a final concert , he played upon the death string . In 1905 , Sousa published a book <unk> Sandy , which included a satirical poem titled " The Feast of the Monkeys " . The poem described " a lavish party attended by variety of animals , however , overshadowed by the King of Beasts , the lion ... who allows the muttering guests the privilege of watching him eat the entire feast " . At the end of his gluttony , the lion explained , " Come all rejoice , You 've seen your monarch dine . " 
 In 1920 , he wrote a 40 @,@ 000 @-@ word story , " The Transit of Venus " . It was about a group of <unk> called the Alimony Club who , as a way of temporarily escaping the society of women , embark on a sea voyage to observe the transit of Venus . The captain 's niece , however , had stowed away on board and soon won over the men . Sousa also wrote a booklet , " A manual for trumpet and drum " , published by the Ludwig drum company , with advice for playing drums and trumpet . An early version of the trumpet solo to " Semper Fidelis " was included in this volume .

 Sousa held a very low opinion of the emerging and upstart recording industry . Using an epithet coined by Mark Twain , he derided recordings as " canned music " , a reference to the early wax cylinder records that came in can @-@ like cylindrical cardboard boxes . In a submission to a congressional hearing in 1906 , he argued : 
 These talking machines are going to ruin the artistic development of music in this country . When I was a boy ... in front of every house in the summer evenings , you would find young people together singing the songs of the day or old songs . Today you hear these infernal machines going night and day . We will not have a vocal cord left . The vocal cord will be eliminated by a process of evolution , as was the tail of man when he came from the ape . 
 Law professor Lawrence Lessig cited this passage to argue that in creating a system of copyrights in which control of music is in the hands of record labels , Sousa was essentially correct . 
 Sousa 's antipathy to recording was such that he almost never conducted his band when it was being recorded . Nevertheless , Sousa 's band made numerous recordings , the earliest being issued on cylinders by several companies , followed by many recordings on discs by the Berliner Gramophone Company and its successor , the Victor Talking Machine Company ( later RCA Victor ) . The Berliner recordings were conducted by Henry Higgins ( one of Sousa 's cornet soloists ) and Arthur Pryor ( Sousa 's trombone soloist and assistant conductor ) , with Sousa quoted as saying , " I have never been in the gramophone company 's office in my life . " A handful of the Victor recordings were actually conducted by Sousa , but most were conducted by Pryor , Herbert L. Clarke , Edwin H. Clarke , or by four of Victor 's most prolific house musicians : Walter B. Rogers ( who had also been a cornet soloist with Sousa ) , Rosario Bourdon , Josef <unk> , and Nathaniel Shilkret . Details of the Victor recordings are available in the external link below to the <unk> .

 Sousa also appeared with his band in newsreels and on radio broadcasts ( beginning with a 1929 nationwide broadcast on NBC ) . In 1999 , Legacy Records released some of Sousa 's historic recordings on CD . In 1922 , he accepted the invitation of the national chapter to become an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi , the national honorary band fraternity . In 1925 , he was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia , the national fraternity for men in music , by the fraternity 's Alpha Xi chapter at the University of Illinois . In 1952 , 20th Century Fox honored Sousa in their Technicolor feature film Stars and Stripes Forever with Clifton Webb portraying the composer . Fox music director Alfred Newman arranged the music and conducted the studio orchestra for the soundtrack . It was loosely based on Sousa 's memoirs , Marching Along .

 = New York State Route 390 = 
 New York State Route 390 ( NY 390 ) is a north – south state highway located along the western edge of the city of Rochester , New York , in the United States . The route , a limited @-@ access northward continuation of Interstate 390 ( I @-@ 390 ) , extends for 8 @.@ 00 miles ( 12 @.@ 87 km ) from I @-@ 490 in Gates to the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece , less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the Lake Ontario shoreline . Between I @-@ 490 and NY 104 , NY 390 makes up the north – south segment of the northwest quadrant of the Rochester Outer Loop , a series of expressways encircling Rochester . At NY 104 , the Outer Loop departs NY 390 and follows NY 104 east into the city . 
 The freeway was constructed in stages from the 1960s to the 1980s , with the first segment — between I @-@ 490 and NY 31 — opening to traffic c . 1963 . At the time , it was part of NY 47 , which followed the completed portions of the Outer Loop from Gates to Irondequoit . An extension of the freeway north to U.S. Route 104 ( US 104 ; now NY 104 ) was opened to traffic in the early 1970s . NY 47 was eliminated in 1980 , giving way to NY 390 from I @-@ 490 to NY 104 . NY 390 was extended to its current length in the early 1980s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 390 begins at the point where I @-@ 390 northbound crosses over I @-@ 490 eastbound in the center of a complex interchange between the two in Gates . Due to the setup of the junction , the northbound and southbound roadways , both two lanes wide , are initially set about 250 yards ( 229 m ) apart . The highway heads through the remainder of the exit , passing over the left exit ramp from I @-@ 490 west to I @-@ 390 south heading northbound and under the ramp linking I @-@ 490 east to NY 390 north southbound and crossing over I @-@ 490 westbound . North of the junction , the median narrows to a more standard width as NY 390 widens to six lanes and connects to NY 31 ( Lyell Avenue ) . The expressway proceeds north through neighborhoods equally residential and industrial , crossing over both the former right @-@ of @-@ way of the CSX Transportation @-@ owned Falls Road Secondary Track and the Erie Canal prior to meeting Lexington Avenue via a modified trumpet interchange . 
 From Lexington Avenue , where NY 390 passes into the town of Greece , north to NY 104 , NY 390 runs parallel to the western edge of Eastman Business Park , the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak . Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits , NY 390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange . Just north of Ridgeway Avenue , the expressway crosses a small , narrow strip of land that lies within the Rochester city limits , a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before . North of the strip , NY 390 curves to the northeast , passing along the west side of the industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY 104 . Heading northbound , the is split into two halves , with exit 24A connecting to NY 104 east and exit <unk> linking to NY 104 west . 
 Past NY 104 , the roadway surface shifts from pavement to concrete as the freeway heads generally northward through primarily residential neighborhoods . The next exit , with Vintage Lane 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) to the north @-@ northeast of NY 104 , is the highway 's last as a six @-@ lane freeway . Here , it narrows to four lanes — two in both directions — before continuing onward to meet NY 18 ( Latta Road ) at a conventional diamond interchange . At this point , all commercial vehicles are forced to exit NY 390 due to a similar restriction on the Lake Ontario State Parkway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to the north . Outside of a small pocket of development near Greece Arcadia High and Middle Schools , the remainder of the freeway crosses open , sparsely developed areas of Greece . NY 390 curves to the northeast for its final 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) before ending at a trumpet interchange with the parkway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the shore of Lake Ontario . 
 = = History = = 
 The 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) segment of the Rochester Outer Loop between NY 33A and NY 31 was completed c . 1963 . It was originally designated as part of NY 47 , which had followed the parallel Howard Road to the west prior to the freeway 's construction . Work on an extension north to US 104 ( now NY 104 ) began in the mid @-@ 1960s and was completed in the early 1970s . The freeway officially became part of NY 47 on January 1 , 1970 , when the route was extended northward over the then @-@ proposed Outer Loop to a new terminus at the Lake Ontario State Parkway . In actuality , however , NY 47 never extended any farther north than NY 104 , which served as the freeway 's northern terminus throughout the 1970s . 
 In the late 1970s , the state of New York submitted a proposal to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials that would substantially alter how the Outer Loop was numbered . As part of the plan , the NY 47 designation would be eliminated while the northwestern section of the Outer Loop — from I @-@ 490 in Gates to the proposed northern terminus at the Lake Ontario Parkway in Greece — would become the northernmost part of I @-@ 390 . Most of the proposed changes took effect on March 18 , 1980 , when NY 47 was eliminated ; however , I @-@ 390 was modified to end at its junction with I @-@ 490 . In its place , the Gates – Greece leg of the Outer Loop was assigned NY 390 . The NY 390 designation was extended northward to its current terminus in the early 1980s when the segment of the Outer Loop between NY 104 and the Lake Ontario State Parkway was completed . 
 The pair of interchanges connecting NY 390 to I @-@ 490 and NY 31 have two major movements that cause weaving . The first is on NY 390 northbound , where traffic entering NY 390 from I @-@ 490 west must immediately merge into traffic to avoid taking the NY 31 exit while motorists already on NY 390 must cross traffic coming from I @-@ 490 to reach the ramp for NY 31 . The other is on NY 390 southbound , where commuters entering NY 390 south from NY 31 must cross several lanes of traffic to access I @-@ 490 east . Additionally , the junction between NY 390 / I @-@ 390 and I @-@ 490 serves over 200 @,@ 000 cars daily and is often heavily congested during the morning and evening rush hours . In July 2010 , the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting ideas on how to improve the junction . Roughly $ 32 million has been earmarked for a future project to improve the interchange , which is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid @-@ 2014 .

 = Rose Colored Glasses ( Kelly Rowland song ) = 
 " Rose Colored Glasses " is a song by American recording artist Kelly Rowland , recorded for her third studio album , Here I Am ( 2011 ) . It was written by Ester Dean and Lukasz " Dr. Luke " Gottwald , with lyrics reflecting the different perspectives on relationships and how one can perceive a relationship different from the outside . It opens with an electro @-@ crescendo followed with vocals by Rowland while Emily Wright produced Rowland 's vocals ; the production is based upon layered synths and drums , programmed by Dr. Luke . Dean helped Rowland to record the song , which Rowland said made her cry as it reminded her of her own experiences in past relationships . " Rose Colored Glasses " also had an effect on Rowland 's vocals , causing them to swell . The song was serviced to rhythmic and contemporary hit radio on June 29 , 2010 . Critics praised " Rose Colored Glasses " as one of Rowland 's strongest vocal and emotional performances to date . 
 The arrangement and delivery were praised as being classy , while the critics felt that the overall emotion of the song gave Rowland the best chance of achieving US chart success . " Rose Colored Glasses " was released on June 28 , 2010 across some parts of Europe , and a day later in the United States and Canada , where it was intended to be one of the album 's two lead singles . An accompanying 3 @-@ D concept music video , directed by John " Rankin " Wadell was released , featuring atmospheric visuals and mood @-@ lit scenes including streamers , doves , and rose petals . Reception for the video was positive , praising its simplicity and noting the stunning visuals and variety of outfits worn by Rowland . The single had limited chart success , entering the top @-@ forty radio airplay charts in Slovakia and the United States , but failed to appear on the US Billboard Hot 100 . It is excluded from the US track listing for Here I Am .

 At the 2010 Winter Music Conference , Rowland confirmed she was ready to release the lead single from her third studio album . On March 29 , 2010 , during the conference , she debuted the David Guetta @-@ helmed song , " Commander " with her live performance of the song . However , just prior to its release , Rowland ’ s label ( Universal Motown ) confirmed that the song would only be fully released as a single in international markets . At the end of May 2010 , Rowland announced that " Shake Them Haters Off " , penned by singer @-@ songwriter Ne @-@ Yo , would be the American lead single for her third album . Prior to its release , " Shake Them Haters Off " was replaced by two new songs , one for urban radio and one for contemporary hit radio . " Rose Colored Glasses " was unveiled as the pop lead single , and serviced to both contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29 , 2010 . It was also released for digital download on June 29 , 2010 in Canada and the United States . The urban single , " Grown Woman " , was also serviced to urban , urban adult contemporary and rhythmic radio on June 29 , 2010 . At the time of this announcement , it meant that three singles would precede the album before its worldwide release . However , the album was pushed back into 2011 , leaving time for two other singles to precede the album : " Forever and a Day " ( 2010 ) and " Motivation " ( 2011 ) .

 “ Rose Colored Glasses ” is a mid @-@ tempo electropop ballad written by Ester Dean and Lukasz Gottwald ( Dr. Luke ) . The song , which opens with an electro @-@ crescendo followed by Rowland 's vocals , has a layered synth production , courtesy of Dr. Luke . In the lyrics , Rowland " explores the subtle ways that perspective can truly change everything ... [ telling ] a story of a relationship that , on the outside , seems troubled . " Lizzie Goodwin , from entertainment website Gather.com , called the song an " addition to your break @-@ up / female empowerment playlist . " Dean accompanied Rowland in the recording studios when she recorded the song . 
 During an interview for Rowland ’ s segment in the iheartradio concert series , it was revealed that " Rose Colored Glasses " had made Rowland cry . She said “ the first time I heard the song it made me think of all of the relationships where I had to wear rose colored glasses , ” in particular noting her past “ toxic relationships ” and “ situations where I needed to leave ” as the causes of her Rowland ’ s tears . Later it was revealed that the song had made Rowland ’ s vocals swell . During an interview for The Belfast Telegraph , Rowland spoke of the songs she had recorded for her third studio album . When speaking of " Rose Colored Glasses " , she said that it had taken its toll on her , “ It brought back a few memories , and when I recorded it I cried so much my vocal chords got swollen . " She also expressed her pleasure at being able to sing about her experiences . 
 " It 's just so nice to express that emotion and get it all out there because everyone out there , I 'm sure you guys can relate to the pain of feeling like a complete idiot when everybody 's laughing at you when you 're getting played by the person in your life at the time . And you just need to take off your rose colored glasses . "

 The song was praised by critics who agreed that it was Rowland 's best chance of reaching the US Billboard Hot 100 again . They praised both production and vocal delivery of the song . Robbie Daw of Idolator said that , although he " liked the <unk> of the Kelly 's upbeat tunes , " it was " as nice to hear her take on a ballad again . " He called the single her best chance of " finally crack [ ing ] the upper reaches of the Hot 100 once again . " Following the video 's premier , Daw said that , alongside " Kelly looking stunning in the video , " the song had " hit " potential . " Surely the timing is right — especially with all the other singles Dr. Luke has had a hand in dominating the charts — for Rowland to be allowed into the spotlight once more . " Lizzie Goodwin of Gather.com agreed that the song , though different from her previous singles , stands on its own as a catchy tune . " Though it ’ s no ' When Love Takes Over ' , Kelly Rowland ’ s latest single and music video ' Rose Colored Glasses ' isn ’ t half @-@ bad . It might not be a dance hit , but her new single is pretty catchy and is a great addition to include in a breakup / girl empowerment playlist . " Mack from Sound @-@ Savvy said , " Kelly always makes those love songs that make you re @-@ examine things ... While I don ’ t think Rose Colored Glasses will impact as hard as Commander , it 's a formidable single in its own right and I kinda like it . " Despite accepting that Rowland has had her moments with the club songs , Melinda Newman of HitFix praised Dr. Luke 's production work , stating that " the song is a show stopper ( a nice production by him - we often find him too slick ) . " Jeremy Helligar of True / Slant said that Rowland had done a smart thing by not releasing " Commander " in the United States . He said , " [ Rowland 's ] edgier preference of dance music is very different to the dance @-@ pop that Lady Gaga often tops the charts with . " He later added that the song was " still to the left of what normally passes for modern R & B. " <unk> said that the electro ballad " sounds fresh and breathtaking " thanks to an " amazing production " and " great vocal delivery . "

 When the single 's cover was revealed , it divided opinions .

 Scenes in the video include vivid colors , unique visuals , and mood @-@ responsive lighting . During the shoot , Rowland said , " This video has been one of the best video experiences I ’ ve ever had . I ’ ve shot a lot of videos , but this one is probably the most intriguing because of how it ’ s shot , the lighting — everything is so detailed . " Rankin said that " the concept for the video was 3D " to best portray how " the people look at your relationships with an optimism that can 't be seen from the inside . " The scenes feature the use of circular trap and turntables so that Rowland " could be seen from every angle . " " Rose Colored Glasses " was set to premier on the Vevo network on September 20 , 2010 ; however , it was uploaded to her Vevo account on September 15 , 2010 , five days earlier than expected .

 At the beginning of the video , Rowland is seen dressed in waist @-@ high trousers , a white blouse , and a black tie . The first scene of the video features Rowland and her love interest , played by Alvino Lewis , arguing . During the song 's build @-@ up , she is dressed in a black @-@ and @-@ white netted catsuit , standing in front of pink and red streamers . Just before the chorus , she appears in a low cut corset against a dark backdrop with her hair tied in a tight bun . In the chorus , she appears in a gold dress on a turntable surrounded by smoke , spliced with scenes of the argument and a blue @-@ tinged image of Rowland . As she sings the hook of the song , the camera flicks to a scene where she is surrounded by windswept rose petals ( top frame ) . During the second verse , the blue tinged image of Rowland is seen again , as is a new scene where she is on the turntable again dressed in a black ball gown with frills around the neck and shoulder . This is spliced with more scenes of Rowland in her gold dress . As the chorus builds for a second time , Rowland is seen wearing a tube dress before switching to the dark corset scene where it begins to rain . Rowland is then seen surrounded by white doves ( bottom frame ) which fly around her while she spins on the circular trap .

 Critics generally praised the clip 's simplicity , the visuals , and the choice of outfits . A reviewer from Rap @-@ Up said , " Kelly Rowland turns her tears into art in the eye @-@ popping video for ' Rose Colored Glasses ' ... " They focused on the choice of visuals , saying that " the clip shows the Destiny 's Child alum struggling with a relationship , while numerous wardrobe changes , vivid colors , doves , and stunning shots of Kelly burst onto the screen . " Liz Goodwin of Gather.com agreed with the visuals , saying , " In the music video , Kelly Rowland 's body is looking fantastic . ( Though she could switch up the weave for another hairstyle . ) The outfits are hot – she ’ s looking fit ! Kudos to Kelly for pulling off the very , very low @-@ cut corset without falling out of it ! She can be grateful to gravity for still being on her side ... and for double @-@ sided tape . " Robbie Daw of Idolator said , " We hope two things happen now that Kelly Rowland ’ s Rankin @-@ directed ' Rose Colored Glasses ' music video has premiered : 1 . ) you like it and show Miss Kelly some love on iTunes , and 2 . ) radio programmers in this fine country open their ears and show Miss Kelly major love on the airwaves ... Kelly looks truly stunning in this video , from the opening shot of her wearing a dress shirt and tie to the couture dresses she vamps in expertly . " 
 Mariel Concepcion of Billboard was also positive of the video , saying that " not only does she walk away from an unhealthy situation in the clip - she looks completely stunning while doing so . " A reviewer from <unk> said , " The clip is fairly successful , despite its simplicity and sobriety , which probably result from a lack of budget . In the song , Kelly is very beautiful and very emotional because it gives way to sadness created by the decline of a relationship with her boyfriend . In the absence of a spectacular clip , Kelly still focused on her wardrobe , perfect for the occasion . " The reviewer pointed out that the video works because of Rowland having a good team behind her . " Kelly 's team is really good . Imagine the damage that Kelly could have done with the team of Rihanna ! ... " Julia <unk> of <unk> was also critical of the clip , saying , " The aesthetic is the rendezvous , the Destiny 's Child alum appears sexier than ever , but why has it increased the costumes ? Something is missing ... coherence , an imprint ? We do not yet see the real Kelly ... "

The song was nominated for the Viewers Choice Award at the 2010 BET Awards .

 Initially titled " Beautiful Nightmare " , " Sweet Dreams " became one of the first songs composed for the 2008 double album I Am ... Sasha Fierce . Record producer Rico Love regards writing " Sweet Dreams " with Knowles as " the experience of a lifetime " . When Knowles went to the South Beat Studios in Miami Beach , Florida , she was not prepared to record and had to attend the opening concert of her husband Jay @-@ Z 's tour . However , when she heard a demo of " Sweet Dreams " , she was impressed and wanted to record the song immediately . 
 Knowles , Wayne Wilkins and Jim Jonsin did some additional writing and produced the song alongside Love at the same studio . Knowles and Love worked on the vocal arrangements ; Knowles appreciated Love 's background vocals in the hook and retained them . Jim Caruana assisted in recording the music . Love then recorded Knowles ' vocals ; the recording session lasted for an hour . Lastly , Wilkins mixed the track . " Sweet Dreams " appears on the Sasha Fierce disc of I Am ... Sasha Fierce as it allows Knowles to portray her alter ego Sasha Fierce , whom Knowles described as " [ her ] fun , more sensual , more aggressive , more outspoken side and more glamorous side " . 
 = = Leak and release = = 
 " Sweet Dreams " was leaked under its original title the day after it was recorded in March 2008 , eight months before the album 's release . It was the first time that a single by Knowles was leaked before its inclusion on an upcoming album . She responded to the leak on her official website , thanking her fans for the positive response towards the song , before clarifying that it was just a work in progress and that she did not intend to release new material in the near future . About the leak , Love told MTV News : 
 I was more concerned that [ Beyoncé ] would feel that we did it . A lot of times producers or songwriters leak records because they feel if you put the song out there it would go [ on to become a hit ] . Usually a leak that far in advance of an album release puts the song in serious jeopardy of being excluded from the final track list . It was frustrating . I felt like you work hard to get in the studio to work with Beyoncé . [ But ] I was blessed ... that song turned out [ to ] have nine lives . 
 Under the song 's original title " Beautiful Nightmare " , " Sweet Dreams " gained some attention in the United States , where it amassed enough airplay to chart at number forty @-@ five on Hot Dance Club Songs chart and at number fifty @-@ seven on Pop 100 Airplay chart . " Broken @-@ Hearted Girl " was initially intended as the sixth US and fourth international single alongside the stateside @-@ only single " Ego " ( 2009 ) . However , its release was scrapped at the last minute , and replaced by " Sweet Dreams " , which Knowles selected for a summer single release because she wanted an uptempo song that would keep people dancing . She added , " It 's very rare to find an uptempo song that means something ... that 's not just about going to a club or partying or being a sexy girl . " 
 " Sweet Dreams " was added to US contemporary hit radio and rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on June 2 , 2009 . Dance remixes of the song alongside the album version of " Ego " and its remixes were later released on the same digital EP on August 17 , 2009 , in the US .

 = = Composition and lyrical interpretation = = 
 " Sweet Dreams " is an electropop song that incorporates elements of rock and old school funk music . The song is built on undulating electro rhythms and a thumping beat ; its groove fits into hip hop phrasing . It is essentially driven by a keyboard and also has guitar , piano , synthesizer , snare drum and bass instrumentation . Many music critics noted that several components of " Sweet Dreams " are reminiscent of the songs on Michael Jackson 's 1982 album Thriller . James Montgomery of MTV News said that the " gnarly low end " sounds like Jackson 's song " Beat It " ( 1983 ) . Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that the electronic bassline is similar to those used in Jackson 's songs " Thriller " ( 1983 ) and " Bad " ( 1987 ) . Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that Jackson could use the beat of " Sweet Dreams " to bring up to date his Thriller @-@ era style . 
 The lyrics of " Sweet Dreams " are about a female protagonist who has some insecurities about her new romantic relationship ; she is confused about whether her relationship with her partner is a " sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare " . The song starts with a bassline , which is occasionally interrupted by spare snare kicks , drum fills and Knowles ' chanting , " Turn the lights on " . She then adopts slinky vocals to begin the first verse . The " expansive @-@ yet @-@ molecular " chorus then starts with the line , " You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare / Either way , I don 't wanna wake up from you . " The song is written in the key of D ♯ minor with a tempo of 122 beats per minute . Beyoncé 's vocals span from C ♯ 4 to E ♯ 5 in the song .

 " Sweet Dreams " was acclaimed by critics , some of whom praised its dark tone and electropop sound that is different from Knowles ' previous work . James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles ' vocals , which he called , " icy and cool , slippery like mercury [ and ] nothing to scoff at either " , help make the song an " undeniable smash " that is unique compared to the work of other artists . Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles ' " fierce " alter ego , who " dares the listener to dream of her , warning that it might be a ' beautiful nightmare ' . " Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that " Sweet Dreams " is another one of Jim Jonsin 's productions with a keyboard @-@ propelled arrangement , but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy , the song is " swirling , and darker " . Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles ' purest dance songs and is " an irresistible call to the dance floor " . Describing " Sweet Dreams " as a " cool dance track " , Dennis Amith of J ! -ENT complimented its arrangement , calling it " experimental " with " cool transitions " . 
 Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times described the song as " a gritty slow grind with a salacious bassline " and noted that Knowles " delivers a near parody of a good @-@ girl voice " while singing the chorus . Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media wrote that " Sweet Dreams " sounds like a song Rihanna would sing . Echoing Dombal 's sentiments , Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote that the best song on the Sasha Fierce disc is a " dark [ ish ] electropop track called ' Sweet Dreams ' , [ which ] actually sounds like the cousin of Rihanna 's ' Disturbia ' " . On a separate review for the single , Levine awarded " Sweet Dreams " a rating of four stars out of five , and commented that the song seduces listeners with its catchy chorus hook , and thereafter keeps them intrigued by " placing a hint of darkness just beneath the shiny , synthy surface " . Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that though " Sweet Dreams " is not a " stellar track " , it is superior to other album tracks , including " Diva " and " Radio " . Similarly , Vicki Lutas of BBC Music wrote that even though " Sweet Dreams " appears to lack something , it is undeniably a good song overall . She added that " Sweet Dreams " may not be Knowles ' finest or most memorable work , but it remains her best offering since her 2003 song " Crazy in Love " . Lutas also commended Knowles ' vocal delivery , which he described as " beautiful and soft , yet strong and powerful " . Talia Kraines of the same publication wrote that " Sweet Dreams " is one of the standout tracks on the Sasha Fierce disc though Knowles does not get as experimental as she did on her 2006 song " Ring the Alarm " .

 The accompanying music video for " Sweet Dreams " was directed by Adria Petty , whom Knowles chose because of her intelligence and beautiful visual references . After Knowles learned the choreography in Los Angeles , the video was shot in a studio in Brooklyn , New York City . It was the seventh video released from I Am ... Sasha Fierce , and the second to have complete color throughout ; " Halo " was the first . Knowles described it as more " graphic " when compared to the previous six videos ; its motive was to " take Sasha [ Fierce ] to the next level " . In the video , Knowles ' alter ego is symbolized by the golden robot suit she wears ; it was designed by French fashion designer Thierry Mugler . 
 A green @-@ screen and computer @-@ generated effects were used for the video to create a minimal and performance @-@ based clip . The computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) was employed to create a context @-@ less void ; the CGI effects were used to delete the background and setting before creating a void @-@ like digital canvas for the dance routine that is executed by Knowles and her dancers Ebony Williams and Ashley Everett , who all sport numerous flashy and symmetrical costumes throughout the video . Accordingly , there were no concerns of cutting ; the images were easily merged into one another using computers . A high number of camera lens glare effects was used in the video , part of which was inspired by British designer Gareth Pugh 's Autumn / Winter 2009 video presentation . Knowles further explained that the fashion and choreography were the main elements of the music video : 
 The fashion was extremely important in this video because everything was so minimal ... With the choreography , we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat . What makes this choreography so interesting is that in one instance , it is very staccato and hard ... And the next instance ; the movement is very smooth and there are lots of melts with inter @-@ kit movement in the fingers and hands . 
 On June 12 , 2009 , a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes video , which Knowles ' dance rehearsal , was released ; Knowles was dressed in golden costumes and was performing some robotic movements The music video of " Sweet Dreams " was not included on the remixes and video album Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes as it was not finished when the CD / DVD collection was made ; instead , a Making of Sweet Dreams video was included .

The following day , the full video was leaked online but was soon deleted after Knowles ' label issued warnings to infringing websites . The video for " Sweet Dreams " premiered on MTV later the same day . 
 = = = Synopsis and analysis = = = 
 The video opens with Knowles tossing and turning in her bed ; her idea was to make the opening shot look like " a dark fairy tale " . As she tries to sleep , Brahms 's Lullaby plays softly in the background . She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move the top half of her body . Knowles said that the levitation shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck look straight . She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream , which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar . Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background . She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots ; as the music begins , her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear . The scene changes into a computer @-@ generated sci @-@ fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci 's Vitruvian Man . The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass @-@ breaking sound effect as the sci @-@ fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one @-@ shouldered mini dress on a white background . Accompanied by her backup dancers , she performs sophisticated , street and hip @-@ busting dance moves . 
 The second chorus shows Knowles wearing a silver lined body suit while smashing mirrors . During the bridge , the video fades to black and white and Knowles appears wearing the gold robot suit , and gold and diamond nail rings valued at $ 36 @,@ 000 and designed by <unk> designer Jules Kim . She executes some robotic movements . As the chorus begins to play for the third and final time , digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images Knowles arching her back . The gold outfit is then reused , this time in color . Knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers , then says , " Turn the lights out " , and the video ends .

 James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that the video is " an eye @-@ popping , herky @-@ jerky , high @-@ fashion " one . He praised the way Knowles " [ pops ] her pelvis in ways never imagined " , and the wardrobe changes in the clip , before concluding : " She expands on her burgeoning robot fetish , flashes the crazy eyes and contorts her body in downright unsettling ways . All of which is to say that ' Sweet Dreams ' is just like every amazingly crazy Beyoncé video from the past three years , which — to extend the point — also means that it 's pretty great . " Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video , Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella ( 1968 ) , Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears . Smith further compared the video with the one for " Single Ladies " , writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she " can only swivel those hips in so many ways " . Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described the introductory part of the video as a David Lynch @-@ like mixture of eroticism and symbolism . He wrote that the video was " one part Victoria 's Secret commercial , another part dream logic anti @-@ narrative , and a CGI @-@ assisted freakout all around " . Soderberg commended the video for being " an excess of body and action , not filmic techniques " , adding that the dancing in the video " blow [ s ] our minds anew " . 
 Rolling Stone found similarities between the video for " Sweet Dreams " , Kanye West 's video for " Paranoid " ( 2009 ) and the cover artworks of English rock band Yes . Canadian magazine Dose also compared the video with " Paranoid " due to their similar dream sequences . Nadia Mendoza of The Sun further compared Knowles ' look in the video with Lady Gaga 's . Vicki Lutas of the BBC did not appreciate the first 30 seconds of the video , writing that " the dark , horror @-@ type music , the pumping heartbeat , the equally spooky lullaby , the screech of an electric guitar " , gave her the impression that she was watching " some [ 19 ] 80s magician , with a Knowles soundtrack " . However , she complimented the rest of the video writing that " things ( thankfully ) move away from the Hallowe 'en cheese and into familiar Beyoncé territory ( right from the fact it 's proper [ 19 ] 80s pop through to the video essentially being ' Single Ladies ' with Beyoncé and 2 dancers ) " . Lutas concluded that the video might not be remembered for long or hailed as Beyoncé 's finest and more memorable work , but it remains one of the best music videos from Knowles she has seen since " Crazy in Love " . Nick Levine of Digital Spy compared the dancing moves in the video with those in " Single Ladies " . 
 The video stayed at number one for several weeks on the UK TV Airplay Chart in August and September 2009 . It was ranked at number 13 on BET 's Notarized : Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown . Tamar Anitai of MTV placed the video at number three on his list of the best five videos of 2009 , wrote that it " isn 't just another high @-@ fashion look at Beyoncé ... " and continued , " It 's the dark yin to the brighter , lighter fare of ' Single Ladies . ' This is a 360 @-@ degree look at Beyoncé 's life : Beyoncé the woman , Sasha Fierce the performer , and the powerful force that occupies the spaces in between . " . In 2013 , John Boone and Jennifer Cady of E ! Online placed the video at number ten on their list of Knowles ' ten best music videos , praising Knowles ' sexy robotic look .

She further compared the performance with the dream sequence from the 1945 film Spellbound but noted that it was " slightly weirder " Jim Farber of the Daily News commented that " her take on a song by her clear role model , Beyoncé , showed too much similarity in their timbres and phrasing , making Sanchez 's voice seem redundant ... despite the fact she switched up the arrangement of the bootylicious song she chose , ' Sweet Dreams . ' " Laura Schreffler of the Daily Mail described Sanchez ' performance as " pared @-@ down , show @-@ stopping ... a floaty , dreamy , confection that wows the judges . " Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote , " Sanchez gave yet another perfectly calibrated performance with Beyoncé 's ' Sweet Dreams , ' balancing restraint and power . Everything from her voice to her dress to the red door she walked through seemed polished and tour @-@ ready . " The Arizona Republic 's Randy Cordova praised the performance , saying that the slow @-@ tempo version allowed Sanchez " to really delve into the song 's emotional core " . The Hollywood Reporter 's Erin Carlson praised the <unk> @-@ down theatrical stage during the performance and Sanchez 's vibrato voice , further describing the performance as a " near @-@ perfection " .

 = God of War : Ghost of Sparta = 
 God of War : Ghost of Sparta is a third person action @-@ adventure video game developed by Ready at Dawn and Santa Monica Studio , and published by Sony Computer Entertainment ( SCE ) . It was first released for the PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) handheld console on November 2 , 2010 . The game is the sixth installment in the God of War series and the fourth chronologically . Loosely based on Greek mythology , Ghost of Sparta is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif . The player controls the protagonist Kratos , the God of War . Kratos is still haunted by the visions of his mortal past and decides to explore his origins . In Atlantis , he finds his mother Callisto , who claims that his brother Deimos is still alive . Kratos then journeys to the Domain of Death to rescue his brother . After initial resentment from Deimos , the brothers team up to battle the God of Death , Thanatos . 
 The gameplay is similar to that of the previous installments , and focuses on combo @-@ based combat , achieved through the player 's main weapon — the Blades of Athena — and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game . It features quick time events that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses . Up to three magical attacks and a power @-@ enhancing ability can be used as alternative combat options . Ghost of Sparta also features puzzles and platforming elements . The combat system was updated with 25 percent more gameplay than its PSP predecessor , God of War : Chains of Olympus . 
 Ghost of Sparta received praise for its story , gameplay , and graphics . Several critics agree that it is the best @-@ looking game on the PSP . Others have compared the overall game to those on the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) , and some have said that the graphics are better than those of the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) . Ghost of Sparta received several awards , including " Best Handheld Game " , " Best PSP Game " , and " PSP Game of Show " at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) , and " Best Handheld Game " at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards . By June 2012 , it had sold almost 1 @.@ 2 million copies worldwide , making it the fifteenth best @-@ selling PlayStation Portable game of all time . Together with Chains of Olympus , Ghost of Sparta was remastered and released on September 13 , 2011 , as part of the God of War : Origins Collection and the remastered version was re @-@ released on August 28 , 2012 , as part of the God of War Saga , both for the PlayStation 3 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of God of War : Ghost of Sparta resembles that of the previous installments . It is a third @-@ person single player video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective . The player controls the character Kratos in combo @-@ based combat , platforming , and puzzle game elements , and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology , including minotaurs , cyclopes , harpies , Gorgons , and satyrs . The undead legionnaires , <unk> wraiths , <unk> , automatons , Boreas beasts , and Triton warriors were influenced by the mythology , but created specifically for the game . Platforming elements require the player to climb walls , jump across chasms , swing on ropes , and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game . Some puzzles are simple , such as moving a box so that the player can use it to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping , but others are more complex , such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door . The game features new weapons , magical powers , and navigational abilities not present in previous games and has been cited as featuring 25 percent more gameplay than God of War : Chains of Olympus . 
 = = = Combat = = = 
 Kratos ' main weapon is the Blades of Athena , a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around the character 's wrists and forearms . In gameplay , the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers . Later in the game , Kratos acquires a new weapon , the Arms of Sparta — a spear and shield offering alternative combat options ( e.g. , Kratos can use the shield for defense and the spear for offense , such as throwing it at distant targets ) . Kratos gains a special ability , Thera 's Bane , that infuses his blades with fire , and is similar to the Rage ability in previous games , providing increased attack damage that is strong enough to pierce through enemy armor . As with the Items in God of War III , this ability automatically replenishes itself ( represented by the Fire meter ) , allowing further usage . Both the Arms of Sparta and Thera 's Bane are used to overcome environmental obstacles ( e.g. , certain doors require the use of Thera 's Bane to open ) . Kratos learns to use up to three magical abilities , including the Eye of Atlantis , Scourge of Erinys , and the Horn of Boreas , giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies . The relic Poseidon 's Trident is retained from the prior installment , which allows him to breathe underwater , a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there . 
 The combat system has been updated to allow Kratos to " pummel enemies to the ground as well as throw them " , and perform air @-@ to @-@ air attacks . An " augmented death system " is also used , featuring specific weapon and magic death animations . This game 's challenge mode is called the Challenge of the Gods , which features five Challenges of Ares , with an additional eight Challenges of Athena that can be unlocked . The challenge mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks ( e.g. , kill all enemies without being attacked ) . A new mode exclusive to this game has been added called The Temple of Zeus , which allows players to sacrifice collected red orbs ( from both in @-@ game and the challenge mode ) to unlock additional features , such as the Challenges of Athena , bonus costumes for Kratos , behind @-@ the @-@ scenes videos , and concept art of the characters and environments . Completing each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards . A Combat Arena ( similar to the version in God of War III ) allows players to pick adversaries and adjust the level of difficulty to improve their skills .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 As with other games in the God of War franchise , God of War : Ghost of Sparta is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods , Titans , and other beings from Greek mythology . With the exception of flashbacks , the events are set between the games God of War ( 2005 ) and Betrayal ( 2007 ) . Several locations are explored , including the fictional city of Atlantis ( and later a sunken version ) . Atlantis is a mythical city erected by the Sea God Poseidon , and houses the Temple of Poseidon . Near the city is real @-@ world location , the Methana Volcano , which is contained by the <unk> screws and is also the prison of the Titan Thera , who is guarded by automatons . On the outskirts of the city is the Temple of the god Thanatos , the location of Death 's Gate and portal to the Domain of Death . Other locations include the Island of Crete and its capital city , Heraklion , the Mounts of <unk> , the ancient city of Sparta ( also home to the Temple of Ares ) , the Mounts of Laconia , and a brief scene above the city of Athens featuring Suicide Bluffs , the highest cliff in the city overlooking the Aegean Sea and a recurring location during Kratos ' adventures . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The protagonist of the game is Kratos ( voiced by Terrence C. Carson ) , the God of War after having killed the former , Ares ( who appears in flashbacks and voiced by Steven Blum ) . Other characters include Athena ( Erin Torpey ) , the Goddess of Wisdom who warns Kratos about exploring his past ; Deimos ( Mark <unk> ) , the younger brother of Kratos and imprisoned and tortured in the Domain of Death ; Thanatos ( Arthur Burghardt ) , the God of Death and main antagonist ; Callisto ( Deanna <unk> ) , the mother of Kratos and Deimos ; Thera ( Dee Dee Rescher ) , a Titan imprisoned beneath the Methana Volcano ; and Erinys ( Erin Torpey and Jennifer Hale ) , Thanatos ' daughter . Minor characters include <unk> ( Fred Tatasciore ) ; a servant of Poseidon ; King Midas ( Fred Tatasciore ) , a king whose touch will turn anything to gold ; the gravedigger ( Paul Eiding ) , who warns Kratos to not alienate the gods ; a loyal Spartan soldier ( Gideon Emery ) ; and Poseidon ( Gideon Emery ) , the God of the Sea . Zeus ( Fred Tatasciore ) , the King of the Gods , appears in the " Combat Arena " ( bonus feature ) after the player selects the gravedigger . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 A series of flashbacks reveals that an oracle had foretold that the demise of Olympus would come not by the revenge of the Titans , who had been imprisoned after the Great War , but by a marked warrior . The Olympians Zeus and Ares believed this warrior to be Deimos , the brother of Kratos , due to his strange birthmarks . Ares interrupted the childhood training of Kratos and Deimos , with Athena on hand , and kidnapped Deimos . Kratos attempted to stop Ares , but was swept aside and subsequently scarred across his right eye by the Olympian . Athena stopped Ares from killing Kratos , knowing his eventual destiny . Taken to Death 's Domain , Deimos was imprisoned and tortured by Thanatos . In honor of his sibling , Kratos marked himself with a red tattoo , identical to his brother 's birthmark . 
 Years later , when the game begins , Kratos has taken Ares ' place as the new God of War on Mount Olympus . Still haunted by visions of his mortal past , Kratos decides against Athena 's advice to explore his past and travels to the Temple of Poseidon , located within the city of Atlantis . The sea monster , Scylla , attacks and destroys Kratos ' vessel off the coast of Atlantis , although the Spartan drives the beast off . After a series of skirmishes across the city , he eventually kills Scylla . 
 Reaching the temple , Kratos locates his mother , Callisto , who attempts to reveal the identity of his father . When Callisto is suddenly transformed into a hideous beast , Kratos is forced to battle her , and before dying , Callisto thanks him and beseeches him to seek out Deimos in Sparta . Prior to departure , Kratos encounters and frees the trapped Titan , Thera , which causes the eruption of the Methana Volcano , and subsequently destroys the city . During his escape , he has another encounter with the enigmatic gravedigger , who warns him of the consequences of alienating the gods . 
 After a battle with Erinys , Kratos arrives in Sparta and witnesses a group of Spartans tearing down a statue of Ares , intent on replacing it with one of Kratos . Kratos then chases a dissenter loyal to Ares into the Spartan Jails , who attempts to kill Kratos by releasing the Piraeus Lion . Defeating both foes , Kratos journeys to the Temple of Ares , where he encounters the spirit of his child self and learns that he must return to the now sunken Atlantis and locate the Domain of Death . Before leaving , a loyal Spartan provides him with his former weapons — used during Kratos ' days as a Captain of the Spartan army — the Arms of Sparta . After returning to the sunken Atlantis , Kratos receives great resentment from Poseidon for sinking his beloved city . 
 Entering the Domain of Death , the Spartan frees his imprisoned brother . Enraged that Kratos had failed to rescue him sooner and stating he will never forgive him , Deimos attacks Kratos , but Thanatos intervenes . The god takes Deimos against his will to Suicide Bluffs ( the site of Kratos ' suicide attempt ) , where Kratos saves Deimos from falling to his death . A grateful Deimos then aids his brother in battling the god with the Arms of Sparta . Thanatos , however , kills Deimos but is destroyed , in turn , by Kratos . Remarking that his brother is finally free , Kratos places Deimos in his grave ( leaving the Arms of Sparta as a grave marker ) , while the gravedigger states that Kratos has become " Death ... the Destroyer of Worlds . " Athena appears , begs for forgiveness , and offers full godhood for not revealing the truth , but Kratos ignores her and returns to Olympus , promising that " the gods will pay for this . " As Kratos is seen leaving , Athena looks apologetically at Kratos and whispers out of his earshot , " Forgive me ... brother . " 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , the gravedigger places Callisto in a grave by Deimos ( with an empty third grave nearby ) and states " Now ... only one remains . " The final scene is a brooding Kratos sitting on his throne on Mount Olympus . 
 = = Development = = 
 God of War : Ghost of Sparta was announced on May 4 , 2010 , on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony , Ready at Dawn utilized " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art visual technologies " that allowed " higher quality environments and characters . " Ghost of Sparta apparently offers " over 25 % more gameplay " than its PSP predecessor , Chains of Olympus , while adding more enemies on screen and a greater number of boss encounters . Development of Ghost of Sparta took 23 months to complete . Chains of Olympus Game Director Ru Weerasuriya did not return to direct due to his busy schedule at Ready at Dawn , so Dana Jan , the Lead Level Designer on Chains of Olympus , became director . At Comic @-@ Con 2010 , Jan noted that when development began in 2008 , the goal was to make the game " bigger " than Chains of Olympus , which had apparently " pushed " the PSP to its functional limits . Jan stated that Ghost of Sparta has taken the PSP to its " absolute capacity " , with one additional feature being more on @-@ screen foes . The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from God of War III . The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com – it initially featured a simple animation of torrential rain falling into a body of water and a Spartan shield encompassed by a meter on the screen . The meter was speculated to have been filled by players achieving the trophy and reaching the site . On May 4 , 2010 , the meter reached maximum and the site was updated for a final time , revealing an image of Kratos standing above a reflection and the logo for God of War : Ghost of Sparta , as the official site . On June 15 , 2010 , Sony displayed a cinematic trailer narrated by Linda Hunt during their 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) Press Conference . 
 Dana Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because " It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void . " Jan said with some scenes , " the team wasn 't sure how gamers would react " because " God of War usually doesn 't slow ... down " and the team " worried if these scenes would be captivating enough to keep player interested and still feel like God of War . " For puzzles , Jan stated that they tried to make the outcomes unexpected because players assume that they will have to " push something , carry a body or smash something with [ the ] blades . " <unk> at a possible future installment from Ready at Dawn , Jan stated that he is " intrigued " by the flashbacks in God of War and God of War II and that " There 's definitely a back story to Kratos that nobody 's touched on . " For the character Deimos , Jan stated that the first reference was actually in the Chains of Olympus finale . In the game , Helios states " Do you think that they 'll survive ? " and Athena says " They must . " Jan said that this line was " purposefully put " in that game and that there are also references to Deimos in God of War III .
