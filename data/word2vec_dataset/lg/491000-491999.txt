 In previews , publications such as IGN and GameSpot noted that the graphics had been improved , and that there were many new characters and locations . The new minigames were previewed , and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity to back up the simple gameplay . In an interview with GameSpot , Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters , but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story . Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection , in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained . This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release . 
 Despite the positive response the game would go on to receive , Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games ' last Spyro title . In an interview , CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they couldn 't do anything new with the character , and that after five years of development on a single series the team wanted to do something different . Future Spyro games were produced by , among other developers , Digital Eclipse , Equinox Digital Entertainment , Eurocom , Krome Studios , <unk> <unk> , and Tantalus Media . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The music for Year of the Dragon was composed and produced by Stewart Copeland , former drummer for the rock band The Police , with additional contributions by Ryan Beveridge . During the band 's hiatus , Copeland composed several movie soundtracks , and composed the scores for the previous Spyro titles ; Price stated that Copeland 's offering for the third installment was his best work to date . 
 In an interview , Copeland stated his creative process for writing the music for the Spyro series always began by playing through the levels , trying to get a feel for each world 's " atmosphere " . Copeland noted the challenge of writing for games was to create music that would both be interesting to listen to and complemented the gameplay ; his approach was to incorporate more complicated harmonies and basslines so that the music could seem fresh for players , even after repeated listening . He complimented the compact disc format of the PlayStation and its support for high quality audio ; there were no technical constraints that stopped him from producing the sound he wanted . Copeland recorded entire orchestral scores for extra flourish when the visuals called for an expansive sound , but used more percussive and beat @-@ driven melodies for " high @-@ energy " moments in the game .

 Year of the Dragon was critically acclaimed , with the game receiving an average ranking of 91 % at Game Rankings , and a similar score based on fifteen reviews at Metacritic . According to GameRankings , Year of the Dragon is the fourteenth highest rated PlayStation game of all time . The game sold more than two million units in the United States . 
 GameSpot noted that while Year of the Dragon made no significant changes to the formula of its predecessors , the combination of new playable characters , more detailed graphics , and the variety of minigames made the game worth the buy . IGN praised the game 's appeal to all ages and the polished levels , as well as the successful multi @-@ character focus . Game Revolution thought that while the game 's premise itself was simply a rehash of previous titles , " the story that unfolds as you actually play the game is flawlessly interwoven and quite entertaining " . GamePro noted that the ability of the game to automatically drop the difficulty if players get stuck was an excellent feature . Next Generation Magazine 's Kevin Rice provided one of the most positive reviews in which he stated the top @-@ notch level design , intuitive controls and excellent graphics made the title the best Spyro game to date , and arguably the best PlayStation game overall . 
 Copeland 's score was generally well @-@ received , though several critics sharply disagreed with the general consensus . Publications like <unk> thought the music helped bring atmosphere to the varied worlds , and Allgame enthused that " Insomniac should be commended for realizing the importance of music in games ; it seems to enhance the whole experience . " Others , such as Joseph <unk> of Game Revolution , thought the background music sounded " identical to every other 3D , cartoony , action platformer I 've ever played " . Other points of praise were the voice acting and character development . Among the few complaints aside from the story included the game camera , which could be difficult to control and led to unjustified enemy attacks . Some publications warned that the game might feel too much like its predecessors , with a similar plot and objectives .

 Gordon Mac Gollob ( 16 June 1912 – 7 September 1987 ) was a German Luftwaffe military aviator during World War II , a fighter ace credited with 150 enemy aircraft shot down in over 340 combat missions . Originally from Austria , he claimed the majority of his victories over the Eastern Front , and six over the Western Front , five of which he claimed as a Messerschmitt Bf 110 fighter pilot . 
 Gollob volunteered for military service in the Austrian Austrian Armed Forces in 1933 . In March 1938 , following the Anschluss , the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany , Gollob was transferred to the Luftwaffe . In 1939 , Gollob was posted to Zerstörergeschwader 76 ( ZG 76 — 76th Destroyer Wing ) , a twin @-@ engined heavy fighter wing . Following the outbreak of World War II , he claimed his first aerial victory on 5 September 1939 during the invasion of Poland . Gollob claimed one victory during the Battle of the Heligoland Bight and two victories during the Norwegian Campaign . He then transferred to Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) , flying the single @-@ engined Messerschmitt Bf 109 . In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain on the Channel Front , he claimed his sixth and final victory on the Western Front . 
 Gollob then fought in the aerial battles of Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . On 27 June 1941 , Gollob was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the II . Gruppe ( 2nd group ) of JG 3 . He claimed 18 aerial victories in August , and following his 42nd victory was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 18 September .

At the time of its presentation to Gollob it was Germany 's highest military decoration . 
 Due to concerns that he would be killed in action , Gollob was prohibited from flying further combat missions . On 15 October 1942 , he was appointed as Jagdfliegerführer 3 on the Western Front , then on 6 September 1943 he was appointed as Jagdfliegerführer 5 , responsible for the tactical fighter command of northwestern France . In April 1944 , he was transferred to the staff of the Inspector of Fighters . In January 1945 , he succeeded Generalleutnant ( Major General ) Adolf Galland as Inspector of Fighters , a position he held until the end of hostilities .

 Gollob was born on 16 June 1912 in Vienna , the capital of Austria @-@ Hungary . His father , Heinrich Gollob , worked as an academic painter . His mother , Johanna ( née <unk> ) , was the daughter of Zoe von Karajan , a distant relative of Herbert von Karajan and wife of Carl <unk> . Gollob was the first of five children . Both his parents had studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna , where they mutually befriended Gordon Mallet <unk> , an American artist of Scottish descent . <unk> was his godfather and the namesake for his first and middle names , Gordon Mac .

In 1930 , as a student at an <unk> , a secondary school , he built his first primary glider in Tirol , experimenting with it at the old airfield at Innsbruck . He also completed his A- and B @-@ license to fly glider aircraft and became an instructor as well as a construction and airframe inspector . 
 Following four semesters of mechanical engineering at the University of Graz , Gollob joined the Austrian Bundesheer ( Austrian Armed Forces ) in 1933 as an officer cadet in the artillery . For three years he was trained at the Maria Theresia Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt and was promoted to Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) on 1 September 1936 . He then served as an instructor in the Luftstreitkräfte ( Austrian Air Force ) and commander of <unk> A ( Training Squadron A ) . Following the Anschluss in March 1938 , the forced incorporation of Austria into Nazi Germany , Gollob was transferred to the Luftwaffe ( the Nazi German Air Force ) . There , he was promoted to Oberleutnant ( first lieutenant ) on 1 June 1938 . On 15 March 1939 , Gollob was posted to the 3 .

 World War II in Europe began on Friday , 1 September 1939 , when German forces invaded Poland . ZG 76 had been stationed at the Polish border prior to the invasion . Gollob scored the first of his aerial victories over Poland on 5 September 1939 , shooting down a PWS 56 ( Podlaska <unk> <unk> — Podlasie Aircraft Factory ) biplane . He also flew a number of ground support missions , attacking an airfield and destroying a number of aircraft on the ground . On 21 September 1939 , Gollob was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse ) for his service in Poland . Following the campaign in Poland , ZG 76 was moved to Germany to defend the Reich . The 1 . Gruppe of ZG 76 first relocated to the Stuttgart area on 29 September 1939 to defend the western border against the French and British , who had declared war with Germany on 3 September 1939 . From early October to middle December , I. Gruppe operated from a number of airfields in the Stuttgart and Ruhr regions before relocating north to Jever on 16 December 1939 . There , on 18 December 1939 , Gollob claimed his second aerial victory over a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) Vickers Wellington bomber in what became to be known as the Battle of the Heligoland Bight . During the battle , he shot down and killed Squadron Leader Archibald Guthrie , of No. 9 Squadron .

 On 8 April 1940 , Gollob was appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of 3 . Staffel of ZG 76 . The unit took part in Operation Weserübung , Germany 's assault on Denmark and Norway in the opening operation of the Norwegian Campaign . In June 1940 , I. Gruppe was based at Trondheim @-@ Værnes , when the Allied expeditionary force composed of British , French , and Free Polish , were being evacuated from Narvik . In support of the evacuation , the RAF was targeting German shipping in Norwegian waters and Luftwaffe occupied airfields along the coast . On 13 June , fifteen Blackburn Skua dive bombers , six from 800 Naval Air Squadron and nine from 803 Naval Air Squadron , launched from the Royal Navy aircraft carrier Ark Royal attempted to attack the battleship Scharnhorst in the Trondheimsfjord . The flight was intercepted by the Luftwaffe and in the resulting aerial encounter , eight Skuas were shot down , the first by Gollob . That day , he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse ) . 
 Gollob then received night fighter training . At the time , he made a few recommendations for technical improvement of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 single @-@ engined fighter . Based on these recommendations , he was transferred to the Erprobungstelle Rechlin , the Luftwaffe test facility at Rechlin in June 1940 . At 14 : 47 on 9 July 1940 , Gollob intercepted and shot down Short Sunderland flying boat " Y " ( <unk> ) from No. 201 Squadron . The Sunderland , piloted by Flight Lieutenant J.D. Middleton , was on patrol off Norway and crashed 140 kilometers ( 90 mi ) southwest of Sumburgh Head . That same day at 17 : 20 , Gollob , together with Oberfeldwebel ( Staff Sergeant ) Herbert <unk> and Oberleutnant Gerhard <unk> , shot down a patrolling Lockheed Hudson reconnaissance aircraft " J " ( <unk> ) from No. 233 Squadron off Shetland . 
 On 7 September 1940 during the Battle of Britain , Gollob was transferred to the Gruppenstab ( headquarters unit ) of II . Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) based at <unk> in northern France . On 8 October , Oberleutnant Werner Voigt , Staffelkapitän of 4 . Staffel was shot down over England and taken prisoner of war . Four days later , Gollob took command of 4 . Staffel . In February 1941 , the entire II . Gruppe returned to Germany for a period of rest . The pilots went on a ski vacation in Kitzbühel from 9 to 28 March 1941 . 4 . Staffel was housed at the foot of the <unk> , the highest point of the <unk> . The Gruppe then reassembled at Darmstadt @-@ <unk> where they received a complement of the new Bf 109 F @-@ 2 fighter aircraft . On 25 April 1941 , II . Gruppe began relocating back to the English Channel Front at Monchy @-@ Breton . The Gruppe completed relocation on 4 May and flew its first mission on 7 May 1941 . That day , the RAF flew several fighter sweeps over the French coast and Gollob was credited with shooting down a Supermarine Spitfire fighter , his sixth of the war and last on the Western Front . On 1 June 1941 , Gollob was promoted to Hauptmann ( captain ) and II . Gruppe began its relocation to the Eastern Front . The ground elements moved immediately while the air elements followed on 8 June . On that day , they flew to Saint @-@ Dizier and then to Böblingen . On the following day , they continued to Breslau @-@ <unk> , now the Wrocław – Copernicus Airport in Poland , via Straubing .

 In preparation for Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union , II . Gruppe headed further east on 18 June . Following a stopover at Kraków , the unit was moved to <unk> . At the start of the campaign , JG 3 under the command of Major ( Major ) Günther Lützow was subordinated to the V. Fliegerkorps ( 5th Air Corps ) , under the command of General der Flieger ( General of the Aviators ) Robert Ritter von Greim , itself part of Luftflotte 4 ( 4th Air Fleet ) , under the command of Generaloberst ( Colonel General ) Alexander Löhr . These air elements supported Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) Gerd von Rundstedt 's Heeresgruppe Süd ( Army Group South ) , with the objective of capturing Ukraine and its capital Kiev . At 17 : 00 on 21 June 1941 , V. Fliegerkorps , based at <unk> , briefed the various unit commanders of the upcoming attack . That evening , Hauptmann Lothar Keller , Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of II . Gruppe , informed his subordinates of the attack . 
 The invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941 . II . Gruppe flew its first missions on the Eastern Front shortly before 04 : 00 , flying low attacks against Soviet airfields in the vicinity of Lvov , now Lviv in Ukraine . At 06 : 30 the Gruppe fought its first aerial battles . 4 . Staffel claimed three victories and the Gruppenstab four . One of these victories was credited to Gollob , who claimed a Polikarpov I @-@ 16 fighter shot down at 07 : 00 . On 25 June , II . Gruppe claimed 17 victories , 6 of which were credited to 4 . Staffel . The Staffel engaged Ilyushin DB @-@ 3 bombers escorted by I @-@ 16 " <unk> " on a free chase mission west of Lutsk . The Soviet bombers targeted the German advance roads from Hrubieszów through Volodymyr @-@ Volynskyi to Lusk . Gollob was credited with two victories over DB @-@ 3s in this encounter . On 26 June 1941 , Gruppenkommandeur Keller was killed in a mid @-@ air collision . The next day , Gollop succeeded Keller in this position and turned over command of 4 . Staffel to Oberleutnant Karl Faust . In the beginning of July 1941 , the front in the vicinity of the northern sector of Heeresgruppe Süd became increasingly fluid . This necessitated the relocation of II . Gruppe to Volodymyr @-@ Volynskyi . By this time the war of attrition had reduced the Gruppe to 50 percent of its authorized strength . One reason for this was the almost complete lack of new aircraft or of engines and other spare parts . Another factor was overwork of the ground crews and signs of exhaustion were apparent . Flying combat air patrols over Berdychiv and Zhytomyr on 1 July , II . Gruppe claimed four victories . On this day at 19 : 42 , Gollob claimed his tenth aerial victory over a Petlyakov Pe @-@ 2 light bomber . The following day , the Gruppe claimed 23 aerial victories for the loss of one in combat . The first victory of the day was claimed by Gollob who shot down a <unk> @-@ 19 — a German alias for the Polikarpov I @-@ 17 fighter , possibly a misidentified Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 1 or Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 3 — at 05 : 52 in the morning . On another mission that day , he claimed two Vultee V @-@ 11 attack aircraft shot down at 11 : 30 and 11 : 43 . 
 The rapid advance of German ground forces required II . Gruppe to move to Lutsk on 5 July , then to Dubno that evening and to <unk> on 10 July . Flying missions east of Zhytomyr , Gollob claimed his 14th victory over a Polikarpov I @-@ 153 at 06 : 30 on 13 July 1941 . A victory over a DB @-@ 3 at 11 : 42 and a further victory over a Tupolev SB @-@ 2 bomber at 11 : 44 , both claimed on 16 July , took his total to 16 aerial victories . On 20 July 1941 , II . Gruppe relocated from <unk> to Berdychiv . One day later , Gollob was awarded the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe ( Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe ) for 16 aerial victories . On 23 July 1941 at 16 : 35 , Gollob claimed a Polikarpov R @-@ 5 reconnaissance bomber , his 17th aerial victory . That day , II . Gruppe received orders to turn over its remaining aircraft to I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 — 53rd Fighter Wing ) . Gollob 's Gruppe was re @-@ equipped with the Bf 109 F @-@ 4 . On 28 July , the pilots were flown to Krosno on a Junkers Ju 52 where they received a full complement of Bf 109 F @-@ 4s . After a single familiarization flight , they departed to Berdychiv and on the following morning they were transferred to Bila Tserkva . During the first days in August 1941 , II . Gruppe flew missions over the combat areas along the Dnieper in support of the main German attack to encircle Soviet forces near Uman , approximately 200 km ( 120 mi ) south of Kiev . Most II . Gruppe missions were subsequently in the greater Kiev area and to the north near <unk> , where Soviet forces were still holding onto the west bank of the Dnieper . Until 6 August 1941 , II . Gruppe claimed five victories without loss . Two victories claimed on 5 August took Gollob 's total to 20 aerial victories . He was victorious over a I @-@ 153 at 17 : 46 and a I @-@ 17 at 18 : 22 . 
 On 7 August , II . Gruppe moved again , from Bila Tserkva the Gruppe moved to <unk> , a forward airfield near <unk> . In the days to come , the Gruppe flew combat missions over the Dnieper , between <unk> and Kremenchuk as well to the south . Flying from <unk> for the next 10 days , II . Gruppe claimed 64 aerial victories , including 11 on 8 August , 7 on 9 August , 8 on 12 August and 27 on 17 August 1941 , the Gruppe 's most successful day of the entire 1941 summer campaign . In the same timeframe , Gollob increased his number of aerial victories to 26 . II . Gruppe had to relocate again in order to keep up with the German advance . On the afternoon of 17 August parts of the air elements flew to Kirovohrad @-@ North airfield . Their primary mission was to protect the armored spearheads in the Dnipropetrovsk area . On 21 August 1941 , II . Gruppe claimed 17 victories , five of which were by Gollob . This " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " achievement , the first of six during his combat career , took his total to 33 aerial victories . On 25 August , III . Armeekorps ( 3rd Army Corps ) took Dnipropetrovsk and captured the first bridgehead across the Dnieper . Until the end of August 1941 , II . Gruppe primary objective was to help secure the bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper . In support of these battles , Gollob scored a I @-@ 17 on 22 August , a Polikarpov I @-@ 180 fighter aircraft on 24 August and a Tupolev TB @-@ 3 heavy bomber on 31 August 1941 , taking his total to 36 aerial victories . On 1 September 1941 , the 17 . Armee ( 17th Army ) began crossing the Dnieper in force and II . Gruppe was moved to Myronivka . Flying from Myronivka was characterized by poor weather conditions with rain and fog , as a result operations were kept to a minimum . At the time , II . Gruppe 's primary objective was the defense of the Dnieper crossing . In these defensive battles , Gollob score his 37th victory on 8 September . His opponent was classified as an I @-@ 26 fighter aircraft , later referred to as Yakovlev Yak @-@ 1 . One day later , he claimed a Ilyushin Il @-@ 2 ground @-@ attack aircraft . On 12 September weather conditions improved and flight operations increased . II . Gruppe flew missions in support of the armored spearheads as well as fighter escort missions for Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers . That day , Gollob claimed two victories , a Il @-@ 2 and a I @-@ 26 , taking his total to 40 aerial victories . On 13 September , the Gruppe claimed 20 victories over Soviet bombers and ground @-@ attack aircraft , including a V @-@ 11 shot down by Gollob at 17 : 19 . On 14 September 1941 , the German airfield at Myronivka came under Soviet air attack . Following the attack , Gollob and his wingman Oberleutnant Walther Dahl managed to pursue the attackers , and both shot down one of them . This victory over an I @-@ 153 claimed at 05 : 47 in the morning took his total to 42 aerial victories . II . Gruppe was again forced to relocate , on 15 September it moved to an airfield at Kremenchuk . On 18 September , Gollob was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) for 42 victories . On 19 September 1941 , II .

 On 30 September 1941 , the Gruppe was temporarily transferred from the southern sector of the Eastern Front . Their new area of operation was <unk> , approximately 40 km ( 25 mi ) southeast of Roslavl . The Gruppe was then subordinated to the II . Fliegerkorps ( 2nd Air Corps ) under the command of General der Flieger Bruno Loerzer and was part of the preparations for Operation Taifun , the planned assault on Moscow . All available German forces were concentrated under the command of Generalfeldmarschall Fedor von Bock 's Heeresgruppe Mitte ( Army Group Centre ) for the attack which began on 2 October 1941 . In the first days of this campaign , II . Gruppe supported the advance northeast by Panzergruppe 4 ( 4th Panzer Group ) and the 4 . Armee ( 4th Army ) towards Vyazma and <unk> . Predominantly flying escort missions for Ju 87 dive bombers and combat air patrols over the battle zone east of Desna , Gollob claimed one enemy aircraft shot down on 4 October and two more the following day , including his 50th aerial victory over a I @-@ 61 . 
 Gollob claimed two Pe @-@ 2s shot down on 6 October , the first at 10 : 15 and the second two hours later . The following day , he was victorious over two further Pe @-@ 2s and one Il @-@ 2 , taking his total to 56 aerial victories . On that night , the first snow fell , worsening road conditions . By 9 October German units had encircled major Soviet forces in two separate pockets at Vyazma and Bryansk . In support of German ground forces , II . Gruppe detached a Schwärme — two pairs of two fighter aircraft — to a forward airfield at <unk> , approximately 100 km ( 62 mi ) south of Bryansk . From 9 to 11 October the air elements operated from the Kirov and Oryol airfields , which had been captured by German forces on 3 October . Operating from these airfields , Gollob claimed his 57th and 58th victories on 10 October , both aircraft were I @-@ 61s shot down at 12 : 40 and 12 : 43 . The missions on 11 October 1941 were II . Gruppe 's last in support of Operation Taifun . Orders had been received to transfer the air element and a small technical ground crew detachment , which was airlifted by several Ju 52s to <unk> . From there , the Gruppe participated in the Crimean Campaign , the conquest of the Crimean peninsula . The transfer began on 13 October , but due to bad weather conditions , it was only completed on 16 October . At <unk> , the Gruppe was placed under the command of the Geschwaderstab ( headquarters unit ) of Jagdgeschwader 77 ( JG 77 — 77th Fighter Wing ) . 
 The first missions over the battle zone in front of Perekop and over the Crimea were flown on 17 October 1941 , either flying Ju 87 escort missions or combat air patrols . On two separate missions that day , Gollob claimed two I @-@ 61s and one I @-@ 16 shot down . On 18 October 1941 , the 11 . Armee ( 11th Army ) began its attack on the Isthmus of Perekop and <unk> . II . Gruppe flew a number of combat air patrols that day and reported 16 aerial victories for the loss of two Bf 109s damaged in combat . Gollob alone accounted for nine of these 16 claimed victories . This was the third time he had become an " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " and was the most successful day of his combat career . During the course of three combat missions , he increased his personal score to 70 . That day he filed a claim for nine I @-@ 61s shot down , two at 07 : 18 and 07 : 20 , five more at 10 : 05 , 10 : 07 , 10 : 19 , 10 : 20 and 10 : 29 and two more at 14 : 46 and 14 : 48 .

The next day , he was credited with one further I @-@ 61 , taking his total to 76 victories . Two days later , on 22 October , Gollob made " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " for the fifth time and surpassed eighty victories . That day he claimed three I @-@ 16s , one Pe @-@ 2 and one I @-@ 61 . One day later , he claimed three aerial victories , all I @-@ 61s , and on 24 October , he was credited with his 85th victory after he shot down a I @-@ 153 . Following this streak of 37 aerial victories in October 1941 , he was mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht , a propaganda radio report , the first of three such mentions , on 25 October 1941 . The following day , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub ) after reaching 85 victories . He was the 38th member of the German armed forces to be so honored . Gollob , together with Oberleutnant <unk> Graf von <unk> , received the Oak Leaves from Adolf Hitler personally at the Wolf 's Lair , Hitler 's headquarters in Rastenburg , present @-@ day Kętrzyn in Poland , on 5 November 1941 . 
 On 31 October 1941 , II . Gruppe flew its last combat missions over the northern Crimea . The Gruppe was then ordered to return to Germany , to be stationed at the Wiesbaden @-@ <unk> airfield where it arrived in early November . Prior to departure , all of the remaining aircraft where handed over to III . Gruppe of JG 77 . Since the start of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941 , II . Gruppe had claimed 504 aerial victories for the loss of ten pilots killed or missing in action , and a further nine pilots who had been injured . In addition , 27 aircraft were lost or damaged beyond repair , a further 21 aircraft received heavy damaged and another 27 were lightly damaged . On 20 November 1941 , Gollob was again posted to the test facility Erprobungstelle Rechlin . Gollob was replaced by Hauptmann Karl @-@ Heinz <unk> as commander of II . Gruppe of JG 3 . At Rechlin , he flew numerous test and comparison flights with the latest version of the Bf 109 and Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft , as well as a variety of types which never went beyond a prototype variant .

 In early 1942 , the General der Jagdflieger ( General of Fighters ) , Oberst ( Colonel ) Adolf Galland recommended Gollob for the Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) position of JG 77 . Subsequently Gollob was sent to the Geschwaderstab of Jagdgeschwader 54 ( JG 54 — 54th Fighter Wing ) as a commander @-@ in @-@ training under Major Hannes Trautloft . On 1 May 1942 , Gollob was officially appointed Geschwaderkommodore of JG 77 , replacing Major Gotthard Handrick . He took operational command of the Geschwader after he arrived on 16 May 1942 . On the same day of his arrival , Gollob flew his first combat mission as Geschwaderkommodore . That day , he claimed his aerial victories 87 to 89 , shooting down three Lavochkin @-@ Gorbunov @-@ Gudkov LaGG @-@ 3 fighter aircraft .

 JG 77 had been given the task of supporting the German ground forces in the Crimean Campaign over the Kerch Strait on the Crimean Peninsula . An anonymous JG 77 pilot described Gollob 's methods ; " Gollob flew from Kerch together with his wingman . They positioned themselves at a low altitude beneath a Soviet formation . Then they started climbing in spirals , carefully maintaining their position beneath the enemy formation . Before the peacefully flying Soviets had even suspected any mischief , the two planes at the bottom of their formation had been shot down and the two Germans were gone . " On 18 May 1942 , Gollob claimed his 94th to 96th aerial victories over Kerch and the Caucasus coast ; all three were Polikarpov R @-@ 5 reconnaissance bombers . JG 77 , led by Gollob , and its I. Gruppe , led by Hauptmann Heinrich Bär , were engaged in an intense rivalry , each striving to outperform the other , and both eager to achieve the century mark first . Bär claimed his 100th aerial victory on 19 May . That day , Gollob claimed three more R @-@ 5 shot down , taking his total to 99 aerial victories . One day later , on 20 May 1942 , Gollob shot down two aircraft , a DB @-@ 3 and a LaGG @-@ 3 , and thereby exceeded 100 aerial victories . He was the 10th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark . This achievement earned him his second mention in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report on Saturday 20 June 1942 . 
 On 7 June 1942 , German and Romanian forces began Operation <unk> ( Sturgeon Catch ) , the second assault on the port city Sevastopol , which resulted in its capture on 4 July 1942 . On the first day of this operation , Gollob claimed his 102nd victory , a LaGG @-@ 3 shot down over Sevastopol . The attack on Sevastopol was still making slow progress on 9 June , largely due to the artillery deployed within the fortress . Over the battle zone , Gollob claimed a I @-@ 153 shot down that day . Gollob did not claim any further victories until 18 June . The fighting over Sevastopol was still ongoing and Gollob claimed a Il @-@ 2 and a LaGG @-@ 3 over the southern sector of Sevastopol . These two victories took his total to 105 . On 21 June 1942 , Gollob was credited with two victories over LaGG @-@ 3 fighter aircraft . For this achievement , on 23 June , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern ) , after his score had increased to 107 aerial victories . This was the 13th presentation of this award . On 1 July 1942 , he was promoted to Major . 
 On 22 July 1942 , the Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 52 ( JG 52 — 52nd Fighter Wing ) , Major Herbert Ihlefeld , was severely injured in a flight accident and had to surrender command during his convalescence . At the time , all three Gruppen of JG 77 were lent out to other units , and Gollob had time to spare , so temporarily took over command of JG 52 as acting Geschwaderkommodore . On this or one of the following days , he departed and flew to the Geschwaderstab of JG 52 . On 28 June 1942 , the Wehrmacht had initiated Fall Blau ( Case Blue ) , the 1942 strategic summer offensive in southern Russia . The objective was to secure the oil fields of Baku as well as an advance in the direction of Stalingrad along the Volga River , to cover the flanks of the advance towards Baku . Tasked with aerial support of this offensive was Luftflotte 4 to which JG 52 was subordinated . By the time Gollob joined the Geschwader in late July 1942 , the offensive had been renamed Operation Braunschweig and JG 52 was located at Rostov @-@ on @-@ Don . Gollob claimed his first victory with the Stab of JG 52 on 26 July 1942 , a I @-@ 16 and his 108th in total . The next day , he shot down two I @-@ 153 biplane fighters . He claimed the first aerial victory of August 1942 , his last month of combat operations , on 4 August over a Yakovlev Yak @-@ 1 fighter aircraft . He was then credited with four victories on 6 August , two Il @-@ 2 , one Yak @-@ 1 and one R @-@ 5 took his score to 115 aerial victories . He claimed one Yak @-@ 1 on each of the next two days . On 14 August , he was credited with two LaGG @-@ 3 and one Douglas A @-@ 20 Havoc , referred to as a Boston . For the last time in his combat career , Gollob achieved " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " for the sixth time on 16 August 1941 . That day he claimed two LaGG @-@ 3 , two I @-@ 16 and one Il @-@ 2 . His success as a fighter pilot continued , as he shot down two LaGG @-@ 3 on 17 August , three I @-@ 16 on 18 August , and two Il @-@ 2 and a I @-@ 153 on 19 August , taking his overall total to 133 aerial victories . 
 Following three victories on 20 August , two I @-@ 153 and a I @-@ 16 , Gollob shot down two Bostons on 22 August . On 24 August 1941 , he took his total to 142 aerial victories by claiming three LaGG @-@ 3 and one Boston . Over the course of the next four days , he scored one victory on each day , a Boston on 25 August , a Pe @-@ 2 on 26 August , a I @-@ 16 on 27 August , and another Boston on 28 August . After three victories over LaGG @-@ 3s and one Pe @-@ 2 on 29 August 1942 , he reached 150 aerial victories and became the Luftwaffe 's highest scoring pilot at that point . For this he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves , Swords and Diamonds ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub , Schwertern und Brillanten ) on 30 August . Gollob was the third member of the Wehrmacht and the third fighter pilot who had received this award . Fearing he would be lost in combat , Hitler imposed a flying ban on him . The next day , he was again mentioned in the Wehrmachtbericht radio report , his third and last of such mentions . Der Adler , a biweekly Nazi propaganda magazine published by the Luftwaffe , also reported his actions in volume 19 of 1942 . On 30 September 1942 , Gollob was officially replaced in command of JG 77 by Hauptmann Joachim Müncheberg . Gollob was then posted to the Stab of Jagdfliegerführer 3 ( Jafü 3 — 3rd Fighter Pilot Leader ) at Brest @-@ <unk> on the English Channel Front . 
 = = = High command = = = 
 On 15 October 1942 , Gollob was made Jagdfliegerführer 3 , responsible for tactical fighter command over northwestern France . Jagdfliegerführer 3 was renamed Jagdfliegerführer 5 ( Jafü 5 — 5th Fighter Pilot Leader ) on 6 September 1943 . In this command position , he was promoted to Oberstleutnant ( lieutenant colonel ) on 20 April 1943 , effective as of 1 April , and to Oberst on 1 May 1944 . When he became Jafü 5 he frequently submitted reports to his superiors at the 5 . Jagd @-@ Division ( 5th Fighter Division ) about the suitability of the Bf 109 on the Western Front . He indicated that in its present state the Bf 109 G @-@ 3 to G @-@ 6 were no longer adequate for service in the West and that the Fw 190 and Bf 109 were inferior to enemy aircraft . Learning about the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet @-@ powered aircraft , Gollob became a strong advocate of it and its employment as fighter aircraft . Hitler had become interested in the idea of using the Me 262 in a fighter @-@ bomber role , which contributed to the delays in preparing the aircraft for operational readiness as an interceptor . 
 In April 1944 , Gollob was transferred to the personal staff of General der Jagdflieger Galland , to advise on the development of the Me 262 jet and Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket aircraft projects . Gollob quarrelled with Galland in September and was transferred to Kommando der <unk> ( headquarters of test units ) , which two years previously had been put under the command of Oberst Edgar Petersen . Gollob was also involved in the development and testing of the Neptun " J " airborne radar and air @-@ to @-@ air rockets , such as the <unk> . In November 1944 , Gollob was appointed commander of the Jäger @-@ Sonderstab — or special fighter command — for the Ardennes offensive and the ill @-@ fated Operation Bodenplatte . 
 Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler had suggested to Hitler that he appoint Gollob as General der Jagerflieger . Himmler 's intervention in Luftwaffe affairs had been an irritation to Reichsmarschall ( Marshal of the Reich ) Hermann Göring , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe ( Air Force High Command ) . Himmler had ambitions to expand his influence and power base into the Luftwaffe . One aspect of this was to put jet fighter units under control of the SS and later , Göring ordered Galland to prepare a report on Gollob . Galland 's conclusion was that Gollob required close supervision in a responsible post . In early January 1945 , Göring summoned Gollob to Karinhall , Göring 's estate northeast of Berlin , and read out selected excerpts from Galland 's report to him and Gollob became infuriated with Galland . Göring then ordered Galland to Karinhall and informed him of his dismissal . During the meeting , Göring postponed his decision as to what position Galland would receive and sent Galland on vacation . News of Galland 's dismissal soon spread , leading to the failed Fighter Pilots ' Revolt , an insurrection of a small group of high @-@ ranking Luftwaffe pilots , including Oberst Johannes Steinhoff who after the war became Chairman of the NATO Military Committee , aimed at re @-@ instating Galland as General der Jagerflieger . On 31 January 1945 , Gollob was officially appointed as General der Jagerflieger . 
 In his new role , Gollob worked with General der Flieger Josef Kammhuber , responsible for fighting against the enemy four @-@ engined bombers , and SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Hans Kammler , responsible for air armament and manufacturing of the Me 262 . Gollob 's objective was to deploy and arm the Me 262 as a defensive weapon against the Allied air offensive . Hitler 's decision to use the Me 262 in a fighter bomber role had not been revised . Gollob gathered data and hoped to meet Hitler in order to convince him that the Me 262 was better suited as a fighter aircraft and not as a fighter bomber , but this meeting never occurred . On 7 April 1945 , frustrated over the lack of progress made , Gollob submitted his written request to be released from office as General der Jagerflieger , but the request was not approved by Göring . Gollob left Berlin on 10 April 1945 after his staff had left for southern Germany . At that time he needed urgent hospitalization to treat his appendicitis . Gollob underwent surgery by Prof. Dr. <unk> Breitner at a hospital in Igls , in the present @-@ day a borough of Innsbruck , eight days after his departure from Berlin . On 24 April , he was transferred to the Luftwaffe hospital at Kitzbühel , which was in the middle of the so called <unk> ( Alpine Fortress ) . At Kitzbühel , he met with the last Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Luftwaffe , Generalfeldmarschall Greim and the female pilot Hanna Reitsch . Greim was convalescing from an injury sustained during a flight by Reitsch into the encircled city of Berlin on 26 April . At Kitzbühel , Gollob was taken prisoner of war by elements of the 36th Infantry Division of the United States Army under the command of General John E. Dahlquist . Shortly after , he was transferred into the custody of the US 42nd Infantry Division commanded by Major General Harry J. Collins . 
 = = Prisoner of war and later life = = 
 On 1 June 1945 , Gollob , who had been released on parole , was arrested at his home by the Austrian Gendarmerie acting for the US authorities . From Kitzbühel , he was taken via Pass Strub , and other internment camps , to Ludwigsburg in Württemberg , and then flown to England . In England , he was held at Latimer and interrogated at the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre regarding combat operations . He was released by US forces in 1946 and was then imprisoned by the French , as his home region of North Tyrol had become part of the French Occupation Zone . After finally being released from captivity , Gollob made a living as a contributor to aircraft magazines and lecturing . In 1948 , he became General Secretary of the Federation of Independents ( VDU — Verband der <unk> ) , an Austrian political party . In 1950 , the VDU dismissed Gollob from the party following the internal strife between the more liberal approach of the founders Herbert Kraus and Viktor Reimann and the German nationalist faction centered on Gollob . 
 Gollob and his wife Elisabeth Lüning , had married on 14 February 1943 , and had two sons and a daughter . Their first son , Ulrik , was born on 30 November 1943 in Kitzbühel , their second son , Gerald was born on 9 January 1946 , also in Kitzbühel , and their daughter Cornelia was born on 16 March 1954 in Sulingen . Following his dismissal from the VDU , the family had moved to his wife 's hometown of Sulingen . There , from November 1951 , he started working in a sales role for the Klöckner Humboldt Deutz AG , a company making motors and vehicles . Until a myocardial infarction impeded his health in 1975 , he regularly flew powered and glider aircraft . Gollob died in Sulingen , <unk> , Lower Saxony on 7 September 1987 .

 = Rusty Kuntz = 
 Russell Jay Kuntz ( / <unk> / ; born February 4 , 1955 ) is a retired American Major League Baseball ( MLB ) outfielder . He played for the Chicago White Sox , Minnesota Twins and Detroit Tigers between 1979 and 1985 . He never appeared in more than 84 games in any season during his playing career . In the final game of the 1984 World Series , Kuntz hit a pop fly to the second baseman that became the deciding run batted in ( RBI ) . 
 Kuntz grew up in Kansas and California , playing three sports in high school and community college . He went to the Division III World Series twice with California State University , Stanislaus before being selected by the White Sox in the 11th round of the 1977 MLB Draft . After the 1984 season , Kuntz was unable to return to form the next year . He was demoted to the minor leagues early in the 1985 season and was out of professional baseball as a player shortly thereafter . 
 Since his playing career ended , Kuntz has worked with several MLB organizations , including the Houston Astros , Seattle Mariners , Florida Marlins , Kansas City Royals , Atlanta Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates . He has worked as an assistant to the general manager , minor league coach , roving instructor and major league base coach . Since 2012 , he has served as the first base coach for the Kansas City Royals , and has received substantial praise for his contributions to the team 's success during that period . " Rusty Kuntz , " Royals manager Ned Yost has said , " is the best first base coach in baseball . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kuntz was born on February 4 , 1955 in Orange , California . He was born to Chet and Willie Kuntz . His father was a bricklayer who later became an auto mechanic . The family moved from Orange to Wichita , Kansas when Rusty was young , then moved to Paso Robles , California a few years later . He attended Paso Robles High School in California , where he played baseball , basketball , and football . He said that baseball was his least favorite of the three sports at the time and that he was drawn to basketball because of the game 's pace . 
 Continuing his education , Kuntz attended Cuesta College and California State University , Stanislaus . At Cuesta College , Kuntz played center field on the baseball team , quarterbacked the football team and was the center on the basketball team . After hitting for .402 and .442 batting averages in two seasons at Cuesta , Kuntz 's father encouraged him to focus on baseball . At CSU Stanislaus , Kuntz played on two teams that went to the Division III World Series . He was later inducted into the university 's Warrior Athletics Hall of Fame . Kuntz was drafted by the Chicago White Sox as the first pick in the 11th round of the 1977 MLB Draft . 
 Kuntz played 51 games for the rookie @-@ level Gulf Coast League White Sox in the 1977 season . He hit for .287 as the team finished first in the Gulf Coast League standings . The next season , Kuntz was promoted to the Class AA team , the Knoxville Sox . He bypassed the Class A affiliate because the Knoxville center fielder was suffering from migraine headaches , and he won the starting center field position . He hit .263 for Knoxville with 10 home runs in 113 games ; the team was managed by Tony <unk> for part of the season and won first place in the Southern League . Starting the 1979 season with Chicago 's Class AAA affiliate , the Iowa Oaks , Kuntz played 122 games , batted .294 and hit 15 home runs in 394 at bats .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Kuntz stood 6 feet 3 inches ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) and weighed 190 pounds ( 86 kg ) during his playing career . He batted and threw right @-@ handed . Kuntz made his MLB debut with the White Sox on September 1 , 1979 . He spent all of the 1980 and 1981 seasons with the White Sox , but he was used sparingly , registering less than 120 plate appearances in the two seasons combined . He started 1982 in the minor leagues with the Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League , hitting .269 with 7 home runs and 34 RBI in 193 at bats . He walked 50 times in 249 plate appearances for Edmonton . He was called back up to the major league team near the end of that season . 
 He was traded to the Minnesota Twins in June 1983 , with the White Sox receiving minor leaguer Mike <unk> in exchange . He was traded to the Detroit Tigers for pitcher Larry <unk> after the 1983 season . The <unk> @-@ Kuntz trade was prompted because future Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Kirby Puckett was playing in the minor leagues for Minnesota 's Class AA affiliate and was expected to quickly join the Twins as an impact player . In 1984 with Detroit , Kuntz had the best numbers of his career : a .286 average and a .393 on @-@ base percentage . He appeared in a career @-@ high 84 major league games that season , mostly as a pinch @-@ hitter and outfielder . 
 = = = 1984 World Series = = = 
 In the fifth and deciding game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres , Kuntz pinch @-@ hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb with the bases loaded and the score tied at three . Kuntz hit a pop @-@ up to short right field that Tony Gwynn was unable to see . Second baseman Alan Wiggins made the catch , but was unable to prevent Kirk Gibson from racing home from third with the go @-@ ahead run . The Tigers maintained their lead after that , giving Kuntz an unlikely game @-@ winning RBI . 
 The 1984 American League Championship Series and the ensuing World Series represented Kuntz 's only career postseason appearances . In a 2010 Baseball Prospectus article , Steven Goldman wrote that the 1984 Tigers were " a great team that relied on a lot of fluke elements ... The club had no regular first baseman , no regular third baseman , and the primary left fielder hit .239 / .302 / .342 against right @-@ handers . The club made up for this in part by getting terrific production out of role players like Ruppert Jones , Johnny Grubb , and Rusty Kuntz , players who wouldn 't synch up again ... " 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Kuntz returned to the Tigers in 1985 but appeared in just five games ( last on April 24 , 1985 ) before being sent back to the minor leagues . After batting .222 for Detroit 's AAA affiliate , the Nashville Sounds , he was released by the Detroit organization . He signed with the Oakland Athletics a couple of months later , but he did not play any games with them . Kuntz retired as a player with 277 games played , a .236 career batting average , 5 home runs and 38 RBI . 
 = = Post @-@ playing career = = 
 Kuntz was out of baseball in 1986 , working for the United Parcel Service . He worked as a coach in the Houston Astros organization during the 1987 and 1988 seasons , then moved to the Seattle Mariners . With Seattle , he served as a first @-@ base coach between 1989 and 1992 . Kuntz joined the Florida Marlins organization in 1993 as a minor league baserunning and outfield coach . He became the team 's first @-@ base coach after the 1994 season . In 1997 , Kuntz moved into a role as roving instructor with the Marlins organization . In August of that year he worked on defensive skills with Gary Sheffield when the major league slugger was struggling with injuries . 
 In late 2000 , Kuntz decided not to return to his role as first @-@ base coach and outfield instructor . Instead , he went back to his position as a roving instructor with the team , which allowed for more time to be spent with his family . At that time , Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching . Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued . Floyd said , " " I don 't know what I 'm going to do . I 'm telling you , he 's meant everything . He tells me about every pitcher we 're facing . He keeps me going when I 'm down . You don 't get that too often in this game . You 're expected just to be strong , handle everything . But it ain 't that easy sometimes . He 's a players ' man . He loves us . " 
 Kuntz was dismissed from his position with the Marlins before spring training in 2002 . The move was part of a mass firing of Marlins personnel in player development and scouting after the team 's change in ownership . Kuntz , who was paid for the 2002 season in any case due to the terms of his contract , kept a job working on the grounds crew at the team 's spring training site . He had performed ground crew duties at the site for several years in the offseasons . Late in the 2002 season , the Atlanta Braves hired Kuntz as a roving instructor . After the season , he was hired by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first @-@ base coach . In October 2005 , the Pirates offered minor league positions to Kuntz and fellow coaches Gerald Perry and Alvaro Espinoza . He spent the next two seasons coaching between the Class AAA Indianapolis Indians and the major league club . 
 After the 2007 season , the Kansas City Royals named him their first @-@ base coach . In October 2009 , the team reassigned him , designating him field instructor and special assistant to the team 's general manager , Dayton Moore . In August 2012 , he was named the Royals ' first base coach after the dismissal of Doug Sisson . Sisson had replaced Kuntz as the Royals ' first base coach after the 2010 season . At the conclusion of the 2012 season , the Royals announced that they would retain Kuntz for the 2013 season . In a January 2014 article , the Boston Globe listed Kuntz as one of the baserunning / outfield coaches who had the most respect among his peers in the major leagues . " Kuntz ’ s outfielders are fundamentally sound and get great jumps on balls . Kuntz has been able to improve arm accuracy " . 
 = = Personal = = 
 Kuntz 's son Kevin was drafted by the Royals in the 2009 MLB Draft but he chose to play baseball at the University of Kansas . He was selected again by the Royals in the 28th round of the 2013 MLB Draft . Kevin spent the 2013 season in the minor leagues at the team 's rookie @-@ level affiliate , the Burlington Royals . 
 The coach 's name has been the subject of some media coverage . A 2010 Bleacher Report article said that his name was " hands down the best name ever . So many jokes , so little time . " In April 2013 , The Big Lead wrote about the name after a photo depicted Kuntz standing to the right of White Sox first baseman Paul Konerko and Royals baserunner Chris Getz . The resulting image seemed to display the phrase " Konerko Getz Kuntz " on the backs of their uniform jerseys . 
 = Pelvic inflammatory disease = 
 Pelvic inflammatory disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder ( PID ) is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus , fallopian tubes , and ovaries , and inside of the pelvis . Often there may be no symptoms . Signs and symptoms , when present may include lower abdominal pain , vaginal discharge , fever , burning with urination , pain with sex , or irregular menstruation . Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility , ectopic pregnancy , chronic pelvic pain , and cancer . 
 The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix . Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases . Often multiple different bacteria are involved . Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID . Risk factors are similar to those of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use . Vaginal douching may also increase the risk . The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms . It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain . A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery . Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis . 
 Efforts to prevent the disease include not having sex or having few sexual partners and using condoms . Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID . If the diagnosis is suspected , treatment is typically advised . Treating a woman 's sexual partners should also occur . In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended . For those who do not improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used . 
 Globally about 106 million cases of chlamydia and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008 . The number of cases of PID however , is not clear . It is estimated to affect about 1 @.@ 5 percent of young women yearly . In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly . A type of intrauterine device ( IUD ) known as the <unk> shield led to increased rates of PID in the 1970s . Current IUDs are not associated with this problem after the first month . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Symptoms in PID range from none to severe . If there are symptoms , then fever , cervical motion tenderness , lower abdominal pain , new or different discharge , painful intercourse , uterine tenderness , <unk> tenderness , or irregular menstruation may be noted . 
 Other complications include endometritis , <unk> , <unk> @-@ ovarian abscess , pelvic peritonitis , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 = = Cause = = 
 Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are usually the main cause of PID . Data suggest that PID is often <unk> . Isolated anaerobes and facultative microorganisms have been obtained from the upper genital tract . N. gonorrhoeae has been isolated from fallopian tubes , facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues . 
 The anatomical structure of the internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum . The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of PID . 
 N. gonorrhoea and C. trachomatis are the most common organisms . The least common were infections caused exclusively by anaerobes and facultative organisms . <unk> and facultative bacteria were also isolated from 50 percent of the patients from whom Chlamydia and Neisseria were recovered ; thus , anaerobes and facultative bacteria were present in the upper genital tract of nearly two @-@ thirds of the PID patients . PCR and serological tests have associated extremely fastidious organism with endometritis , PID , and tubal factor infertility . Microorganisms associated with PID are listed below . 
 = = = Bacteria involved = = = 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Upon a pelvic examination , cervical motion , uterine , or <unk> tenderness will be experienced . <unk> <unk> and or <unk> may be observed . In severe cases more testing may be required such as <unk> , intra @-@ abdominal bacteria sampling and culturing , or tissue biopsy . 
 <unk> can visualize " violin @-@ string " adhesions , characteristic of Fitz @-@ Hugh – Curtis <unk> and other <unk> that may be present . 
 Other imaging methods , such as <unk> , computed tomography ( CT ) , and magnetic imaging ( MRI ) , can aid in diagnosis . Blood tests can also help identify the presence of infection : the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , the C @-@ reactive protein ( CRP ) level , and chlamydial and <unk> DNA probes . 
 <unk> acid amplification tests ( <unk> ) , direct fluorescein tests ( DFA ) , and <unk> linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) are highly sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present . Serology testing for antibodies is not as useful since the presence of the microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels , although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long term . 
 Definitive criteria include histopathologic evidence of endometritis , thickened filled Fallopian tubes , or laparoscopic findings . Gram stain / smear becomes definitive in the identification of rare , atypical or and possibly more serious organisms . Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID , however even asymptomatic PID can cause serious harm . 
 <unk> identification is helpful in diagnosing tubal disease ; a 65 percent to 90 percent positive predictive value exists in patients with presumed PID . 
 Upon gynecologic ultrasound , a potential finding is <unk> @-@ ovarian complex , which is <unk> and dilated pelvic structures as evidenced by vague margins , but without abscess formation . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 A number of other causes may produce similar symptoms including appendicitis , ectopic pregnancy , hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cysts , ovarian torsion , and endometriosis and gastroenteritis , peritonitis , and bacterial vaginosis among others . 
 Pelvic inflammatory disease is more likely to reoccur when there is a prior history of the infection , recent sexual contact , recent onset of menses , or an IUD ( intrauterine device ) in place or if the partner has a sexually transmitted infection . 
 Acute pelvic inflammatory disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used . A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy . <unk> will differentiate <unk> ( ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst ) from pelvic sepsis ( <unk> , ruptured pelvic abscess , or ruptured appendix ) . 
 Pelvic and vaginal ultrasounds are helpful in the diagnosis of PID . In the early stages of infection , the ultrasound may appear normal . As the disease progresses , nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid , endometrial thickening , uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas . In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct . Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID . 
 <unk> is infrequently used to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease since it is not readily available . Moreover , it might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes , and it fails to detect endometritis . Nevertheless , laparoscopy is conducted if the diagnosis is not certain or if the person has not responded to antibiotic therapy after 48 hours . 
 No single test has adequate sensitivity and specificity to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease . A large <unk> U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases the sensitivity of the CDC diagnostic criteria from 83 percent to 95 percent . However , even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with subclinical disease . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 Regular testing for sexually transmitted infections is encouraged for prevention . The risk of contracting pelvic inflammatory disease can be reduced by the following : 
 Using barrier methods such as condoms ; see human sexual behavior for other listings . 
 Seeking medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of PID . 
 Using hormonal combined contraceptive pills also helps in reducing the chances of PID by thickening the cervical mucosal plug & hence preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower genital tract . 
 Seeking medical attention after learning that a current or former sex partner has , or might have had a sexually transmitted infection . 
 Getting a STI history from your current partner and strongly encouraging they be tested and treated before intercourse . 
 Diligence in avoiding vaginal activity , particularly intercourse , after the end of a pregnancy ( delivery , miscarriage , or abortion ) or certain gynecological procedures , to ensure that the cervix closes . 
 Sexual monogamy that restricts sexual activities to two ' virgins ' or partners remaining sexually exclusive with each other and having no outside sex partners . 
 Abstinence 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Treatment is often started without confirmation of infection because of the serious complications that may result from delayed treatment . Treatment depends on the infectious agent and generally involves the use of antibiotic therapy . If there is no improvement within two to three days , the patient is typically advised to seek further medical attention . Hospitalization sometimes becomes necessary if there are other complications . Treating sexual partners for possible STIs can help in treatment and prevention . 
 For women with PID of mild to moderate severity , parenteral and oral therapies appear to be effective . It does not matter to their short- or long @-@ term outcome whether antibiotics are administered to them as inpatients or outpatients . Typical regimens include <unk> or <unk> plus doxycycline , and clindamycin plus <unk> . An alternative parenteral regimen is ampicillin / <unk> plus doxycycline . Another alternative is to use a parenteral regimen with ceftriaxone or <unk> plus doxycycline . Clinical experience guides decisions regarding transition from parenteral to oral therapy , which usually can be initiated within 24 – 48 hours of clinical improvement . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 Even when the PID infection is cured , effects of the infection may be permanent . This makes early identification essential . Treatment resulting in cure is very important in the prevention of damage to the reproductive system . Formation of scar tissue due to one or episodes of PID can lead to tubal blockage , increasing the risk of the inability to get pregnant and long @-@ term pelvic / abdominal pain . Since certain occurrences such as a post pelvic operation , the period of time immediately after childbirth ( postpartum ) , miscarriage or abortion increases the risk of acquiring another infection leading to PID . 
 = = = Complications = = = 
 PID can cause scarring inside the reproductive system , which can later cause serious complications , including chronic pelvic pain , infertility , ectopic pregnancy ( the leading cause of pregnancy @-@ related deaths in adult females ) , and other complications of pregnancy . Occasionally , the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation and the formation of scar tissue on the external surface of the liver ( Fitz @-@ Hugh – Curtis syndrome ) . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Globally about 106 million cases of chlamydia and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008 . The number of cases of PID ; however , is not clear . It is estimated to affect about 1 @.@ 5 percent of young women yearly . In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly . Rates are highest with teenagers and first time mothers . PID causes over 100 @,@ 000 women to become infertile in the US each year . 
 = Phellinus ellipsoideus = 
 Phellinus ellipsoideus ( formerly Fomitiporia ellipsoidea ) is a species of polypore fungus in the family <unk> , a specimen of which produced the largest fungal fruit body ever recorded . Found in China , the fruit bodies produced by the species are brown , woody basidiocarps that grow on dead wood , where the fungus feeds as a saprotroph . The basidiocarps are perennial , allowing them to grow very large under favourable circumstances . They are resupinate , measuring 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) or more in length , though typically extending less than a centimetre from the surface of the wood . P. ellipsoideus produces distinct ellipsoidal spores , after which it is named , and unusual setae . These two features allow it to be readily differentiated microscopically from other , similar species . Chemical compounds isolated from the species include several steroidal compounds . These may have pharmacological applications , but further research is needed . 
 The species was named in 2008 by Bao @-@ Kai Cui and Yu @-@ Cheng Dai based on collections made in Fujian Province . It was placed in the genus Fomitiporia , but later analysis suggests that it is more closely related to Phellinus species . It was revealed in 2011 that a very large fruit body , measuring up to 1 @,@ 085 cm ( 427 in ) in length , had been found on Hainan Island . The specimen , which was 20 years old , was estimated to weigh between 400 and 500 kilograms ( 880 and 1 @,@ 100 lb ) . This was markedly larger than the previously largest recorded fungal fruit body , a specimen of <unk> <unk> found in the United Kingdom that had a circumference of 425 cm ( 167 in ) . The findings were formally published in September 2011 , but attracted international attention from the mainstream press prior to this . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogenetics = = 
 The species was first described in 2008 by Bao @-@ Kai Cui and Yu @-@ Cheng Dai , both of the Beijing Forestry University . Five specimens of the then @-@ unknown species were collected during field work in the <unk> Nature Reserve ( 27 ° 03 ′ N 118 ° 08 ′ E ) , Jian 'ou , Fujian Province . The pair named the species Fomitiporia ellipsoidea in an article in the journal Mycotaxon . The specific name ellipsoidea is from the Latin meaning " ellipsoid " , and refers to the shape of the spores . Species of the order <unk> , to which this taxon belongs , make up 25 % of the over 700 species of polypore found in China . 
 Phylogenetic analysis of large subunit and internal transcribed spacer DNA sequence data , the results of which were published in 2012 , concluded that the species then known as F. ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus <unk> , P. <unk> @-@ <unk> and the newly described P. <unk> . The four species share morphological characteristics , and form a monophyletic clade . This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P. <unk> than it did with the Fomitiporia type species F. <unk> , and so the authors proposed a transference of F. ellipsoidea to Phellinus , naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus . While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study , MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial . Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway . 
 = = Description = = 
 Phellinus ellipsoideus produces resupinate fruit bodies that are hard and woody , whether fresh or dry . The original description characterized them as measuring up to 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) " or more " in length , 20 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) in width , and extending 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) from the wood on which they grow at their thickest point . The outermost layer is typically yellow to yellowish @-@ brown , measuring 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 in ) in thickness . The shiny surface of the hymenium , the spore @-@ producing section of the fruit body , is covered in pores and ranges in colour from yellow @-@ brown to rust @-@ brown . There are between 5 and 8 pores per millimetre . The tubes are up to 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in depth , have the same colouration as the surface of the hymenium , and are distinctively layered . They are also hard and woody . The very thin yellow @-@ brown layer of flesh measures less than 0 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 02 in ) in width . As with much of the rest of the fruit body , it is firm , solid , and reminiscent of wood . The fruit bodies lack any odour or taste . 
 = = = Microscopic features = = = 
 Phellinus ellipsoideus produces basidiospores that are ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoidal in shape . The spore shape is one of the features that makes the species readily recognisable microscopically , and the spores measure from 4 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 1 by 3 @.@ 5 to 5 micrometres ( μm ) . The average spore length is 5 @.@ 25 μm , while the average width is 4 @.@ 14 μm . The spores have thick cell walls , and are hyaline . They are strongly cyanophilous , meaning that the cell walls will readily absorb methyl blue stain . In addition , they are weakly dextrinoid , meaning that they will stain slightly reddish @-@ brown in Melzer 's reagent or Lugol 's solution . The spores are borne on barrel @-@ shaped basidia , with four spores per basidium , measuring 8 to 12 by 6 to 7 μm . There are also basidioles , which are similar in shape to the basidia , but slightly smaller . 
 In addition to the spore shape , the species is readily identified with the use of a microscope because of its setae . <unk> are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family <unk> , and , in P. ellipsoideus , are found in the hymenium . In shape , the setae are ventricose , with distinctive hooks on their tips . In colour , they are yellow @-@ brown , and they have thick cell walls . They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14 μm . Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles ( underdeveloped cystidia ) can be found in the species , but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the hymenium and the flesh . 
 Most of the tissue of a fungal fruit body is made up of hyphae , which can be of three forms : generative , skeletal and binding . In P. ellipsoideus , the tissue is dominated by skeletal hyphae , but also has generative hyphae ; it lacks binding hyphae . For this reason , the hyphal structure of P. ellipsoideus is referred to as " dimitic " . The hyphae are divided into separate cells by septae , and lack clamp connections . The skeletal hyphae do not react with Melzer 's reagent or Lugol 's solution , and are not cyanophilous . While the hyphae will darken when a solution of potassium hydroxide is applied ( the KOH test ) , they remain otherwise unchanged . 
 The main structure of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination ( mass ) of interwoven skeletal hyphae , which are <unk> to rust @-@ brown . The hyphae are unbranched , forming long tubes 2 to 3 @.@ 6 μm in diameter , enveloping a lumen of variable thickness . There are also hyaline generative hyphae . These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae , and are also septate ( possessing of septa ) , but are sometimes branched . They measure 2 to 3 μm in diameter . The flesh , again , is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae . The thick @-@ walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow @-@ brown to rust brown , and are slightly less agglutinate . The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller ; the skeletal hyphae measure 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 4 μm in diameter , while the generative hyphae measure 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 6 μm in diameter . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 A <unk> species potentially similar to Phellinus ellipsoideus is P. <unk> @-@ <unk> . The latter species shares the hooked hymenial setae and ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal spores . However , details of the fruit body differ , and the spores are hyaline to yellowish , and not dextrinoid . Further , the species is known only from tropical America , where it grows on the Cuban oak . P. <unk> , newly described in 2013 , is not perennial , and has a pale greyish @-@ brown pore surface . The spores are also slightly larger than those of P. ellipsoideus . 
 Phellinus ellipsoideus differs from species of Fomitiporia in two key respects . Its spores are less dextrinoid than those of the genus and their shape is atypical . Other than this , it is typical of the genus , according to the original description . Five species of Fomitiporia , F. <unk> , F. <unk> , F. <unk> , F. <unk> and F. tenuis , share with P. ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium . Despite this , all of them but P. ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae , and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical , which is much more typical of the genus . F. <unk> ( formerly Phellinus <unk> ) has hooked hymenial setae , and the spores are , as with P. ellipsoideus , thick @-@ walled and dextrinoid . The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so , and somewhat larger than those of P. ellipsoideus , measuring 5 @.@ 5 to 7 by 5 to 6 @.@ 5 μm . The species is also known only from tropical America , where it grows on bamboo . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Phellinus ellipsoideus has been recorded growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus <unk> , as well as the wood of other flowering plants . The species favours the trunks of trees , where it feeds as a saprotroph , causing white rot . P. ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers , allowing them to , in the correct circumstances , grow very large . The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China ; it has been recorded in Fujian Province and Hainan Province . It is not a common species , and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered . 
 = = = Largest fruit body = = = 
 In 2010 , Cui and Dai were performing field work in tropical woodland on Hainan Island , China , studying wood @-@ rotting fungi . The pair uncovered a very large P. ellipsoideus fruit body on a fallen Quercus <unk> log , which turned out to be the largest fungal fruit body ever documented . The fruit body was found at an altitude of 958 metres ( 3 @,@ 143 ft ) , in old @-@ growth forest . They were initially unable to identify the specimen as P. ellipsoideus , because of its large size , but tests revealed its identity after samples were taken for analysis . After their initial encounter with the large fruit body , Cui and Dai returned to it on two subsequent occasions , so that they could study it further . Nicholas P. Money , executive editor of Fungal Biology , in which the findings were published , praised the pair for not removing the fruit body , thereby allowing it " to continue its business and to marvel visitors to Hainan Island " . The discovery was formally published in Fungal Biology in September 2011 , but gained attention in the mainstream press worldwide prior to this . 
 The fruit body was 20 years old , and up to 1 @,@ 085 cm ( 35 @.@ 60 ft ) long . It was between 82 and 88 cm ( 32 and 35 in ) wide , and between 4 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 and 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The total volume of the fruit body was somewhere between 409 @,@ 000 and 525 @,@ 000 cubic centimetres ( 25 @,@ 000 and 32 @,@ 000 in3 ) . It was estimated to weigh between 400 and 500 kilograms ( 880 and 1 @,@ 100 lb ) , based on three samples from different areas of the fruit body . The specimen had an average of 49 pores per square millimetre , roughly equivalent to 425 million pores . Money estimated that , based on spore output from other polypore species , the fruit body would be able to release a trillion spores a day . 
 Prior to this discovery , the largest recorded fruit body of any fungus was a specimen of <unk> <unk> , found in Kew Gardens , United Kingdom . It measured 150 by 133 cm ( 59 by 52 in ) in diameter , and had a circumference of 425 cm ( 167 in ) . While the largest individual fruit bodies belong to polypores , individual organisms belonging to certain Armillaria species can grow extremely large . In 2003 , a large specimen of A. solidipes ( synonymous with A. <unk> ) was recorded in the Blue Mountains , Oregon , covering an area of 965 hectares ( 2 @,@ 380 acres ) . At the time , the organism was estimated to be <unk> years old . Prior to this , an A. gallica ( synonymous with A. bulbosa ) organism was the largest recorded , covering 15 hectares ( 37 acres ) , weighing approximately 9 @,@ 700 kilograms ( 21 @,@ 400 lb ) . However , whilst these organisms cover a large area , the individual fruit bodies ( the mushrooms ) are not remarkably large , typically with stems of up to 10 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in height and caps less than 15 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter , weighing from 40 to 100 grams ( 1 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 5 oz ) each . 
 = = Medicinal uses and biochemistry = = 
 The fruit bodies of both Phellinus and Fomitiporia species have seen use in traditional medicine for gastrointestinal cancer and heart disease . P. ellipsoideus fruit bodies are used for medicinal purposes as " <unk> " ( a name which typically refers to P. <unk> ) in the north of Fujian Province . 
 In 2011 , research into the chemistry of P. ellipsoideus was published in the journal <unk> by Cui , along with Hai @-@ Ying Bao and Bao @-@ Kai Liu of the Jilin Agricultural University . The research discussed how several chemical compounds could be isolated from P. ellipsoideus with petroleum ether and ( after <unk> ) chloroform . The nine compounds isolated from these extracts included the common ergosterol and its derivative ergosterol peroxide . Two of the compounds , ergosta @-@ 7 @,@ 22 @,@ 25 @-@ <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ one and benzo [ 1 @,@ 2 @-@ b : 5 @,@ 4 @-@ b ' ] <unk> @-@ 3 @,@ 5 @-@ <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ methyl formate , were new to science . All of these chemicals were steroidal ; such compounds play important physiological roles in cell membranes . P. ellipsoideus has been used as a source of ergosterol for biochemical research . 
 <unk> compounds , like those isolated from P. ellipsoideus , can have pharmacological or taxonomical applications ; for instance , some can act as anti @-@ <unk> ( including ergosterol ) or inhibit tumour growth . The 2011 study concluded that , as P. ellipsoideus contained a large number of diverse steroidal compounds , there may be comparatively high pharmacological activity in the fungus ; however , more research would be needed to confirm this . Later publications echoed this research , claiming that the fungus has " potential medicinal functions " . Research published in 2012 named <unk> A , a natural furan derivative isolated from <unk> extract of P. ellipsoideus fruit bodies . The chemical , methyl 3 @,@ 5 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @,@ 3 @,@ 5 @,@ 7 @-@ <unk> [ 1 @,@ 2 @-@ c : 4 @,@ 5 @-@ c ' ] <unk> @-@ 4 @-@ carboxylate , displayed significant antitumour ability in a mouse model . 
 = Kanak people = 
 Kanak ( French spelling : Kanak since 1984 ; earlier <unk> ) are the indigenous Melanesian inhabitants of New Caledonia , an overseas collectivity of France in the southwest Pacific . According to the 2009 census , they constitute 40 @.@ 3 % of the total population of New Caledonia with 99 @,@ 078 people . Though Melanesian settlement is recorded on Grande Terre 's Presqu 'île de <unk> peninsula as far back as the Lapita culture , the origin of Kanak people is unclear . Ethnographic research has shown that Polynesian seafarers have intermarried with the Kanaks over the centuries . The Kanaks refer to the European inhabitants of New Caledonia as <unk> . 
 New Caledonia was annexed to France in 1853 , and became an overseas territory of France in 1956 . An independence movement led to a failed revolt in 1967 , and was restarted in 1984 , pursuing total independence status from the French rule . A 2014 referendum will decide whether or not the territory will achieve sovereign status . When the 1988 Matignon agreements were signed between the representatives of France and New Caledonia to decide on holding the referendum for independence , Jean @-@ Marie Tjibaou , the Kanak leader of the independence movement , had mooted a proposal to set up an Agency for the Development of Kanak Culture ( ADCK ) . After Tjibaou 's assassination in 1989 , the French President François Mitterrand ordered that a cultural centre on the lines suggested by Tjibaou be set up in Nouméa , the capital of New Caledonia ; it was to be the last of Mitterrand 's Grands <unk> . The Jean @-@ Marie Tjibaou Cultural Centre was formally established in May 1998 . 
 Although ancient Lapita potteries date back to 1500 BC , and the people of the island have long been involved in the arts , since the establishment of the ADCK , Kanak arts and crafts have become more popular in New Caledonia . Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks , ancient gods , serpents and turtles are popular as is flèche <unk> , a carving which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes . Music , dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function and dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word ' Kanak ' is derived from kanaka <unk> , a Hawaiian word which was at one time applied indiscriminately by European explorers , traders and missionaries in Oceania to any non @-@ European Pacific islander . Prior to European contact , there were no unified states in New Caledonia , and no single self @-@ appellation used to refer to its inhabitants . Other words have been coined from Kanak in the past few generations : <unk> is an ethno @-@ political name for the island or the entire territory . <unk> is a musical genre associated with the Kanak , stylistically a form of reggae with added flutes , percussion and harmonies . <unk> often has political lyrics and is sung in <unk> , <unk> or other Melanesian languages , or in French . The word " kanak " is grammatically invariable . The German racial epithet <unk> — which is now applied to all non @-@ whites , even southern Europeans in some cases , and especially to Turkish immigrants — also derives from the same source , and was originally applied to people from German colonial possessions in Oceania . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origin = = = 
 Melanesian settlement on Grande Terre dates back at least as far as the Lapita culture . However , the origin of Kanak people is unclear . Obsidian transported from New Guinea was found with the earliest New Caledonian Lapita pottery . In addition , some researchers have claimed there is evidence of New Caledonian human habitation dating from 3000 BC ( predating Lapita culture by 1500 years ) , while others claim to have found pre @-@ Lapita pottery . At the Fourth Lapita Conference , held in June 2000 , in Canberra , Australia , the question was posed : " Is Lapita Kanak , or is Lapita the oldest and first ancestor of a later culture that is labelled Kanak ? " Still another problem in determining the origin and early history of Kanak people is that the archaeological interpretation is in conflict with the views of Kanak people which have become politicized subsequent to colonial rule . 
 = = = Early colonial rule = = = 
 The earliest history of Europeans arriving on these islands is when Captain Cook of the United Kingdom landed in these islands in 1775 at a time when there were reportedly 70 @,@ 000 Kanaks living in the archipelago . Cook gave the name " New Caledonia " to these islands , after Caledonia , his Scottish highlands . 
 Fifty years later , the Protestants of London Missionary Society came to New Caledonia , which was followed by entry of the French Catholics to the island , in 1843 . This resulted in a conflict between the two religious factions and eventually the French Catholics ' control of the islands prevailed . The island nation was thereafter annexed by France , in 1853 . 
 During the colonial period , in the 19th century , Kanaks were recruited or enslaved , to perform unfree labour in places such as Australia , California , Canada , Chile and Fiji ( with the inter @-@ Asian slave trade to India , Japan , South Africa , and what is now Malaysia ) . During the 3 @,@ 000 years that Kanaks lived in the remote islands , they were unprepared for the arrival of European viruses and bacteria . The Kanaks were uprooted from the land and were employed as forced labour on French plantations , ranches and public works . 
 = = = Revolt = = = 
 When Kanaks were forced to move to reserve areas of the island , closer to the mountains , they occupied only 10 percent of the area of their ancestral territories given that their population had declined so dramatically due to disease , and their living conditions became very hard . This situation arose consequent to induction of 20 @,@ 000 convicts by the French government between 1864 and 1897 , most of whom settled permanently in the country , and who were employed to extract nickel ( beginning with 1864 ) and copper from 1875 onwards . This caused serious resentment among the Kanaks who revolted in 1878 against the French colonial rule , which was suppressed by the French who were better armed . The Kanak leader was decapitated , and his head was put on display in the Museum of Natural History . 
 = = = After World War II = = = 
 After World War II , the Kanak independence movement again picked up momentum when the United Nations placed New Caledonia on its Decolonisation List of Non @-@ Self @-@ Governing Territories in 1946 . A major progression occurred when Kanaks and French settlers in the country obtained voting rights in 1951 , shortly before it became an overseas territory of France in 1956 . The Kanaks were then also allowed to move out of their reserve areas . This was followed by the establishment of the Territorial Assembly in 1957 , but this was short @-@ lived ; Charles de Gaulle abolished it after he became the President of France , in 1958 . 
 = = = Agitation for independence = = = 
 In 1981 the movement for Independence began , following the murder of Pierre Declercq , the secretary general of the Caledonian Union ( French : Union <unk> , UC ) on 19 September 1981 . A national forum titled " Front de Liberation Nationale Kanak <unk> ( FLNKS ) ” was established in 1984 . This forum refused to participate in elections to the Territorial Assembly and even declared its own Provincial Government ; it met with opposition by the French . FLNKS " organized a boycott of the territorial elections in New Caledonia , smashing ballot boxes and setting up roadblocks to prevent people from voting . " The FLNKS persisted with their agitation and unilaterally announced on 7 January 1985 that a referendum on independence would be conducted in July 1985 . After the death of Kanak leader Eloi <unk> in 1985 , Kanak activists took 27 gendarmes hostage on the island of <unk> , igniting a French response . 
 The Kanak movement proposed a self @-@ government in January 1986 . An interim arrangement was announced by Mitterrand who moved to give greater autonomy in the colony . However , the French prime minister Chirac stationed troops in the islands and the autonomy issue was shelved . The FLNKS , backed in their campaign for a referendum by regional organizations such as the " Groupe du fer de lance <unk> " ( the Melanesian Spearhead Group ) , the Pacific Forum , and the <unk> Countries Movement , were successful in getting the UN Resolution 41 @-@ 41 A of 2 December 1986 passed ; it re @-@ inscribed New Caledonia on the Decolonisation List of Non @-@ Self @-@ Governing Territories . But this resolution did not mitigate the violence as what ensued was more confrontations with the authorities : the " <unk> cave hostage taking " resulted in 21 deaths including 19 Kanaks . Following the battle , there was an international outcry that resulted in initiation of talks for settlement between the French government , the Kanaks and the French settlers .

 An agreement called the Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between the French and the Kanaks , which had the majority support of 80 % of the French people .

However , two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement , Jean @-@ Marie Tjibaou and <unk> <unk> , were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist . The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence .

 A subsequent agreement , the " Nouméa Accord " , was signed between the FLNKS President and the French Government on 5 May 1998 , allowing for a degree of autonomy to New Caledonia over a transition period of up to 20 years . A referendum for independence from France is to be held between 2014 and 2019 . Progressive changes that were expected of this agreement were in the local political control and structure ; the Kanaks would have greater say over internal and regional affairs while France would retain sovereign rights including control over military and foreign affairs . In a speech made before the Fourth Commission of the United Nations on 10 October 2005 , the FLNKS Vice President , Léopold <unk> , urged the UN " to establish a monitoring and follow @-@ up system for the previous contracts signed between multinationals and municipalities , by drawing on the initiatives of Global Witness and asking the UN to put in place an ad hoc commission in order to protect the wealth of New Caledonia , following the example of what was done for Congo .

 The Caledonian Union , one of the political parties within the pro @-@ independence FLNKS group had , in 2010 , appealed for a national committee to evaluate progress and prepare New Caledonia for the change in leadership before the planned referendum in 2014 . In this appeal , the UC also argued that , according to the Nouméa Accord , it was obligatory for the French government to train and build the capacity of Kanaks to be able to take over the government in 2014 and urged them to respond swiftly .

 New Caledonia or <unk> des Nouvelle @-@ <unk> et <unk> , is approximately 1 @,@ 200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) off the northeast coast of Australia . Of its 500 islands , the five main ones are inhabited , are spread across an area 30 miles ( 48 km ) wide and over 250 miles ( 400 km ) in length . As of 2009 , the Melanesian Kanak people constituted 40 @.@ 3 % ( 99 @,@ 078 ) of the population of 245 @,@ 580 in New Caledonia , a minority in their ancestral land . The other groups consist of Europeans ( mostly French ) at 29 % , <unk> 9 % , people of mixed ancestry ( 8 % ) , and other groups including Polynesians , Indonesians , Vietnamese and those ( believed to be chiefly of European ancestry ) who identified simply as " Caledonian . " In 1774 , Cook landed in <unk> and estimated a population of around 50 @,@ 000 for the whole island . A minimum of 100 @,@ 000 is more likely , considering the amount of land that can be shown to have been cultivated pre @-@ colonially . This declined to 27 @,@ 000 during early colonial rule as a result of disease . Kanaks were historically associated with tribes , including the <unk> , <unk> , Goa , and <unk> , as well as clans , such as the <unk> . 
 There are significant populations of ethnic Kanaks living in Australia , particularly in sugar cane growing areas in Queensland , where they were brought to work in the fields . There are many social links and intermarriages between these people and local Australian Aboriginal groups . 
 = = = Languages = = = 
 Kanak languages are extremely diverse , and French serves as the official language of New Caledonia . There are 28 distinct Kanak languages , as well as many dialects , out of the 1 @,@ 200 Melanesian languages spoken throughout the Pacific . They are mutually incomprehensible . All are a part of the Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family . They all belong to the New Caledonian subgroup – except for <unk> , which is a Polynesian language . 
 New Caledonia languages are divided into several groups . The Northern language group is tonal and includes 12 languages : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Nemi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Approximately 60 @,@ 000 residents of New Caledonia speak at least one of the Kanak languages . Most of these languages are only in spoken form . There is no one unified language among the Kanaks ; however , the largest group of Kanaks speak <unk> . 
 Coming from an oral tradition , the written word was nonexistent until the missionary arrival . Kanak knowledge was passed orally in the form of poems , legends , and stories . Children 's oral history is provided by parents and other relatives who also use tickling and onomatopoeic noise to hold the child 's attention . Of the Kanak authors , some of the notable ones are Tjibaou who wrote La <unk> Kanak ; Susanna <unk> @-@ Small , a Kanak author from <unk> who wrote about the Matignon Accords ; and <unk> <unk> , author of <unk> – Sayings from the <unk> Valley which provides insight into <unk> legends and is written in <unk> , with English language translation . 
 Tjibaou was involved in the establishment of the Écoles populaires kanak , which was taught in a local Kanak language and educated children in spiritual and practical knowledge , while including French and English language instruction . Since 2006 , pre @-@ school children have been given the opportunity to learn indigenous Kanak languages . While the Kanak languages have been taught in high schools across the Loyalty Islands and North Province , the language education has not been as common in the more European South Province . The establishment of the Kanak Language Academy ( KLA ) was a provision of the Nouméa Accord .

 = = = Traditional beliefs and religion = = = 
 The Kanaks were known to worship their ancestors . This worship was embodied in the sepulchre , sacred stones , and devotional hearths where they offered sacrifices . Today , most Kanaks are Christians . Religion is an important aspect of Kanaks ' life . Kanaks attend the Catholic Church in <unk> and they form nearly 50 percent of the population of Catholics in New Caledonia , next only to the Europeans . Also , the majority of Protestants are Kanaks . However , there are a few who follow traditional beliefs . 
 According to the traditional beliefs of the Kanak people , the sea is sacred as it provides them with " fish for food " , so they treat it with great reverence . The folk stories created by the Kanak people not only attest to this fact but are also strictly followed as unwritten laws . Some of the important aspects of the oral laws relate to environmental protection and conservation , such as the closure of fishing operations when the fish stocks are on the decline , and fishing rights in certain areas are strictly observed with respect to locals . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Following these beliefs and traditions , Kanak people and Conservation International ( CI ) have been jointly involved in conserving the ancestral waters and natural resources . According to a rapid assessment survey conducted with help from the Kanaks , 42 coral reefs have been identified for protection near Nord 's Mont Pani Province . Its rich biodiversity reserves also include sea cucumbers , molluscs , crustaceans , herrings , groupers , and snappers . Supporting Kanak traditions , the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific 's ( <unk> ) partnership with CI provided recommendations and underwater species guides to the Kanak people . In 2004 , a proposal was put forward to promote the entire coastal region as a World Heritage Site . Further work on this initiative has been pursued by CI 's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science , the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific ( <unk> ) , and the French Government , in collaboration with WWF to assess marine resources used by both Kanak tribes and people of European descent across three coastlines of the Nord Province . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 <unk> is a traditional Kanak casserole , considered a national food by many Kanaks . It is made of sliced root vegetables which might include taro , manioc , yams and coconut milk . Pork , chicken or seafood may be used in the filling which is then wrapped in <unk> banana leaves before being cooked over hot stones in an earthen oven . Other local ingredients used in Kanak cuisine include <unk> ( flying foxes ) and local deer ; marine staples such as lagoon and coral reef fish ( including <unk> ) , as well as crabs and lobsters . Paita beans are locally grown <unk> , while custard @-@ apple , lime and saffron are other local ingredients . 
 = = = Fine arts = = = 
 The Kanak arts of sculpture , dance , music and theatre have become more popular since the 1990s with the efforts of the Agency for Development of Kanak Culture ADCK . Art forms in Kanak culture comprise : 
 Lapita pottery 
 The ancient Lapita potteries date to 1500 BC . Essentially a women ’ s craft , the pottery is generally decorated with geometric patterns and stylised human faces , although there is variation between northern and southern New Caledonian pottery . The various handles and glazes have pinhole @-@ incised designs made from tooth combs . The pottery was made from clay deposits found in the islands . 
 Paintings 
 Painting is a recent art form common among women artists . Famous artists include Yvette Bouquet from <unk> who has produced paintings with Pacific and Oceania themes , Paula Boi , whose paintings are of more abstract scenes , and Denise <unk> and <unk> <unk> who use mixed art forms . Bus stop shelters are common places where their paintings are illustrated . 
 Wood sculpture 
 Wood sculpture represents the spirit of Kanak culture of which the Flèche <unk> , which resembles a small totem pole with symbolic shapes , is the most common . A mini Stonehenge @-@ looking religious memorial near the village in L 'Île @-@ des @-@ Pins has a display of religious carvings . Other wooden objects include war clubs carved from the strongest wood , made in the form of a phallic head ( <unk> @-@ tete ) , a lethal bird 's beak club ( bec d 'oiseau ) , and spears made from <unk> trees used to burn enemy houses . 
 Wooden carvings in the shape of hawks , ancient gods , serpents and turtles are also popular . The Grand Huts , also known as grande case ( chef 's hut ) , are decorated with the filial of fleche <unk> representing the ancestral spirits , symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living . The wood carving is shaped like the spear @-@ like carving that adorns the top of the grande case . It comprises three parts ; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long , the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor ’ s voice , and a base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief . The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points ( facing downwards ) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part . As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects , it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia . The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top . After the death of a Kanak chief , the fleche <unk> is removed and his family takes it to their home . Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses . 
 Stone carving 
 Stone carvings made of jade or serpentinite are in the form of ceremonial axe representing clan 's strength and power . These were used to behead enemies during war and during ancestor celebrations known as Pilou . The bottom of the handle represents the particular clan and is embellished with stones and shells . The axe is polished smooth like a disc . Carvings made of soapstone are also popular . 
 Bamboo carvings 
 A meter in length canes , dated between 1850 and 1920 , are used to make an entry into a village or in dance ceremonies . The canes were fired to give black patina over the engraved parts ; the engraving designs consist of geometrical real images from the pilou dance , agricultural motifs and village scenes of fishing or building a Grand Hut or case . These were also stuffed with magic herbs to ward off evil spirits . 
 Tapa 
 Tapa is a bark cloth made into small pieces , often from banyan trees used to wrap up Kanak ancient bead money . 
 Boats 
 Kanaks living on the islands made canoes out of hollowed – out trunks and large double – hulled outriggers with triangular sails , known as pirogues , traditionally used for fishing . 
 = = = Dances = = = 
 Dances are performed during the traditional Kanak gatherings with the objective of cementing relationships within the clan and with ancestors . Dance is performed in the form of a message or a legend , often related to their daily activities or important events such as birth , marriage , circumcision , the death of a chief and so forth . Dancers paint themselves colourfully to please the ancestors watching over them . Wooden masks made of local materials such as bark , feathers and leaves adorn them representing a physical link with the invisible world . 
 The Festival des Arts du Pacifique , the Festival of Pacific Arts , is organized every four years . Dancers are trained in traditional dances in special workshops . Welcome dances performed by groups are very popular . Of the various dance forms , the pilou @-@ pilou dance is a unique dance form of the Kanaks , which recounts many stories of the clans . The pilou @-@ pilou dance form of the Kanaks , now almost extinct , was so named by the early French missionaries of New Caledonia and involved stomping with bamboo tubes and beating of bark @-@ clappers accompanied by singing in duets with shrieks and whistles of hundreds of dancers . However , in view of very strong nature of this form of dance , with a trance @-@ like status attained by the dancers , these have been banned ; the last such dance reported was in 1951 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Music , dance and singing are part of many a Kanak ceremonial function such as initiation , courting and mourning . Conch shells are blown by an appointed person to represent a clan chief ’ s arrival or the voice of an ancestor . Rhythm instruments used include <unk> , used during ceremonies by a group of men ; Jew 's harp , ( <unk> in the <unk> language where it originated ) made of dried piece of coconut palm leaf held between the teeth and an attached segment of soft nerve leaf ; coconut @-@ leaf <unk> , a piece of coconut leaf attached to a string and twirled that produces a noise like a humming bee ; oboe , made of hollow grass stems or bamboo ; end @-@ blown flute , made of 50 cm long hollowed pawpaw leaf stem ; bamboo stamping tubes that are struck vertically against the ground and played at major events ; percussion instruments ( hitting sticks , palm sheaths ) ; rattles that are worn on the legs made of coconut leaves , shells and certain fruits . Kanak groups such as <unk> first made the recordings on cassette around 1975 or 1976 . 
 = = = Arts festivals = = = 
 In 1971 the women 's association , Smiling Melanesian Village Women 's Groups was formed and advocated the idea of a cultural festival to promote Kanak arts . As a result of this movement the first festival of Melanesian arts , " Melanesia 2000 " , was held in Nouméa in September 1975 , supported by Jean @-@ Marie Tjibaou . Kanak arts festivals became popular with two international events held early in the 1990s that created the awareness of Kanak arts . The first exhibition of modern @-@ day wood sculptors and painters was held at Ko i Neva , which was also published as contemporary Kanak arts . This was followed by a large exhibition of Kanak arts in Paris known as " De Jade et de <unk> - Patrimoine <unk> Kanak ( Jade and Mother of Pearl - Kanak Artistic Heritage " . 
 The Centre Cultural Tjibaou also stages occasional art exhibitions . A popular quadrennial event is the Festival of Pacific Arts where the indigenous people of all Pacific nations and people gather to display the Pacific 's cultural heritage .

 = Clare Stevenson = 
 Clare Grant Stevenson , AM , MBE ( 18 July 1903 – 22 October 1988 ) was the inaugural Director of the Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) . As such , she has been described as " the most significant woman in the history of the Air Force " . Formed as a branch of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in 1941 , the WAAAF was the first and largest uniformed women 's service in Australia during World War II , numbering more than 18 @,@ 000 members by late 1944 and making up over thirty per cent of RAAF ground staff . 
 Born and educated in Victoria , Stevenson was an executive with the Berlei company when she was appointed Director WAAAF . Initially ranked squadron officer , she rose to become group officer by 1942 . Stevenson resumed her civilian career following her discharge from the Air Force in 1946 . Long active in education and social welfare , she helped form aid organisations including the Carers Association of New South Wales ( now Carers NSW ) after retiring from Berlei in 1960 . Stevenson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire and a Member of the Order of Australia for her services to the community and to female veterans . 
 = = Education and early career = = 
 Born on 18 July 1903 in Wangaratta , Victoria , Clare Grant Stevenson was the fifth of six children of Robert Logan Grant Stevenson and his wife Ada <unk> , née Griffiths . When Clare was four her family moved to Essendon , where she attended <unk> Girls ' Grammar School and Essendon High School , completing her intermediate and leaving certificates . In 1922 , she entered the Faculty of Science at the University of Melbourne , but switched to education after failing chemistry in her final year . Stevenson was a hockey blue and was active in several campus groups , including the Students ' Representative Council and the Science Club . She became President of the Committee of Melbourne University Women , and graduated in 1925 with a Diploma of Education . 
 Stevenson began working with the YWCA in 1926 . A strong advocate for continuing education , during her first two years with the association she organised night classes for workers in Sydney . She served as General Secretary of the Rockhampton , Queensland , branch from 1929 to 1931 . In 1932 she took up a position as a training and research officer at Berlei , and from 1935 to 1939 represented the company in London as a senior executive . Stevenson was based in Sydney , supervising product research and the training of sales staff , at the outbreak of World War II .

 = = = Appointment = = = 
 Late in 1940 , Stevenson was nominated to be the first Director of the planned Women 's Auxiliary Australian Air Force ( WAAAF ) . Although keen to support the war effort in some capacity , she demurred owing to the administrative and social obstacles she foresaw in the role , but her appointment went ahead regardless on 21 May 1941 . The Air Member for Personnel , Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley , had recommended Stevenson on the basis of her management background and because she was not a " socialite " . Despite her initial misgivings , Stevenson decided not to fight the appointment , which took effect on 9 June . 
 Established on 25 March 1941 in response to lobbying by women wanting to serve in the war , and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings , the WAAAF was the first uniformed women 's branch of an armed service in Australia , predating similar organisations in the Army and Navy . Fewer than two hundred personnel had been recruited when Stevenson became Director in June ; this number would grow to around a thousand by the end of the year . For the first three months of its existence the WAAAF had been under the temporary command of Flight Officer Mary Bell , wife of an RAAF group captain and former Australian Commandant of the Women 's Air Training Corps , an organisation of female pilots and ground staff that had been formed in 1939 and had been providing voluntary support to the Air Force . Bell chose to resign on learning of Stevenson 's appointment , rather than stay on as Deputy Director and report to someone from outside the service fraternity ; she later rejoined on the condition that she would receive no promotion higher than flight officer . 
 = = = Early challenges = = = 
 In her role as Director , Stevenson was responsible for training , morale and welfare of all WAAAF staff . Philosophically committed to equal opportunity regardless of gender and social background , from the outset she had to deal with discrimination by government authorities , many of whom had been against the creation of such a service . One @-@ time Minister for Defence , Harold <unk> , declared that " aviation takes women out of their natural environment , the home and the training of the family " , and various senior Air Force officers , including the man subsequently known as the " Father of the RAAF " , Air Marshal Richard Williams , and the Director of Personnel Services , Group Captain Joe Hewitt , also fought the proposal . The Chief of the Air Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett , a Royal Air Force commander who appreciated how the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force ( WAAF ) had proved itself during the Battle of Britain in 1940 , supported its establishment but lost some interest after his preferred choice as Director , his daughter Sybil @-@ Jean , a serving WAAF officer , was ruled out . The Federal government decreed that WAAAF staff would be paid two @-@ thirds of what a male doing the equivalent trade received , while their right of appeal in disciplinary matters and the deference shown to their rank was more comparable to that of " uniformed civilians " than to servicemen . Women were at first enrolled for renewable twelve @-@ month periods rather than enlisted as permanent staff ; only in 1943 did the WAAAF become part of the Permanent Air Force . 
 Stevenson considered housing , uniforms , and recruit training as her first priorities after taking up her appointment . She said that on arriving at No. 1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern , Victoria , she was " shattered at the prison @-@ like atmosphere of the place " . She drew on her retail experience to both organise the WAAAF and design its uniform . Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941 , and group officer on 1 April 1942 , which was to be the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member . She took an active interest in recruitment , her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF . In order to establish high standards , Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of her officers as was possible before they were posted to a new job . She also worked to maintain the morale of personnel , encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff . Colonel Sybil Irving , the head of the Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) , who observed first hand the WAAAF 's training methods before large @-@ scale AWAS recruitment commenced , later declared that Stevenson " did the most pertinent pioneering work " in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces . For her part , Stevenson considered the role of Director " a difficult job and often a lonely one " . 
 = = = Later service = = = 
 Early in 1943 a policy change was mooted to remove female officers from the technical <unk> they had so far filled in the WAAAF , and substitute male officers in these roles . In opposing this , Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel , Air Commodore Frank Lukis , and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff , Air Commodore John McCauley . She told McCauley , " I contend that it is a waste of money and training to take women cipher officers , women from Signals ( S4 ) and casualty ... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job " , and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions , and not simply for administration and welfare . McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Vice Marshal George Jones . Jones backed Lukis ' authority , and the latter sent a " stinging rebuke " to Stevenson , who was forced to apologize . In the event , women officers continued to be employed in technical positions as the WAAAF expanded over the next two years , peaking in strength at 18 @,@ 667 members in October 1944 . By the end of the war a total of 27 @,@ 000 women had served in the WAAAF , comprising some thirty @-@ one per cent of Air Force ground staff and filling sixty @-@ one trades , all previously occupied by men . 
 Stevenson continued to lead the WAAAF following the cessation of hostilities , retiring on medical grounds on 22 March 1946 . Suffering reduced muscle function in her left arm and pain on the left side of her face and neck , she was diagnosed with brachial neuritis , traced to typhus , tetanus and smallpox injections received the previous May in preparation for a proposed visit to Manila that never eventuated . In her last annual address to the WAAAF as its Director , Stevenson encouraged its members to make use of their service experience when they returned to civilian life : 
 These are the things we shall miss — the comradeship , the knowledge of a common aim , the feeling that one is not alone — they all make life in the WAAAF very different from life in the outside world ... We must find a common aim — not of winning a war and working to free our prisoners of war — but winning something for our district from an unenlightened council or a disinterested public ... 
 Presented with a jewelled brooch as a farewell gift by her fellow officers , Stevenson asked that its value instead be put towards a scholarship for an ex @-@ WAAAF member to study social work at the University of Sydney . The WAAAF itself , the first and largest of Australia 's wartime women 's services , was disbanded on 30 September 1946 . It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation with a separate charter to the RAAF , the Women 's Royal Australian Air Force ( <unk> ) . <unk> members achieved a pay scale equal to the male service in 1972 , and five years later were integrated with the RAAF . 
 = = Post @-@ war work and legacy = = 
 Following her discharge from the WAAAF , Stevenson resumed her career as a senior executive with Berlei , and remained with the company until her retirement in 1960 . Parallel to her work at Berlei , she was a trustee of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in Melbourne , maintaining her links with the organisation for the next forty years . A founding patron of the Council of Ex @-@ Servicewomen 's Associations , Stevenson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in the 1960 Queen 's Birthday Honours for her welfare work on behalf of female veterans . She helped set up the Scholarship Trust Fund for Civilian Widows ' Children in 1963 , and was a research officer with the New South Wales Council on the Ageing ( COTA ) from 1969 to 1978 . In 1975 , Stevenson was involved in establishing the Kings Cross Community Aid and Information Service , serving for a time as President and as a member of the Management Committee until 1987 . 
 Stevenson founded the Carers Association of New South Wales , and became its first President , in 1980 . While serving with COTA in 1974 , she had prepared a report titled " Dedication " concerning the levels of assistance given to the elderly by their family and friends . This led to her forming in 1976 a subcommittee of COTA made up of carers , from which she later created the Carers Association as an independent organisation . As President of the association , Stevenson lobbied for the establishment of a Carers Pension in New South Wales , which was legislated in 1985 . She is commemorated at the Carers Association ( now Carers NSW ) by the Clare Stevenson Memorial Lectures . 
 In 1984 Stevenson , together with Honor Darling , published The WAAAF Book , a collection of reminiscences by former members of the service . Stevenson was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 1988 Australia Day Honours for her services to the community and her welfare work with veterans . Her hobbies included reading , classical music and , in her younger days , surfing . Unmarried , Clare Stevenson died in Mona Vale on 22 October 1988 , leaving her body to the University of Sydney . 
 = Painted turtle = 
 The painted turtle ( Chrysemys picta ) is the most widespread native turtle of North America . It lives in slow @-@ moving fresh waters , from southern Canada to Louisiana and northern Mexico , and from the Atlantic to the Pacific . The turtle is the only species of the genus Chrysemys , which is part of the pond turtle family Emydidae . Fossils show that the painted turtle existed 15 million years ago . Four regionally based subspecies ( the eastern , midland , southern , and western ) evolved during the last ice age . 
 The adult painted turtle female is 10 – 25 cm ( 4 – 10 in ) long ; the male is smaller . The turtle 's top shell is dark and smooth , without a ridge . Its skin is olive to black with red , orange , or yellow stripes on its extremities . The subspecies can be distinguished by their shells : the eastern has straight @-@ aligned top shell segments ; the midland has a large gray mark on the bottom shell ; the southern has a red line on the top shell ; the western has a red pattern on the bottom shell . 
 The turtle eats aquatic vegetation , algae , and small water creatures including insects , crustaceans , and fish . Although they are frequently consumed as eggs or hatchlings by rodents , canines , and snakes , the adult turtles ' hard shells protect them from most predators . Reliant on warmth from its surroundings , the painted turtle is active only during the day when it basks for hours on logs or rocks . During winter , the turtle hibernates , usually in the mud at the bottom of water bodies . The turtles mate in spring and autumn . Females dig nests on land and lay eggs between late spring and mid @-@ summer . <unk> turtles grow until sexual maturity : 2 – 9 years for males , 6 – 16 for females . 
 In the traditional tales of Algonquian tribes , the colorful turtle played the part of a trickster . In modern times , four U.S. states have named the painted turtle their official reptile . While habitat loss and road killings have reduced the turtle 's population , its ability to live in human @-@ disturbed settings has helped it remain the most abundant turtle in North America . Adults in the wild can live for more than 55 years . 
 = = Description = = 
 The painted turtle 's shell is 10 – 25 cm ( 4 – 10 in ) long , oval , smooth with little grooves where the large scale @-@ like plates overlap , and flat @-@ bottomed . The color of the top shell ( carapace ) varies from olive to black . Darker specimens are more common where the bottom of the water body is darker . The bottom shell ( plastron ) is yellow , sometimes red , sometimes with dark markings in the center . Similar to the top shell , the turtle 's skin is olive to black , but with red and yellow stripes on its neck , legs , and tail . As with other pond turtles , such as the bog turtle , the painted turtle 's feet are webbed to aid swimming . 
 The head of the turtle is distinctive . The face has only yellow stripes , with a large yellow spot and streak behind each eye , and on the chin two wide yellow stripes that meet at the tip of the jaw . The turtle 's upper jaw is shaped into an inverted " V " ( philtrum ) , with a downward @-@ facing , tooth @-@ like projection on each side . 
 The hatchling has a proportionally larger head , eyes , and tail , and a more circular shell than the adult . The adult female is generally longer than the male , 10 – 25 cm ( 4 – 10 in ) versus 7 – 15 cm ( 3 – 6 in ) . For a given length , the female has a higher ( more rounded , less flat ) top shell . The female weighs around 500 g ( 18 oz ) on average , against the males ' average adult weight of roughly 300 g ( 11 oz ) . The female 's greater body volume supports her egg @-@ production . The male has longer <unk> and a longer , thicker tail , with the anus ( cloaca ) located further out on the tail . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 Although the subspecies of painted turtle intergrade ( blend together ) at range boundaries they are distinct within the hearts of their ranges . 
 The male eastern painted turtle ( C. p. picta ) is 13 – 17 cm ( 5 – 7 in ) long , while the female is 14 – 17 cm ( 6 – 7 in ) . The upper shell is olive green to black and may possess a pale stripe down the middle and red markings on the periphery . The segments ( scutes ) of the top shell have pale leading edges and occur in straight rows across the back , unlike all other North American turtles , including the other three subspecies of painted turtle , which have alternating segments . The bottom shell is plain yellow or lightly spotted . Sometimes as few as one dark grey spot near the lower center of the shell . 
 The midland painted turtle ( C. p. marginata ) is 10 – 25 cm ( 4 – 10 in ) long . The centrally located midland is the hardest to distinguish from the other three subspecies . Its bottom shell has a characteristic symmetrical dark shadow in the center which varies in size and prominence . 
 The southern painted turtle ( C. p. dorsalis ) , the smallest subspecies , is 10 – 14 cm ( 4 – 6 in ) long . Its top stripe is a prominent red , and its bottom shell is tan and spotless or nearly so . 
 The largest subspecies is the western painted turtle ( C. p. bellii ) , which grows up to 26 @.@ 6 cm ( 10 in ) long . Its top shell has a mesh @-@ like pattern of light lines , and the top stripe present in other subspecies is missing or faint . Its bottom shell has a large colored splotch that spreads to the edges ( further than the midland ) and often has red hues . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The painted turtle has a very similar appearance to the red @-@ eared slider ( the most common pet turtle ) and the two are often confused . The painted turtle can be distinguished because it is flatter than the slider . Also , the slider has a prominent red marking on the side of its head ( the " ear " ) and a spotted bottom shell , both features missing in the painted turtle . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The painted turtle hunts along water bottoms . It quickly juts its head into and out of vegetation to stir potential victims out into the open water , where they are pursued . The turtle holds large prey in its mouth and tears the prey apart with its forefeet . It also consumes plants and skims the surface of the water with its mouth open to catch small particles of food . 
 Although all subspecies of painted turtle eat both plants and animals , their specific diets vary . 
 The eastern painted turtle 's diet is the least studied . It prefers to eat in the water , but has been observed eating on land . The fish it consumes are typically dead or injured . 
 The midland painted turtle eats mostly aquatic insects and both vascular and non @-@ vascular plants . 
 The southern painted turtle 's diet changes with age . Juveniles ' diet consists of 13 % vegetation , while the adults eat 88 % vegetation . This perhaps shows that the turtle prefers small larvae and other prey , but can only obtain significant amounts while young . The reversal of feeding habits with age has also been seen in the false map turtle , which inhabits some of the same range . The most common plants eaten by adult southern painted turtles are duckweed and algae , and the most common prey items are dragonfly larvae and crayfish . 
 The western painted turtle 's consumption of plants and animals changes seasonally . In early summer , 60 % of its diet comprises insects . In late summer , 55 % includes plants . Of note , the western painted turtle aids in the dispersal of white water @-@ lily seeds . The turtle consumes the hard @-@ coated seeds , which remain viable after passing through the turtle , and disperses them through its feces . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Painted turtles are most vulnerable to predators when young . Nests are frequently ransacked and the eggs eaten by garter snakes , crows , chipmunks , thirteen @-@ lined ground and gray squirrels , skunks , groundhogs , raccoons , badgers , gray and red fox , and humans . The small and sometimes bite @-@ size , numerous hatchlings fall prey to water bugs , bass , catfish , bullfrogs , snapping turtles , three types of snakes ( copperheads , racers and water snakes ) , herons , rice rats , weasels , muskrats , minks , and raccoons . As adults , the turtles ' armored shells protect them from many potential predators , but they still occasionally fall prey to alligators , ospreys , crows , red @-@ shouldered hawks , bald eagles , and especially raccoons . 
 Painted turtles defend themselves by kicking , scratching , biting , or urinating . In contrast to land tortoises , painted turtles can right themselves if they are flipped upside down . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 = = = Mating = = = 
 The painted turtles mate in spring and fall in waters of 10 – 25 ° C ( 50 – 77 ° F ) . Males start producing sperm in early spring , when they can bask to an internal temperature of 17 ° C ( 63 ° F ) . Females begin their reproductive cycles in mid @-@ summer , and ovulate the following spring . 
 Courtship begins when a male follows a female until he meets her face @-@ to @-@ face . He then strokes her face and neck with his elongated front claws , a gesture returned by a receptive female . The pair repeat the process several times , with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom , where they copulate . As the male is smaller than the female , he is not dominant . The female stores sperm , to be used for up to three clutches , in her oviducts ; the sperm may remain viable for up to three years . A single clutch may have multiple fathers . 
 = = = Egg @-@ laying = = = 
 Nesting is done , by the females only , between late May and mid @-@ July . The nests are vase @-@ shaped and are usually dug in sandy soil , often at sites with southern exposures . Nests are often within 200 m ( 220 yd ) of water , but may be as far away as 600 m ( 660 yd ) , with older females tending to nest further inland . Nest sizes vary depending on female sizes and locations but are about 5 – 11 cm ( 2 – 4 in ) deep . Females may return to the same sites several consecutive years , but if several females make their nests close together , the eggs become more vulnerable to predators . 
 The female 's optimal body temperature while digging her nest is 29 – 30 ° C ( 84 – 86 ° F ) . If the weather is unsuitable , for instance a too hot night in the Southeast , she delays the process until later at night . Painted turtles in Virginia have been observed waiting three weeks to nest because of a hot drought . 
 While preparing to dig her nest , the female sometimes exhibits a mysterious preliminary behavior . She presses her throat against the ground of different potential sites , perhaps sensing moisture , warmth , texture , or smell , although her exact motivation is unknown . She may further <unk> by excavating several false nests as the wood turtles also do . 
 The female relies on her hind feet for digging . She may accumulate so much sand and mud on her feet that her mobility is reduced , making her vulnerable to predators . To lighten her labors , she lubricates the area with her bladder water . Once the nest is complete , the female deposits into the hole . The freshly laid eggs are white , elliptical , porous , and flexible . From start to finish , the female 's work may take four hours . Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards , before returning to her home water . 
 Females can lay five clutches per year , but two is a normal average after including the 30 – 50 % of a population 's females that do not produce any clutches in a given year . In some northern populations , no females lay more than one clutch per year . Bigger females tend to lay bigger eggs and more eggs per clutch . Clutch sizes of the subspecies vary , although the differences may reflect different environments , rather than different genetics . The two more northerly subspecies , western and midland , are larger and have more eggs per clutch — 11 @.@ 9 and 7 @.@ 6 , respectively — than the two more southerly subspecies , southern ( 4 @.@ 2 ) and eastern ( 4 @.@ 9 ) . Within subspecies , also , the more northerly females lay larger clutches . 
 = = = Growth = = = 
 Incubation lasts 72 – 80 days in the wild and for a similar period in artificial conditions . In August and September , the young turtle breaks out from its egg , using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth . Not all offspring leave the nest immediately , though . Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring . 
 The hatchling 's ability to survive winter in the nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle . The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive extended periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground . The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings . 
 Immediately after hatching , turtles are dependent on egg yolk material for sustenance . About a week to a week and a half after emerging from their eggs ( or the following spring if emergence is delayed ) , hatchlings begin feeding to support growth . The young turtles grow rapidly at first , sometimes doubling their size in the first year . Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely . Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body , growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area . Among the subspecies , the western painted turtles are the quickest growers . 
 Females grow faster than males overall , and must be larger to mature sexually . In most populations males reach sexual maturity at 2 – 4 years old , and females at 6 – 10 . Size and age at maturity increase with latitude ; at the northern edge of their range , males reach sexual maturity at 7 – 9 years of age and females at 11 – 16 . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 = = = Daily routine and basking = = = 
 A cold @-@ blooded reptile , the painted turtle regulates its temperature through its environment , notably by basking . All ages bask for warmth , often alongside other species of turtle . Sometimes more than 50 individuals are seen on one log together . Turtles bask on a variety of objects , often logs , but have even been seen basking on top of common loons that were covering eggs . 
 The turtle starts its day at sunrise , emerging from the water to bask for several hours . <unk> for activity , it returns to the water to forage . After becoming chilled , the turtle re @-@ emerges for one to two more cycles of basking and feeding . At night , the turtle drops to the bottom of its water body or perches on an underwater object and sleeps . 
 To be active , the turtle must maintain an internal body temperature between 17 – 23 ° C ( 63 – 73 ° F ) . When fighting infection , it manipulates its temperature up to 5 ° C ( 8 ° F ) higher than normal . 
 = = = Seasonal routine and hibernation = = = 
 In the spring , when the water reaches 15 – 18 ° C ( 59 – 64 ° F ) , the turtle begins actively foraging . However , if the water temperature exceeds 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , the turtle will not feed . In fall , the turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set @-@ point . 
 During the winter , the turtle hibernates . In the north , the inactive season may be as long as from October to March , while the southernmost populations may not hibernate at all . While hibernating , the body temperature of the painted turtle averages 6 ° C ( 43 ° F ) . Periods of warm weather bring the turtle out of hibernation , and even in the north , individuals have been seen basking in February . 
 The painted turtle hibernates by burying itself , either on the bottom of a body of water , near water in the shore @-@ bank or the burrow of a muskrat , or in woods or pastures . When hibernating underwater , the turtle prefers shallow depths , no more than 2 m ( 7 ft ) . Within the mud , it may dig down an additional 1 m ( 3 ft ) . In this state , the turtle does not breathe , although if surroundings allow , it may get some oxygen through its skin . The species is one of the best @-@ studied vertebrates able to survive long periods without oxygen . Adaptations of its blood chemistry , brain , heart , and particularly its shell allow the turtle to survive extreme lactic acid buildup while oxygen @-@ deprived . 
 = = = Movement = = = 
 Searching for water , food , or mates , the painted turtles travel up to several kilometers at a time . During summer , in response to heat and water @-@ clogging vegetation , the turtles may vacate shallow marshes for more permanent waters . Short overland migrations may involve hundreds of turtles together . If heat and drought are prolonged , the turtles will bury themselves and , in extreme cases , die . 
 Foraging turtles frequently cross lakes or travel linearly down creeks . Daily crossings of large ponds have been observed . Tag and release studies show that sex also drives turtle movement . Males travel the most , up to 26 km ( 16 mi ) , between captures ; females the second most , up to 8 km ( 5 mi ) , between captures ; and juveniles the least , less than 2 km ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , between captures . Males move the most and are most likely to change wetlands because they seek mates . 
 The painted turtles , through visual recognition , have homing capabilities . Many individuals can return to their collection points after being released elsewhere , trips that may require them to traverse land . One experiment placed 98 turtles varying several @-@ kilometer distances from their home wetland ; 41 returned . When living in a single large body of water , the painted turtles can home from up to 6 km ( 4 mi ) away . Females may use homing to help locate suitable nesting sites . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 = = = Range = = = 
 The most widespread North American turtle , the painted turtle is the only turtle whose native range extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific . It is native to eight of Canada 's ten provinces , forty @-@ five of the fifty United States , and one of Mexico 's thirty @-@ one states . On the East Coast , it lives from the Canadian Maritimes to the U.S. state of Georgia . On the West Coast , it lives in British Columbia , Washington , and Oregon and offshore on southeast Vancouver Island . The northernmost American turtle , its range includes much of southern Canada . To the south , its range reaches the U.S. Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Alabama . In the southwestern United States there are only dispersed populations . It is found in one river in extreme northern Mexico . It is absent in a part of southwestern Virginia and the adjacent states as well as in north @-@ central Alabama . 
 The borders between the four subspecies are not sharp , because the subspecies interbreed . Many studies have been performed in the border regions to assess the intermediate turtles , usually by comparing the anatomical features of hybrids that result from intergradation of the classical subspecies . Despite the imprecision , the subspecies are assigned nominal ranges . 
 = = = = Eastern painted turtle = = = = 
 The eastern painted turtle ranges from southeastern Canada to Georgia with a western boundary at approximately the Appalachians . At its northern extremes , the turtle tends to be restricted to the warmer areas closer to the Atlantic Ocean . It is uncommon in far north New Hampshire and in Maine is common only in a strip about 50 miles from the coast . In Canada , it lives in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia but not in Quebec or Prince Edward Island . To the south it is not found in the coastal lowlands of southern North Carolina , South Carolina , or Georgia , or in southern Georgia in general or at all in Florida . 
 The eastern subspecies 's range extends slightly into east central Alabama , where it intergrades with the southern subspecies . In the northeast , there is extensive mixing with the midland subspecies , and some writers have called these turtles a " hybrid swarm " . In the southeast , the border between the eastern and midland is more sharp as mountain chains separate the subspecies to different drainage basins . 
 = = = = Midland painted turtle = = = = 
 The midland painted turtle lives from southern Ontario and Quebec , through the eastern U.S. Midwest states , to Kentucky , Tennessee and northwestern Alabama , where it intergrades with the southern painted turtle . It also is found eastward through West Virginia , western Maryland and Pennsylvania . The midland painted turtle appears to be moving east , especially in Pennsylvania . To the northeast it is found in western New York and much of Vermont , and it intergrades extensively with the eastern subspecies . 
 = = = = Southern painted turtle = = = = 
 The southern painted turtle ranges from extreme southern Illinois and Missouri , roughly along the Mississippi River Valley , to the south . In Arkansas , it branches out to the west towards Texas , where it is found in the far northeast part of that state ( Caddo Lake region ) as well as extreme southeastern Oklahoma ( <unk> County ) . It is found in much of Louisiana , where it reaches the Gulf of Mexico ( in fresh water ) . Eastward it is found in western Tennessee , northern Mississippi and much of Alabama , including the Gulf Coast city of Mobile An isolated population in central Texas has been reported but is now believed to be non @-@ native . 
 = = = = Western painted turtle = = = = 
 The western painted turtle 's northern range includes southern parts of western Canada from Ontario through Manitoba , Saskatchewan , Alberta and British Columbia . In Ontario , the western subspecies is found north of Minnesota and directly north of Lake Superior , but there is a 130 km ( 80 mi ) gap to the east of Lake Superior ( in the area of harshest winter climate ) where no painted turtles of any subspecies occur . Thus Ontario 's western subspecies does not intergrade with the midland painted turtle of southeastern Ontario . In Manitoba , the turtle is numerous and ranges north to Lake Manitoba and the lower part of Lake Winnipeg . The turtle is also common in south Saskatchewan , but in Alberta , there may only be 100 individuals , all found very near the U.S. border , mostly in the southeast . 
 In British Columbia , populations exist in the interior in the vicinity of the Kootenai , Columbia , Okanagan , and Thompson river valleys . At the coast , turtles occur near the mouth of the Fraser and a bit further north , as well as the bottom of Vancouver Island , and some other nearby islands . Within British Columbia , the turtle 's range is not continuous and can better be understood as northward extensions of the range from the United States . High mountains present barriers to east @-@ west movement of the turtles within the province or from Alberta . Some literature has shown isolated populations much further north in British Columbia and Alberta , but these were probably pet @-@ releases . 
 In the United States , the western subspecies forms a wide intergrade area with the midland subspecies covering much of Illinois as well as a strip of Wisconsin along Lake Michigan and part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ( UP ) . Further west , the rest of Illinois , Wisconsin and the UP are part of the range proper , as are all of Minnesota and Iowa , as well as all of Missouri except a narrow strip in the south . All of North Dakota is within range , all of South Dakota except a very small area in the west , and all of Nebraska . Almost all of Kansas is in range ; the border of that state with Oklahoma is roughly the species range border , but the turtle is found in three counties of north central Oklahoma . 
 To the northwest , almost all of Montana is in range . Only a narrow strip in the west , along most of the Idaho border ( which is at the Continental Divide ) lacks turtles . Wyoming is almost entirely out of range ; only the lower elevation areas near the eastern and northern borders have painted turtles . In Idaho , the turtles are found throughout the far north ( upper half of the Idaho Panhandle ) . Recently , separate Idaho populations have been observed in the southwest ( near the Payette and Boise rivers ) and the southeast ( near St. Anthony ) . In Washington state , turtles are common throughout the state within lower elevation river valleys . In Oregon , the turtle is native to the northern part of the state throughout the Columbia River Valley as well as the Willamette River Valley north of Salem . 
 To the southwest , the painted turtle 's range is fragmented . In Colorado , while range is continuous in the eastern , prairie , half of the state , it is absent in most of the western , mountainous , part of the state . However , the turtle is confirmed present in the lower elevation southwest part of the state ( Archuleta and La Plata counties ) , where a population ranges into northern New Mexico in the San Juan River basin . There are also some unconfirmed sightings in parts of the far west of the state ( e.g. Mesa County ) . In New Mexico , the main distribution follows the Rio Grande and the Pecos River , two waterways that run in a north @-@ south direction through the state . Within the aforementioned rivers , it is also found in the northern part of Far West Texas . In Utah , the painted turtle lives in an area to the south ( Kane County ) in streams draining into the Colorado River , although it is disputed if they are native . In Arizona , the painted turtle is native to an area in the east , Lyman Lake . The painted turtle is not native to Nevada or California . 
 In Mexico , painted turtles have been found about 50 miles south of New Mexico near Galeana in the state of Chihuahua . There , two expeditions found the turtles in the Rio Santa Maria which is in a closed basin . 
 = = = = Human @-@ introduced range = = = = 
 Pet releases are starting to establish the painted turtle outside its native range . In California , it is an invasive species that endangers the local western pond turtle , although competition from similarly released red @-@ eared sliders is a greater threat . It has also been introduced into waterways near Phoenix , Arizona , and Miami , Florida , and to Germany , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Spain . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 To thrive , painted turtles need fresh waters with soft bottoms , basking sites , and aquatic vegetation . They find their homes in shallow waters with slow @-@ moving currents , such as creeks , marshes , ponds , and the shores of lakes . The subspecies have evolved different habitat preferences . 
 The eastern painted turtle is very aquatic , leaving the immediate vicinity of its water body only when forced by drought to migrate . Along the Atlantic , painted turtles have appeared in brackish waters . 
 The midland and southern painted turtles seek especially quiet waters , usually shores and coves . They favor shallows that contain dense vegetation and have an unusual toleration of pollution . 
 The western painted turtle lives in streams and lakes , similar to the other painted turtles , but also inhabits pasture ponds and roadside pools . It is found as high as 1 @,@ 800 m ( 5 @,@ 900 ft ) . 
 = = = Population features = = = 
 Within much of its range , the painted turtle is the most abundant turtle species . Population densities range from 10 to 840 turtles per hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) of water surface . Warmer climates produce higher relative densities among populations , and habitat desirability also influences density . Rivers and large lakes have lower densities because only the shore is desirable habitat ; the central , deep waters skew the surface @-@ based estimates . Also , lake and river turtles have to make longer linear trips to access equivalent amounts of foraging space . 
 Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations , but gauging the ratios is difficult because juveniles are harder to catch ; with current sampling methods , estimates of age distribution vary widely . Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age . The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19 % . For females , the annual survival rate rises to 45 % for juveniles and 95 % for adults . The male survival rates follow a similar pattern , but are lower overall than females , creating an average male age lower than that of the female . Natural disasters can confound age distributions . For instance , a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region , resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year . Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults . 
 To understand painted turtle adult age distributions , researchers require reliable methods . Turtles younger than four years ( up to 12 years in some populations ) can be aged based on " growth rings " in their shells . For older turtles , some attempts have been made to determine age based on size and shape of their shells or legs using mathematical models , but this method is more uncertain . The most reliable method to study the long @-@ lived turtles is to capture them , permanently mark their shells by notching with a drill , release the turtles , and then recapture them in later years . The longest @-@ running study , in Michigan , has shown that painted turtles can live more than 55 years . 
 Adult sex ratios of painted turtle populations average around 1 : 1 . Many populations are slightly male @-@ heavy , but some are strongly female @-@ imbalanced ; one population in Ontario has a female to male ratio of 4 : 1 . Hatchling sex ratio varies based on egg temperature . During the middle third of incubation , temperatures of 23 – 27 ° C ( 73 – 81 ° F ) produce males , and anything above or below that , females . It does not appear that females choose nesting sites to influence the sex of the hatchlings ; within a population , nests will vary sufficiently to give both male and female @-@ heavy broods . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The painted turtle ( C. picta ) is the only species in the genus Chrysemys . The parent family for Chrysemys is Emydidae : the pond turtles . Emydidae is split into two sub families ; Chrysemys is part of the <unk> ( Western Hemisphere ) branch . The four subspecies of the painted turtle are the eastern ( C. p. picta ) , midland ( C. p. marginata ) , southern ( C. p. dorsalis ) , and western ( C. p. bellii ) . 
 The painted turtle 's generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek words for " gold " ( <unk> ) and " freshwater tortoise " ( <unk> ) ; the species name originates from the Latin for " colored " ( pictus ) . The subspecies name , marginata , derives from the Latin for " border " and refers to the red markings on the outer ( marginal ) part of the upper shell ; dorsalis is from the Latin for " back " , referring to the prominent dorsal stripe ; and bellii honors zoologist Thomas Bell , a collaborator of Charles Darwin . An alternate East Coast common name for the painted turtle is " <unk> " , from the Dutch for turtle , <unk> . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Originally described in 1783 by Johann Gottlob Schneider as Testudo picta , the painted turtle was called Chrysemys picta first by John Edward Gray in 1855 . The four subspecies were then recognized : the eastern by Schneider in 1783 , the western by Gray in 1831 , and the midland and southern by Louis Agassiz in 1857 . 
 Until the 1930s many of the subspecies of the painted turtle were labeled by biologists as full species within Chrysemys , but this varied by the researcher . The painted turtles in the border region between the western and midland subspecies were sometimes considered a full species , <unk> . In 1931 , Bishop and Schmidt defined the current " four in one " taxonomy of species and subspecies . Based on comparative measurements of turtles from throughout the range , they subordinated species to subspecies and eliminated <unk> . 
 Since at least 1958 , the subspecies were thought to have evolved in response to geographic isolation during the last ice age , 100 @,@ 000 to 11 @,@ 000 years ago . At that time painted turtles were divided into three different populations : eastern painted turtles along the southeastern Atlantic coast ; southern painted turtles around the southern Mississippi River ; and western painted turtles in the southwestern United States . The populations were not completely isolated for sufficiently long , hence wholly different species never evolved . When the glaciers retreated , about 11 @,@ 000 years ago , all three subspecies moved north . The western and southern subspecies met in Missouri and hybridized to produce the midland painted turtle , which then moved east and north through the Ohio and Tennessee river basins . 
 Biologists have long debated the genera of closely related subfamily @-@ mates Chrysemys , Pseudemys ( <unk> ) , and Trachemys ( sliders ) . After 1952 , some combined Pseudemys and Chrysemys because of similar appearance . In 1964 , based on measurements of the skull and feet , Samuel B. McDowell proposed all three genera be merged into one . However , further measurements , in 1967 , contradicted this taxonomic arrangement . Also in 1967 , J. Alan Holman , a paleontologist and herpetologist , pointed out that , although the three turtles were often found together in nature and had similar mating patterns , they did not crossbreed . In the 1980s , studies of turtles ' cell structures , <unk> , and parasites further indicated that Chrysemys , Pseudemys , and Trachemys should remain in separate genera . 
 David E. Starkey and collaborators advanced a new view of the subspecies in 2003 . Based on a study of the mitochondrial DNA , they rejected the glacial development theory and argued that the southern painted turtle should be elevated to a separate species , C. dorsalis , while the other subspecies should be collapsed into one and not differentiated . However , this proposition was largely unrecognized because successful breeding between all subspecies was documented wherever they overlapped . Nevertheless , in 2010 , the IUCN recognized both C. dorsalis and C. p. dorsalis as valid names for the southern painted turtle . 
 = = = Fossils = = = 
 Although its evolutionary history — what the forerunner to the species was and how the close relatives branched off — is not well understood , the painted turtle is common in the fossil record . The oldest samples , found in Nebraska , date to about 15 million years ago . Fossils from 15 million to about 5 million years ago are restricted to the Nebraska @-@ Kansas area , but more recent fossils are gradually more widely distributed . Fossils newer than 300 @,@ 000 years old are found in almost all the United States and southern Canada . 
 = = = DNA = = = 
 The turtle 's karyotype ( nuclear DNA , rather than mitochondrial DNA ) consists of 50 chromosomes , the same number as the rest of its subfamily @-@ mates and the most common number for Emydidae turtles in general . Less well @-@ related turtles have from 26 to 66 chromosomes . Little systematic study of variations of the painted turtle 's <unk> among populations has been done . ( However , in 1967 , research on protein structure of offshore island populations in New England , showed differences from mainland turtles . ) 
 Comparison of subspecies chromosomal DNA has been discussed , to help address the debate over Starkey 's proposed taxonomy , but as of 2009 had not been reported . Interestingly , the complete sequencing of the genetic code for the painted turtle was at a " draft assembled " state in 2010 . The turtle was one of two reptiles chosen to be first sequenced .

 The decline in painted turtle populations is not a simple matter of dramatic range reduction , like that of the American bison . Instead the turtle is classified as G5 ( demonstrably widespread ) in its Natural Heritage Global Rank , and the IUCN rates it as a species of least concern . The painted turtle 's high reproduction rate and its ability to survive in polluted wetlands and artificially made ponds have allowed it to maintain its range , but the post @-@ Columbus settlement of North America has reduced its numbers . 
 Only within the Pacific Northwest is the turtle 's range eroding . Even there , in Washington , the painted turtle is designated S5 ( demonstrably widespread ) . However , in Oregon , the painted turtle is designated S2 ( imperiled ) , and in British Columbia , the turtle 's populations in the Coast and Interior regions are labeled " endangered " and " of special concern " , respectively . 
 Much is written about the different factors that threaten the painted turtle , but they are unquantified , with only inferences of relative importance . A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms . Related to water habitat , there is drying of wetlands , clearing of aquatic logs or rocks ( basking sites ) , and clearing of shoreline vegetation , which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic . Related to nesting habitat , urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils . 
 Another significant human impact is roadkill — dead turtles , especially females , are commonly seen on summer roads . In addition to direct killing , roads genetically isolate some populations . Localities have tried to limit roadkill by constructing underpasses , highway barriers , and crossing signs . Oregon has introduced public education on turtle awareness , safe swerving , and safely assisting turtles across the road . 
 In the West , human @-@ introduced bass , bullfrogs , and especially snapping turtles , have increased the predation of hatchlings . Outside the Southeast , where sliders are native , released pet red @-@ eared slider turtles increasingly compete with painted turtles . In cities , increased urban predators ( raccoons , canines , and felines ) may impact painted turtles by eating their eggs . 
 Other factors of concern for the painted turtles include over @-@ collection from the wild , released pets introducing diseases or reducing genetic variability , pollution , boating traffic , angler 's hooks ( the turtles are noteworthy bait @-@ thieves ) , wanton shooting , and crushing by agricultural machines or golf course lawnmowers or all @-@ terrain vehicles . Gervais and colleagues note that research itself impacts the populations and that much funded turtle trapping work has not been published . They advocate discriminating more on what studies are done , thereby putting fewer turtles into scientists ' traps . Global warming represents an uncharacterized future threat . 
 = = = Pets and other uses = = = 
 According to a trade data study , painted turtles were the second most popular pet turtles after red @-@ eared sliders in the early 1990s . As of 2010 , most U.S. states allow , but discourage , painted turtle pets , although Oregon forbids keeping them as pets , and Indiana prohibits their sale . U.S. federal law prohibits sale or transport of any turtle less than 10 cm ( 4 in ) , to limit human contact to salmonella . However , a loophole for scientific samples allows some small turtles to be sold , and illegal trafficking also occurs . 
 Painted turtle pet @-@ keeping requirements are similar to those of the red @-@ eared slider . Keepers are urged to provide them with adequate space and a basking site , and water that is regularly filtered and changed . According to Petco , the animals are described as being somewhat unsuitable for children as they do not enjoy being held . Hobbyists have kept turtles alive for decades . 
 The painted turtle is sometimes eaten but is not highly regarded as food , as even the largest subspecies , the western painted turtle , is inconveniently small and larger turtles are available . Schools frequently dissect painted turtles , which are sold by biological supply companies ; specimens often come from the wild but may be captive @-@ bred . In the Midwest , turtle racing is popular at summer fairs . 
 = = = Capture = = = 
 Commercial harvesting of painted turtles in the wild is controversial and , increasingly , restricted . Wisconsin formerly had virtually unrestricted trapping of painted turtles but based on qualitative observations forbade all commercial harvesting in 1997 . Neighboring Minnesota , where trappers collected more than 300 @,@ 000 painted turtles during the 1990s , commissioned a study of painted turtle harvesting . Scientists found that harvested lakes averaged half the painted turtle density of off @-@ limit lakes , and population modeling suggested that unrestricted harvests could produce a large decline in turtle populations . In response , Minnesota forbade new harvesters in 2002 and limited trap numbers . Although harvesting continued , subsequent takes averaged half those of the 1990s . As of 2009 , painted turtles faced virtually unlimited harvesting in Arkansas , Iowa , Missouri , Ohio , and Oklahoma ; since then , Missouri has prohibited their harvesting . 
 Individuals who trap painted turtles typically do so to earn additional income , selling a few thousand a year at $ 1 – 2 each . Many trappers have been involved in the trade for generations , and value it as a family activity . Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch , saying the populations are not dropping . 
 Many U.S. state fish and game departments allow non @-@ commercial taking of painted turtles under a creel limit , and require a fishing ( sometimes hunting ) license ; others completely forbid the recreational capture of painted turtles . Trapping is not allowed in Oregon , where western painted turtle populations are in decline , and in Missouri , where there are populations of both southern and western subspecies . In Canada , Ontario protects both subspecies present , the midland and western , and British Columbia protects its dwindling western painted turtles . 
 Capture methods are also regulated by locality . Typically trappers use either floating " basking traps " or partially submerged , baited " hoop traps " . Trapper opinions , commercial records , and scientific studies show that basking traps are more effective for collecting painted turtles , while the hoop traps work better for collecting " meat turtles " ( snapping turtles and soft @-@ shell turtles ) . Nets , hand capture , and fishing with set lines are generally legal , but shooting , chemicals , and explosives are forbidden .

 Indian tribes were familiar with the painted turtle — young braves were trained to recognize its splashing into water as an alarm — and incorporated it in folklore . A Potawatomi myth describes how the talking turtles , " Painted Turtle " and allies " <unk> Turtle " and " Box Turtle " , outwit the village women . Painted Turtle is the star of the legend and uses his distinctive markings to trick a woman into holding him so he can bite her . An Illini myth recounts how Painted Turtle put his paint on to entice a chief 's daughter into the water . 
 As of 2010 , four U.S. states designated the painted turtle as official reptile . Vermont honored the reptile in 1994 , following the suggestion of Cornwall Elementary School students . In 1995 , Michigan followed , based on the recommendation of Niles fifth graders , who discovered the state lacked an official reptile . Illinois citizens , in 2004 , voted to select the painted turtle as their state reptile and the legislature made it official in 2005 . Colorado chose the western painted turtle in 2008 , following the efforts of two succeeding years of Jay <unk> 's fourth grade classes . In New York , the painted turtle narrowly lost ( 5 @,@ 048 to 5 @,@ 005 , versus the common snapping turtle ) a 2006 statewide student election for state reptile . 
 In the border town of <unk> , Manitoba , a 10 @,@ 000 lb ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) western painted turtle , Tommy the Turtle , is a roadside attraction . The statue was built in 1974 to celebrate the Canadian Turtle Derby , a festival including turtle races that ran from 1972 – 2001 . 
 Another Canadian admirer of the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery , who won the 2010 Olympic gold medal in skeleton ( a form of sled ) racing , while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet , prominently visible when he slid downhill . Montgomery , who also iconically <unk> his chest with a maple @-@ leaf , explained his visual promotion of the turtle , saying that he had assisted one to cross the road . BC Hydro referred to Montgomery 's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia . 
 Several private entities use the painted turtle as a symbol . Wayne State University Press operates an imprint " named after the Michigan state reptile " that " publishes books on regional topics of cultural and historical interest " . In California , The Painted Turtle is a camp for ill children , founded by Paul Newman . Painted Turtle Winery of British Columbia trades on the " laid back and casual lifestyle " of the turtle with a " job description to bask in the sun " . Also , there are two Internet companies in Michigan , a guesthouse in British Columbia , and a café in Maine that use the painted turtle commercially . 
 In children 's books , the painted turtle is a popular subject , with at least seven books published between 2000 and 2010 . " Painted turtle : state reptile of Michigan " is a short song for children .

 Chen Guangcheng ( born 12 November 1971 ) is a Chinese civil rights activist who has worked on human rights issues in rural areas of the People 's Republic of China . Blind from an early age and self @-@ taught in the law , Chen is frequently described as a " barefoot lawyer " who advocates for women 's rights , land rights , and the welfare of the poor . He is best known for accusing people of abuses in official family @-@ planning practices , often involving claims of violence and forced abortions . 
 In 2005 , Chen gained international recognition for organising a landmark class @-@ action lawsuit against authorities in Linyi , Shandong province , for the excessive enforcement of the one @-@ child policy . As a result of this lawsuit , Chen was placed under house arrest from September 2005 to March 2006 , with a formal arrest in June 2006 . On 24 August 2006 , Chen was sentenced to four years and three months for " damaging property and organising a mob to disturb traffic . " He was released from prison in 2010 after serving his full sentence , but remained under house arrest or " soft detention " at his home in Dongshigu Village . Chen and his wife were reportedly beaten shortly after a human rights group released a video of their home under intense police surveillance in February 2011 . 
 Chen 's case received sustained international attention , with the U.S. State Department , the British Foreign Secretary , Human Rights Watch , and Amnesty International issuing appeals for his release ; the latter group designated him a prisoner of conscience . Chen is a 2007 laureate of the Ramon Magsaysay Award and in 2006 was named to the Time 100 . 
 In April 2012 , Chen escaped his house arrest and fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing . After negotiations with the Chinese government , he left the embassy for medical treatment in early May 2012 , and it was reported that China would consider allowing him to travel to the United States to study . On 19 May 2012 , Chen , his wife , and his two children were granted U.S. visas and departed Beijing for New York City . In October 2013 , Chen accepted a position with the conservative research group Witherspoon Institute , and a position at the Catholic University of America . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Chen is the youngest of five brothers of a peasant family from the village of Dongshigu , Yinan County , Shandong Province , approximately 200 kilometres ( 120 mi ) from the city of Jinan . When Chen was about six months old , he lost his sight due to a fever that destroyed his optical nerves . In an interview for the New York Review of Books , Chen said that although his family did not identify with an organized religion , his upbringing was informed by a " traditional belief in virtue that ’ s present in Chinese culture — that might have some Buddhist content , but not necessarily that one believes in Buddhism . " His village was poor , with many families living at a subsistence level . " When I went to school I ’ d be happy if I just got enough to eat , " he recalled . 
 Chen 's father worked as an instructor at a Communist Party school , earning the equivalent of about $ 60 annually . When Chen was a child , his father would read literary works aloud to him , and reportedly helped impart to his son an appreciation of the values of democracy and freedom . In 1991 , Chen 's father gave him a copy of " The Law Protecting the Disabled , " which elaborated on the legal rights and protections in place for disabled persons in the PRC . 
 In 1989 , at the age of 18 , Chen began attending school as a grade one student at the Elementary School for the Blind in Linyi city . In 1994 , he enrolled at the Qingdao High School for the Blind , where he studied until 1998 . He had already begun developing an interest in law , and would often ask his brothers to read legal texts to him . He earned a position at the Nanjing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1998 but because his family was poor , they had to borrow $ 340 to cover tuition costs . They still fell short of the required $ 400 and university authorities reportedly had to be pleaded with before allowing Chen to enroll . He studied in Nanjing from 1998 to 2001 , specializing in acupuncture and massage — the only programs available to the blind . Chen also audited legal courses , gaining a sufficient understanding of the law to allow him to aid his fellow villagers when they sought his assistance . After graduation he returned to his home region and found a job as a masseur in the hospital of Yinan County . 
 Chen met his wife , Yuan <unk> , in 2001 , after listening to a radio talk show . Yuan had called into the show to discuss her difficulties in landing a job after graduating from the foreign language department of Shandong 's Chemistry Institute . Chen , who listened to the program , later contacted Yuan and relayed his own story of hardship as a blind man living on just 400 Yuan per year . Yuan was moved by the exchange , and later that year , she traveled to Chen 's village to meet him . The couple eloped in 2003 . Their son , Chen <unk> , was born later that year . In 2005 they had a second child — a daughter named Chen <unk> — in violation of China 's one @-@ child policy . Yuan , who had been working as an English teacher at the time of the marriage , left her job in 2003 in order to assist her husband in his legal work . 
 = = Activism = = 
 Chen first petitioned authorities in 1996 , when he traveled to Beijing to complain about taxes that were incorrectly being levied on his family ( people with disabilities , such as Chen , are supposed to be exempt from taxation and fees ) . The complaint was successful , and Chen began petitioning for other individuals with disabilities . With funding from a British foundation , Chen became an outspoken activist for disability rights within the China Law Society . His reputation as a disability rights advocate was solidified when agreed to advocate for an elderly blind couple whose grandchildren suffered from paralysis . The family had been paying all of the regular taxes and fees , but Chen believed that , under the law , the family should have received government assistance and exemption from taxation . When the case went to court , blind citizens from surrounding counties were in attendance as a show of solidarity . The case was successful , and the outcome became well @-@ known . 
 In 1997 , the leaders of Chen 's village began implementing a land use plan that gave authorities control over 60 percent of land , which they then rented out at high cost to the villages . The plan , known as the " two @-@ field system , " was a major source of enrichment for the local government . While studying in Nanjing the following year , however , Chen learned that the program was illegal , and he petitioned central authorities in Beijing to end the system , thereby irritating local officials . 
 In 2000 , Chen returned from his studies in Nanjing to his village of Dongshigu in an effort to confront environmental pollution . A paper mill constructed in 1988 had been dumping toxic wastewater into the Meng river , destroying crops and harming wildlife . The chemicals also reportedly caused skin and digestive problems among villagers living downstream from the mill . Chen organized villagers in his hometown and 78 other villages to petition against the mill . The effort was successful , and resulted in the suspension of the paper mill . In addition , Chen contacted the British embassy in Beijing , informing them of the situation and requesting funding for a well to supply clean water to locals . The British government responded by providing £ 15 @,@ 000 towards a deep water well , irrigation systems and water pipelines . 
 In March 2004 , more than 300 residents from Chen 's village of Dongshigu filed a petition to the village government demanding that they release the village accounts — which hadn 't been made public for over ten years — and address the issue of illegal land requisitions . When village authorities failed to respond , villagers escalated their appeals to the township , county and municipal governments , still without response . Village authorities then began to publicly threaten villagers . In November 2004 , Chen acted on behalf of villagers to file a lawsuit in the Qi <unk> County Court against the local Public Security Bureau for negligence . The case was accepted , and proceedings began in early 2005 . 
 In 2005 , Chen spent several months surveying residents of Shandong Province , collecting accounts of forced , late @-@ term abortions and forced sterilization of women who stood in violation of China ’ s one @-@ child policy . His survey was based in Linyi and included surrounding rural suburbs . Chen later recalled that his survey would have been significantly larger in scope were he not limited by a lack of financial resources . 
 Though Chinese central authorities have sought to curb the coercive enforcement of the one @-@ child policy since 1990 by replacing measures such as forced abortions and sterilizations with a system of financial incentives and fines , Chen found that coercive practices remained widespread , and he documented numerous cases of abuse . One of the women he interviewed in <unk> village , 36 @-@ year @-@ old Feng <unk> , said that local officials detained and beat her relatives , and indicated they would not be released until she turned herself in and submitted to a forced abortion . She said she was later subjected to forced sterilization . Chen also solicited the help of prominent legal scholar Teng Biao , who conducted his own interviews in Linyi . Teng and Chen later released a report claiming that an estimated 130 @,@ 000 residents in the city had been forced into ' study sessions ' for refusing abortions or violating the one @-@ child policy ; residents would be held for days or weeks in the study sessions , and were allegedly beaten . 
 In 2005 , Chen filed a class @-@ action lawsuit on behalf of women from Linyi against the city 's family planning staff . And in June , he traveled to Beijing to file the complaint and meet with foreign reporters to publicize the case . Although there had been prior instances of Chinese citizens filing complaints about abuses under the one @-@ child policy , Chen ’ s initiative was the first class @-@ action lawsuit to challenge its implementation . 
 Although the suit he filed was rejected , the case garnered international media attention . Responding to questions about Chen ’ s allegation , a senior official with the National Population and Family Planning Commission told the Washington Post that the practice of forced abortions and sterilizations was “ definitely illegal , ” and indicated that the complaints were being investigated . “ If the Linyi complaints are true , or even partly true , it 's because local officials do not understand the new demands of the Chinese leadership regarding family planning work , ” said the official . In September 2005 , the Commission announced that several Linyi officials had been detained . But local authorities in Linyi retaliated against Chen , placing him under house arrest in September 2005 and embarking on a campaign to undermine his reputation ; the Linyi officials portrayed him as working for " foreign anti @-@ China forces " , pointing out that he had received foreign funding for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled . 
 = = Detention and trial = = 
 On 7 September 2005 , while Chen was in Beijing to publicize his class action lawsuit against the Linyi city family planning staff , he was reportedly abducted by security agents from Linyi and held for 38 hours . Recounting the incident to foreign journalists , Chen said that authorities threatened to levy criminal charges against him for providing state secrets or intelligence to foreign organizations . After Chen refused negotiations with local officials to cease his activism , Linyi authorities placed him under effective house arrest beginning in September 2005 . When he attempted to escape in October , he was beaten . 
 Xinhua , the news agency of the Chinese government , stated that on 5 February 2006 , Chen instigated others " to damage and smash cars belonging to the <unk> Police Station and the town government " as well as attack local government officials . Time reported that witnesses to Chen 's protest disputed the government 's version of events , and his lawyers argued that it was unlikely he could have committed the crimes due to his constant surveillance by police . Chen was removed from his house in March 2006 and was formally detained in June 2006 by Yinan county officials . He was scheduled to stand trial on 17 July 2006 on charges of destruction of property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic , but this was delayed at the request of the prosecution . According to Radio Free Asia and Chinese Human Rights Defenders , the prosecution delayed the trial because a crowd of Chen supporters gathered outside the courthouse . With only a few days ' notice , authorities rescheduled Chen 's trial for 18 August 2006 . 
 On the eve of his trial , all three of his lawyers , including Xu Zhiyong of the <unk> Law Firm , were detained by Yinan police ; two were released after being questioned . Neither Chen 's lawyers nor his wife were allowed in the courtroom for the trial . Authorities appointed their own public defender for Chen just before the trial began . The trial lasted only two hours . On 24 August 2006 , Chen was sentenced to four years and three months for " damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic " . 
 As a result of Chen 's trial , British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett selected his case for the cover of the British government 's 2006 human rights report , stating concern over the handling of Chen 's case and calling for the Chinese government " to prove its commitment to building rule of law . " A Globe and Mail columnist also criticized the verdict , writing that " Even assuming [ Chen ] did damage ' doors and windows , ' as well as cars , and interrupt traffic for three hours , it is difficult to argue a four @-@ year prison sentence is somehow proportionate to the offence . " 
 On 30 November 2006 , Yinan County court upheld Chen 's sentence , and on 12 January 2007 , the Linyi Intermediate Court in Shandong Province rejected his final appeal . The same court had overturned his original conviction in December 2006 , citing lack of evidence . However , Chen was convicted in a second trial on identical charges and given an identical sentence by the Yinan court . Following the trial , Amnesty International declared him to be a prisoner of conscience , " jailed solely for his peaceful activities in defence of human rights " . 
 = = House arrest = = 
 After his release from prison in 2010 , Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law , and was closely monitored by security forces . Legally , he was proclaimed by the government to be a free man , but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape . The national propaganda organ , the Global Times , expressed confusion over the issue , and suggested that the local government may not know how to handle it , but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level . 
 He and his wife attempted to communicate with the outside world via video tape and letters . Letters described beatings Chen and his wife were subjected to , seizure of documents and communication devices , cutting off of electric power to their residence , and placing of metal sheets over the windows of their house . Harassment of Chen 's family continued throughout his house arrest , and extended to Chen 's six @-@ year @-@ old daughter , who was briefly banned from attending school and had her toys confiscated by guards , and to Chen 's mother , who was harassed while working in the fields . Authorities reportedly told Chen that they had spent 60 million yuan ( $ 9 @.@ 5 million ) to keep him under house arrest . 
 In 2011 , The New York Times reported that a number of supporters and admirers had attempted to penetrate the security monitoring Chen 's home , but were unsuccessful . In some instances , his supporters were pummeled , beaten , or robbed by security agents . U.S. Congressman Chris Smith attempted to visit Chen in November 2011 , but was not granted permission . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the U.S. government as " alarmed " by Chen 's continued detention and called on China " to embrace a different path " . Human Rights Watch described his house arrest as " unlawful " and called on authorities to give Chen his freedom . 
 In December 2011 , actor Christian Bale attempted to visit Chen along with a CNN crew , but was punched , shoved , and denied access by Chinese security guards . Bale later stated that he had wanted " to meet the man , shake his hand and say what an inspiration he is . " Video footage also showed Bale and the CNN crew having stones thrown at them , and being pursued in their minivan for more than 40 minutes . 
 = = Escape and emigration = = 
 On 22 April 2012 , Chen escaped from house arrest . Chen 's fellow activist Hu Jia stated that Chen had been planning escape for a long time , and had previously attempted to dig a tunnel for escape . In the weeks leading up to his escape , Chen gave his guards the impression that he was ill in bed , and stopped appearing outside the house , which allowed him several days before any absence would be discovered . Under cover of darkness and with the help of his wife , Chen climbed over the wall around his house , breaking his foot in the process . 
 When he came upon the Meng River , he found it to be guarded , but crossed anyway and was not stopped ; he later stated that he believed the guards had been asleep . Though he recollected his immediate surroundings from his childhood explorations , he eventually passed into less familiar territory ; he later told his supporters that he fell more than 200 times during his escape . Communicating with a network of activists via a cell phone , he reached a pre @-@ determined rendezvous point where He <unk> , an English teacher and activist , was waiting for him . A chain of human rights activists then escorted him to Beijing . Several of the activists reported to be involved were detained or disappeared in the days following the announcement of Chen 's escape . 
 Chen was given refuge at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing , though the Embassy initially declined to confirm or deny reports that they were sheltering him . The Embassy later said they had accepted Chen on humanitarian grounds and offered him medical assistance . On 27 April , Chen appeared in an internet video in which he expressed his concern that the authorities would carry out " insane retribution " on his family and made three demands of Premier Wen Jiabao : 1 ) that local officials who allegedly assaulted his family be prosecuted ; 2 ) that his family 's safety be guaranteed ; and 3 ) that the Chinese government prosecute corruption cases under the law . 
 The New York Times described the situation as a " diplomatic quandary " at a time when the U.S. was seeking to improve relations with China and seeks its support with respect to crises in Iran , Sudan , Syria , and North Korea . BBC News described Chen 's escape as coming at " an unwelcome time for China 's leaders , " who were still dealing with a high @-@ profile corruption scandal that resulted in the removal of politburo member Bo Xilai . Within twenty @-@ four hours , Chen 's name as well as the phrases " CGC " and " the blind man " had been blocked by Chinese online censors in an effort to quell Internet discussion of the case . On the day Chen announced his escape , Chinese state media did not carry " a single line of news " referring to it . The New York Times wrote that news of the escape " electrified China ’ s rights activists " . 
 = = = Negotiations and exit from U.S. embassy = = = 
 Kurt M. Campbell , an assistant secretary of state , quietly arrived in Beijing on 29 April for negotiations with representatives of China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs . After several days of media speculation as to his whereabouts , Chen was confirmed on 2 May to have been under U.S diplomatic protection at the Embassy . According to embassy representatives , the agreement brokered with Chinese authorities provided that Chen would be freed from soft detention , relocated , and be permitted to finish his legal education at one of several law schools in China . Chinese officials also promised to investigate " extra @-@ legal activities " taken by Shandong province authorities against Chen and his family . Chen left the embassy of his own accord on 2 May , was reunited with his family , and admitted to Beijing 's Chaoyang Hospital for medical treatment . 
 During the initial negotiations in the U.S. embassy , Chen did not request asylum in the United States or considered leaving China , but instead demanded to remain there as a free man . However , soon after leaving the embassy , Chen feared that Chinese authorities would renege on their promises or take punitive actions against his family members . While in the hospital , Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him . Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family . U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy , Chen had been told by Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States , his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong . However , they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten , and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen . On 3 May , Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy , and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China . 
 On 2 May , a spokesperson of China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded that the U.S. apologize for the Chen incident , investigate its acts and never interfere in China 's domestic matters in such a way again . In an editorial on 4 May , Beijing Daily described Chen as " a tool and a pawn for American politicians to denigrate China " . The daily also accused US Ambassador Gary Locke of stirring up trouble by sheltering Chen , and questioned Locke 's motives . 
 On 4 May , after Chen made clear his desire to leave China for the United States , a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson indicated that , if he wished to study abroad , he could " apply through normal channels to the relevant departments in accordance with the law , just like any other Chinese citizen . " On the same day , Chen was offered a visiting scholar position at New York University . On 19 May , Chen , his wife , and his two children , having been granted U.S. visas , departed Beijing on a commercial flight for Newark , New Jersey . 
 = = = Treatment of family and associates = = = 
 While Chen was living under house arrest , several of his family members also reportedly faced harassment and confinement by authorities . His elderly mother , Wang <unk> , recalled being continuously followed by three security agents . The BBC reported in May 2012 that she remained under house arrest . Before leaving China in the spring of 2012 , Chen expressed concern that his relatives and other activists who had helped him evade capture would be punished by Chinese officials after his departure . 
 On 27 April 2012 , soon after Chen escaped house arrest , plainclothes security agents forced entry into the home of his eldest brother , Chen Guangfu . Believing that the elder brother had information on Chen 's escape , police took him to a police station for interrogation , and reportedly chained his feet , slapped him , and struck him with a belt . Police officers then allegedly returned to the family 's home and proceeded to beat Guangfu 's wife and son . His son , Chen <unk> , pulled a knife and slashed at three of the officers , causing minor injuries . He was taken into custody and faces criminal charges for attempted murder . On 24 May , it was reported that Chen Guangfu had escaped to Beijing from his guarded village to advocate on behalf of his son . In November 2012 , Chen <unk> was sentenced to more than three years in prison . 
 On 4 November 2013 , Chen Guangfu said he would fly to New York City with his mother two days later for a reunion with his brother Chen Guangcheng . 
 = = In the United States = = 
 Following his arrival in the U.S. , Chen , his wife , and the couple 's two children settled in a housing complex for students and faculty of New York University , located in Greenwich Village . He reportedly began studying English for two hours per day , in addition to having regular meetings with American legal scholars . His memoir , The Barefoot Lawyer , was published in March 2015 by Henry Holt and Company . 
 On 29 May 2012 , Chen published an editorial in the New York Times criticizing the Chinese government and the Communist Party for the " lawless punishment inflicted on ( himself ) and ( his ) family over the past seven years . " He said that " those who handled my case were able to openly flout the nation ’ s laws in many ways for many years . " In an April 2013 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Chen said that Chinese authorities had failed to deliver on promises to investigate allegations of mistreatment against him and his family . Chen issued a statement in June saying NYU is forcing him to leave at the end of June because of pressure from the Chinese government . This claim was denied by the university , as well as by professor Jerome A. Cohen , Chen 's mentor who arranged for his placement at NYU . Chen 's close association with conservative Christian and pro @-@ life figures since coming to the United States , including representative Chris Smith , pastor Bob Fu , and media consultant Mark Corallo , has concerned old supporters like Cohen . 
 In October 2013 , Chen accepted an offer from the Witherspoon Institute in Princeton , New Jersey , which opposes abortion and gay marriage . Chen will serve as Distinguished Senior Fellow in Human Rights at the Witherspoon Institute , as well as Visiting Fellow of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America and Senior Distinguished Advisor to the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice . 
 On 16 October 2013 , Chen made his first public appearance in his role as a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Witherspoon Institute . He delivered a public lecture at Princeton University entitled " China and the World in the 21st Century : The Next Human Rights Revolution , " which was co @-@ sponsored by the Witherspoon Institute and the James Madison Program in American Ideals and Institutions . The text of Chen 's speech , translated into English , was then published online . In the speech , Chen called on the American people to support the Chinese people by fighting against the oppressive Communist government of China . He reminded the audience that even small actions undertaken in defense of human rights can have a large impact , because “ Every person has infinite strength . Every action has an important impact . We must believe in the value of our own actions . ” 
 = = Awards and recognition = = 
 Chen began attracting international media attention for his civil rights activism in the early 2000s . In March 2002 , Newsweek magazine ran a cover story on Chen and the " barefoot lawyer " movement in China , detailing his advocacy on behalf of villagers and the disabled . His profile rose further in 2005 when he filed a landmark class @-@ action suit taking on abuses of the one @-@ child policy . In 2007 , Chen Guangcheng was named one of the Time 100 , Time 's annual list of " 100 men and women whose power , talent or moral example is transforming our world " . The citation stated , " He may have lost his sight as a child , but Chen Guangcheng 's legal vision has helped illuminate the plight of thousands of Chinese villagers . " 
 Later that year , Chen won the Ramon Magsaysay Award while still in detention . The award , often called the " Asian Nobel Prize " , was bestowed for " his irrepressible passion for justice in leading ordinary Chinese citizens to assert their legitimate rights under the law " . According to AIDS activist Hu Jia , Chen 's wife Yuan <unk> attempted to attend the Magsaysay Award ceremony on her husband 's behalf , her passport was revoked and her mobile phone was confiscated by Chinese authorities at Beijing Capital International Airport . 
 The National Endowment for Democracy honored Chen with the 2008 Democracy Award . Chen was one of seven Chinese lawyers and civil rights activists to be named as recipients of the award . 
 In 2012 , Chen was chosen as the recipient of the Human Rights Award from the New York @-@ based NGO Human Rights First . In explaining the choice , the organization 's president Elisa Massimino stated , " Mr. Chen 's activism has reignited an international conversation about the need to protect human rights lawyers around the world who face great danger for their courageous work . " In 2014 he received the Geneva Summit Courage Award . 
 = Sea Cloud = 
 Sea Cloud is a sailing cruise ship of the Sea Cloud Cruises line . Initially built as a private yacht , it subsequently served as a weather ship for the United States Coast Guard and United States Navy during World War II . The ship served as the first racially integrated warship in the United States Armed Forces since the American Civil War . Following the war , Sea Cloud was returned to private ownership , serving as a yacht for numerous people , including as presidential yacht of the Dominican Republic . The ship currently sails in Europe and the Caribbean as part of a fleet of sail cruise ships operated by Sea Cloud Cruises GmbH of Hamburg , Germany , often under contract to the National Geographic Society . 
 = = Private yacht = = 
 Sea Cloud was built in Kiel , Germany , as a barque for Marjorie Merriweather Post and her second husband Edward F. Hutton of Wall Street fame E. F. Hutton & Co .. She was launched in 1931 as Hussar II ; at the time of her construction , she was the largest private yacht in the world . In 1935 , the United States Ambassador to the Soviet Union , Joseph E. Davies , married Marjorie Merriweather Post . Mr. and Mrs. Davies renamed the ship Sea Cloud . Although Mrs. Davies owned the ship , she allowed Mr. Davies to claim ownership of the vessel . As a man with political influence , Davies entertained many high profile people on the ship , including Queen Elisabeth of Belgium . The ship even served as an informal embassy , as Soviet and United States officials stayed and met on the vessel . 
 = = Coast Guard service = = 
 Mrs. Davies had first offered the ship to the U.S. Department of the Navy in 1941 , but the Navy turned her down . President Franklin Delano Roosevelt objected to the ship entering service , remarking that she was too beautiful to be sacrificed . However , on January 7 , 1942 , the Navy reassessed their position , chartering the ship for $ 1 per year . The Navy sent Sea Cloud from Georgetown , South Carolina , to the United States Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay , Maryland , to be refitted as a " weather observation station vessel " , and had its four masts removed and hull painted battleship gray . Sea Cloud was commissioned as a United States Coast Guard Cutter on April 4 , 1942 , and assigned to the Eastern Sea Frontier , with a permanent home port in Boston . 
 During 1942 , Sea Cloud mostly served as a weather ship at Weather Patrol Station Number Two ( position 52 ° 0 ′ N 42 ° 30 ′ W ) . On June 6 , 1942 , the ship rescued eight survivors from the schooner Maria da Gloria . On August 3 , 1942 and August 4 , 1942 , Sea Cloud served at Weather Patrol Station Number One while USS Manhasset was converted to a weather ship . 
 = = Naval service = = 
 In 1943 , the Navy asked for control of Sea Cloud and Nourmahal , another former yacht converted into a weather ship . On April 9 , 1943 , the United States Navy commissioned Sea Cloud as USS Sea Cloud ( IX @-@ 99 ) , though she maintained a Coast Guard crew . She was assigned to Task Force 24 . 
 Relieving USCGC Conifer in February 1944 , Sea Cloud patrolled a 100 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 260 km2 ) area near the New England coast , generating weather reports for the First Naval District . On February 27 , 1944 , Sea Cloud traveled to be refurbished at Atlantic Yard in East Boston , afterwards taking over a new one @-@ hundred square mile area at Weather Station Number One . 
 On April 5 , 1944 , Sea Cloud received radar indication of a small target at position 39 ° 27 ′ N 62 ° 30 ′ W , bearing 350 ° at 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) . General quarters were sounded and battle stations manned , but contact was lost ten minutes later . The target was identified as a submarine , but after Sea Cloud carried out standard anti @-@ submarine drills with no evidence of damage being inflicted , she returned to port . 
 After minor repairs , Sea Cloud was rebased to Argentia , Newfoundland , where she was assigned to Weather Station Number Three . While patrolling the area on June 11 , 1944 , the crew spotted a Navy Grumman TBF Avenger , exchanging recognition signals . Sea Cloud received orders to report to the escort carrier Croatan and join the five other escort ships under her command . The envoy searched for a raft reported in the area , but returned with no sightings . After this event , Sea Cloud was once again reassigned to Weather Station Number Four . After a search for a downed aircraft , she returned to port in Boston . Sea Cloud was decommissioned on November 4 , 1944 , at the Bethlehem Steel Atlantic Yard and returned to Davies , along with $ 175 @,@ 000 for conversion to pre @-@ war appearance . 
 For her wartime service , Sea Cloud was awarded the American Campaign Medal and the World War Two Victory Medal . 
 = = = Racial integration = = = 
 In late 1944 , Lieutenant Carlton Skinner took command of the ship , after previously serving as executive officer in November 1944 . At that time , black seamen were only permitted to serve as ship stewards . After witnessing a black man save the crew of Northland yet still be denied promotion because of the rule , Skinner proposed an experiment . Skinner submitted his plan to the U.S. Secretary of the Navy and was allowed to sail his first weather patrol with a fully integrated crew . Within a few months , fifty black sailors , including two officers , were stationed aboard Sea Cloud . Skinner requested that the experiment not be publicized and the ship not be treated differently from other ships in the task force . Skinner showed that his integrated crew could work just as efficiently as a segregated crew , if not more so , when his crew passed two fleet inspections with no deficiencies . 
 Under Skinner 's command when the ship was integrated , American painter Jacob Lawrence served on the Sea Cloud . He was able to paint and sketch while in the Coast Guard , notably his War Series . 
 = = Return to civilian service = = 
 Following its return , Sea Cloud received a reassembled rigging in 1947 , and a new set of twenty @-@ nine sails in 1949 . The vessel was painted white , and a gold eagle painted on the bow . The ship 's reconstruction took nearly four years . Marjorie Merriweather Post retained ownership of Sea Cloud in the aftermath of her divorce from Mr. Davies , since she had originally brought the ship into the marriage . After evaluating the cost of running a year round crew of seventy @-@ two , Marjorie Merriweather Post decided to sell the ship .

 Rafael Trujillo , ruler of the Dominican Republic , purchased Sea Cloud in 1955 , trading a secondhand Vickers Viscount for it . He renamed the ship Angelita after his daughter .

 = Second Crusade = 
 The Second Crusade ( 1147 – 1149 ) was the second major crusade launched from Europe as Catholic ( ' Latin ' ) holy war against Islam . The Second Crusade was started in response to the fall of the County of Edessa the previous year to the forces of Zengi . The county had been founded during the First Crusade ( 1096 – 1099 ) by King Baldwin of Boulogne in 1098 . While it was the first Crusader state to be founded , it was also the first to fall . 
 The Second Crusade was announced by Pope Eugene III , and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings , namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany , with help from a number of other European nobles . The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe . After crossing Byzantine territory into Anatolia , both armies were separately defeated by the Seljuk Turks . The main Western Christian source , Odo of Deuil , and Syriac Christian sources claim that the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos secretly hindered the crusaders ' progress , particularly in Anatolia , where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them . Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached Jerusalem and participated in 1148 in an ill @-@ advised attack on Damascus . The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the Muslims . It would ultimately have a key influence on the fall of Jerusalem and give rise to the Third Crusade at the end of the 12th century . 
 The only Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13 @,@ 000 Flemish , Frisian , Norman , English , Scottish , and German crusaders in 1147 . Travelling from England , by ship , to the Holy Land , the army stopped and helped the smaller ( 7 @,@ 000 ) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon , expelling its Moorish occupants . 
 = = Background : the fall of Edessa = = 
 After the First Crusade and the minor Crusade of 1101 there were three crusader states established in the east : the Kingdom of Jerusalem , the Principality of Antioch and the County of Edessa . A fourth , the County of Tripoli , was established in 1109 . Edessa was the most northerly of these , and also the weakest and least populated ; as such , it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the <unk> , Danishmends and Seljuq Turks . Count Baldwin II and future count Joscelin of Courtenay were taken captive after their defeat at the Battle of Harran in 1104 . Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122 , and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the Battle of Azaz in 1125 , Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131 . His successor Joscelin II was forced into an alliance with the Byzantine Empire , but in 1143 both the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus and the King of Jerusalem Fulk of Anjou died . Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch , leaving Edessa with no powerful allies . 
 Meanwhile , the Seljuq Zengi , Atabeg of Mosul , had added to his rule in 1128 Aleppo , the key to power in Syria , contested between the rulers of Mosul and Damascus . Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus ; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129 . Damascus , ruled by the Burid Dynasty , later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140 ; the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler Usamah ibn Munqidh . 
 In late 1144 , Joscelin II allied with the <unk> and marched out of Edessa with almost his entire army to support the <unk> army against Aleppo . Zengi , already seeking to take advantage of Fulk 's death in 1143 , hurried north to besiege Edessa , which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144 . Manasses of <unk> , Philip of Milly and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist , but arrived too late . Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from <unk> , but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines . Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as " defender of the faith " and al @-@ Malik al @-@ Mansur , " the victorious king " . He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa , or the Principality of Antioch , as was feared . Events in Mosul compelled him to return home , and he once again set his sights on Damascus . However , he was assassinated by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son Nur ad @-@ Din . 
 = = = Quantum <unk> = = = 
 The news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145 , and then by embassies from Antioch , Jerusalem and Armenia . Bishop Hugh of Jabala reported the news to Pope Eugene III , who issued the bull Quantum <unk> on 1 December of that year , calling for a second crusade . Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king , who , it was hoped , would bring relief to the crusader states : this is the first documented mention of Prester John . Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at Viterbo , but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First : the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand . 
 The initial response to the new crusade bull was poor , and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that Louis VII of France would be taking part in the expedition . Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope , which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145 . It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage , as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land . It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about Quantum <unk> . In any case , Abbot Suger and other nobles were not in favour of Louis ' plans , as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years . Louis consulted Bernard of Clairvaux , who referred him back to Eugene . By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull , and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis ' crusade . The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146 , and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France . 
 = = Saint Bernard of Clairvaux = = 
 The Pope commissioned Bernard to preach the Second Crusade , and granted the same indulgences for it which Pope Urban II had accorded to the First Crusade . A parliament was convoked at <unk> in Burgundy in 1146 , and Bernard preached before the assembly on March 31 . Louis VII of France , his wife , Eleanor of Aquitaine , and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims ' cross . Bernard then passed into Germany , and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission . At Speyer , Conrad III of Germany and his nephew , Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa , received the cross from the hand of Bernard . Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise . 
 For all his overmastering zeal , Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor . As in the First Crusade , the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on Jews ; a fanatical French monk named Rudolf was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland , Cologne , Mainz , Worms and Speyer , with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land . Bernard , the Archbishop of Cologne and the Archbishop of Mainz were vehemently opposed to these attacks , and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs . Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him , returning him to his monastery . 
 = = Wendish Crusade = = 
 When the Second Crusade was called , many south Germans volunteered to crusade in the Holy Land . The north German Saxons were reluctant . They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against the Slavs at an Imperial Diet meeting in Frankfurt on 13 March 1147 . <unk> of the Saxons ' plan , Eugenius issued a papal bull known as the Divina <unk> on 13 April . This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders . Those who volunteered to crusade against the Slavs were primarily Danes , Saxons and Poles , although there were also some Bohemians . The Papal legate , Anselm of <unk> , was placed in overall command . The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the <unk> , Wettin and <unk> . 
 Upset by German participation in the crusade , the <unk> preemptively invaded <unk> in Holstein in June 1147 , leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147 . After expelling the <unk> from Christian territory , the crusaders targeted the <unk> fort at Dobin and the <unk> fort at Demmin . The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes Canute V and Sweyn III , Adalbert II , Archbishop of Bremen and Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony . When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside , others objected by asking , " Is not the land we are devastating our land , and the people we are fighting our people ? " The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief , <unk> , agreed to have Dobin 's garrison undergo baptism . 
 After an unsuccessful siege of Demmin , a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack Pomerania instead . They reached the already Christian city Stettin , whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop Adalbert of Pomerania and Prince <unk> I of Pomerania . According to Bernard of Clairvaux , the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs " until such a time as , by God 's help , they shall either be converted or deleted " . 
 However , the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends . The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin , as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed . Albert of Pomerania explained , " If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching , not by arms " . 
 By the end of the crusade , the countryside of Mecklenburg and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed , especially by the troops of Henry the Lion . This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades . The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production , limiting their resistance in the future . 
 = = Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon = = 
 In the spring of 1147 , the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the Iberian peninsula , in the context of the Reconquista . He also authorized Alfonso VII of León and Castile to equate his campaigns against the Moors with the rest of the Second Crusade . In May 1147 , the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land . Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast , at the northern city of Porto on 16 June 1147 . There they were convinced to meet with King Afonso I of Portugal . 
 The crusaders agreed to help the King attack Lisbon , with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city 's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners . The Siege of Lisbon lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when , after four months , the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender , primarily due to hunger within the city . Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city , but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land . Some of them , who had departed earlier , helped capture Santarém earlier in the same year . Later they also helped to conquer Sintra , Almada , <unk> and Setúbal , and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands , where they settled down and had offspring . 
 Elsewhere on the Iberian peninsula , almost at the same time , Alfonso VII of León , Ramon Berenguer IV , Count of Barcelona , and others led a mixed army of Catalans , Leonese , Castilians and French crusaders against the rich port city of Almería . With support from a Genoese – Pisan navy , the city was occupied in October 1147 . 
 Ramon Berenger then invaded the lands of the Almoravid taifa kingdom of Valencia and Murcia . In December 1148 , he captured Tortosa after a five @-@ month siege again with the help of French , Anglo @-@ Normans and Genoese crusaders . The next year , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in the confluence of the Segre and Ebro rivers fell to his army . 
 = = Forces = = 
 = = = Islamic = = = 
 Muslim forces in this period comprised small bodies of professional troops , which were augmented by volunteers and conscripts in times of war . The largest of the Muslim states at the time , the Turkish Great Seljuk Sultanate , which ruled most of what is modern Iran and Iraq had about 10 @,@ 000 full @-@ term soldiers . The number of troops available to the Syrian states was much smaller . The core of the professional troops were the ghulam or mamluk , who were trained for war since childhood . The cost of raising and training a mamluk was about 30 dinars ( by contrast , a good horse in Syria went for about 100 dinars ) . 
 To compensate for their quantitative weaknesses , the Muslim states sought qualitative superiority . The professional soldiers of the Muslim states , who were usually ethnic Turks , tended to be very well @-@ trained and equipped . The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the iqta ' system of fiefs , which supported a certain number of troops in every district . In the event of war , the ahdath militias , based in the cities under the command of the ra ’ is ( chief ) , and who were usually ethnic Arabs , were called upon to increase the number of troops . The ahdath militia , though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops , were often very strongly motivated by religion , especially the concept of jihad . Further support came from Turkoman and Kurdish auxiliaries , who could be called upon in times of war , though these forces were prone to indiscipline . 
 The principal Islamic commander was Mu 'in al @-@ Din Anur , the atabeg of Damascus from 1138 to 1149 . Damascus was supposedly ruled by the Burid amirs of Damascus , but Anur , who commanded the military , was the real ruler of the city . The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat , also well known as a patron of the arts . Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty , Anur 's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur 's rival , Nur ad @-@ Din Zangi , the amir of Aleppo . 
 = = = Christian Crusaders = = = 
 The German contingent comprised about 2 @,@ 000 knights ; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king ’ s lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights ; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 550 knights and 6 @,@ 000 infantrymen . 
 Both the French and German contingents had a huge numbers of camp followers , most of whom did not survive the Crusade . As the monk , Odo of Deuil , noted " the weak and helpless are always a burden to their commanders and a source of prey to their enemies " . 
 The French knights preferred to fight on horseback , while the German knights liked to fight on foot . The Roman chronicler John Kinnamos wrote " the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear , and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed . The Germans , however , are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword " . 
 Conrad III was considered to be a brave knight , though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis . Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife , Eleanor of Aquitaine , than being interested in war or politics .

 Joscelin tried to take back Edessa following Zengi 's murder , but Nur ad @-@ Din defeated him in November 1146 . On 16 February 1147 , the French crusaders met at Étampes to discuss their route . The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary , as the sea route was politically impractical because Roger II , King of Sicily , was an enemy of Conrad . Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route , which would take them through the Byzantine Empire , the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the First Crusaders . Nevertheless , it was decided to follow Conrad , and to set out on 15 June . Roger II was offended and refused to participate any longer . In France , Abbot Suger and Count William II of Nevers were elected as regents while the king would be on crusade . In Germany , further preaching was done by Adam of <unk> , and Otto of Freising also took the cross . The Germans planned to set out at Easter , but did not leave until May . 
 = = = German route = = = 
 The German crusaders , accompanied by the papal legate and cardinal <unk> , intended to meet the French in Constantinople . Ottokar III of Styria joined Conrad at Vienna , and Conrad 's enemy Géza II of Hungary allowed them to pass through unharmed . When the German army of 20 @,@ 000 men arrived in Byzantine territory , Emperor Manuel I Komnenos feared they were going to attack him , and Byzantine troops were posted to ensure that there was no trouble . There was a brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans near Philippopolis and in Adrianople , where the Byzantine general <unk> fought with Conrad 's nephew , the future emperor Frederick . To make matters worse , some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September . On 10 September , however , they arrived at Constantinople , where relations with Manuel were poor , resulting in a battle , after which the Germans were convinced that they should cross into Asia Minor as quickly as possible . Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind , to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II , who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece , but Conrad did not agree , despite being a fellow enemy of Roger . 
 In Asia Minor , Conrad decided not to wait for the French , and marched towards Iconium , capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm . Conrad split his army into two divisions . Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real , with much of the provinces being a no @-@ man 's land controlled by Turkish nomads . Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia , and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case . Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road . The king led one of these , which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum . 
 In battle , the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat , and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them . Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople , and his army was harassed daily by the Turks , who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard . Even Conrad was wounded in a skirmish with them . The other division , led by the King 's half @-@ brother , Bishop Otto of Freising , had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148 . The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the <unk> Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147 . The majority of Otto 's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery . 
 = = = French route = = = 
 The French crusaders had departed from Metz in June 1147 , led by Louis , Thierry of Alsace , <unk> I of Bar , Amadeus III , Count of Savoy and his half @-@ brother William V of Montferrat , William VII of Auvergne , and others , along with armies from Lorraine , Brittany , Burgundy and Aquitaine . A force from Provence , led by Alphonse of Toulouse , chose to wait until August , and to cross by sea . At Worms , Louis joined with crusaders from Normandy and England . 
 They followed Conrad 's route fairly peacefully , although Louis came into conflict with king Geza of Hungary when Geza discovered Louis had allowed an attempted Hungarian usurper to join his army . Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim , and the Lorrainers , who had marched ahead of the rest of the French , also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way . 
 Since the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I , Manuel had broken off his military campaign against the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm , signing a truce with his enemy Sultan <unk> I. This was done so that Manuel would be free to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders , who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the First Crusade and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on Constantinople . Nevertheless , Manuel 's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans , and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople . Some of the French were outraged by Manuel 's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople , but they were restrained by Louis . 
 When the armies from Savoy , Auvergne and Montferrat joined Louis in Constantinople , having taken the land route through Italy and crossing from Brindisi to Durazzo , the entire army was shipped across the Bosporus to Asia Minor . The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured Iconium ( Konya ) , but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops . Byzantium had just been invaded by Roger II of Sicily , and all of Manuel 's army was needed in the Peloponnese . Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance , unlike the armies of the First Crusade . In the tradition set by his grandfather Alexios I , Manuel also had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured . 
 The French met the remnants of Conrad 's army at Lopadion , and Conrad joined Louis ' force . They followed Otto of Freising 's route , moving closer to the Mediterranean coast , and they arrived at Ephesus in December , where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them . Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way , and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks . Meanwhile , Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople , where Manuel attended to him personally , and Louis , paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack , marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors . The Turks were indeed waiting to attack , but in a small battle outside Ephesus , the French were victorious . The French fended off another Turkish ambush at the Meander River . 
 They reached Laodicea on the Lycus early in January 1148 , around the same time Otto of Freising 's army had been destroyed in the same area . Resuming the march , the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army at Mount Cadmus , and Louis ’ troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks . Louis himself , according to Odo of Deuil , climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks , who did not recognize him . The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to Adalia , continually harassed from afar by the Turks , who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food , both for themselves and their horses . Louis no longer wanted to continue by land , and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and sail for Antioch . After being delayed for a month by storms , most of the promised ships did not arrive at all . Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves , while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch . The army was almost entirely destroyed , either by the Turks or by sickness . 
 = = = Journey to Jerusalem = = = 
 Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on March 19 after being delayed by storms ; Amadeus of Savoy had died on Cyprus along the way . Louis was welcomed by Eleanor 's uncle Raymond of Poitiers . Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo , the Muslim city that was the gateway to Edessa , but Louis refused , preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade . Eleanor enjoyed her stay , but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade . During this period , there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor , which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor . Louis quickly left Antioch for Tripoli with Eleanor in arrest . 
 Meanwhile , Otto of Freising and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April , and Conrad soon after . Fulk , Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem , was sent to invite Louis to join them . The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time , as well as the Provençals who had left Europe under the command of Alfonso Jordan , Count of Toulouse . Alphonso himself did not make it to Jerusalem as he died at Caesarea . He was supposedly poisoned by Raymond II of Tripoli , the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county . The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alphonso caused much of the Provençal force to turn back and go home . The original focus of the crusade was Edessa , but the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus . 
 In response to the arrival of the Crusaders , the regent of Damascus , Mu 'in ad @-@ Din Unur , started making feverish preparations for war , strengthening the fortifications of Damascus , ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted . Anur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul ( who were normally his rivals ) , though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus . It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Anur might lose his city to the Crusaders . 
 = = = Council of Acre = = = 
 The nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe , and it was announced that a council should meet to decide on the best target for the crusaders . This took place on 24 June 1148 , when the Haute Cour of Jerusalem met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at <unk> , near Acre , a major city of the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem . This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence . " it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council ... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity . " He lists these and numerous others ; " to name each one individually would take far too long . " 
 In the end , the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus , a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids , and attacked the Kingdom 's allied city of Bosra in 1147 . Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as " an act of inexplicable folly " . Noting the tensions between Anur , the atabeg of Damascus , and the growing power of the Zangids , many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids . More recently , historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus , arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria , and that if the Christians held Damascus , they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of Nur ad @-@ Din . Since Anur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers , it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad @-@ Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future , and thus it was better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids . In July their armies assembled at Tiberias and marched to Damascus , around the Sea of Galilee by way of Banyas . There were perhaps 50 @,@ 000 troops in total . 
 = = = Siege of Damascus = = = 
 The crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west , where orchards would provide them with a constant food supply . They arrived at <unk> on 23 July . The following day , the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus . The defenders had sought help from Saif ad @-@ Din Ghazi I of Mosul and Nur ad @-@ Din of Aleppo , who personally led an attack on the crusader camp . The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards , where they were prone to ambushes and guerrilla attacks . 
 According to William of Tyre , on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city , which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water . It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position , and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad @-@ Din if the crusaders went home . Meanwhile , Nur ad @-@ Din and Saif ad @-@ Din had by now arrived . With Nur ad @-@ Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position . The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege , and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city . First Conrad , then the rest of the army , decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July , though for their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Each of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other . A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there , but no further help arrived , due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege . This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat , to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land . After quitting Ascalon , Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel . Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149 . The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor , which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade . In April 1149 , Louis and Eleanor , who were barely on speaking terms by this time , pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France . 
 Back in Europe , Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat . Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his Book of Consideration . There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures . When his attempt to call a new crusade failed , he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether . He would die in 1153 . 
 In Germany , the Crusade was seen as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil . The anonymous monk who wrote the Annales <unk> chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards , noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle @-@ men . The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky . Of the 113 individuals known by name to have been involved in the Crusade , 22 died , 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 is a mystery . Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade , the experience of the crusade had notable impact on German literature , with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade . 
 The cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France , with many troubadours fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond , which helped to feed the theme of courtly love . Unlike Conrad , the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God 's punishments . 
 Relations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade . Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor . The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries . Within the empire itself , the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy . In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop <unk> of Thessalonika , it was declared : 
 " He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill , playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility " . 
 The preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results . While the Saxons affirmed their possession of <unk> and <unk> , pagans retained control of the <unk> land east of Lübeck . The Saxons also received tribute from Chief <unk> , enabled the colonization of the Bishopric of <unk> , and freed some Danish prisoners . However , the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign . 
 In Iberia , the campaigns in Spain , along with the siege of Lisbon , were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade . They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista , which would be completed in 1492 . 
 In the East the situation was much darker for the Christians . In the Holy Land , the Second Crusade had disastrous long @-@ term consequences for Jerusalem . In 1149 , the atabeg Anur died , at which point the amir Abu Sa 'id Mujir al @-@ Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule . The ra 'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu <unk> al @-@ <unk> Ibn al @-@ Sufi feel that since his ahdath had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power , and within two months of Anur 's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq . The in @-@ fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years . Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad @-@ Din after a short siege in 1154 . 
 Baldwin III finally seized Ascalon in 1153 , which brought Egypt into the sphere of conflict . Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt , briefly occupying Cairo in the 1160s . However , relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed , and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade . King Amalric I of Jerusalem allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169 , but the expedition ultimately failed . In 1171 , Saladin , nephew of one of Nur ad @-@ Din 's generals , was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt , uniting Egypt and Syria and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom . Meanwhile , the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor Manuel I in 1180 , and in 1187 , Jerusalem capitulated to Saladin . His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States , precipitating the Third Crusade .

 World Painted Blood is the eleventh studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer . It was released through American Recordings and Sony Music on November 3 , 2009 and was produced by Greg Fidelman and executively produced by Rick Rubin . It is the band 's only album produced by Greg Fidelman . With much anticipation for the album after 2006 's Christ Illusion , members of Slayer were revealing information about the album since early 2009 . There were four different artworks released for the album , each which completed one @-@ fourth of a map , that when put together , illustrates the earth painted with red . There are eleven tracks on the album , with origins illustrating death and destruction , war , serial killers , and the Apocalypse . It is the band 's first studio album to be played mostly in E @-@ flat tuning since Divine Intervention . World Painted Blood is the last Slayer album to feature the band 's original lineup ; drummer Dave Lombardo was fired from the band and guitarist Jeff Hanneman died of liver failure , both in 2013 . 
 Three singles were released from the album : " Psychopathy Red " , " Hate Worldwide " , and " World Painted Blood " . " Psychopathy Red " leaked onto the internet over a year before its release , and was released as a seven – inch single on April 18 , 2009 . The album received generally positive reviews from music critics . It was praised by The A.V. Club , who said that the " resounding success in that regard : It 's eclectic , but never self @-@ consciously so . " " Hate Worldwide " and " World Painted Blood " were both nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 53rd and 54th Grammy Awards , respectively . The album peaked at number two on the US Top Hard Rock Albums chart , as well as twelve on the Billboard 200 and forty @-@ one on the United Kingdom album chart . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 World Painted Blood marked the first time that the band wrote material in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics . The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical . King related : " I was kind of thinking , ' Man , this could be the first record in a long time that 's got a little bit of filler , ' " he acknowledges . " But I think every song came out great . I was concerned some would sound similar , and every one is completely different . It 's cool how it worked out . " The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman . Kerry King stated : " I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record . When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective . A lot of Jeff 's stuff has a very punky vibe this time ; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk , and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash . It works together well . " Unlike 2006 's Christ Illusion , the band was " under @-@ ready " with their lyrics and music . 
 The album was recorded in Los Angeles , California with producer Greg Fidelman during October 2008 and then recorded from late January and March 2009 . There were 13 songs recorded for the album , but only 11 appear on the album . In May 2009 , King said of the album : " I think this one has a little bit of everything — more so than anything we 've done since Seasons . So I would imagine people are gonna compare it to that one . " The band had recorded thirteen songs for the album , seven written by lead guitarist Jeff Hanneman and six by King , although not all of them were included . King later confirmed the album 's release date was pushed back to late summer 2009 . An article on Slayer 's website confirmed the album 's name . On August 20 , 2009 , Roadrunner Records confirmed the track listing . Thom Jurek of Allmusic said the production " takes a different tack altogether for this guitar @-@ manic crew . " A listening party for World Painted Blood was held on October 30 , 2009 at Duff 's Brooklyn in Williamsburg , New York . The event started at 9 : 00 pm 
 During the recording of World Painted Blood , King used BC Rich Guitars , Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs , Dunlop strings and picks , EMG pickups , and Korg tuners . Hanneman used ESP guitars , Marshall Amplifiers and Cabs , Dunlop strings and picks , Monster Cables , and Shure Wireless System . Vocalist / bassist Araya used ESP basses , Marshall Bass Amplifiers and Cabs , EMG Pick @-@ Ups , Dunlop Picks and accessories , and MXR Effects . Lombardo used Tama Drums , Paiste cymbals , Pro @-@ Mark drum sticks , and Evans drum heads .

 Record producer Greg Fidelman said that " the fact that the songs were still new and fresh to them , and they hadn 't been playing them for six months in rehearsal , kept the vibe and excitement in the studio very high . " Vocalist Tom Araya said that there " are two principal music writers in this band , so you 're going to get a combination of speed and heaviness , " and later said that the " writing is really aggressive and fast , while Jeff likes things to be fast , but with melodies and grooves . In making this album , we seemed to share the same vision from song ideas to titles ; when we get together as Slayer , it just happens , nothing is contrived , it 's not thought out , we just do it , and we did that with this new album . " Lombardo said that Hanneman 's writing and performance had " gone back to this great punk energy , especially with ' Psychopathy Red ' . " 
 Allmusic said that it expressed moods such as <unk> , Fiery , Confidence , <unk> , <unk> , Rebellious , <unk> , Anger , and Hostility . It also is categorized in genres like speed metal and heavy metal . Thom Jurek said Lombardo 's percussion beats " are <unk> up in the mix , " and said that " you can understand every word , even on the thrashers " about Tom Araya 's vocal style . " [ T ] he guitars are simply further down in the mix and sometimes it becomes difficult to discern Araya 's bass . Therefore , the first listen or two to World Painted Blood might be a bit confusing for the seasoned Slayer fan , but that changes quickly , and the sound of those drums blasting in one 's head will become a more than welcome presence in the mix . " 
 The album 's title track was said by band members to be the continuation of " Final Six " , which was an outtake from their previous album . " Final Six " origins deal with the apocalypse . " Human Strain " deals with apocalyptic origins as well . The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a <unk> disease . The title of " Public Display of Dismemberment " refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes . Tom Araya said that " Unit 731 " is " very similar to Josef Mengele in the sense that it was a medical unit in the military , which was a Japanese military unit , actually . They did kind of the same thing ; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes . " " Playing With Dolls " is about a child witnessing a serial killer . " Beauty Through Order " is about Elizabeth Báthory , the most prolific female serial killer . Jeff Hanneman explained : " I 've been meaning to write a song about that for a long time . I couldn 't figure out the angle , I was thinking , ' How does a woman write ? I can 't write like a woman I 'm a guy ! ' Then I just figured , ' Well , she 's evil ; she has lots of power and killed people . ' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out . " Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track " Snuff " has no lyrical concept . " Psychopathy Red " was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei <unk> .

 " Psychopathy Red " , a song inspired by the Soviet serial killer Andrei <unk> , was made available as a " limited edition , blood @-@ red vinyl seven @-@ inch vinyl " disc on April 18 , 2009 as part of the third annual Record Store Day . The song premiered on October 29 , 2008 , on a YouTube stream .

The song was made available exclusively at Hot Topic stores and was streamed at Hot Topic 's <unk> The composition was written by Kerry King who said " It 's a really cool track , and Tom 's voice sounds incredible on it . The last line in the song 's chorus is ' .. spread a little hate worldwide , ' and that 's what we 've been doing for 25 years . " Along with five other songs , " Hate Worldwide " was nominated for a Best Metal Performance Grammy Award , but lost to " Dissident Aggressor " by Judas Priest . 
 The title track , " World Painted Blood " , was released as a seven @-@ inch single on November 26 , 2010 , and was limited to 2500 copies . It included the b @-@ side " Atrocity Vendor " . A music video for the song had already been released on June 16 , 2010 . The single was exclusively released through the Metal Club record store chain . The song itself was said by the band to be a continuation of " Final Six " , a bonus track on the special edition of Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion , and deals with the end of the world . Araya and Hanneman have said " World Painted Blood " is " one of the more classic Slayer songs " .

 World Painted Blood generally received positive reviews from critics . On Metacritic , it has been given a score of 78 out of 100 based on 11 reviews . 
 Greg Moffitt from the BBC said that the album " is their best in years . " He also noted that " a few of the songs command the attention with the insistence of old , but quite frankly we were beginning to wonder if they still had an album like this left in them . " Moffitt also said the album was " a deliciously wicked ride . " Thom Jurek of AllMusic rewarded the album three and a half stars , saying " in many ways it could be Reign In Blood Revisited " , and later said that " some compositions on this new recording have more of the band 's early – style melody in them , with lightning flare – up riffs between verses : quick unexpected guitar pyrotechnics ; and blastbeat power drumming from Dave Lombardo pushing it all into red . " Blabbermouth.net 's Ryan Ogle gave the album 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 and said that it " jumps into fairly aggressive thrash gallop , but doesn 't really have that ' straight @-@ for @-@ the @-@ throat ' feel you 'd expect from track one . " 
 Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club described the album as " burden " , and said it " weighs particularly heavy on bands that made their reps with intensity and innovation ; Slayer , in particular , was perceived as wandering in the wilderness during the years Paul Bostaph sat behind the drum kit , and expectations were high for the group . " Pierce rewarded the album with an A – , and said that the album was " eclectic , but never self @-@ consciously so . It rarely flags in intensity , and it 's good enough that if it were inserted in Slayer ’ s discography right after Seasons In The Abyss — the record it most resembles — it would be an almost seamless transition . " Adrien Begrand from PopMatters gave the album eight out of ten stars , saying " it 's a slight improvement on Christ Illusion , as more than on any of their previous five albums , the foursome of guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King , bassist / vocalist Tom Araya , and drummer Dave Lombardo find themselves revisiting the seminal styles of their 1986 – 88 heyday . " About.com 's Chad Bowar and MusicOMH gave the album four out of five stars .

 = Main Quad ( Stanford University ) = 
 The Main Quadrangle , or more commonly Main Quad or simply Quad , is the heart and oldest part of Stanford University in California . The collection of connected buildings was started in 1887 and completed in 1906 . The Quad was damaged in the 1906 earthquake , repaired , less severely damaged in an 1989 earthquake , and repaired again . The exteriors have remained almost the same since the beginning , though the interiors of most of the buildings have changed radically . The Main Quad is still used for its original purposes of teaching , research , and administration . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Main Quad is built on a slight slope so that though the back of the structure is level with the ground , the front is elevated . It is oriented slightly east of north along the Memorial Church – Memorial Court – Palm Drive axis . The front approach is at the end of a mile @-@ long road , Palm Drive , which leads from the main entrance onto the university grounds and is lined with Canary Island palm trees . At its southwestern ( campus ) end , Palm Drive becomes a one @-@ way loop that encircles a large lawn called the Oval . Immediately in front perpendicular to Palm Drive is Serra Street , which is restricted to official vehicles and bicycles . Between Serra Street and the Main Quad are another lawn , some bicycle parking , a long sandstone balustrade originally built in 1902 , and steps up to the level of the quad : the main steps to Memorial Court , the east steps to Wallenberg Hall ( building 160 ) , and the west steps to Jordan Hall ( building 420 ) . 
 The Inner Quad consists of a large courtyard surrounded by twelve connected buildings ( numbered clockwise , 1 through 110 ) and Stanford Memorial Church . Around that are 14 additional connected buildings ( 120 through 460 ) that make up the Outer Quad . The Outer Quad buildings create several additional courtyards . Memorial Court , the most important , is the front entrance of the structure . Besides the front entrance there are also the east and west entrances with gatehouses over them where they enter the inner courtyard . The four corners of the Outer Quad are named , clockwise from Memorial Court , the History Corner with its courtyard of citrus trees , the Engineering Corner with the Oregon Courtyard of flowering cherry trees , the Geology Corner with a garden designed by Thomas Church , and the Math Corner . Other than Engineering , which now houses the Division of Literatures , Cultures , and Languages ( hence is often now referred to as the Language Corner ) , the respective disciplines are still in their corners . Besides the gardens in the minor courtyards , the main inner courtyard has eight large raised planting circles with a variety of trees and bushes . 
 The Main Quad also has open covered walkways around the Inner Quad courtyard , Memorial Court , and around the exterior of the entire structure except for the main entrance , the east and west gateways , and part of the back . Each year 's graduating class buries a time capsule and marks it with a plaque in the walkway around Inner Quad , starting with the class of 1896 right in front of Memorial Church ( the classes of 1892 to 1895 put theirs in later ) ; the plaques now reach nearly halfway up the western walkway . Under the west gatehouse is a time capsule and plaque marking the centennial of the opening of the university , and the cornerstone ( building 60 ) also has a time capsule . 
 = = = Points of interest = = = 
 Wallenberg Hall ( building 160 ) on east side of the front ( History Corner ) is named for the Wallenberg family who gave much of the money for renovating it in 1999 . In the early days it housed the University library and was originally built in 1900 with funds from Thomas Welton Stanford , brother of university founder Leland Stanford and uncle of Leland Stanford Junior for whom the university is named . The second story has two white statues of Benjamin Franklin and Johann Gutenberg . The corresponding building on the west side ( Math Corner ) , Jordan Hall , is named for David Starr Jordan , the first president of the university . It has statues of Louis Agassiz and Alexander von Humboldt . The original statues were created by Antonio <unk> , but Franklin and Gutenberg went missing after renovation work in 1949 and were never found ; recreations were done by a local sculptor , Oleg <unk> , and installed in 2013 . 
 Only a few of the other buildings have names . Building 200 is officially the Lane History Corner , named for Bill and Jean Lane in 1998 . At about the same time Building 320 ( aka Geology Corner ) became Braun Corner after the Braun family and Building 260 ( aka Language Corner ) became Pigott Hall after the Pigott family ; both families have long connections with Stanford University . Building 460 is Margaret Jacks Hall , named in 1980 for the daughter ( who died in 1962 and left a bequest to the university ) of David Jacks . Building 120 is named McClatchy Hall . 
 Memorial Court features several sculptures by Auguste Rodin from his grouping The Burghers of Calais . 
 Adjacent to the Main Quad at the Math Corner is a casting of George Segal 's Gay Liberation sculpture . The statue , consisting of four life @-@ sized figures , was commissioned in 1979 ( the 10th anniversary of the Stonewall riots ) and created in 1980 . It was the first piece of public art dedicated to LGBT rights . Two castings were made and originally intended for installation in New York and Los Angeles , but the statue proved too controversial for either city . The second casting was offered to Stanford , which accepted it as a long @-@ term loan and installed it in 1984 . The sculpture was vandalized several times over the next 10 years but eventually became an accepted part of the public art at Stanford . New York in 1992 finally installed the first casting in Christopher Park . 
 Between the church and building 60 is the Amy Blue Garden with benches , a sundial , and a small <unk> dedicated to the memory of Barbara Jordan , daughter of the university 's first president who died aged 9 in 1901 of scarlet fever ; the garden as a whole is in memory of Amy Blue , a university staffer who died in 1988 at the age of 44 . Also in that area is the Frances C. Arrillaga Memorial , named after the wife of John Arrillaga ; it has unusual acoustic properties . 
 Behind the church is the Keith Memorial Terrace with its roses and fountain , designed by Thomas D. Church who created many other public spaces and gardens at Stanford , and dedicated to the memory of Captain Willard W. Keith , Jr . ( class of 1941 ) , who was killed at Guadalcanal in November 1942 .

 Architect Frederick Law Olmsted , who created the university 's first Master Plan , called for the university to be primarily housed in an inner and outer quadrangle . To design the quadrangle itself , the Stanfords in 1886 hired the firm of " the greatest American architect of his generation , " Henry Hobson Richardson . ( Richardson himself had died earlier that year , and his three main associates were carrying on his work as the firm Shepley , Rutan and Coolidge . ) This group of architects are noted for the Richardsonian Romanesque style , and features of that style including " round low arches , sturdy piers , massive walls , simple silhouettes , and sheltering roofs " are prominent in the Quad . The style was adapted to a California Mission theme . The primary building materials were local yellow sandstone and red tile roofs . The sandstone was quarried at the Graystone Quarry in San Jose , California , and transported to the building site via a private railway spur . Hundreds of unskilled laborers received the sandstone , cut it to size , dressed it , and finished it ; skilled stonecutters and sculptors , primarily from Italy , installed it and embellished it with friezes . Over the objections of the architects , the Stanfords insisted that the main entrance to the Quad be " a large memorial arch with an enormously large approach " . The arch was built and was topped with an elaborate frieze representing " The Progress of Civilization in America " ; however , the arch was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was not rebuilt . 
 The cornerstone was laid at what is now Building 60 on May 14 , 1887 , which would have been Leland Stanford Junior 's 19th birthday . The Inner Quad was mostly finished ( except for the church ) by the time the university opened in 1891 . The Outer Quad and Memorial Church were completed by 1906 , but the entire structure was severely damaged in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . Restoration of the Quad began immediately , but several original features of the Quad that collapsed in the earthquake were never rebuilt : the huge Memorial Arch over the entrance to Memorial Court , and a spire on Memorial Church . The Quad , which was originally built of unreinforced masonry , has been seismically retrofitted several times since then . 
 The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake also damaged some of the Quad buildings . Language Corner and Geology Corner were closed for repairs for more than five years ; most of that time was spent negotiating with the Federal Emergency Management Agency over paying for the repairs . Memorial Church was also damaged but was repaired more quickly via private donations . 
 Most of the University 's other , more recent buildings echo the Quad 's basic pattern of buff @-@ colored walls , red roofs , and arcades , giving Stanford 's campus its distinctive look . The original university plan was to add additional quadrangles of buildings , initially to the left and right of the Main Quad . However , this part of the plan was put aside for many decades until the Science and Engineering Quad was built to the west , starting in the 1980s and completed in 2013 .

 The Main Quad now houses many departments and classrooms and also the offices of the President , Provost , and administrative offices of the School of Humanities and Sciences . The main courtyard is used for University functions , in particular the Baccalaureate service held on the day before the main graduation ceremony , departmental graduation ceremonies , and the annual alumni reunion dinner . A long @-@ standing tradition is Full Moon in the Quad . In its oldest form it was an event at which " a Stanford girl becomes a Stanford woman ... when kissed by a senior man in front of Memorial Church under the light of a full moon " ; now it is a party with much kissing held on the first full moon of the school year .

 " Episode 523 " is the <unk> episode of the Australian soap opera Neighbours . It premiered on Network Ten on 1 July 1987 . The episode was written by Ray Harding , directed by Rod Hardy , and executively produced by the serial 's creator Reg Watson . " Episode 523 " focuses on the wedding of popular couple Scott Robinson ( Jason Donovan ) and Charlene Mitchell ( Kylie Minogue ) . The storyline was devised by the producers after some viewers became outraged by the idea of an unwed couple moving in together . They also believed that the wedding would be " the perfect climax " to the character 's long @-@ running relationship and an instant ratings hit . 
 The episode was filmed in secrecy and with a limited budget three months before it was broadcast . The wedding ceremony was filmed in the nave of The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster . " Episode 523 " is one of only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast . A new romantic style wedding dress made from ivory silk , organza and <unk> lace was made for Minogue 's character . The ballad " Suddenly " , which was written and sung by Angry Anderson , was chosen as the theme to the episode . Prior to its broadcast , Minogue and Donovan promoted the episode by making several appearances at shopping centres around Australia . 
 " Episode 523 " became one of the most watched soap opera episodes upon its broadcast in Australia . When it aired in the United Kingdom in November 1988 , it attracted an audience of 19 @.@ 6 million . The episode was well received by critics and viewers . TV Week 's Kelly Bourne stated that the wedding would be the most exciting television soap opera event of 1987 , while Network Ten 's head of drama thought it was " a major turning point for Neighbours " . The wedding has been voted one of the most memorable soap moments and is often included in lists featuring the greatest television weddings of all time .

 By 1987 , Scott Robinson ( Jason Donovan ) and Charlene Mitchell ( Kylie Minogue ) had become a popular couple with Neighbours viewers , who dubbed them " TV 's Romeo and Juliet " because they were from feuding families . Following months of dating , Scott asked Charlene to move in with him . After " <unk> viewers " became outraged at the idea of the unwed couple moving in together , the producers decided that they should get married instead . Donovan recalled that the producers thought a wedding would be " the perfect climax " to Scott and Charlene 's long @-@ running relationship , as well as an instant ratings winner . 
 Speaking to James Oram , author of Neighbours : Behind the Scenes , Minogue thought the marriage would bring controversial subjects , such as pre @-@ marital sex and HIV / AIDS , into focus . Donovan agreed , saying there was " a valid moral point behind it . " Executive producer Reg Watson noted how each character in the show expressed a different point of view about the wedding . Some , like Scott 's father Jim ( Alan Dale ) , thought it was " stupid " for a couple just out of school to get married , while others , like Charlene 's mother Madge ( Anne Charleston ) , believed it was romantic . Watson believed the storyline would have repercussions for everyone .

 Ray Harding wrote the script for " Episode 523 " . Bruce Andrews from Charles Sturt University noted that it is one of only a few Neighbours episodes to include the entire cast . The producers asked Rod Hardy to direct the episode , due to his experience of directing other television weddings . Hardy believed that " the magic of the episode " is captured best in two close @-@ up shots of Scott and Charlene . The director recalled " The image that stays with me is the close @-@ up of Kylie as she arrives and then the close @-@ up on Jason 's face , and those two looks epitomised what the whole scene was about . " The episode was shot " in great secrecy " three months before it was broadcast on Australian television . The shoot was initially delayed due to bad weather . Due to a limited budget , there were very few extras on set and crew were asked to stand in at the church instead . The scenes were shot in soft focus , creating " a halo effect " around Charlene as she walked up the aisle . 
 The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster was used as the location for the wedding . The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church , which was surrounded by " rough @-@ hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows . " Liz <unk> , the former vicar 's secretary and administrator , revealed that many of the church 's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set . Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age , <unk> recalled " The person who played the vicar , and wore the vicar 's robe , he smoked cigarettes , so we had to be careful that they were dry @-@ cleaned before services on Sunday . Then we waited for months until the episode was aired , and most parishioners were glued to the set . " Scenes featuring the character 's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show 's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively . Recalling the shoot , Donovan told the Herald Sun 's Nui Te Koha , " I don 't remember that particular day well , but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long , long time to put things together . "

 Charlene 's new romantic style wedding dress was designed and made by Isis of Melbourne , a local bridal salon . A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery 's website observed that it was " in keeping with Charlene 's character as the suburban girl @-@ next @-@ door . " The dress was made from ivory silk , organza and <unk> lace . When asked what made the dress memorable , fashion designer Alex Perry , stated " There are so many things going on that it 's hard not to remember it ! The see @-@ through sleeves with a hint of lace , the romantic era @-@ style shoulders , the high neckline and hem . " Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time , Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers . Charlene 's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses , while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails . 
 Minogue was asked by the producers to choose a romantic song to be played in the episode and she chose " Suddenly " by Angry Anderson . Anderson had written the song a long time before it was used in " Episode 523 " . He explained that it is about a man coming to a certain point in his life when he realises that he does not mind being vulnerable . Minogue told Anderson that she loved the song and how the lyrics resonated with her . She later revealed that she wanted the song played at her own wedding . After " Episode 523 " was broadcast in the UK , " Suddenly " reached number 3 on the Singles Chart .

 Network Ten 's national publicity director , Brian Walsh , believed the wedding episode would be an ideal marketing opportunity . He arranged for Minogue and Donovan to attend a wedding breakfast at the Park Royal Hotel in Parramatta and invited four hundred competition winners to join them . Minogue and Donovan later made an appearance with the wedding cake at Westfield Parramatta . Walsh recalled " I 'd never seen anything like it ; there would have been 6000 people . Security had to prevent any more going inside . It was as simple as Jason and Kylie and a wedding cake on stage . There was a speech and the cutting of the cake . Then there was this near riot . We had to stop the appearance at this point to prevent people getting crushed . " The actors made several more appearances with replica cakes in shopping centres throughout Sydney and Melbourne . They would cut the cakes and then hand out slices to thousands of fans . The episode later become the main focus on covers of TV Week and the Australian edition of Time magazine . 
 " Episode 523 " was first broadcast in Australia on 1 July 1987 . Just over a year later , the episode aired in the United Kingdom on 8 November 1988 .

 Kelly Bourne from TV Week described the episode as " the television wedding of the year " and " a fairytale ceremony . " Bourne observed that the wedding would be the most exciting soap opera event of 1987 . The head of drama at Network Ten , Rick Maier , stated " Scott and Charlene 's wedding was the biggest television event of 1987 . ... Not only a major turning point for Neighbours , but a wedding that stopped a nation . " The Sydney Morning Herald 's Michael Idato observed that " Australians packed the aisles for the nuptials of star @-@ crossed teenagers Scott and Charlene " and added that " the nation wept " while " Suddenly " played . Sarah Megginson from SheKnows quipped " Scott and Charlene 's wedding episode is practically the defining episode of what Neighbours was all about in the 80s . This episode featured the entire cast , and audiences loved watching the romance of off @-@ screen couple Jason Donovan ( Scott ) and Kylie Minogue ( Charlene ) spill over on to the small screen . " Andrew Mercado , author of Super Aussie Soaps , called the episode " The biggest event ever in Aussie soap history . " 
 Elizabeth Day , writing for The Guardian , commented " For many , the quintessential on @-@ screen wedding remains the 1987 marriage of Scott and Charlene in Australian daytime soap Neighbours . It was the apotheosis of a romantic teenage love story which brought together two feuding families – the Robinsons and the Ramsays – in much the same way as the Montagues and the Capulets , albeit with fewer deaths and more shoulder pads . " The Birmingham Post 's Gemma Quade named the wedding one of her five most memorable Neighbours storylines , calling it a " tearjerker episode " . Josephine Monroe , author of The Neighbours Programme Guide , wrote that the episode showed the " soap wedding of the century ! " , adding " Teenagers Scott and Charlene tied the knot in a traditional and emotional church service " . During a feature on how to celebrate a wedding ceremony in the style of a soap opera , Tom Cole from the Radio Times said " Who needs Mendelssohn and Bach when you can process down the aisle to power ballad ' Suddenly ' by Australian rocker Angry Anderson ? Sounds unorthodox , but it put pep in the step of Scott and Charlene in Neighbours . Note to groom : we can 't all swan around like we 're Jason Donovan , so give the feathered mullet a miss . "

 The Holy Trinity Church experienced an increase in interest after the episode aired , with some viewers holding their own weddings there . Backpackers also visit the church during their holidays to see the nave where Scott and Charlene were married . The church has since been used again by Neighbours to film the weddings of Harold and Madge , Libby Kennedy ( Kym Valentine ) and Drew Kirk ( Dan Paris ) and Vanessa Villante ( Alin Sumarwata ) and Lucas Fitzgerald ( Scott Major ) . Charlene 's wedding dress was donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery by Grundy television in 1989 . It has since gone on display in the Powerhouse Museum and travelled to Victoria and the UK . A copy of the episode 's script , autographed by Harding , fetched £ 2 @,@ 000 when it came up for auction in London . 
 In October 1997 , the serial 's longest serving character , Helen Daniels ( Anne Haddy ) , was seen watching a video of Scott and Charlene 's wedding , before she died . Kathleen Morgan from the Daily Record commented " The wedding video brought back memories of the soap 's golden years " . Footage of the wedding was later shown during the soap 's 20th anniversary episode , " Friends for Twenty Years " . Charlene became an iconic bridal image , and when Jane Turner and Gina Riley were writing the 2004 season finale of Kath & Kim , they asked Minogue to play the character of <unk> Rae who was due to get married . Executive producer , Rick McKenna , thought that it would be funny for Minogue to dress up as Charlene and the singer agreed . She appeared as a futuristic version of the character , complete with a lacy dress and 80 's style hair . 
 In October 2006 , Australia Post brought out five stamps celebrating fifty years of television . Network Ten 's stamp featured Charlene and Scott in their wedding attire . In 2007 , Herald Sun readers voted Scott and Charlene 's wedding as their top Neighbours moment . A Herald Sun reporter said " No other wedding in soap history in Australia has captured the attention like Scott and Charlene 's nuptials late in 1987 . " The episode became FremantleMedia 's seventh most requested television clip in 2008 . To celebrate the soap 's 25th anniversary and its 6000th episode , producers decided to " recreate the magic " of Scott and Charlene 's wedding through the marriage of Ringo Brown ( Sam Clark ) and Donna Freedman ( Margot Robbie ) . Robbie said " People are saying that my wedding is this generation 's Kylie ( Minogue ) and Jason ( Donovan ) wedding – that 's big shoes to fill . " 
 Scott and Charlene 's wedding ceremony has often been included in lists about the best television weddings or soap opera moments . It was voted the " Most Romantic TV <unk> of all Time " and the " Top TV Wedding of all Time " in a Radio Times poll . The following year saw the wedding place ninth in a list of the most memorable soap moments . In 2011 , the wedding placed third in Channel 5 's Greatest TV Weddings programme . It also came third in Virgin Media 's " 10 Best On @-@ screen <unk> " list . Sky Living included the ceremony in their 2012 feature on the best TV weddings , with a reporter noting that it is probably Neighbours ' most iconic moment . After including the ceremony in their list of best TV weddings , a writer for MSN New Zealand stated that " it set the standard up to which TV weddings ( and terrible mullets ) are held . " 
 = Antibody = 
 An antibody ( Ab ) , also known as an immunoglobulin ( Ig ) , is a large , Y @-@ shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize pathogens such as bacteria and viruses . The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the harmful agent , called an antigen , via the variable region . Each tip of the " Y " of an antibody contains a paratope ( analogous to a lock ) that is specific for one particular epitope ( similarly analogous to a key ) on an antigen , allowing these two structures to bind together with precision . Using this binding mechanism , an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system , or can neutralize its target directly ( for example , by blocking a part of a microbe that is essential for its invasion and survival ) . Depending on the antigen , the binding may impede the biological process causing the disease or may recruit macrophages to destroy the foreign substance . The ability of an antibody to communicate with the other components of the immune system is mediated via its Fc region ( located at the base of the " Y " ) , which contains a conserved glycosylation site involved in these interactions . The production of antibodies is the main function of the humoral immune system . 
 Antibodies are secreted by B cells of the adaptive immune system , mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells . Antibodies can occur in two physical forms , a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma , and a membrane @-@ bound form that is attached to the surface of a B cell and is referred to as the B @-@ cell receptor ( BCR ) . The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure . In most cases , interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and , therefore , antibody generation following antigen binding . Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids , as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms . 
 Antibodies are glycoproteins belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily . They constitute most of the gamma globulin fraction of the blood proteins . They are typically made of basic structural units — each with two large heavy chains and two small light chains . There are several different types of antibody heavy chains that define the five different types of <unk> fragments ( Fc ) that may be attached to the antigen @-@ binding fragments . The five different types of Fc regions allow antibodies to be grouped into five isotypes . Each Fc region of a particular antibody isotype is able to bind to its specific Fc Receptor ( except for IgD , which is essentially the BCR ) , thus allowing the antigen @-@ antibody complex to mediate different roles depending on which FcR it binds . The ability of an antibody to bind to its corresponding FcR is further modulated by the structure of the <unk> ( s ) present at conserved sites within its Fc region . The ability of antibodies to bind to <unk> helps to direct the appropriate immune response for each different type of foreign object they encounter . For example , IgE is responsible for an allergic response consisting of mast cell degranulation and histamine release . IgE 's Fab paratope binds to allergic antigen , for example house dust mite particles , while its Fc region binds to Fc receptor ε . The allergen @-@ IgE @-@ <unk> interaction mediates allergic signal transduction to induce conditions such as asthma . 
 Though the general structure of all antibodies is very similar , a small region at the tip of the protein is extremely variable , allowing millions of antibodies with slightly different tip structures , or antigen @-@ binding sites , to exist . This region is known as the hypervariable region . Each of these variants can bind to a different antigen . This enormous diversity of antibody paratopes on the antigen @-@ binding fragments allows the immune system to recognize an equally wide variety of antigens . The large and diverse population of antibody paratope is generated by random recombination events of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen @-@ binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity . This recombinational process that produces clonal antibody paratope diversity is called V ( D ) J or VJ recombination . Basically , the antibody paratope is polygenic , made up of three genes , V , D , and J. Each paratope locus is also polymorphic , such that during antibody production , one allele of V , one of D , and one of J is chosen . These gene segments are then joined together using random genetic recombination to produce the paratope . The regions where the genes are randomly recombined together is the hyper variable region used to recognise different antigens on a clonal basis . 
 Antibody genes also re @-@ organize in a process called class switching that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another , creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen @-@ specific variable region . This allows a single antibody to be used by different types of Fc receptors , expressed on different parts of the immune system . 
 = = Forms = = 
 The membrane @-@ bound form of an antibody may be called a surface immunoglobulin ( <unk> ) or a membrane immunoglobulin ( <unk> ) . It is part of the B cell receptor ( BCR ) , which allows a B cell to detect when a specific antigen is present in the body and triggers B cell activation . The BCR is composed of surface @-@ bound IgD or IgM antibodies and associated Ig @-@ α and Ig @-@ β heterodimers , which are capable of signal transduction . A typical human B cell will have 50 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 antibodies bound to its surface . Upon antigen binding , they cluster in large patches , which can exceed 1 micrometer in diameter , on lipid rafts that isolate the BCRs from most other cell signaling receptors . These patches may improve the efficiency of the cellular immune response . In humans , the cell surface is bare around the B cell receptors for several hundred nanometers , which further isolates the BCRs from competing influences . 
 = = Antibody – antigen interactions = = 
 The antibody 's paratope interacts with the antigen 's epitope . An antigen usually contains different epitopes along its surface arranged discontinuously , and dominant epitopes on a given antigen are called determinants . 
 Antibody and antigen interact by spatial complementarity ( lock and key ) . The molecular forces involved in the Fab @-@ epitope interaction are weak and non @-@ specific – for example electrostatic forces , hydrogen bonds , hydrophobic interactions , and van der Waals forces . This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible , and the antibody 's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute . Relatively weak binding also means it is possible for an antibody to cross @-@ react with different antigens of different relative affinities .
