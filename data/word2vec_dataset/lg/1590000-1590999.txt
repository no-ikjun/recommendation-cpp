 The Kinks were active for more than 30 years between 1964 and 1996 , releasing 28 regular albums in the UK ( 24 studio , four live ) , and 30 in the USA ( 24 studio , four live , two compilation ) . The early 1960s US albums were slightly different to the British albums partly due to the method that publishing royalties were calculated in the two countries , partly due to difference in popularity of the extended play format ( the UK market liked it , the US market didn 't , so US albums had the EP releases bundled onto them ) , and partly due to the US albums including the hit singles , and the UK albums not ; after The Kink Kontroversy in 1965 the albums were the same . There have been somewhere between 100 and 200 compilation albums released worldwide . Their hit singles include three UK number @-@ one singles , starting in 1964 with " You Really Got Me " ; plus 18 Top 40 singles in the 1960s alone and further Top 40 hits in the 1970s and 1980s .

 = Loop Parkway = 
 The Loop Parkway ( also known as the Loop ) is a 2 @.@ 65 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 26 km ) parkway in Nassau County , New York , in the United States . It serves the barrier islands south of Long Island itself , beginning on Long Beach Barrier Island at an intersection with Lido Boulevard in Point Lookout . From here , it heads generally east – west across Alder and Meadow islands to an interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway on Jones Island , a part of Jones Beach State Park located just north of Jones Beach Island . The islands served by the Loop Parkway are separated by narrow channels of water , all of which connect to Jones Inlet . The parkway is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation ( NYSDOT ) and inventoried by the department as New York State Route <unk> ( NY <unk> ) , an unsigned reference route . 
 The highway was built in 1934 as the Long Beach Loop Causeway , funded with money from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . It was completed six months ahead of schedule and officially opened on October 27 , 1934 , by Robert Moses , then a candidate for Governor of New York , and New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia . The plans to fund the highway included the implementation of tolls , which went into effect on January 2 , 1935 . These tollbooths , once considered the murder site of Sonny Corleone in Mario Puzo 's The Godfather , were closed in 1978 as part of Governor Hugh Carey 's efforts to establish that year 's state budget . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Loop Parkway begins at an at @-@ grade intersection with Lido Boulevard on the eastern end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout . It proceeds north as a four @-@ lane divided highway , crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island , one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park . Here , the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island . Two U @-@ turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island , serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island . The Loop Parkway heads east from Alder Island , traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island . The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections . 
 At the eastern edge of the island , the highway reaches Swift Creek , another channel separating Meadow Island from Jones Island . The parkway crosses the waterway and immediately enters a trumpet interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway . The right @-@ of @-@ way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway . The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30 @,@ 520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT . Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003 , when the department recorded a daily average of 24 @,@ 740 vehicles .

 = = = Construction = = = 
 The Loop Parkway , originally envisioned as the Long Beach Loop Causeway , was conceived as part the original design for the Long Island Parkway System , developed by Robert Moses and the Long Island State Park Commission ( LISPC ) in 1924 . Moses wanted a parkway system to alleviate congestion on " unattractive " local roads . The system was designed to connect several parks that were under construction at the time , including Jones Beach State Park , Bethpage State Park and Sunken Meadow State Park . In 1927 , the parkway system was linked to parkways within New York City 's boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens , and in 1929 , Jones Beach State Park and the Ocean Parkway opened , providing access to the mainland via the Jones Beach Causeway ( now part of the Wantagh State Parkway ) . 
 In May 1933 , construction began on the Meadowbrook State Parkway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway . It was financed by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Washington D.C. , which loaned $ 5 @,@ 050 @,@ 000 ( 1933 USD ) to the LISPC for the new parkways . It was proposed that the loan would be repaid in 25 years . The two highways would be connected by way of a trumpet interchange on Jones Island , with a total of 10 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 7 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 m3 ) of hydraulic fill was used to build both parkways , and a new channel for boats heading to South Oyster Bay was constructed as part of the projects . The roadway of the 2 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) Loop Causeway would be made of macadam pavement and be 44 feet ( 13 m ) wide and help connect mainland Long Island to Jones Beach and Long Beach . 
 Both roadways were expected to be completed by January 1 , 1935 . They were ultimately completed in October 1934 , six months ahead of schedule . The Long Beach Loop Causeway was opened to extreme fanfare on October 27 , 1934 , as was the Meadowbrook State Parkway with parades celebrating the event were held in Freeport and Rockville Centre , and they were attended by Robert Moses , at the time a candidate for Governor of New York , and Fiorello LaGuardia , the Mayor of New York City . 
 = = = Tolls = = = 
 When the Jones Beach State Park Authority was given the loan by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in March 1933 , a toll was planned for both the Meadowbrook Causeway and the Long Beach Loop Causeway to help repay the loan . <unk> were constructed , and a 25 @-@ cent toll ( 1935 USD ) went into effect on both roadways on January 2 , 1935 . On that day , the supervisor with the LISPC reported that 300 people used the highway . 
 In 1975 , the Jones Beach Parkway Authority raised the toll on the Southern State Parkway from to 25 cents , while the Loop Parkway retained its 25 cent toll . The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature , and the Democratic members tried to rescind the toll hike . The power Robert Moses still had in a deal with the State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls . However , the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority . Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $ 12 billion state budget for 1978 , and he proposed a deal to forgo the $ 24 million ( 1978 USD ) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads . 
 After the governor and his department decided that the state could do without the $ 3 @.@ 8 million ( 1978 USD ) that the toll would produce each year , a bill permitting the state to take over the Loop Parkway was passed on March 31 , 1978 . The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year 's state budget . The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah <unk> , who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979 . 
 In Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel , The Godfather , Sonny Corleone was in the process of running to go settle a years @-@ long dispute with Carlo Rizzi when he drove his Buick across Jones Beach from the Wantagh State Parkway ( mentioned as the Jones Beach Causeway ) towards the " causeway that would take him over the water from Long Beach " . However , when Corleone approached the toll on the Jones Beach Causeway , the toll @-@ taker fumbled his money and soon two men approached him with guns along with a fake toll @-@ taker from another booth . All three men shot Corleone and flew back via car to the Meadowbrook Parkway and into Long Beach via the Loop Parkway . A common misconception is that the murder occurred on either the Loop or the Meadowbrook parkways ; however , the book specifies that the event occurred at the tollbooth on the Wantagh State Parkway .

 = St Margaret 's Church , Ifield = 
 St Margaret 's Church is an Anglican church in the Ifield neighbourhood of Crawley , a town and borough in West Sussex , England . It is the ancient parish church of the village of Ifield ; the medieval settlement was expanded to form one of the New Town of Crawley 's 13 neighbourhoods , and the church 's modern parish now serves several other neighbourhoods as well . 
 The present building incorporates the chancel from a 13th @-@ century church which may have replaced a wooden building of two or three centuries earlier . Additions in the 14th century included stone effigies representing a knight and his wife , considered to be excellent examples of such sculptures . More structural changes took place at regular intervals , and a major Victorian restoration by architect Somers Clarke included an extension to the nave and a new tower . English Heritage has listed the church at Grade I because of its architectural and historical importance . 
 The churchyard has many old tombs and monuments , including writer Mark Lemon 's grave and an elaborately decorated table tomb , which is listed separately by English Heritage at Grade II . Further memorials adorn the interior walls . Internal fixtures include a 12th @-@ century font with unusual decorative carvings . 
 = = History = = 
 The ancient parish of Ifield covered about 4 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 600 ha ) of rural land in the north of Sussex , up to the border with Surrey . It was attached to the priory at nearby <unk> by the mid @-@ 13th century . The church was built in the centre of the small settlement of Ifield , which was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 . The present stone building is believed to stand on the site of an older wooden church — possibly dating from the 10th or 11th century . The earliest record of a vicar being present at the Church was in 1247 but is simply listed as ' ? ' on the Church 's list although ' Simon ' took over in 1288 and there has been 53 vicars since then . 
 By the 13th century , the church had a stone @-@ built nave and chancel ; the latter survives in the present building , as does a 12th @-@ century font which was probably taken from the building in place at that time . A chancel arch was inserted between the nave and chancel in about 1300 . The dedication to Saint Margaret is later : it was first recorded in 1489 . 
 <unk> were added to the nave in the 14th century , first on the north side and then on the south , doubling the seating capacity . More windows were also installed in the nave . A century later , a timber porch was built on the north side , the chancel arch was widened and a rood screen was installed , a standard feature of churches in the medieval era , as were wall decorations and paintings . Ecclesiastical feeling moved in favour of austere , whitewashed walls , screens and pillars by the 17th century , and Parliament decreed these changes in the 1640s . The vicar of Ifield , Reverend Robert Goddin , was a strict Protestant who was strongly opposed to Catholic @-@ style worship , ceremony and church decoration , and he enforced the new style rigorously . The rood screen and all internal decoration were removed at this time . 
 The next major work took place in 1760 , when a gallery was built for the choir and the pews were replaced with large box @-@ pews taken from St Margaret 's Church , Westminster ( the parish church of the Palace of Westminster in London ) . More restoration took place in 1785 . In 1847 , the roof was improved and a vestry was built , incorporating wood from one of Crawley 's famous old trees , the " County Oak " , which had been cut down at that time . ( The tree marked the ancient county boundary between Sussex and Surrey . ) A barrel organ was installed in 1850 . Between 1883 and 1884 , architect and archaeologist Somers Clarke and fellow architect J. T. <unk> built a tall , substantial tower at the west end to replace an earlier small tower over the porch ( which had itself replaced the much older bell turret ) ; lengthened the nave ; and removed a gallery at the west end of the church . 
 The exterior walls are of rough @-@ hewn stone , but this has been hidden under modern layers of cement . The church is approached from the east through a lychgate at the end of Ifield Street , the ancient village street . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 St Margaret 's Church has a chancel , wide nave with a narrow clerestory above and narrow three @-@ bay aisles on the north and south sides , a tall tower ( topped with a spire ) at the west end and a porch on the north side . The nave , chancel and chancel @-@ arch all date from the 13th century . The aisles and their arcades are largely unaltered from their 14th @-@ century origins : between them they feature various mouldings and designs typical of that period , including chamfered arches , octagonal columns and squinch corners . Many of the windows also date from that century , while others are a century later ; trefoil @-@ headed designs predominate , but there are some larger square @-@ headed Perpendicular Gothic windows as well . Several other windows contain stained glass . The roof of the nave is tall and steeply pitched , with substantial king posts and tie @-@ beams . It is also of medieval origin . 
 Architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner considered the tower to be " perplexing " , but described its windows and double internal arch as " odd and very effective details " . Unusually , it is rendered with roughcast in the same way as the body of the church , producing a " heavy " effect . It has three tall lancet windows on the lower stage , and a much smaller lancet above . The three lancets depict the Resurrection , Crucifixion and Ascension of Jesus Christ respectively . 
 Many of the internal fittings date from the 19th @-@ century renovations . The baptismal font is by far the oldest feature of the church , dating from the late 12th century . Made of local marble , it has an intricately carved stem flanked by four columns topped with delicate leaf @-@ like capitals and roll mouldings , ornamentation uncommon on a Norman @-@ era font . Its form is otherwise typical : a deep square bowl supported by a wide central column and four narrower shafts . 
 = = Memorials and churchyard = = 
 At the east end of the nave are two large 14th @-@ century stone effigies , survivors of the 17th @-@ century upheaval and all subsequent changes to the church , and now considered to be " high quality " examples of their kind . They are life @-@ size representations of a knight in a full suit of armour and a woman , both lying on their backs in prayer . Most sources identify them as John de <unk> ( Sir John of Ifield ) and his wife , Lady Margaret . There is some disagreement over their date of death and the date the effigies were carved , although 1340 is most often cited . The figures may have been carved in London rather than locally . Their heads rest on angels and their feet on lions . Pevsner had great praise for the effigies , noting that they were " far above the usual standard " and had an " inimitable sideways sway " . Such carved effigies are rare in Sussex — it is more common to find empty plinths or recesses where they once stood — and there are only three other recorded examples in the county . 
 Mark Lemon , the founding editor of the satirical magazine Punch , lived in the parish in the mid @-@ 19th century . He owned Vine Cottage on Crawley High Street , which formed the boundary between Ifield parish and the Crawley parish of St John the Baptist . He often worshipped at St John the Baptist 's , which was much closer , but was buried at St Margaret 's in 1870 . 
 A large table tomb at the west end of the churchyard is listed separately by English Heritage as a Grade II @-@ listed structure . Dating from about 1800 , it contains the remains of George and Mary Hutchinson . The structure is of pale ( but heavily weathered ) stone , including a two @-@ step plinth , with various inscriptions on the sides , topped with a carved urn decorated with putti . The Grade II listing was given on 23 February 1983 . 
 There are several other large tombs from the 18th century in the churchyard — some of which are good examples of the use of artificial Coade stone , popular at the time — and several brass and stone memorial tablets inside the church from the 16th century onwards . George Hutchinson has a prominent wall memorial in the chancel in addition to his tomb outside ; local sculptor Richard Joanes designed it , and there are Coade stone embellishments . Other carved tablets , such as those to Reverend Lewin and Nicholas Spencer , are by obscure London @-@ based mid @-@ 19th @-@ century sculptor T. Marsh .

 St Margaret 's was listed at Grade I by English Heritage on 23 February 1983 . It is one of the three Grade I buildings , and 100 listed buildings of all grades , in the Borough of Crawley . Buildings classified as Grade I are considered to be of " exceptional interest " and national importance . 
 The present @-@ day parish of Ifield covers the west of Crawley and its rural hinterland . The A23 and A2220 roads , between County Oak and the A264 , form the eastern and southern boundaries . Beyond the edge of the Ifield West estate , the boundary extends to <unk> and the farms and rural roads around that hamlet . The northern border is close to the county boundary with Surrey and the southern edge of Gatwick Airport . 
 St Margaret 's serves as the parish church of Ifield parish , which has four churches — one in each of the neighbourhoods it covers — and a church plant venue at Ifield West ( part of the Ifield neighbourhood ) . A team rector , responsible for the running of all four churches and their pastoral care , is based at St Margaret 's . Bewbush is served by St Mary Magdalene 's Church in the far southwest of the parish . St Alban 's Church , a brick building with a tall bell tower , is in nearby <unk> Green , and Langley Green is served by St Leonard 's Church . All of these churches were built after the Second World War , when the new town was designed . 
 = Mercury dime = 
 The Mercury dime is a ten @-@ cent coin struck by the United States Mint from 1916 to 1945 . Designed by Adolph Weinman and also referred to as the Winged Liberty Head dime , it gained its common name as the obverse depiction of a young Liberty , identifiable by her winged Phrygian cap , was confused with the Roman god Mercury . Weinman is believed to have used Elsie Stevens , the wife of lawyer and poet Wallace Stevens , as a model . The coin 's reverse depicts a fasces , symbolizing unity and strength , and an olive branch , signifying peace . 
 By 1916 , the dime , quarter , and half dollar designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber had been struck for 25 years , and could be replaced by the Treasury , of which the Mint is a part , without Congressional authorization . Mint officials were under the misapprehension that the designs had to be changed , and held a competition among three sculptors , in which Barber , who had been in his position for 36 years , also took part . Weinman 's designs for the dime and half dollar were selected . 
 Although the new coin 's design was admired for its beauty , the Mint made modifications to it upon learning that vending machine manufacturers were having difficulties making the new dime work in their devices . The coin continued to be minted until 1945 , when the Treasury ordered that a new design , featuring recently deceased president Franklin Roosevelt , take its place . The Mercury dime was restruck in gold for its centenary in 2016 . 
 = = Inception = = 
 On September 26 , 1890 , the United States Congress passed an act providing : 
 The Director of the Mint shall have power , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury , to cause new designs ... to be prepared and adopted ... But no change in the design or die of any coin shall be made oftener than once in twenty @-@ five years from and including the year of the first adoption of the design ... But the Director of the Mint shall nevertheless have power , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury , to engage temporarily the services of one or more artists , distinguished in their respective departments of art , who shall be paid for such service from the contingent appropriation for the mint at Philadelphia . 
 The Barber coinage had been introduced in 1892 ; similar dimes , quarter dollars , and half dollars , all designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber . The introduction had followed a design competition to replace the Seated Liberty coinage , which had been struck since the 1830s . The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner , and all invited artists refused to submit entries . The competition was open to the public , and the judging committee found no entry suitable . Mint Director Edward Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime , quarter , and half dollar . The Barber coinage , after its release , attracted considerable public dissatisfaction . 
 Beginning in 1905 , successive presidential administrations had attempted to bring modern , beautiful designs to United States coins . Following the redesign of the double eagle , eagle , half eagle and quarter eagle in 1907 and 1908 , as well as the cent and nickel redesigns of 1909 and 1913 respectively , advocates of replacing the Barber coins began to push for the change when the coins ' minimum term expired in 1916 . As early as 1914 , Victor David Brenner , designer of the Lincoln cent , submitted unsolicited designs for the silver coins . He was told in response that Secretary of the Treasury William G. McAdoo was completely occupied with other matters . 
 On January 2 , 1915 , an interview with Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce appeared in the Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record : 
 So far as I know ... there is no thought of issuing new coins of the 50 @-@ cent , 25 @-@ cent , and 10 @-@ cent values . If , however , a change is made we all hope that more serviceable and satisfactory coins are produced than the recent Saint @-@ Gaudens double eagle and eagle and the Pratt half and quarter eagle . The buffalo nickel and the Lincoln penny are also faulty from a practical standpoint . All resulted from the desire by the government to mint coins to the satisfaction of artists and not practical coiners . 
 In January 1915 , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury William P. Malburn sent McAdoo a memorandum about the silver subsidiary coinage , noting that " the present silver half dollar , quarter , and dime were changed in 1892 , and a new design may , therefore , be adopted in 1916 . This can be done any time in the year . " In reply , McAdoo wrote " [ l ] et the mint submit designs before we try anyone else . " on the memorandum . 
 In April 1915 , Robert W. Woolley took office as Mint Director . On April 14 , he asked Superintendent Joyce to request Chief Engraver Barber , then in his 36th year in office , to prepare new designs . The same day , Malburn requested the opinion of the Treasury Department 's Solicitor concerning the Mint view that it could strike new designs for the three denominations in 1916 . On April 17 , the Solicitor 's Office responded that the Mint could change the designs . At the time , the Mint was intensely busy producing the Panama @-@ Pacific commemorative coin issue , and immediate action was not taken . In October , Barber was summoned to Washington to discuss coin designs with Woolley , though it is uncertain whether or not he had already prepared sketches for the new coinage . 
 On December 3 , Woolley met with the Commission of Fine Arts . Woolley asked the Commission to view sketches produced by the Mint 's engraving department . Barber was present to explain the coinage process to the Commission members . Woolley suggested to the members that if they did not like the Mint 's work , they should select sculptors to submit designs for the new pieces . It was Woolley 's intent to have distinct designs for the dime , quarter and half dollar — previously , the three pieces had been near @-@ identical . The director informed the Commission that as the existing coinage had been in use for 25 years , it would have to be changed — something which numismatic historian David Lange calls a " misinterpretation of the coinage laws " . 
 The Commission disliked the sketches from the Mint ( submitted by Barber ) and selected sculptors Adolph Weinman , Hermon MacNeil and Albin Polasek to submit proposals for the new coins . The sculptors could submit multiple sketches . Although the Mint could decide to use a design on a denomination not intended by its sculptor , the designs were not fully interchangeable — by statute , an eagle had to appear on the reverse of the quarter and half dollar , but could not appear on the dime . Woolley hoped that each sculptor would be successful with one piece . 
 The three sculptors submitted design sketches in mid @-@ February , and on February 23 met with Woolley in New York so the artists could make presentations of the work to him and answer his questions . After discussions between Woolley and McAdoo , Weinman was notified on February 28 that five of his sketches had been selected — for the dime and half dollar , and the reverse of the quarter . The same day , Woolley wrote to MacNeil to tell him he would sculpt the quarter 's obverse , and to Polasek to inform him of his lack of success . Members of the Commission persuaded Woolley that so much should not be entrusted to a single artist , and MacNeil was allowed to design both sides of the quarter , subject to his making modifications to his submission . 
 On March 3 , the new coins were publicly announced , with the Treasury noting , " [ d ] esigns of these coins must be changed by law every 25 years and the present 25 year period ends with 1916 . " The press release indicated that the Treasury hoped production of the new coins would begin in about two months , once the designs were finalized . The same day , Woolley wrote to Mint Engraver Barber , telling him that his sketches were rejected , and that models from Weinman and MacNeil would arrive at the Philadelphia Mint no later than May 1 . According to numismatic historian Walter Breen , Barber became " sullen and totally uncooperative " . Lange notes that " numerous delays were encountered as the artists fine @-@ tuned their models while simultaneously avoiding obstacles thrown in their path by Barber . While his observations regarding many aspects of practical coinage were quite accurate , they clearly could have been presented in a more constructive manner . " In his book on Mercury dimes , Lange notes that Barber , by then aged 75 , had been " compelled over the past ten years to participate in the systematic undoing of a lifetime 's achievements " ; he had to participate in the process which resulted in coins designed by others replacing ones designed by him . 
 With the new pieces , all American coins would have had a recent change of design ( the Morgan dollar was not then being struck . ) According to a column in The Art World magazine later in 1916 @,@ 
 Since that day [ the 19th century ] much artistic progress has taken place in our coinage . Sculptors of reputation have been employed with admirable results ... And now we are to have a new half dollar and a new dime by Weinman and a new quarter by McNeill [ sic ] . Altogether , in the retrospect , it seems an incredible achievement . 
 = = Design = = 
 Weinman never disclosed the name of the model for the obverse , and no person ever claimed to have been her . The winged Liberty is widely believed , however , to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens , wife of Wallace Stevens . A lawyer and insurance executive , Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet ; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916 . In a draft of his unpublished autobiography , Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model , but told him it was the wife of a lawyer who lived above his Manhattan apartment . ( Woolley , in a later version , omitted the location , saying only that Weinman said it was the wife of a lawyer friend . ) Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap . In 1966 , Holly Stevens , Wallace and Elsie 's daughter , noted in her edition of her father 's letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman 's dime and half dollar . Liberty 's features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman 's 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore , the Union Soldiers and Sailors ' Monument . 
 Weinman 's dime depicts Liberty with a wreath of tight curls , and wearing a traditional pileus , or Liberty cap . His depiction of the pileus as a winged cap has provoked comparisons with Roman Republic denarii , which art historian Cornelius Vermeule considered superficial . Weinman wrote that he considered the winged cap to symbolize " liberty of thought " . Vermeule suggests that one reason for the use of wings was that Weinman , in common with many in the tradition of Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , under whom Weinman had studied , liked the effect of feathers done in relief . The reverse depicts a fasces , the object carried by lictors , who accompanied Roman magistrates ; on the coin it represents war and justice . It is contrasted with a large olive branch symbolizing peace . According to Breen , " Weinman 's symbolic message in this design ... was clearly an updated ' Don 't tread on me ' " . The fasces is bound both horizontally and diagonally by a leather strap , with the loose ends at the bottom . The lettering is in Roman style , and is made as discreet as possible . Weinman 's monogram , AW , appears on the obverse , midway between the date and the letter Y in " LIBERTY " . The mintmark is located on the reverse , to the right of the first E in " ONE <unk> " . 
 Woolley described the design in his 1916 report to the Secretary of the Treasury : 
 The design of the dime , owing to the smallness of the coin , has been held quite simple . The obverse shows a head of Liberty with winged cap . The head is simple and firm in form , the profile forceful . The reverse shows a design of the bundle of rods , with battle @-@ ax , known as " Fasces " , and symbolical of unity , wherein lies the nation 's strength . Surrounding the fasces is a full @-@ <unk> branch of olive , symbolical of peace .

 After Weinman 's success in the competition , he visited the Mint to discuss conversion of his models to finished dies . The first time , he found Barber absent , but had a productive talk with long @-@ time Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan . Other visits followed , and on March 29 , Woolley wrote to Superintendent Joyce , " confidentially , the sculptors designing the new coins felt that on their last trip Mr. Morgan was much more cordial and cooperative than Mr. Barber was . I realize I am dealing with artistic temperaments at both ends . " A severe case of tonsillitis delayed Weinman 's work , and caused him to request an extension of the May 1 deadline . On May 29 , Woolley wrote Weinman that the designs , both for the dime and half dollar , were accepted by the Mint . 
 As no Barber pieces of any of the three denominations had been struck in 1916 , the pent @-@ up demand was high . On June 24 , Woolley wrote to Joyce : 
 The dime is all right . Please see that working dies for the three mints are made as rapidly as possible , in order that the coinage of the new dimes may be begun quickly . The demand for these coins is exceedingly great . Everyone to whom the coins have been shown here thinks they are beautiful . I beg to enjoin you not to pay out any of the new dimes until you have received special instructions from this office . 
 Two days later , work on dies was stopped when it was decided that the lettering was insufficiently distinct . The delay , however , did not prevent the Mint from authorizing payment to Weinman for his designs . On July 15 , Woolley resigned as Mint director to work as publicity chairman of the Wilson reelection campaign . As the new director , Friedrich Johannes Hugo von Engelken , did not take office until September 1 , 1916 , Fred H. Chaffin became acting director . With none of the new designs ready for production , and small change in great demand , the Mint had no alternative other than to strike Barber dimes and quarters by the million . 
 After the lettering problems were addressed , Acting Director <unk> halted production of Barber dimes on August 29 , and ordered production of the Mercury dime to begin the following day at the Philadelphia Mint . Barber had prepared dies for the Denver and San Francisco mints , but they were still in transit . Small quantities of the new dime had been sent to vending machine and pay phone manufacturers ; on September 6 , two companies reported problems with the coins . AT & T complained that the new dimes were too thick and would not work in their phones . American Sales Machines ( owned by Clarence W. Hobbs , whose complaints had delayed the Buffalo nickel ) requested design changes so that its counterfeit detector could work . Von Engelken ordered production of the dimes halted . In reality , the dime was not too thick , but the rim of the coin struck too high , a defect known as a " fin " . This had been an ongoing problem as Weinman 's design was produced , but was thought to have been corrected . No dimes had yet been struck at the two western mints . Minting of Barber dimes resumed . After an article quoting Joyce appeared in the press , Von Engelken instructed his staff not to speak to reporters . 
 The problems with the dime were a potential embarrassment with a presidential campaign underway . McAdoo enquired how much time would be required for another design to be struck ; he was informed it would take months . Instead , Weinman prepared modified designs , separating the letters of " LIBERTY " slightly from the rim , and lowering the relief . McAdoo approved the revised design on September 28 . These changes assuaged the concerns of both firms . Von Engelken authorized Joyce to produce coinage dies on October 6 , and the new coins were put into production . The earlier strikes , including those reclaimed from the testing companies , were melted , though one specimen is currently known to exist .

 The Mercury dime was released into circulation on October 30 , 1916 , the same day that production of the Barber dime ceased . Several newspapers complained that Weinman 's monogram was too prominent on the obverse ; according to The New York Times , the Treasury was considering removal . On November 4 , Weinman enquired of Joyce whether any removal was contemplated ; he received in reply compliments on his design and Joyce 's statement that the Mint was not responsible for what appeared in print . Weinman wrote again , hoping to make changes to the dime , but was told that only an act of Congress could change the design . 
 Of the three circulating coins first struck in 1916 , the Mercury dime was particularly praised . On the first day of circulation , quantities sold were limited at banks . One Minneapolis newspaper dubbed it the " battle ax " or " golf " dime , reflecting a lack of knowledge concerning the fasces . A letter to the editor in the January 1917 The Numismatist appears to be the first numismatic reference to the coin by the nickname " Mercury " . Lange traced the history of this misnomer , 
 This misattribution appeared almost immediately in the popular press , as writers imagined that the obviously female Liberty was actually a representation of Mercury , messenger to the Roman gods of mythology and quite certainly a male . It is popularly known as the Mercury Dime even today , despite noble but ill @-@ fated attempts by some publications to reverse this error . 
 Chief Engraver Barber died on February 18 , 1917 , having served 37 years in office . His successor was the 72 @-@ year @-@ old Morgan , who had served under Barber for his entire tenure . 
 The dime was struck in substantial numbers until 1930 , with the notable exception of the 1916 @-@ D issue and from 1921 to 1923 , when an economic downturn caused the need for coins to diminish . No dimes were struck for 1922 , the first time since 1826 that this had occurred . With the onset of the Great Depression , mintages dropped again in 1930 and 1931 ; coinage of dimes was suspended entirely in 1932 and 1933 . The low @-@ mintage dates are not rare today as many were hoarded , and <unk> and 1931 @-@ dated dimes proved readily available from the banks once the economy improved . With the economy beginning to pick up again , coinage resumed in 1934 , and the dime was struck in large numbers each year through the end of the series . 
 The death of President Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945 brought immediate calls for a coin to be issued with his image . As Roosevelt had been closely associated with the March of Dimes , and as the dime 's design could be replaced without the need for congressional action as it had been struck for more than 25 years , the Treasury chose that denomination to honor Roosevelt . Mint Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock , Morgan 's successor , executed the design featuring Roosevelt , which replaced the Mercury dime in 1946 , making 1945 the last year in which it was produced . According to Mint Director Nellie Tayloe Ross , a total of 2 @,@ 677 @,@ 232 @,@ 488 Mercury dimes were struck . 
 = = Collecting = = 
 The 1916 @-@ D Mercury dime , struck at the Denver Mint , is the key date of the series , with a mintage of 264 @,@ 000 pieces . The low mintage is because in November 1916 , von Engelken informed the three mint superintendents of a large order for quarters , and instructed that Denver strike only quarters until it was filled . Striking of dimes at Denver did not resume until well into 1917 , making the 1917 @-@ D relatively rare as well . 
 Few varieties are known in the Mercury dime series . The 1942 / 41 is generally termed an overdate ; it is actually a doubled @-@ die error — the obverse die from which the coins were struck took one impression from a 1942 @-@ dated hub and one from a 1941 @-@ dated hub ( until the 1990s , dies required two strikes from a hub for the design to be fully impressed ) . Sinnock stated that the pieces were most likely struck in late 1941 , when preparation of the 1942 dies was under way . Also produced at that time , though less apparent to the naked eye , was the 1942 / 1 @-@ D. Another popular variety is the 1945 @-@ S " Micro S " , with a smaller @-@ than @-@ normal mintmark . This variety was caused by the Mint 's wartime use of a puncheon ( used to impress mintmarks on dies and hubs ) which had been made for use with early 20th century Philippine coinage struck at San Francisco , which had only a small space for the mintmark . Beginning in 1928 , coin albums were issued by private publishers , mostly in folder form , which were widely used to collect the pieces . This led to a great increase in interest in collecting current coinage by date and mintmark . 
 Many Mercury dimes were not fully struck , meaning that design detail was lost even before the coins entered circulation . Exceptionally well @-@ struck dimes display " full bands " , that is , the horizontal bands on the fasces show full detail . In circulation , the reverse tended to more readily display wear due to a lower rim in relation to the relief of the design . Most well @-@ circulated dimes show more wear to the reverse . 
 Although no 1923 or 1930 dimes were struck at Denver , specimens appearing to be 1923 @-@ D or 1930 @-@ D dimes may be encountered . These counterfeits are struck in good silver , allowing the coiner to profit on the difference between the cost of production and the face value . They did not appear until after World War II , are invariably found in worn condition , and are believed to have been struck in the Soviet Union , a country known to have counterfeited US coins during World War II .

 The Mint released a centennial version , in gold , of the Mercury dime on April 21 , 2016 , sold through the Mint 's official website . Demand was so high , that orders were no longer able to placed within 45 minutes of the coin becoming available . On April 26 , the Mint reported that it has sold 122 @,@ 510 units , just 2 @,@ 490 pieces away from the item 's maximum allowable mintage .

 Gwyneth Herbert ( born 26 August 1981 ) is a British singer @-@ songwriter , composer , multi @-@ instrumentalist and record producer . Initially known for her interpretation of jazz and swing standards , she is now established as a writer of original compositions , including musical theatre . Her songs have been described as " impressively crafted and engrossing vignette [ s ] of life 's more difficult moments " . 
 Three of her six albums have received four @-@ starred reviews in the British national press . Another album , Between Me and the Wardrobe , received a five @-@ starred review in The Observer . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Born in Wimbledon , London , Herbert was brought up in Surrey and Hampshire in the south of England . She began playing the piano at the age of three and was writing basic songs at the age of five . She also learned the French horn , achieving Grade 8 by the age of 15 . Throughout her teenage years she played music with local orchestras and bands such as the Surrey County Youth Orchestra and also briefly formed a short @-@ lived punk band called Wasted Minds . At 14 she recorded a demo tape of her own songs at Trinity Studios , Woking ; however , despite music industry interest , she chose to continue with her studies . 
 Herbert went to Glebelands School in Cranleigh , Surrey and , for her sixth form studies , to Alton College in Hampshire , where her musical tastes moved more towards jazz music . While she was studying at St Chad 's College , University of Durham , she met up with fellow student Will Rutter and together they began to write and perform in the cafés and bars of North East England as a jazz duo called Black Coffee .

 After leaving university , Herbert and Rutter moved to London , where they soon met a former member of Boney M , who had been asked to judge a forthcoming Polish television music competition . She and Rutter were invited to enter , and Black Coffee won the competition . Returning to London , Black Coffee continued to perform in local bars , before being introduced to Ian Shaw , a noted jazz vocalist . This led eventually to the production of a debut CD , First Songs , initially credited to " Gwyn and Will " , of both original songs and jazz standards , which was launched at London 's Pizza Express Jazz Club in September 2003 . The Herbert / Rutter song " Sweet Insomnia " featured guest vocals from Jamie Cullum . Described by BBC Music 's reviewer as " a lovingly crafted debut " , the album received a significant amount of radio airplay on Jazz FM and BBC Radio 2 , and was promoted by Michael Parkinson .

 Soon after , Herbert was signed to the Universal Classics and Jazz label and released , in September 2004 , her first major label album , Bittersweet and Blue . This comprised mainly standards , but also included three original tracks by Herbert and Rutter . Herbert 's version of Neil Young 's " Only Love Can Break Your Heart " , taken from this album , was featured on the soundtrack of romantic comedy Leap Year , directed by Anand Tucker and starring Amy Adams and Matthew Goode . John Fordham , in a four @-@ starred review of the album for The Guardian , praised Herbert 's " precociously powerful chemistry of taste and meticulous care for every sound – from a whisper to an exhortation " .

 Herbert left Universal Classics and Jazz to pursue a less commercial and more personal musical direction and then self @-@ financed a project in which she collaborated with Polar Bear 's Seb Rochford in a production role . Between Me and the Wardrobe , an album of self @-@ penned songs , was recorded in three days and was never intended for general release . The album was initially made available , in 2006 , on Herbert 's own <unk> label before being picked up by Blue Note Records , making Herbert their first UK signing in 30 years . In a five @-@ starred review , Stuart Nicholson of The Observer said that on this album she " lets the lyrics do the work for her . They are well thought out , moving between artfully constructed soft @-@ focus simplicities to poignant yearning " .

 In early 2008 , Herbert was commissioned by a collaborative project between Peter Gabriel and Bowers & Wilkins to record an acoustic album at Gabriel 's Real World Studios . The result of these sessions – Ten Lives – was released as a digital download in July 2008 , available only from the Bowers & Wilkins website as part of their Music Club . 
 Remixed versions of these songs were to form the basis of Herbert 's album All the Ghosts , which was released by Naim Edge in July 2009 in Europe to critical acclaim , including four @-@ starred reviews from The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian ; the album was released in the United States in June 2010 . This album also featured two further recordings – including a cover version of David Bowie 's " Rock ' n ' Roll Suicide " – by Robert Harder , who had previously collaborated with Herbert as recording engineer of Between Me and the Wardrobe . It was remastered for vinyl by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios , London and reissued in LP format in 2010 .

 In October 2009 , Herbert returned to Harder Sound Studio to record the song " Perfect Fit " which she gave away as a free download , available exclusively from Naim Edge . It was also released as a single on 7 March 2011 . The track was also one of nine tracks on her EP Clangers & Mash , released on 1 November 2010 , which included remixes , by Seb Rochford of Polar Bear , of some of her previously published songs . 
 In a four @-@ starred review for The Guardian , John Fordham described it as a " fascinating set of variations on the familiar for Herbert regulars , or an appealing introduction for jazz @-@ averse newcomers " , saying that although her songs had been radically transformed , " Herbert 's unfussy soulfulness and personal vision always glow through " .

 In January 2010 , Herbert was commissioned by Snape Maltings as artist in residence to write , record and perform a new body of work based on stories of the sea . This was performed in October 2010 at Snape Maltings . An album of this music , The Sea Cabinet , was released in May 2013 and launched in a series of concerts from 23 to 26 May at Wilton 's Music Hall in London 's East End . In a review of the album launch , The Guardian 's jazz critic John Fordham said that " Herbert 's imaginative narrative , and her casually commanding voice – whether softly nuanced as confiding speech or at full soaring @-@ contralto stretch – were the central characters in an entertaining and often moving show that opens a new chapter in her creative story " . Michal <unk> , in a review for the Morning Star of musical performances in 2013 , described it as a " stand @-@ out " , admiring " a voice that can effortlessly render any emotion with commanding ease . Every song is an impressively crafted and engrossing vignette of life 's more difficult moments and they grab the attention time and again " . 
 The Financial Times ' four @-@ starred review called it " a concept album about the debt British history owes to the sea " . In a four @-@ star review The Independent described it as a " cabinet of curiosities " with " a cabaret approach to storytelling , in rollicking sea shanties and waltzes " , and " inventive " instrumentation " featuring wheezing accordions , warbling woodwind , tinkling music boxes and rolling bells " . Alexander <unk> , for Vancouver 's The Georgia Straight said that the album " blends Weimar cabaret and English music @-@ hall stylings , with disquieting touches of avant @-@ garde jazz " . 
 Commenting on her live performance in July 2013 at the Love Supreme Jazz Festival in <unk> Place , East Sussex , Nick Hasted of The Independent said : " Gwyneth Herbert sings the shanties on her The Sea Cabinet album with happy , cabaret sensuality , detailing a relationship ’ s shipwrecked , sunken past in ' I Still Hear The Bells ' " .

 = Maryland Route 346 = 
 Maryland Route 346 ( MD 346 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . The state highway runs 23 @.@ 72 miles ( 38 @.@ 17 km ) from U.S. Route 50 Business ( US 50 Business ) in Salisbury east to US 50 in Berlin . MD 346 is the old alignment of US 50 between Salisbury and Berlin , connecting those cities with <unk> , <unk> , and Willards in eastern Wicomico County and Whaleyville in northern Worcester County . Much of what is now MD 346 was built as the original state road between Salisbury and Ocean City in the mid @-@ 1910s . The highway was designated US 213 in 1927 and changed to US 50 in 1949 . MD 346 was first applied to Church Street in Salisbury in the 1940s ; this designation was removed in 1954 . MD 346 was reassigned in the mid @-@ 1960s to the old alignments of US 50 left behind after US 50 's bypass of Berlin opened in the late 1950s and the US 50 divided highway was completed between Salisbury and Berlin in the mid @-@ 1960s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MD 346 begins at an intersection with US 50 Business ( Salisbury Parkway ) in Salisbury . Main Street continues west into downtown Salisbury on the other side of US 50 Business . MD 346 heads northeast as Main Street , a two @-@ lane road maintained by the city of Salisbury . The state highway veers east at Church Street . At the city limit of Salisbury , state maintenance begins and the name of the highway changes to Old Ocean City Road . MD 346 passes under the Salisbury Bypass ( US 13 and US 50 ) without access and continues east through a mix of farmland and scattered residences . MD 346 passes through the unincorporated community of <unk> and along the edge of the town of <unk> , where the highway intersects MD 353 ( Gumboro Road ) and Sixty Foot Road . The state highway next passes through Willards , where the highway meets the northern end of MD 354 ( <unk> Road ) . After crossing Burnt Mill Branch , MD 346 crosses the Pocomoke River and enters Worcester County . 
 MD 346 continues east as Old Ocean City Boulevard , passing along the southern edge of Whaleyville , where the highway intersects MD 610 ( Whaleyville Road ) . The state highway curves southeast and crosses over MD 90 ( Ocean City Expressway ) with no access , then turns south through the hamlet of St. Martin before intersecting US 50 ( Ocean Gateway ) . MD 346 turns southeast , paralleling US 50 for a while before turning south toward the center of Berlin . Upon entering the town limits of Berlin , the state highway curves east to intersect MD 818 ( Main Street ) . MD 346 has a grade crossing of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad 's Snow Hill Line track , then intersects MD 377 ( Williams Street ) immediately before an intersection with US 113 ( Worcester Highway ) . The state highway veers northeast to its eastern terminus at a tangent intersection with US 50 . 
 = = History = = 
 The original highway between Salisbury and Ocean City , which followed much of which is now MD 346 , was marked for improvement as a state road by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909 . This highway was paved from Salisbury to Berlin in 1914 and from Berlin toward Ocean City in 1915 . The road followed present @-@ day MD 346 with two exceptions : the highway exited Salisbury on Church Street ; and in Berlin , the state road followed Main Street south to the downtown area , then northeast toward Ocean City on Williams Street before rejoining MD 346 's course . Main Street in Salisbury was extended east from the downtown area to its present intersection with Church Street in 1925 and 1926 . In Berlin , the cut @-@ off between Main Street and Williams Street was completed by 1927 . US 213 was assigned to the Salisbury – Ocean City road in 1927 . The U.S. Highway originally followed Church Street out of downtown Salisbury , while Main Street was also a state highway . In 1940 , the two highways swapped streets , with US 213 following Main Street and the other highway using Church Street from US 13 ( now US 13 Business ) to the intersection of Main Street and Church Street on the east side of Salisbury . That other highway was marked MD 346 by 1946 at the latest . MD 346 was removed from Church Street in Salisbury in 1954 . US 50 replaced US 213 from Wye Mills to Ocean City in 1949 . US 50 's bypass of Berlin was completed in 1958 . Salisbury Parkway ( now US 50 Business ) from MD 349 to Main Street was completed by 1964 and US 50 's four @-@ lane divided highway between MD 346 's western terminus and the US 50 – MD 346 intersection west of Berlin opened in 1965 . MD 346 was assigned to the old alignment of US 50 from Salisbury to west of Berlin in 1966 and through Berlin in 1967 .

 = Death of Osama bin Laden = 
 Osama bin Laden , the founder and head of the Islamist group Al @-@ Qaeda , was killed in Pakistan on May 2 , 2011 , shortly after 1 : 00 am <unk> ( 20 : 00 UTC , May 1 ) by United States Navy SEALs of the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group ( also known as DEVGRU or SEAL Team Six ) . The operation , code @-@ named Operation Neptune Spear , was carried out in a Central Intelligence Agency @-@ led operation . In addition to DEVGRU , participating units included the United States Army Special Operations Command 's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( Airborne ) and CIA operatives . The raid on bin Laden 's compound in Abbottabad , Pakistan , was launched from Afghanistan . U.S. military officials said that after the raid , U.S. forces took bin Laden 's body to Afghanistan for identification , then buried him at sea within 24 hours of his death in accordance with Islamic tradition . According to a Pakistani official , the United States had direct evidence that Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) chief , Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha , knew of bin Laden 's presence in Abbottabad . 
 Al @-@ Qaeda confirmed the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites , vowing to avenge the killing . Other Pakistani militant groups , including the Tehrik @-@ i @-@ Taliban Pakistan , also vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation . The raid was supported by over 90 % of the American public , was welcomed by the United Nations , NATO , the European Union , and a large number of governments , but was condemned by others , including two @-@ thirds of the Pakistani public . Legal and ethical aspects of the killing , such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed , were questioned by others , including Amnesty International . Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden 's death to the public . The Pakistani Abbottabad Commission Report was leaked to Al Jazeera on July 8 , 2013 . 
 = = Locating bin Laden = = 
 Accounts of how Bin Laden was located by U.S. intelligence differ . The White House and CIA director John Brennan stated that the process began with a fragment of information unearthed in 2002 , resulting in years of investigation . This account states that by September 2010 , these leads followed a courier to the Abbottabad urban compound , where the U.S. began intensive multiplatform surveillance . According to journalist Seymour Hersh and NBC News , however , the U.S. was tipped off about Bin Laden 's location when a Pakistani intelligence officer offered details of where the Pakistani Intelligence Service held him in detention in exchange for a bounty . 
 = = = ISI walk @-@ in places Bin Laden in Abbottabad = = = 
 In August 2010 , a former Pakistani intelligence officer approached the U.S. embassy station chief in Islamabad and offered to provide Bin Laden 's location , in return for the $ 25 million reward , according to a retired senior U.S. intelligence official . This story was corroborated by two U.S. intelligence officials speaking to NBC News , and had been previously reported by intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse . The Pakistani official informed U.S. intelligence that Bin Laden had been located by Pakistani ISI in 2006 , and held under house arrest near Pakistani intelligence and military centers ever since . The official passed polygraph tests , after which the U.S. began local and satellite surveillance of Bin Laden 's Abbottabad residence . 
 According to the retired senior U.S. intelligence official speaking to Hersh , Bin Laden was ill at this point , financially supported by some within Saudi Arabia , and kept by the ISI to better manage their complex relationship with Pakistani and Afghan Islamist groups . According to the official , retired CIA officials emphasized the importance of Bin Laden 's courier to the press , because they were nervous over torture scrutiny and possible prosecution . 
 In May 2015 the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag reported that the German Federal Intelligence Service ( Germany ) ( BND ) were aware that Bin Laden was in Pakistan with the knowledge of Pakistani intelligence services . The BND informed the CIA that Bin Laden was in Pakistan , and Bild am Sonntag states that the CIA then found his " precise location " through a courier . Der Spiegel questioned the veracity of the report , produced in the midst of a scandal over BND and NSA collaboration . 
 = = = Identity of his courier = = = 
 According to the earlier official version of his identification from a U.S. official , identification of al @-@ Qaeda couriers was an early priority for interrogators at CIA black sites and the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , because bin Laden was believed to communicate through such couriers while concealing his whereabouts from al @-@ Qaeda foot soldiers and top commanders . Bin Laden was known not to use phones after 1998 , when the U.S. had launched missile strikes against his bases in Afghanistan in August by tracking an associate 's satellite phone . 
 The U.S. official had stated that by 2002 , interrogators had heard uncorroborated claims about an al @-@ Qaeda courier with the kunya Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti ( sometimes referred to as Sheikh Abu Ahmed from Kuwait ) . One of those claims came from Mohammed al @-@ Qahtani , a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23 , 2002 , and January 11 , 2003 . At some point during this period , al @-@ Qahtani told interrogators about a man known as Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti who was part of the inner circle of al @-@ Qaeda . Later in 2003 , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged operational chief of al @-@ Qaeda , stated that he was acquainted with al @-@ Kuwaiti , but that the man was not active in al @-@ Qaeda , according to a U.S. official . 
 According to a U.S. official , in 2004 a prisoner named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden relied on a trusted courier known as al @-@ Kuwaiti . Ghul stated that al @-@ Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed 's successor Abu Faraj al @-@ Libbi . Ghul revealed that al @-@ Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time , which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden . When confronted with Ghul 's account , Mohammed maintained his original story . Abu Faraj al @-@ Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 . He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden 's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al @-@ Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al @-@ Kuwaiti . Because both Mohammed and al @-@ Libbi had minimized al @-@ Kuwaiti 's importance , officials speculated that he was part of bin Laden 's inner circle . 
 In 2007 , officials learned al @-@ Kuwaiti 's real name , though they said they would disclose neither the name nor how they learned it . Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier 's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed , from Pakistan 's Swat Valley . He and his brother Abrar and their families were living at bin Laden 's compound , the officials said . 
 Since the name Maulawi Abd al @-@ Khaliq Jan appears in the JTF @-@ GTMO detainee assessment for Abu Faraj al @-@ Libbi released by WikiLeaks on April 24 , 2011 , there was speculation that the U.S. assault on the Abbottabad compound was expedited as a precaution . The CIA never found anyone named Maulawi Jan and concluded that the name was an invention of al @-@ Libbi . 
 A 2010 wiretap of another suspect picked up a conversation with al @-@ Kuwaiti . CIA paramilitary operatives located al @-@ Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound , which led them to speculate it was bin Laden 's location . 
 The courier and a relative ( who was either a brother or a cousin ) were killed in the May 2 , 2011 , raid . Afterward , some locals identified the men as Pashtuns named Arshad and Tareq Khan . Arshad Khan was carrying an old , <unk> Pakistani identification card , which identified him as from Khat <unk> , a village near <unk> in northwestern Pakistan . Pakistani officials have found no record of an Arshad Khan in that area and suspect the men were living under false identities . 
 = = = Bin Laden 's compound = = = 
 The CIA used surveillance photos and intelligence reports to determine the identities of the inhabitants of the Abbottabad compound to which the courier was traveling . In September 2010 , the CIA concluded that the compound was custom @-@ built to hide someone of significance , very likely bin Laden . Officials surmised that he was living there with his youngest wife and family . 
 Built in 2004 , the three @-@ story compound was located at the end of a narrow dirt road . Google Earth maps made from satellite photographs show that the compound was not present in 2001 but had been built by the time that new images were taken in 2005 . It is located 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) northeast of the city center of Abbottabad . Abbottabad is about 100 miles ( 160 km ) from the Afghanistan border on the far eastern side of Pakistan ( about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from India ) . The compound is 0 @.@ 8 miles ( 1 @.@ 3 km ) southwest of the Pakistan Military Academy . Located on a plot of land eight times larger than those of nearby houses , the compound was surrounded by a 12 @-@ to @-@ 18 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 – 5 @.@ 5 m ) concrete wall topped with barbed wire . It had two security gates , and the third @-@ floor balcony had a seven @-@ foot @-@ high ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) privacy wall , tall enough to hide the 6 ft 4 in ( 193 cm ) bin Laden . 
 The compound had no Internet or landline telephone service . Its residents burned their refuse , unlike their neighbors , who set their garbage out for collection . Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli , because they believed the owner was from Waziristan . Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden , the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012 . 
 = = = Intelligence gathering = = = 
 The CIA led the effort to <unk> and gather intelligence on the compound ; other critical roles in the operation were played by other United States agencies , including the National Security Agency , National Geospatial @-@ Intelligence Agency ( NGA ) , Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( <unk> ) , and U.S. Defense Department . According to The Washington Post , " The [ intelligence @-@ gathering ] effort was so extensive and costly that the CIA went to Congress in December [ 2010 ] to secure authority to reallocate tens of millions of dollars within assorted agency budgets to fund it " , U.S. officials said . 
 The CIA rented a home in Abbottabad from which a team staked out and observed the compound over a number of months . The CIA team used informants and other techniques – including a widely criticised fake vaccination program – to gather intelligence on the compound . The safe house was abandoned immediately after bin Laden 's death . The U.S. National Geospatial @-@ Intelligence Agency helped the Joint Special Operations Command create mission simulators for the pilots , and analyzed data from an RQ @-@ 170 drone before , during and after the raid on the compound . The NGA created three @-@ dimensional renderings of the house , created schedules describing residential traffic patterns , and assessed the number , height and gender of the residents of the compound . Also involved in the intelligence gathering measures were an arm of the National Security Agency known as the Tailored Access Operations group which , among other things , is specialized in surreptitiously installing spyware and tracking devices on targeted computers and mobile @-@ phone networks . Because of the work of the Tailored Access Operations group , the NSA could collect intelligence from mobile phones that were used by al @-@ Qaeda operatives and other " persons of interest " in the hunt for bin Laden . 
 The design of bin Laden 's compound may have ultimately contributed to his discovery . A former CIA official involved in the manhunt told The Washington Post , " The place was three stories high , and you could watch it from a variety of angles . " 
 The CIA used a process called " red teaming " on the collected intelligence to independently review the circumstantial evidence and available facts of their case that bin Laden was living at the Abbottabad compound . An administration official stated , " We conducted red @-@ team exercises and other forms of alternative analysis to check our work . No other candidate fit the bill as well as bin Laden did . " This duplicate analysis was necessary because 
 Despite what officials described as an extraordinarily concentrated collection effort leading up to the operation , no U.S. spy agency was ever able to capture a photograph of bin Laden at the compound before the raid or a recording of the voice of the mysterious male figure whose family occupied the structure 's top two floors .

 The Associated Press reported at the time two U.S. officials as stating the operation was " a kill @-@ or @-@ capture mission , since the U.S. doesn 't kill unarmed people trying to surrender " , but that " it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering " . White House counterterrorism advisor John O. Brennan said after the raid : " If we had the opportunity to take bin Laden alive , if he didn 't present any threat , the individuals involved were able and prepared to do that . " CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour : " The authority here was to kill bin Laden . ... Obviously under the rules of engagement , if he in fact had thrown up his hands , surrendered and didn 't appear to be representing any kind of threat , then they were to capture him . But , they had full authority to kill him . " 
 A U.S. national security official , who was not named , told Reuters that " ' this was a kill operation ' , making clear there was no desire to try to capture bin Laden alive in Pakistan " . Another source referencing a kill ( rather than capture ) order stated , " Officials described the reaction of the special operators when they were told a number of weeks ago that they had been chosen to train for the mission . ' They were told , " We think we found Osama bin Laden , and your job is to kill him , " ' an official recalled . The SEALs started to cheer . " 
 = = = Planning and final decision = = = 
 The CIA briefed Vice Admiral William H. McRaven , the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command ( JSOC ) , about the compound in January 2011 . McRaven said a commando raid would be fairly straightforward but he was concerned about the Pakistani response . He assigned a captain from the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group ( DEVGRU ) to work with a CIA team at their campus in Langley , Virginia . The captain , named " Brian " , set up an office in the printing plant in the CIA 's Langley compound and , with six other JSOC officers , began to plan the raid . Administration attorneys did an analysis on the legal issues and options before the raid . 
 In addition to a helicopter raid , planners considered attacking the compound with B @-@ 2 Spirit stealth bombers . They considered a joint operation with Pakistani forces . Obama , however , decided that the Pakistani government and military could not be trusted to maintain operational security for the operation against bin Laden . " There was a real lack of confidence that the Pakistanis could keep this secret for more than a nanosecond , " a senior adviser to the President told The New Yorker . 
 Obama met with the National Security Council on March 14 to review the options . The President was concerned that the mission would be exposed and wanted to proceed quickly . For that reason he ruled out involving the Pakistanis . Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials expressed doubts as to whether bin Laden was in the compound , and whether a commando raid was worth the risk . At the end of the meeting , the president seemed to be leaning toward a bombing mission . Two U.S. Air Force officers were tasked with exploring that option further . 
 The CIA was unable to rule out the existence of an underground bunker below the compound . Presuming that one existed , 32 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 910 kg ) bombs fitted with JDAM guidance systems would be required to destroy it . With that amount of ordnance , at least one other house was in the blast radius . Estimates were that up to a dozen civilians would be killed in addition to those in the compound . Furthermore , it was unlikely there would be enough evidence remaining to prove that bin Laden was dead . Presented with this information at the next Security Council meeting on March 29 , Obama put the bombing plan on hold . Instead he directed Admiral McRaven to develop the plan for a helicopter raid . The U.S. intelligence community also studied an option of hitting bin Laden with a drone @-@ fired small tactical munition as he paced in his compound 's vegetable garden . 
 McRaven assembled a team drawing from the most experienced and senior operators from Red Squadron , one of four that make up DEVGRU . Red Squadron was coming home from Afghanistan and could be redirected without attracting attention . The team had language skills and experience with cross @-@ border operations into Pakistan . Without being told the exact nature of their mission , the team performed rehearsals of the raid in two locations in the U.S. — around April 10 at Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity facility in North Carolina where a 1 : 1 version of bin Laden 's compound was built , and April 18 in Nevada . The location in Nevada was at 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) elevation — chosen to test the effects the altitude would have on the raiders ' helicopters . The Nevada mock @-@ up used chain @-@ link fences to simulate the compound walls , which left the U.S. participants unaware of the potential effects of the high compound walls on the helicopters ' lift capabilities . 
 Planners believed the SEALs could get to Abbottabad and back without being challenged by the Pakistani military . The helicopters to be used in the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility . Since the U.S. had helped equip and train the Pakistanis , their defensive capabilities were known . The U.S. had supplied F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcons to Pakistan on the condition they were kept at a Pakistani military base under 24 @-@ hour U.S. surveillance . 
 If bin Laden surrendered , he would be held near Bagram Air Base . If the SEALs were discovered by the Pakistanis in the middle of the raid , Joint Chiefs Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen would call Pakistan 's army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani and try to negotiate their release . 
 When the National Security Council ( NSC ) met again on April 19 , Obama gave provisional approval for the helicopter raid . But as he worried that the plan for dealing with the Pakistanis was too uncertain , Obama asked Admiral McRaven to equip the team to fight its way out if necessary . 
 McRaven and the SEALs left for Afghanistan to practice at a one @-@ acre , full @-@ scale replica of the compound built on a restricted area of Bagram known as Camp Alpha . The team departed the U.S. from Naval Air Station Oceana on April 26 in a C @-@ 17 aircraft , refueled on the ground at Ramstein Air Base in Germany , landed at Bagram Air Base , then moved to Jalalabad on April 27 . 
 On April 28 , Admiral Mullen explained the final plan to the NSC . To bolster the " fight your way out " scenario , Chinook helicopters with additional troops would be positioned nearby . Most of the advisers in the meeting supported going forward with the raid . Only Vice President Biden completely opposed it . Gates advocated using the drone missile option , but changed his support the next day to the helicopter raid plan . Obama said he wanted to speak directly to Admiral McRaven before he gave the order to proceed . The president asked if McRaven had learned anything since arriving in Afghanistan that caused him to lose confidence in the mission . McRaven told him the team was ready and that the next few nights would have little moonlight over Abbottabad , good conditions for a raid . 
 On April 29 at 8 : 20 a.m. EDT , Obama conferred with his advisers and gave the final go @-@ ahead . The raid would take place the following day . That evening the president was informed that the operation would be delayed one day due to cloudy weather . 
 On April 30 , Obama called McRaven one more time to wish the SEALs well and to thank them for their service . That evening , the President attended the annual White House Correspondent 's Association dinner , which was hosted by comedian and television actor Seth Meyers . At one point , Meyers joked : " People think bin Laden is hiding in the Hindu Kush , but did you know that every day from 4 to 5 he hosts a show on C @-@ SPAN ? " Obama laughed , despite his knowledge of the operation to come . 
 On May 1 at 1 : 22 p.m. , Panetta , acting on the president 's orders , directed McRaven to move forward with the operation . Shortly after 3 p.m. , the president joined national security officials in the Situation Room to monitor the raid . They watched night @-@ vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta , appearing in a corner of the screen from CIA headquarters , narrated what was happening . Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up in the Situation Room . In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb , assistant commander of JSOC . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those in the Situation Room , and described it like this : " Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies , we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself . All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground . I looked at the President . He was calm . Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day . " Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad .

 = = = = Approach and entry = = = = 
 The raid was carried out by approximately two dozen heliborne U.S. Navy SEALs from the Red Squadron of the Joint Special Operations Command 's U.S. Naval Special Warfare Development Group ( DEVGRU ) . For legal reasons ( namely that the U.S. was not at war with Pakistan ) , the military personnel assigned to the mission were temporarily transferred to the control of the civilian Central Intelligence Agency . The DEVGRU SEALs operated in two teams and were reportedly equipped with Heckler & Koch HK416 military assault rifles , Mark 48 machine guns used for fire support , FN <unk> @-@ H STD Mk 17 battle rifles and Heckler & Koch <unk> personal defense weapons ( with attached Knight 's Armament <unk> @-@ <unk> suppressors ) , Insight Technology AN / <unk> @-@ 6 and <unk> @-@ 18 ( Ground Panoramic Night Vision Goggles ) L @-@ 3 night @-@ vision goggles , body armor and sidearms such as SIG Sauer <unk> Navy <unk> and H & K Mark 23 Mod 0 . 
 According to The New York Times , a total of " 79 commandos and a dog " were involved in the raid . The military working dog was a Belgian <unk> named Cairo . According to one report , the dog was tasked with tracking " anyone who tried to escape and to alert SEALs to any approaching Pakistani security forces " . The dog was to be used to help deter any Pakistani ground response to the raid and to help look for any hidden rooms or hidden doors in the compound . Additional personnel on the mission included a language interpreter , the dog handler , helicopter pilots , " tactical signals , intelligence collectors , and navigators using highly classified hyperspectral <unk> " . 
 The SEALs flew into Pakistan from a staging base in the city of Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan after originating at Bagram Air Base in northeastern Afghanistan . The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( SOAR ) , a U.S. Army Special Operations Command unit known as the " Night Stalkers " , provided the two modified Black Hawk helicopters that were used for the raid itself , as well as the much larger Chinook heavy @-@ lift helicopters that were employed as backups . 
 The Black Hawks appear to have been never @-@ before @-@ publicly @-@ seen " stealth " versions of the helicopter that fly more quietly while being harder to detect on radar than conventional models ; due to the weight of the extra stealth equipment on the Black Hawks , cargo was " calculated to the ounce , with the weather factored in . " 
 The Chinooks kept on standby were on the ground " in a deserted area roughly two @-@ thirds of the way " from Jalalabad to Abbottabad , with two additional SEAL teams consisting of approximately 24 DEVGRU operators for a " quick reaction force " ( QRF ) . The Chinooks were equipped with 7.62mm GAU @-@ 17 / A miniguns and GAU @-@ 21 / B .50 @-@ caliber machine guns and extra fuel for the Black Hawks . Their mission was to interdict any Pakistani military attempts to interfere with the raid . Other Chinooks , holding 25 more SEALs from DEVGRU , were stationed just across the border in Afghanistan in case reinforcements were needed during the raid . 
 The 160th SOAR helicopters were supported by multiple other aircraft , including fixed @-@ wing fighter jets and drones . According to CNN , " the Air Force had a full team of combat search @-@ and @-@ rescue helicopters available " . 
 The raid was scheduled for a time with little moonlight so the helicopters could enter Pakistan " low to the ground and undetected " . The helicopters used hilly terrain and nap @-@ of @-@ the @-@ earth techniques to reach the compound without appearing on radar and alerting the Pakistani military . The flight from Jalalabad to Abbottabad took about 90 minutes . 
 According to the mission plan , the first helicopter would hover over the compound 's yard while its full team of SEALs fast @-@ roped to the ground . At the same time , the second helicopter would fly to the northeast corner of the compound and deploy the interpreter , the dog and handler , and four SEALs to secure the perimeter . The team in the courtyard was to enter the house from the ground floor . 
 As they hovered above the target , however , the first helicopter experienced a hazardous airflow condition known as a vortex ring state . This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ( " a so @-@ called ' hot and high ' environment " ) and the high compound walls , which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing . The helicopter 's tail grazed one of the compound 's walls , damaging its tail rotor , and the helicopter rolled onto its side . The pilot quickly buried the aircraft 's nose to keep it from tipping over . None of the SEALs , crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing , which ended with it pitched at a 45 @-@ degree angle resting against the wall . The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside . The SEALs advanced into the house , breaching walls and doors with explosives . 
 = = = = Killing of bin Laden = = = = 
 The SEALs encountered the residents in the compound 's guest house , in the main building on the first floor where two adult males lived , and on the second and third floors where bin Laden lived with his family . The second and third floors were the last section of the compound to be cleared . There were reportedly " small knots of children ... on every level , including the balcony of bin Laden 's room " . 
 Osama bin Laden was killed in the raid , and initial versions said three other men and a woman were killed as well : bin Laden 's adult son Khalid , bin Laden 's courier ( Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti ) , al @-@ Kuwaiti 's brother Abrar , and Abrar 's wife Bushra . 
 An intelligence official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire @-@ fight took place . In the earlier versions , Al @-@ Kuwaiti is said to have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK @-@ 47 from behind the guesthouse door , lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments . A short firefight took place between al @-@ Kuwaiti and the SEALs , in which al @-@ Kuwaiti was killed . His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder . The courier 's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs ' second team on the first floor of the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he was armed ( this was later confirmed to be true in the official report ) . A woman near him , later identified as Abrar 's wife Bushra , was , in this version , also shot and killed . Bin Laden 's young adult son is said to have encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house , and to have been shot and killed by the second team . An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed , Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti , was armed . The interior of the house was pitch dark , because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood . However , the SEALs wore night vision goggles . 
 The SEALs encountered bin Laden on the third floor of the main building . Bin Laden was " wearing the local loose @-@ fitting tunic and pants known as a kurta <unk> " , which were later found to have € 500 and two phone numbers sewn into the fabric . 
 Bin Laden peered through his bedroom door at the Americans advancing up the stairs , and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him , which either missed or hit him in the side . Robert O ’ Neill , who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden , rolled through the door and confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom . Seymour Hersh reports that , according to his sources , Bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead . 
 O 'Neill states that bin Laden was standing behind a woman with his hands on her shoulders , pushing her forward . O 'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead , then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor . Matt Bissonnette , who entered the room at about the same time , also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden 's fallen body . Simultaneously , in these versions , one of bin Laden 's wives , Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah is said to have screamed at the SEALs in Arabic and motioned as if she were about to charge . The lead SEAL shot her in the leg , then grabbed both women and shoved them aside . The weapon used to kill bin Laden was a HK416 allegedly using <unk> NATO 77 @-@ grain OTM ( open @-@ tip match ) rounds made by Black Hills Ammunition . The SEAL team leader radioed , " For God and country — Geronimo , Geronimo , Geronimo " , and then , after being prompted by McRaven for confirmation , " Geronimo <unk> " ( enemy killed in action ) . Watching the operation in the White House Situation Room , Obama said , " We got him . " 
 There were , in these reports , said to be two weapons near bin Laden in his room , including an AKS @-@ 74U carbine and a Russian @-@ made Makarov pistol , but according to his wife Amal , he was shot before he could reach his AKS @-@ 74U . According to the Associated Press , the guns were on a shelf next to the door and the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body . 
 As the SEALs encountered women and children during the raid , they restrained them with plastic handcuffs or zip ties . After the raid was over , U.S. forces moved the surviving residents outside " for Pakistani forces to discover " . The injured Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah continued to harangue the raiders in Arabic . Bin Laden 's 12 @-@ year @-@ old daughter Safia was allegedly struck in her foot or ankle by a piece of flying debris . 
 While bin Laden 's body was taken by U.S. forces , the bodies of the four others killed in the raid were left behind at the compound and later taken into Pakistani custody . 
 = = = = Wrap @-@ up = = = = 
 The raid was intended to take 40 minutes . All told , the time between the team 's entry in and exit from the compound was 38 minutes . According to the Associated Press , the assault was completed in the first 15 minutes . 
 Time in the compound was spent killing defenders , " moving carefully through the compound , room to room , floor to floor " securing the women and children , clearing " weapons stashes and barricades " including a false door , and searching the compound for information . U.S. personnel recovered three AK @-@ 47s and two pistols , ten computer hard drives , documents , DVDs , almost a hundred thumb drives , a dozen cell phones , and " electronic equipment " for later analysis . The SEALs also discovered a large amount of opium stored in the house . 
 Since the helicopter that had made the emergency landing was damaged and unable to fly the team out , it was destroyed to safeguard its classified equipment , including an apparent stealth capability . The pilot smashed " the instrument panel , the radio , and the other classified fixtures inside the cockpit " , and the SEALs " [ packed ] the helicopter with explosives and [ blew ] it up " . Since the SEAL team was reduced to one operational helicopter , one of the two Chinooks held in reserve was dispatched to carry part of the team and bin Laden 's body out of Pakistan . 
 While the official Department of Defense narrative did not mention the airbases used in the operation , later accounts indicated that the helicopters returned to Bagram Airfield . The body of Osama bin Laden was flown from Bagram to the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson in a V @-@ 22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft escorted by two U.S. Navy F / A @-@ 18 fighter jets . 
 According to U.S. officials , bin Laden was buried at sea because no country would accept his remains . Before disposing of the body , the U.S. called the Saudi government , who approved of burying the body in the ocean . Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden 's death . Preparations began at 10 : 10 am local time and at @-@ sea burial was completed at 11 am . The body was washed , wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag . An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker . Afterward , bin Laden 's body was placed onto a flat board . The board was tilted upward on one side and the body slid off into the sea . 
 In Worthy Fights : A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace , Leon Panetta wrote that bin Laden 's body was draped in a white shroud , given final prayers in Arabic and placed inside a black bag loaded with heavy metals of 300 pounds ( 140 kg ) of iron chains inside apparently to ensure that it would sink and never float . The body bag was placed on a white table at the rail of the ship , and the table was tipped to let the body bag slide into the sea , but the body bag did not slide and took the table with it . The table bobbed on the surface while the weighted body sank into the depths . 
 = = = = Pakistan – U.S. communication = = = = 
 According to Obama administration officials , U.S. officials did not share information about the raid with the government of Pakistan until it was over . Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan 's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3 am local time to inform him of the Abbottabad Operation . 
 According to the Pakistani foreign ministry , the operation was conducted entirely by the U.S. forces . Pakistan Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) officials said they were present at what they called a joint operation ; President Asif Ali Zardari flatly denied this . Pakistan 's foreign secretary Salman Bashir later confirmed that Pakistani military had scrambled F @-@ 16s after they became aware of the attack but that they reached the compound after American helicopters had left . 
 = = = = Identification of the body = = = = 
 U.S. forces used multiple methods to positively identify the body of Osama bin Laden : 
 Measurement of the body : Both the corpse and bin Laden were 6 ft 4 in ( 193 cm ) ; SEALs on the scene did not have a tape measure to measure the corpse , so a SEAL of known height lay down next to the body and the height was approximated by comparison . This later caused Obama to quip , " We donated a $ 60 million helicopter to this operation . Could we not afford to buy a tape measure ? " 
 Facial recognition software : A photograph transmitted by the SEALs to CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia , for facial recognition analysis yielded a 90 to 95 percent likely match . 
 In @-@ person identification : One or two women from the compound , including one of bin Laden 's wives , identified bin Laden 's body . A wife of bin Laden called him by name during the raid , inadvertently assisting in his identification by U.S. armed forces on the ground . 
 DNA testing : The Associated Press and The New York Times reported that bin Laden 's body could be identified by DNA testing using tissue and blood samples taken from his sister who had died of brain cancer . ABC News stated , " Two samples were taken from bin Laden : one of these DNA samples was analyzed , and information was sent electronically back to Washington , D.C. , from Bagram . Someone else from Afghanistan is physically bringing back a sample . " A military medic took bone marrow and swabs from the body to use for the DNA testing . According to a senior US Defense Department official : 
 DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) analysis conducted separately by Department of Defense and CIA labs has positively identified Osama bin Laden . DNA samples collected from his body were compared to a comprehensive DNA profile derived from bin Laden 's large extended family . Based on that analysis , the DNA is unquestionably his . The probability of a mistaken identity on the basis of this analysis is approximately one in 11 @.@ 8 quadrillion . 
 Inference : Per the same Defense official , from the initial review of the materials removed from the Abbottabad compound the Department " assessed that much of this information , including personal correspondence between Osama bin Laden and others , as well as some of the video footage ... would only have been in his possession . "

 Beginning at 12 : 58 a.m. local time , Abbottabad resident <unk> Athar sent a series of tweets describing the noise of helicopters hovering overhead — " a rare occurrence " — and several window @-@ rattling blasts . By 1 : 44 a.m. all was quiet until a plane flew over the city at 3 : 39 a.m. Neighbors took to their roofs and watched as American special forces stormed the compound . One neighbor said , " I saw soldiers emerging from the helicopters and advancing towards the house . Some of them instructed us in chaste Pashto to turn off the lights and stay inside . " Another man said he heard shooting and screams , then an explosion as a grounded helicopter was destroyed . The blast broke his bedroom window and left charred debris over a nearby field . A local security officer said he entered the compound shortly after the Americans left , before it was sealed off by the army . " There were four dead bodies , three male and one female and one female was injured " , he said . " There was a lot of blood on the floor and one could easily see the marks like a dead body had been dragged out of the compound . " Numerous witnesses reported that power , and possibly cellphone service , went out around the time of the raid and apparently included the military academy . Accounts differed as to the exact time of the blackout . One journalist concluded after interviewing several residents that it was a routine rolling blackout . 
 ISI reported after questioning survivors of the raid that there were 17 to 18 people in the compound at the time of the attack and that the Americans took away one person still alive , possibly a bin Laden son . The ISI said that survivors included a wife , a daughter and eight to nine other children , not apparently bin Laden 's . An unnamed Pakistani security official was quoted as saying one of bin Laden 's daughters told Pakistani investigators that bin Laden had been captured alive , then in front of family members was shot dead by American forces and dragged to a helicopter . 
 = = = Compound residents = = = 
 U.S. officials said there were 22 people in the compound . Five were killed , including Osama bin Laden . Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors . The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide , presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid , containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents . The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound . Because of a lack of verifiable information , some of what follows is thinly sourced . 
 5 adults dead : Osama bin Laden , 54 ; Khalid , his son by <unk> ( identified as Hamza in early accounts ) , 23 ; Arshad Khan , a.k.a. Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti , the courier , described as the " flabby " one by The Sunday Times , 33 ; Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti 's brother Abrar , 30 ; and Bushra , Abrar 's wife , age unknown . 
 4 surviving women : <unk> , bin Laden 's third , Saudi wife a.k.a. Um Hamza , 62 ; <unk> , bin Laden 's fourth , Saudi wife a.k.a. Um Khalid , 54 ; Amal , bin Laden 's fifth , Yemeni wife , a.k.a. Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah , 29 ( injured ) ; and Mariam , Arshad Khan 's Pakistani wife . 
 5 minor children of Osama and Amal : Safia , a daughter , 12 ; a son , 5 ; another son , age unknown ; and infant twin daughters . 
 4 bin Laden grandchildren from an unidentified daughter who had been killed in an airstrike in Waziristan . Two may be the boys , around 10 , who spoke to Pakistani investigators . 
 4 children of Arshad Khan : Two sons , Abdur Rahman and Khalid , 6 or 7 ; a daughter , age unknown ; and another child , age unknown .

 At around 9 : 45 p.m. EDT , the White House announced that the president would be addressing the nation later in the evening . At 10 : 24 p.m. , the first public leaks were made simultaneously and separately by Navy Reserve intel officer Keith <unk> and actor and professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson on Twitter . Anonymous government officials confirmed details to the media , and by 11 p.m. numerous major news sources were reporting that bin Laden was dead ; the number of leaks were characterized as " voluminous " by David E.

 At 11 : 35 p.m. , Obama appeared on major television networks : 
 Good evening . Tonight , I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden , the leader of al @-@ Qaeda , and a terrorist who was responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women , and children ... ( cont 'd ) 
 President Obama remembered the victims of the September 11 attacks . He praised the nearly ten @-@ year @-@ old war against al @-@ Qaeda , which he said had disrupted terrorist plots , strengthened homeland defenses , removed the Taliban government , and captured or killed scores of al @-@ Qaeda operatives . Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war . Bin Laden 's death was the most significant blow to al @-@ Qaeda so far but the war would continue . He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam . He defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan . He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened . " To those families who have lost loved ones to al @-@ Qaeda 's terror , " he said , " justice has been done . " This remark book @-@ ended President Bush 's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that " justice will be done . " 
 = = = Reactions = = = 
 Before the official announcement , large crowds spontaneously gathered outside the White House , Ground Zero , The Pentagon and in New York 's Times Square to celebrate . In Dearborn , Michigan , where there is a large Muslim and Arab population , a small crowd gathered outside the City Hall in celebration , many of them being of Middle Eastern descent . From the beginning to the end of Obama 's speech , 5 @,@ 000 tweets per second were sent on microblogging platform Twitter . As news of bin Laden 's death filtered through the crowd at a nationally televised Major League Baseball game in Philadelphia between rivals Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets , " U @-@ S @-@ A ! " cheers began . In Tampa , Florida , at the conclusion of a professional wrestling event which was occurring at the time , WWE Champion John Cena announced to the audience that bin Laden had been " caught and compromised to a permanent end " , prompting chants while he exited the arena to the march The Stars and Stripes Forever . 
 The deputy leader of Egypt 's Muslim Brotherhood said that , with bin Laden dead , Western forces should now pull out of Iraq and Afghanistan ; authorities in Iran made similar comments . Palestinian Authority leaders had contrasting reactions . Mahmoud Abbas welcomed bin Laden 's death , while Ismail <unk> , the head of the Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip , condemned what he saw as the assassination of an " Arab holy warrior " . 
 The 14th Dalai Lama was quoted by the Los Angeles Times as saying , " Forgiveness doesn 't mean forget what happened . ... If something is serious and it is necessary to take counter @-@ measures , you have to take counter @-@ measures . " This was widely reported as an endorsement of bin Laden 's killing and was criticized in Buddhist circles , but another journalist cited a video of the discussion to argue that the comment was taken out of context and the Dalai Lama only supports killing in self @-@ defense . 
 A CBS / The New York Times poll taken after bin Laden 's death showed that 16 % of Americans feel safer as the result of his death while 60 % of Americans of those polled believe killing bin Laden would likely increase the threat of terrorism against the U.S. in the short term . 
 In India , Minister for Home Affairs P. Chidambaram said that bin Laden hiding " deep inside " Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India and showed that " many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks , including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack , continue to be sheltered in Pakistan " . He also called on Pakistan to arrest them , amidst calls for similar strikes being conducted by India against Hafiz Saeed and Dawood Ibrahim . 
 = = = Freedom of Information Act requests and denials = = = 
 Though the Abbottabad raid has been described in great detail by U.S. officials , no physical evidence constituting " proof of death " has been offered to the public , neither to journalists nor to independent third parties who have requested this information through the Freedom of Information Act . Numerous organizations filed FOIA requests seeking at least a partial release of photographs , videos , and / or DNA test results , including The Associated Press , Reuters , CBS News , Judicial Watch , Politico , Fox News , Citizens United , and NPR . On April 26 , 2012 , Judge James E. <unk> held that the Department of Defense was not required to release any evidence to the public . 
 According to a draft report by the Pentagon 's inspector general , Admiral William McRaven , the top special operations commander , ordered the Department of Defense to purge from its computer systems all files on the bin Laden raid after first sending them to the CIA . Any mention of this decision was expunged from the final version of the inspector general 's report . According to the Pentagon , this was done to protect the identities of the Navy SEALs involved in the raid . The legal justification for the records transfer is that the SEALs were effectively working for the CIA at the time of the raid , which ostensibly means that any records of the raid belong to the CIA . " Documents related to the raid were handled in a manner consistent with the fact that the operation was conducted under the direction of the CIA director " , CIA agency spokesman Preston Golson said in an emailed statement . " Records of a CIA operation such as the ( bin Laden ) raid , which were created during the conduct of the operation by persons acting under the authority of the CIA Director , are CIA records . " Golson said it is " absolutely false " that records were moved to the CIA to avoid the legal requirements of the Freedom of Information Act . The National Security Archive has criticized this maneuver , saying that the records have now gone into a " FOIA black hole " : 
 What the transfer really did was ensure that the files would be placed in the CIA 's operational records , a records system that — due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption — is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within . The move prevents the public from accessing the official record about the raid , and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process . 
 The United States Defense Department can prevent the release of its own military files citing risks to national security , but that can be contested in court , and a judge can compel the Pentagon to turn over non @-@ sensitive portions of records . The CIA however has special authority to prevent the release of " operational files " in ways that cannot be challenged in federal court . Richard Lardner , reporting for the Associated Press , wrote that the maneuver " could represent a new strategy for the U.S. government to shield even its most sensitive activities from public scrutiny . " 
 Judicial Watch followed its FOIA request with a FOIA lawsuit on June 8 , 2011 , and by January 31 , 2014 , obtained some of the documents Admiral William McRaven had tried to withhold . The most important of these is an email written by McRaven on Friday 13 , 2011 , in which he instructs his team to destroy all UBL documents ( see image at right ) . 
 The inspector general 's draft report also described how former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta disclosed classified information to the makers of Zero Dark Thirty , including the unit that conducted the raid and the ground commander 's name .

 = = = = Under U.S. law = = = = 
 Following the attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the U.S. Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists , which authorized the President to use " necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations , or persons " he determines were involved in the attacks . The Obama administration justified its use of force by relying on that resolution , as well as international law set forth in treaties and customary laws of war . 
 John Bellinger III , who served as the U.S. State Department 's senior lawyer during President George W. Bush 's second term , said the strike was a legitimate military action and did not run counter to the U.S. ' self @-@ imposed prohibition on assassinations : 
 The killing is not prohibited by the long @-@ standing assassination prohibition in executive order 12333 [ signed in 1981 ] , because the action was a military action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al @-@ Qaeda , and it is not prohibited to kill specific leaders of an opposing force . The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self @-@ defense . 
 Similarly , Harold <unk> Koh , Legal Adviser of the U.S. State Department , said in 2010 that " under domestic law , the use of lawful weapons systems — consistent with the applicable laws of war — for precision targeting of specific high @-@ level belligerent leaders when acting in self @-@ defense or during an armed conflict is not unlawful , and hence does not constitute ' assassination ' . " 
 David Scheffer , director of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights , said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for conspiracy to attack U.S. defense installations was a complicating factor . " Normally when an individual is under indictment the purpose is to capture that person in order to bring him to court to try him ... The object is not to literally summarily execute him if he 's under indictment . " Scheffer and another expert stated that it was important to determine whether the mission was to capture bin Laden or to kill him . If the Navy SEALs were instructed to kill bin Laden without trying first to capture him , it " may have violated American ideals if not international law . " 
 = = = = Under international law = = = = 
 In an address to the Pakistani parliament , Pakistan 's Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani said , " Our people are rightly incensed on the issue of violation of sovereignty as typified by the covert U.S. air and ground assault on the Osama hideout in Abbottabad . ... The Security Council , while exhorting UN member states to join their efforts against terrorism , has repeatedly emphasized that this be done in accordance with international law , human rights and humanitarian law . " Former Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf denied a report in The Guardian that his government made a secret agreement permitting U.S. forces to conduct unilateral raids in search of the top three al @-@ Qaeda leaders . 
 In testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee , Attorney General Eric Holder said , " The operation against bin Laden was justified as an act of national self @-@ defense . It 's lawful to target an enemy commander in the field . " He called the killing of bin Laden " a tremendous step forward in attaining justice for the nearly 3 @,@ 000 innocent Americans who were murdered on September 11 , 2001 . " Commenting on the legality under international law , University of Michigan Law Professor Steven Ratner said , " A lot of it depends on whether you believe Osama bin Laden is a combatant in a war or a suspect in a mass murder . " In the latter case , " you would only be able to kill a suspect if they represented an immediate threat " . 
 Holder testified that bin Laden made no attempt to surrender , and " even if he had there would be a good basis on the part of those very brave Navy SEAL team members to do what they did in order to protect themselves and the other people who were in that building . " According to Anthony Dworkin , an international law expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations , if bin Laden was hors de combat ( as his daughter is said to have alleged ) that would have been a violation of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions . 
 The UN Security Council released a statement applauding the news of bin Laden 's death , and UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon said he was " very much relieved " . Two United Nations Special Rapporteurs issued a joint statement seeking more information regarding the circumstances in which bin Laden was killed and cautioning that " actions taken by States in combating terrorism , especially in high profile cases , set precedents for the way in which the right to life will be treated in future instances . " 
 = = = Handling of the body = = = 
 Under Islamic tradition , burial at sea is considered inappropriate when other , preferred forms of burial are available , and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision . Mohamed Ahmed el @-@ Tayeb , the head of Al @-@ Azhar University , Egypt 's seat of Sunni Muslim learning , said the disposal of the body at sea was an affront to religious and human values . Scholars like el @-@ Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship , and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case — the body buried in the ground with the head pointing to Islam 's holy city of Mecca . 
 A stated advantage of a burial at sea is that the site is not readily identified or accessed , thus preventing it from becoming a focus of attention or " terrorist shrine " . The Guardian questioned whether bin Laden 's grave would have become a shrine , as this is strongly discouraged in Wahhabism . Addressing the same concern , Egyptian Islamic analyst and lawyer <unk> el @-@ Zayat said that if the Americans wished to avoid making a shrine to bin Laden , an unmarked grave on land would have accomplished the same goal . 
 The Guardian also quoted a U.S. official explaining the anticipated difficulty of finding a country that would accept the burial of bin Laden in its soil . A professor of Islamic Law at the University of Jordan stated burying at sea was permitted if there was nobody to receive the body and provide a Muslim burial , and that " it 's neither true nor correct to claim that there was nobody in the Muslim world ready to receive bin Laden 's body " . On a similar note , Mohammed al @-@ <unk> , Dubai 's grand mufti , stated : " They can say they buried him at sea , but they cannot say they did it according to Islam . If the family does not want him , it 's really simple in Islam : you dig up a grave anywhere , even on a remote island , you say the prayers and that 's it . Sea burials are permissible for Muslims in extraordinary circumstances . This is not one of them . " Khalid Latif , an imam who serves as a chaplain and the director of the Islamic Center of New York University , argued that the sea burial was respectful . 
 <unk> <unk> , a professor at Vanderbilt University and the author of Muhammad 's Grave : Death Rites and the Making of Islamic Society , explained that Islamic law does not prescribe ordinary funerals for those killed in battle , and pointed to controversy within the Muslim world over whether bin Laden was , as a " mass murderer of Muslims " , entitled to the same respect as mainstream Muslims . At the same time , he suggested that the burial could have been handled with more cultural sensitivity . 
 Omar bin Laden , son of Osama bin Laden , published a complaint on May 10 , 2011 , that the burial at sea deprived the family of a proper burial . 
 = = = Bin Laden 's will = = = 
 After bin Laden 's death , it was reported he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks in which he urged his children not to join al @-@ Qaeda and not to continue the Jihad . 
 = = = Release of photographs = = = 
 CNN cited a senior U.S. official as saying three sets of photographs of bin Laden 's body exist : Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan , described as the most recognizable and gruesome ; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body ; and photos from the raid itself , which include shots of the interior of the compound as well as three of the others who died in the raid . 
 A source told ABC News that the photos taken by the military servicemen on the scene depict the physical damage done by a high @-@ caliber bullet . CBS Evening News reported that the photo shows that the bullet which hit above bin Laden 's left eye blew out his left eyeball and blew away a large portion of his frontal skull , exposing his brain . CNN stated that the pictures from the Afghanistan hangar depict " a massive open head wound across both eyes . It 's very bloody and gory . " U.S Senator Jim Inhofe , who viewed the photos , stated that the photos taken of the body on the Carl Vinson , which showed bin Laden 's face after much of the blood and material had been washed away , should be released to the public . 
 A debate on whether the military photos should or should not be released to the public has taken place . Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records , that the photos are necessary to complete the journalistic record , and that the photos would prove bin Laden 's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive . Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti @-@ American sentiment in the Middle East . 
 Obama ultimately decided not to release the photos . In an interview that aired on May 4 on 60 Minutes , Obama stated that " We don 't trot out this stuff as trophies . We don 't need to spike the football . " Obama said that he was concerned with ensuring that " very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence , or as a propaganda tool . That 's not who we are . " Among Republican members of Congress , Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the decision and stated that he wanted to see the photos released , while Senator John McCain and Representative Mike Rogers , the chair of the House Intelligence Committee , supported the decision not to release the photos . 
 On May 11 , selected members of Congress ( the congressional leadership and those who serve on the House and Senate intelligence , homeland security , judiciary , foreign relations , and armed forces committees ) were shown 15 bin Laden photos . In an interview with Eliot Spitzer , Senator Jim Inhofe said that three of the photos were of bin Laden alive for identification reference . Three other photos were of the burial @-@ at @-@ sea ceremony . 
 The group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain access to the photos in May 2011 , soon after the raid . On May 9 , the Department of Defense declined to process Judicial Watch 's FOIA request , prompting Judicial Watch to file a federal lawsuit . In 2012 , Judge James E. <unk> of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling denying release of the photographs . In May 2013 , a three @-@ judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit consisting of Chief Judge Merrick Garland , Senior Judge Harry T. Edwards , and Judge Judith Rogers affirmed the ruling , holding that 52 post @-@ mortem images were properly classified as " top secret " and exempt from disclosure . Judicial Watch filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in August 2013 , seeking U.S. Supreme Court review , but in January 2014 the Supreme Court declined to hear the case . 
 The Associated Press filed a FOIA request for photographs and videos taken during the Abbottabad raid less than one day after bin Laden was killed . The AP also requested " contingency plans for bin Laden 's capture , reports on the performance of equipment during the mission and copies of DNA tests " confirming bin Laden 's identity . The Defense Department rejected the AP 's request for expedited processing , a legal provision to shorten the amount of time to process FOIA requests . The Defense Department rejected the request , and the AP administratively appealed .

 = = = = Seal Target Geronimo = = = = 
 A book published in November 2011 , Seal Target Geronimo , by Chuck Pfarrer , a former SEAL , contradicted the account as given by U.S. government sources . According to Pfarrer , neither helicopter crashed at the beginning of the raid . Instead , the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third @-@ floor hallway from the roof terrace . Osama 's third wife , <unk> , was in the hallway , headed towards the SEALs . She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her . Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door , saw the SEALs , and slammed the door closed . At the same time , Osama 's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots . 
 Two SEALs broke through the bedroom door . Bin Laden 's wife Amal was on the edge of the bed shouting in Arabic at the SEALs , and Osama bin Laden dived across the bed , shoving Amal at the same time , for an AKS @-@ 74U kept by the headboard . The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden ; the first missed , the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden , and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head , killing him instantly . In Pfarrer 's account , the total time elapsed from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden 's death was between 30 and 90 seconds . 
 Around the same time , snipers in the hovering Razor 2 helicopter shot and killed Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti when he came to the door of the guest house firing an AK @-@ 47 . One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al @-@ Kuwaiti and the other fired two three @-@ round bursts . Two of the snipers ' bullets went through al @-@ Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was standing behind him . The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives . As the Razor 2 team entered the main house , al @-@ Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK @-@ 47 gun and was killed with two shots . The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots , killing Osama bin Laden , Khalid bin Laden , Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti and al @-@ Kuwaiti 's wife , Arshad Khan , and wounding Osama bin Laden 's wife Amal al @-@ Sadah . 
 Twenty minutes into the operation , Razor 1 took off from the roof of the main house to reposition to a landing spot outside the compound . As Razor 1 was crossing over the courtyard , both " green unit " flight deck control systems went off line . The helicopter settled slowly , bounced off the ground , and then broke apart as it hit the ground a second time . Both failed green units were removed for later examination . 
 Media accounts had reported that the plan had been to fast rope to the inner courtyard and to clear the main house from the ground floor up . The helicopter crashed in the outer courtyard with the SEAL team still on board . The SEAL team exited and needed to breach two walls and then into the house . As a result , Osama bin Laden was killed several minutes into the operation . Pfarrer 's account differs in that he wrote that a SEAL team was inserted onto the roof of the main house , that Osama bin Laden was killed seconds into the operation , and that the main house was cleared from the top down . 
 The Pentagon disputed Pfarrer 's account of the raid , calling it " incorrect " . The U.S. Special Operations Command also disputed Pfarrer 's account , saying , " It 's just not true . It 's not how it happened . " 
 = = = = No Easy Day = = = = 
 Matt Bissonnette , a SEAL who participated in the raid , wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day ( 2012 ) , which significantly contradicts Pfarrer 's account . Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version . According to Bissonnette , when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third @-@ floor room , the SEAL who fired upon him hit him on the right side of the head . Bin Laden stumbled into his bedroom , where the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter , with two women crying over his body . The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women , moved them away , and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead . According to Bissonnette , the weapons in the room — an AK @-@ 47 rifle and a Makarov pistol — were unloaded . 
 Unlike the official account , Bissonnette 's version alleges that bin Laden 's wife Mariam was uninjured in the raid . In addition , Bissonnette states that the report of bin Laden 's daughter Safia having splintered wood striking her foot is false , as he explains that it was rather his wife Amal who was injured by such fragments . 
 The author also asserted that one SEAL sat on bin Laden 's chest in a cramped helicopter as his body was flown back to Afghanistan . 
 Bissonnette stated that a search of bin Laden 's room after his death uncovered a bottle of Just for Men hair dye . 
 In February 2013 , Esquire conducted an interview with an anonymous individual called " the shooter " who stated that bin Laden placed one of his wives between himself and the commandos , pushing her towards them . " Shooter " then claimed bin Laden stood up and had a gun " within reach " and it was only then that he fired two shots into bin Laden 's forehead , killing him . However , another member of SEAL Team Six said the story as presented in Esquire was false and " complete BS " . Then , in November 2014 , former SEAL Robert O 'Neill disclosed his identity as the shooter in a series of interviews with the Washington Post . 
 = = = = Hillhouse and Hersh reports = = = = 
 In 2011 American intelligence analyst Raelynn Hillhouse wrote that according to U.S. intelligence sources , the U.S. had been tipped @-@ off to bin Laden 's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $ 25 million reward . According to the sources , Pakistan purposely stood @-@ down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid , and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden . Hillhouse 's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping Bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis . According to The Telegraph , Hillhouse 's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to an in Abbottabad , and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid . 
 Hillhouse later also stated that bin Laden 's body had been thrown @-@ out of a helicopter over the Hindu Kush . Hillhouse 's account was picked @-@ up and published in The Daily Telegraph , the National Post , The Vancouver Sun , The Calgary Herald , the Windsor Star , The Daily Mail and the New Zealand Herald . 
 In May 2015 , journalist Seymour Hersh said that the Pakistani Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) had kept bin Laden under house arrest at Abbottabad since 2006 , and he said that Pakistani Army chief Pervez Kayani and ISI director Ahmad Shuja Pasha aided the U.S. mission to kill , not capture bin Laden . According to Hersh , Pakistani officials were always aware of bin Laden 's location and were guarding the compound with their own soldiers . Pakistan decided to give up bin Laden 's location to the U.S. because American aid was declining . Pakistani officials were aware of the raid , and assisted the U.S. in carrying it out . According to Hersh , bin Laden was basically an invalid . 
 Hersh 's U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources stated that the U.S. had learned of bin Laden 's location through a Pakistani walk @-@ in seeking the $ 25 million reward , and not through tracking a courier . NBC News and Agence France @-@ Presse subsequently reported that their sources indicated a walk @-@ in was an extremely valuable asset , though the sources disputed that the walk @-@ in knew the location of bin Laden . Pakistan @-@ based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk @-@ in 's identity to be Usman Khalid , though that allegation was denied by Khalid 's family . The White House denied Hersh 's report . 
 Though similar in claims , both Hillhouse and Hersch 's accounts of the bin Laden death appeared to be based on different sources which The Intercept concluded might corroborate the claims if their identities were known . After the Hersch story broke , NBC News also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report , and not the courier .

 The reports of bin Laden 's death on May 2 , 2011 , are not universally accepted despite unreleased DNA testing confirming his identity , bin Laden 's twelve @-@ year @-@ old daughter witnessing his death , and a May 6 , 2011 , al @-@ Qaeda statement confirming his death . The swift burial of bin Laden 's body at sea , the speed of the DNA results , and the decision not to release pictures of the dead body have led to the rise of conspiracy theories that bin Laden had not died in the raid . Some Internet blogs suggested that the U.S. government feigned the raid , and some Internet forums hosted debates over the alleged hoax .

 Pakistan came under intense international scrutiny after the raid . The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden , and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009 . The United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief , Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha , knew of bin Laden ’ s presence in Abbottabad , Pakistan . After the raid , there was an unconfirmed report that Pakistan allowed Chinese military officials to examine the wreckage of the crashed helicopter . 
 = = = Connections with Abbottabad = = = 
 Abbottabad attracted refugees from fighting in the tribal areas and Swat Valley , as well as Afghanistan . " People don 't really care now to ask who 's there " , said Gohar Ayub Khan , a former foreign minister and resident of the city . " That 's one of the reasons why , possibly , he came in there . " 
 The city was home to at least one al @-@ Qaeda leader before bin Laden . Operational chief Abu Faraj al @-@ Libi reportedly moved his family to Abbottabad in mid @-@ 2003 . Pakistan Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him . However , this account was exposed as an outright lie by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field . A courier told interrogators that al @-@ Libi used three houses in Abbottabad . Pakistani officials say they informed their American counterparts at the time that the city could be a hiding place for al @-@ Qaeda leaders . In 2009 officials began providing the U.S. with intelligence about bin Laden 's compound without knowing who lived there . 
 On January 25 , 2011 , ISI arrested Umar Patek , an Indonesian wanted in connection with the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings , while he was staying with a family in Abbottabad . Tahir <unk> , a clerk at the post office , was arrested on suspicion of facilitating travel for al @-@ Qaeda militants . 
 = = = Allegations against Pakistan = = = 
 Numerous allegations were made that the government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden . Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden 's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy , that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation , and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks . U.S. government files , leaked by Wikileaks , disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached . Pakistan 's Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , also helped smuggle al @-@ Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops . According to the leaked files , in December 2009 , the government of Tajikistan had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden 's whereabouts . 
 CIA chief Leon Panetta said the CIA had ruled out involving Pakistan in the operation , because it feared that " any effort to work with the Pakistanis could jeopardize the mission . They might alert the targets . " Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton stated that " cooperation with Pakistan helped lead us to bin Laden and the compound in which he was hiding " . Obama echoed her sentiments . John O. Brennan , Obama 's chief counterterrorism advisor , said that it was inconceivable that bin Laden did not have support from within Pakistan . He said : " People have been referring to this as hiding in plain sight . We are looking at how he was able to hide out there for so long . " 
 The Indian Minister for Home Affairs , P. Chidambaram , said that bin Laden hiding " deep inside " Pakistan was a matter of grave concern for India , and showed that " many of the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks , including the controllers and the handlers of the terrorists who actually carried out the attack , continue to be sheltered in Pakistan " . He called on Pakistan to arrest them . 
 Pakistani @-@ born British MP Khalid Mahmood stated that he was " flabbergasted and shocked " after he learned that bin Laden was living in a city with thousands of Pakistani troops , reviving questions about alleged links between al @-@ Qaeda and elements in Pakistan 's security forces . 
 On August 7 , 2011 , Raelynn Hillhouse , an American spy novelist and security analyst , posted " The Spy Who Billed Me " on her national security blog , suggesting that Pakistan 's ISI had sheltered bin Laden in return for a $ 25 million bounty ; however , ISI and government officials have denied her allegations . 
 Former Pakistani Army Chief , General Ziauddin Butt has said that , according to his knowledge , Osama bin Laden was kept in an Intelligence Bureau safe house in Abbottabad by the then Director @-@ General of the Intelligence Bureau of Pakistan ( 2004 – 2008 ) , Brigadier Ijaz Shah . This had occurred with the " full knowledge " of former army chief General Pervez Musharraf and possibly that of current Chief of Army Staff ( <unk> ) General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani . Emails from the private American security firm , Stratfor , published by WikiLeaks on February 27 , 2012 , indicate that up to 12 officials in Pakistan 's ISI knew of Osama bin Laden 's Abbottabad safe house . Stratfor had been given access to the papers collected by American forces from bin Laden 's Abbottabad house . The emails reveal that these Pakistani officers included " Mid to senior level ISI and Pak Mil with one retired Pak Mil General " . In 2014 , British journalist Carlotta Gall revealed that she had been told by an undisclosed ISI source that the ISI " ran a special desk assigned to handle bin Laden " . The desk was " led by an officer who made his own decisions and did not report to a superior " , … " but the top military bosses knew about it , I was told " .

 According to a Pakistani intelligence official , raw phone @-@ tap data had been transferred to the U.S. without being analyzed by Pakistan . While the U.S. " was concentrating on this " information since September 2010 , information regarding bin Laden and the compound 's inhabitants had " slipped from " Pakistan 's " radar " over the months . Bin Laden left " an invisible footprint " and he had not been contacting other militant networks . It was noted that much focus had been placed on a courier entering and leaving the compound . The transfer of intelligence to the U.S. was a regular occurrence according to the official , who also stated regarding the raid that " I think they came in undetected and went out the same day " , and Pakistan did not believe that U.S. personnel were present in the area before the special operation occurred . 
 According to the Pakistani high commissioner to the United Kingdom , Wajid Shamsul Hasan , Pakistan had prior knowledge that an operation would happen . Pakistan was " in the know of certain things " and " what happened , happened with our consent . Americans got to know him — where he was first — and that 's why they struck it and struck it precisely . " Husain Haqqani , Pakistani ambassador to the U.S. , had said that Pakistan would have pursued bin Laden had the intelligence of his location existed with them and Pakistan was " very glad that our American partners did . They had superior intelligence , superior technology , and we are grateful to them . " 
 Another Pakistani official stated that Pakistan " assisted only in terms of authorization of the helicopter flights in our airspace " and the operation was conducted by the United States . He also said that " in any event , we did not want anything to do with such an operation in case something went wrong . " 
 In June the ISI arrested the owner of a safe house rented to the CIA to observe Osama bin Laden 's compound and five CIA informants . 
 = = Code name = = 
 Several officials who were present in the Situation Room , including the president , told reporters that the code name for bin Laden was " Geronimo " . They had watched Leon Panetta , speaking from CIA headquarters , while he narrated the action in Abbottabad . Panetta said , " We have a visual on Geronimo " , and later , " Geronimo <unk> " — enemy killed in action . The words of the commander on the ground were , " For God and country , Geronimo , Geronimo , Geronimo . " Officials subsequently explained that each step of the mission was labelled alphabetically in an " Execution Checklist " , which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic . " Geronimo " indicated the raiders had reached step " G " , the capture or killing of bin Laden . Osama bin Laden was identified as " Jackpot " , the general code name for the target of an operation . ABC News reported that otherwise his regular code name was " <unk> " . The New Yorker reported that bin Laden 's codename was " <unk> " . 
 Many Native Americans were offended that Geronimo , the renowned 19th @-@ century Apache leader , was irrevocably linked with bin Laden . The chairman of the Fort Sill Apache Tribe , the successor to Geronimo 's tribe , wrote a letter to Obama asking him to " right this wrong . " The president of the Navajo Nation requested that the U.S. government change the code name retroactively . Officials from the National Congress of American Indians said the focus should be on honoring the disproportionately high number of Native Americans who serve in the military , and they had been assured that " Geronimo " was not a code name for bin Laden . The U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs heard testimony on the issue from tribal leaders , while the Defense Department had no comment except to say that no disrespect was intended . 
 = = Derivation of intelligence = = 
 After the death of bin Laden , some officials from the Bush administration , such as former Bush Office of Legal Counsel attorney John Yoo and former attorney general Michael Mukasey , wrote op @-@ eds stating that the enhanced interrogation techniques they authorized ( since legally clarified as torture ) yielded the intelligence that later led to locating bin Laden 's hideout . Mukasey said that the waterboarding of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed caused him to reveal the nickname of bin Laden 's courier . 
 U.S. officials and legislators , including Republican John McCain and Democrat Dianne Feinstein , chairwoman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , countered that those statements were " false " . They noted that a report by CIA Director Leon Panetta stated that the first mention of the courier 's nickname did not come from Mohammed , but rather from another government 's interrogation of a suspect whom they said they " believe was not tortured . " 
 McCain called on Mukasey to retract his statements . 
 I have sought further information from the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee , and they confirm for me that , in fact , the best intelligence gained from a CIA detainee — information describing Abu Ahmed al @-@ Kuwaiti 's real role in Al @-@ Qaeda and his true relationship to Osama bin Laden — was obtained through standard , non @-@ coercive means , not through any ' enhanced interrogation technique ' . 
 Panetta had written a letter to McCain on the issue , saying : " Some of the detainees who provided useful information about the facilitator / courier 's role had been subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques . Whether those techniques were the ' only timely and effective way ' to obtain such information is a matter of debate and cannot be established definitively . " Although some information may have been obtained from detainees who were subjected to torture , Panetta wrote to McCain that : 
 We first learned about the facilitator / courier 's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002 . It is also important to note that some detainees who were subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques attempted to provide false or misleading information about the facilitator / courier . These attempts to falsify the facilitator / courier 's role were alerting . In the end , no detainee in CIA custody revealed the facilitator / courier 's full true name or specific whereabouts . This information was discovered through other intelligence means . 
 In addition , other U.S. officials state that shortly after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , detainees in CIA secret prisons told interrogators about the courier 's pseudonym " al @-@ Kuwaiti " and that when Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was later captured , he only " confirmed " the courier 's pseudonym . After Abu Faraj al @-@ Libbi was captured , he provided false or misleading information : he denied that he knew al @-@ Kuwaiti and he made up another name instead . Also , a group of interrogators asserted that the courier 's nickname was not divulged " during torture , but rather several months later , when [ detainees ] were questioned by interrogators who did not use abusive techniques . "

 Evidence seized from the compound is said to include ten cell phones , five to ten computers , twelve hard drives , at least 100 computer disks ( including thumb drives and DVDs ) , handwritten notes , documents , weapons and " an assortment of personal items " . It was described by a senior Pentagon intelligence official as " the single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever . " Very few of these have been made public . 
 Intelligence analysts also studied call detail records from two phone numbers that were found to be sewn into bin Laden 's clothing . They helped over the course of several months to apprehend several al @-@ Qaeda members in several countries and to kill several of bin Laden 's closest associates by CIA drone attacks in Pakistan . 
 The material gathered at the compound is being stored at the FBI Laboratory in Quantico , Virginia , where forensic experts will analyze fingerprints , DNA and other trace evidence left on the material . Copies of the material are being provided to other agencies ; officials want to preserve a chain of custody in case any of the information is needed as evidence in a future trial . 
 A special CIA team has been given the responsibility of combing through the digital material and documents removed from the bin Laden compound . The CIA team is working in collaboration with other U.S. government agencies " to triage , catalog and analyze this intelligence . " 
 Bin Laden 's youngest wife told Pakistani investigators that the family lived in the feudal village of Chak Shah Muhammad , in the nearby district of <unk> , for two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years prior to moving to Abbottabad in late 2005 . 
 The material seized from the compound contained al @-@ Qaeda 's strategy for Afghanistan after America 's withdrawal from the country in 2014 as well as thousands of electronic memos and missives that captured conversations between bin Laden and his deputies around the world . It showed that bin Laden stayed in touch with al @-@ Qaeda 's established affiliates and sought new alliances with groups such as Boko Haram from Nigeria . According to the material , he sought to reassert control over factions of loosely affiliated jihadists from Yemen to Somalia , as well as independent actors whom he believed had sullied al @-@ Qaeda 's reputation and muddied its central message . Bin Laden was worried at times about his personal security and was annoyed that his organization had not utilized the Arab Spring to improve its image . He acted , according to the Washington Post , on the one hand as " chief executive fully engaged in the group 's myriad crises , grappling with financial problems , recruitment , rebellious field managers and sudden staff vacancies resulting from the unrelenting U.S. drone campaign " , and on the other hand as " a hands @-@ on manager who participated in the terrorist group 's operational planning and strategic thinking while also giving orders and advice to field operatives scattered worldwide . " The material also described Osama bin Laden 's relation with Ayman al @-@ Zawahiri and Atiyah Abd al @-@ Rahman . 
 Seventeen documents seized during the Abbottabad raid , consisting of electronic letters or draft letters dating from September 2006 to April 2011 , were released by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point one year and one day after bin Laden 's <unk> and made available at the Washington Post homepage . The documents covered subjects such as the news media in America , affiliate organization , targets , America , security , and the Arab Spring . In the documents , bin Laden stated that al @-@ Qaeda 's strength was limited and therefore suggested that the best way to attack the U.S. , which he compared to a tree , " is to concentrate on sawing the trunk " . He refused the promotion of Anwar al @-@ Awlaki when this was requested by Nasir al @-@ <unk> , leader of al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . " We here become reassured of the people when they go to the line and get examined there " , bin Laden said . He told al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to expand operations in the U.S. in the wake of the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot by writing " We need to extend and develop our operations in America and not keep it limited to blowing up airplanes . " 
 The seized material shed light on al @-@ Qaeda 's relationship with Iran , which detained <unk> and their relatives in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , including members of bin Laden 's family . Al @-@ Qaeda 's relationship with Iran was , according to the Combating Terrorism Center , an " unpleasant byproduct of necessity , fueled by mutual distrust and antagonism . " An explicit reference to any institutional support from Pakistan for al @-@ Qaeda wasn 't mentioned in the documents ; instead , bin Laden instructed his family members how to avoid detection so that members of Pakistani intelligence couldn 't track them to find him . According to the seized material , former commander of the international forces in Afghanistan David Petraeus and US President Barack Obama should be assassinated during any of their visits to Pakistan and Afghanistan , if there was an opportunity to do so . Bin Laden opined that U.S. Vice President Joe Biden should not be a target because " Biden is totally unprepared for that post [ of president ] , which will lead the US into a crisis . " Bin Laden was also against one @-@ person suicide attacks and was of the opinion that at least two persons should undertake these attacks instead . He planned to reform in a way so that al @-@ Qaeda 's central leadership would have a greater say in the naming of the al @-@ Qaeda branch leaders and their deputies . He expressed his opinion that killing Muslims has weakened his organization and not helped al @-@ Qaeda , writing that it " cost the <unk> no small amount of sympathy among Muslims . The enemy has exploited the mistakes of the <unk> to mar their image among the masses . " 
 The United States Department of Justice released a further eleven documents in March , 2015 . The documents were part of the trial against Abid Naseer , who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Manchester shopping mall in 2009 . They included letters to and from Osama bin Laden in the year before his death , and showed the extent of the damage the CIA drone program had done to Al @-@ Qaeda . 
 In addition to information and data recovered of intelligence value , the documents and computer items also contained personal files , including family correspondence and a large stash of pornography . US officials have refused to characterize the type of pornography found other than to say that it was " modern " in nature . 
 = = Helicopter stealth technology revelations = = 
 The tail section of the secret helicopter survived demolition and lay just outside the compound wall . Pakistani security forces put up a cloth barrier at first light to hide the wreckage . Later , a tractor hauled it away hidden under a tarp . Journalists obtained photographs that revealed the previously undisclosed stealth technology . Aviation Week said the helicopter appeared to be a significantly modified MH @-@ 60 Black Hawk . Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH @-@ 60 built in 2009 . Its performance during the operation confirmed that a stealth helicopter could evade detection in a militarily sensitive , densely populated area . Photos showed that the Black Hawk 's tail had stealth @-@ configured shapes on the boom and the fairings , swept stabilizers and a " <unk> " over the noise @-@ reducing five- or six @-@ blade tail rotor . It appeared to have a silver @-@ loaded infrared suppression finish similar to some V @-@ 22 Ospreys . 
 The U.S. requested return of the wreckage and the Chinese government also expressed interest , according to Pakistani officials . Pakistan had custody of the wreckage for over two weeks before its return was secured by U.S. Senator John Kerry . Experts disagreed as to how much information could have been gleaned from the tail fragment . Stealth technology was already operational on several fixed @-@ wing aircraft and the cancelled RAH @-@ 66 Comanche helicopter ; however , the modified Black Hawk was the first confirmed operational " stealth helicopter " . Likely , the most valuable information could come from radar @-@ absorbing paint used on the tail section . Local children were seen picking up pieces of the wreckage and selling them as souvenirs . In August 2011 , Fox News reported that Pakistan had allowed People 's Republic of China scientists to examine the helicopter 's tail section and were especially interested in its radar @-@ absorbing paint . Pakistan and the PRC denied these claims .

 Megan decides that the only way to confront Colin is to accept her mother 's invitation , which she had previously declined , as Colin is attending and after questioning him , she rules him out as a suspect . Curtis confirms that the maggots that he was testing take around two days to mature , so Curtis confirms that Daphne was dead for two days before the body was found . There are also traces of aspirin in them , so either Daphne was taking aspirin or it was being given to her without her knowledge . With the assistance of Dr. Kate Murphy ( Jeri Ryan ) , Ethan determines that the hair is Victorian . Stephen admits to giving her aspirin , though did not realize she was getting sicker because of it , whilst Megan figures out that Daphne was electrocuted .

 = Mauritius blue pigeon = 
 The Mauritius blue pigeon ( Alectroenas nitidissima ) is an extinct species of blue pigeon formerly endemic to the Mascarene island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar . It has two extinct relatives from the Mascarenes and three extant ones from other islands . It is the type species of the genus of blue pigeons , Alectroenas . 
 It had white hackles around the head , neck and breast and blue plumage on the body , and it was red on the tail and the bare parts of the head . These colours were thought similar to those of the Dutch flag , a resemblance reflected in some of the bird 's names . The males had red foreheads , and the juveniles may have been partially green . It was 30 cm ( 12 in ) long and larger and more robust than any other blue pigeon species . It could raise its hackles into a ruff , which it used for display . Its call sounded like " barf barf " and it also made a cooing noise . It fed on fruits , nuts , and molluscs , and was once widespread in the forests of Mauritius . 
 The bird was first mentioned in the 17th century and was described several times thereafter , but very few accounts describe the behaviour of living specimens . Several stuffed and at least one live specimen reached Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries . Only three stuffed specimens exist today , and only one bird was ever depicted when alive . The species is thought to have become extinct in the 1830s due to deforestation and predation . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first record of the Mauritius blue pigeon is two sketches in the 1601 – 1603 journal of the Dutch ship Gelderland . The birds appear to have been freshly killed or stunned . The drawings were made by the Dutch artist Joris Joostensz Laerle on Mauritius , but were not published until 1969 . François Cauche in 1651 briefly mentions " white , black and red turtle doves " , encountered in 1638 , which is thought to be the first unequivocal mention of the bird . The next account is that of Jean @-@ François Charpentier de Cossigny in the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 The French naturalist Pierre Sonnerat brought the bird to the attention of ornithologists in 1782 , calling it Pigeon Hollandais ( Dutch pigeon ) , a French vernacular name that derives from its white , dark blue and red colouration , which reminded Sonnerat of the Dutch flag . He had collected two specimens during a voyage in 1774 . These syntype specimens were deposited in the Muséum national d 'Histoire naturelle in Paris . By 1893 , only one of them , specimen MNHN n ° C.G. 2000 @-@ 727 , still existed , and had been damaged by sulphuric acid in an attempt at fumigation . Since Sonnerat named and described them in French , the scientific naming of the bird was left to the Tyrolean naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli , who did not observe a specimen himself , but <unk> Sonnerat 's description in 1786 . He named the bird Columba nitidissima , which means " most brilliant pigeon " . When German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin redescribed the bird with the species name <unk> ( " of France " ) in 1789 , he referred to the now @-@ familiar tricolour which had just been flown for the first time . Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre used the name <unk> ( " the Dutch one " ) in his description in 1790 . 
 Another skin arrived at the Paris museum in 1800 , collected by Colonel M. Mathieu for Louis Dufresne . It was sold in 1819 among other items , was sent to Edinburgh , and is now in the National Museum of Scotland as specimen MU No. 624 . It was not identified as a Mauritius blue pigeon until Alfred Newton saw it in 1879 . The last specimen recorded was shot in Savanne in 1826 and given to Julien Desjardins , founder of the Mauritius Natural History Museum in Port Louis , where it is still located , though in poor condition . Only these three <unk> specimens still exist . In 1840 George Robert Gray named a new genus , Alectroenas , for the Mauritius blue pigeon ; <unk> in Greek means domestic cock , and <unk> means dove . Alectroenas nitidissima is the type species of the genus , which includes all blue pigeons . The binomial name was emended from A. <unk> to A. nitidissima in 2014 . 
 Subfossil remains of the Mauritius blue pigeon were collected in the Mare aux Songes swamp by Théodore Sauzier in 1889 . More were collected by Etienne Thirioux around 1900 . They are thought to have been found near Le Pouce mountain and Plaine des Roches . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 Alectroenas blue pigeons are closely interrelated and occur widely throughout islands in the western Indian Ocean . They are allopatric and can therefore be regarded as a superspecies . There are three extant species : the Madagascar blue pigeon ( A. madagascariensis ) , the Comoro blue pigeon ( A. <unk> ) , and the Seychelles blue pigeon ( A. <unk> ) . The three Mascarene islands were each home to a species , all of which are extinct : the Mauritius blue pigeon , the Rodrigues blue pigeon ( A. <unk> ) , and the Réunion blue pigeon ( A. sp . ) . Compared with other pigeons , the blue pigeons are medium to large , stocky , and have longer wings and tails . All the species have distinct mobile hackles on the head and neck . The tibiotarsus is comparatively long and the tarsometatarsus short . The blue pigeons may have colonised the Mascarenes , the Seychelles or a now submerged hotspot island by " island hopping " . They may have evolved into a distinct genus there before reaching Madagascar . Their closest genetic relative is the cloven @-@ feathered dove of New Caledonia ( <unk> <unk> ) , from which they separated 8 – 9 million years ago . Their ancestral group appears to be the fruit doves ( Ptilinopus ) of Southeast Asia and Oceania . 
 = = Description = = 
 The feathers on the head , neck and breast of the Mauritius blue pigeon were silvery white , long , stiffened and pointed , especially around the neck . A patch of bright red , naked skin surrounded the eyes , and extended across the cheeks to the beak , which was greenish with a dark tip . The plumage of the body was indigo , and the back , scapular feathers and wings were metallic blue . The base of the outer rectrices was partially blackish blue . The tail feathers and tail coverts were maroon . The legs were dark slate @-@ grey . The iris was reddish orange and had an inner yellow ring . The bird was 30 cm ( 12 in ) in length , the wings were 208 mm ( 8 @.@ 2 in ) , the tail was 132 mm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) , the culmen was 25 mm ( 1 in ) , and the tarsals were 28 mm ( 1 @.@ 10 in ) . It was the largest and most robust member of its genus , and the hackles were longer and covered a larger area than in other blue pigeons . 
 Unlike the three surviving skins of Mauritius blue pigeons , one of two illustrations ( the other is in black @-@ and @-@ white ) of a live individual kept in the Netherlands around 1790 shows a red forehead . Both sexes of the Seychelles blue pigeon also have red foreheads , and Julian Hume has suggested that the image depicts a male , which was described as " infinitely more handsome " than the female by Cossigny in the mid @-@ 18th century . Hume therefore interprets the three surviving skins as belonging to female specimens . A Mauritian woman recalling observations of Mauritius blue pigeons around 1815 mentioned green as one of its colours . Juvenile Seychelles and Comoro blue pigeons have green feathers , so this may also have been the case for juvenile Mauritian pigeons . 
 Some depictions and descriptions have shown the legs of Mauritius blue pigeons as red , like those of the Madagascar blue pigeon . The legs of the Paris specimen were painted red when the original colour faded , presumably on the basis of such accounts . The legs of the two other surviving specimens have not been painted and have faded to a yellowish brown . This feature is not mentioned in contemporary accounts , and such depictions are thought to be erroneous . Some modern restorations of the bird have also depicted it with facial crenulations , like those of the Seychelles blue pigeon . This feature was unknown from contemporary accounts , until the 1660s report of Johannes Pretorius about his stay on Mauritius was published in 2015 , where he mentioned the bird 's " warty face " .

 Few descriptions of the behaviour of Mauritius blue pigeons are known ; unpublished notes by Desjardins are now lost . An individual was brought to the Netherlands around 1790 , where it survived in the menagerie of William V , Prince of Orange for three months before dying of oedema . The only two known life drawings of the species ( by G. <unk> ) depict this individual . The illustrations show a displaying male raising its hackles into a ruff . This is a characteristic behaviour of other blue pigeons , too , and they can also vibrate their hackles . The following description of the display behaviour and calls of this individual was written on the back on the coloured drawing by Arnout Vosmaer , director of the menagerie : 
 These [ pigeons are ] dark @-@ blue with lead coloured head @-@ feathers , which they can turn upwards just as a collar , were sent to me from the Cape , but originated from an Isle Mauritius . Presented to the court by the Baron I. N. E. van Lynden 1790 , and were called <unk> Hollandais . One only I have received alive but died later after a few months from dropsy . In the evening 11 till 12 o 'clock and many times during the night it made nice sounds 10 to 12 times quickly after another like <unk> <unk> [ pronounced Barf Barf ] , and during the day a kind of cooing sound . 
 The Mauritius blue pigeon probably lived in pairs or small groups in humid , mountainous evergreen forests , like their extant relatives . Subfossil remains have been found in mid @-@ west , mid @-@ east and south @-@ east Mauritius , indicating that the bird was once widespread . By 1812 , Jacques Gérard Milbert stated that solitary individuals were found in river valleys . They probably became rarer during French rule in Mauritius ( 1715 – 1810 ) , as lowland areas of the island were almost completely deforested during this time . 
 Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man , so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct . Before humans arrived , forests covered Mauritius entirely , but very little remains today because of deforestation . The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened . The Mauritius blue pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo , the red rail , the Mascarene grey parakeet , the broad @-@ billed parrot , the Mauritius owl , the Mascarene coot , the Mauritian shelduck , the Mauritian duck and the Mauritius night heron . Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle @-@ backed Mauritius giant tortoise , the domed Mauritius giant tortoise , the Mauritian giant skink and the Round Island burrowing boa . The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands . Some plants , such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid , have also become extinct . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Fruits and nuts were probably the mainstay of the Mauritius blue pigeon 's diet , and like other blue pigeons , it may have occupied the upper canopy , and migrated seasonally to where food was available . Cossigny dissected a specimen in the mid @-@ 18th century and later sent it and its stomach contents to René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur with a letter describing his findings . The gizzard and crop contained four " nuts " , which Cossigny was told were the seeds of either Calophyllum <unk> or <unk> <unk> . The Comoro and Seychelles blue pigeons also feed on C. <unk> , and the strong gizzard of the former helps in the digestion of the seeds . In 1812 Jacques Gérard Milbert provided the only description of the behaviour of the bird in the wild : 
 The second is the pigeon with a mane ; the inhabitants of the Ile de France [ Mauritius ] call it pigeon <unk> ; the head , neck and chest are adorned with long pointed white feathers which it can raise at will ; the rest of the body , and the wings , are a fine deep violet ; the end of the tail is a purplish red . It is one of the finest species of its kind ... The second of these birds lives solitary in river valleys , where I have often seen it without being able to secure one . It eats fruit and fresh water molluscs . 
 The claim that the bird fed on river molluscs was criticised by Alphonse Milne @-@ Edwards and Emile Oustalet in 1893 , with the later agreement of James Greenway in 1967 , as blue pigeons are principally arboreal . It has since been pointed out that other mainly frugivorous pigeons , such as species of Ptilinopus and Gallicolumba , do occasionally eat molluscs and other invertebrates . The two species of <unk> have also been reported as eating freshwater snails , and one was seen hunting tadpoles . Milbert may in any case have been referring to arboreal snails , as extant blue pigeons rarely land on the ground . A diet of snails would have provided the birds with calcium for egg production . Pretorius attempted to keep juvenile and adult Mauritius blue pigeons in captivity , but all his specimens died . This is probably because the species was almost exclusively frugivorous , like extant blue pigeons . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 The Mauritius blue pigeon coexisted with humans for 200 years . Its decline can be correlated with deforestation , which is also the main threat to extant blue pigeons . Little lowland forest was left on the island by 1859 . <unk> birds often need a large area for foraging and move between forest types to feed on different types of food , which grow irregularly . Other blue pigeons perch on bare branches , making them vulnerable to hunters . 
 Cossigny noted that the bird had become rare by 1755 , but were common 23 years before , and attributed the decline to deforestation and hunting by escaped slaves . On the other hand , Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre stated they were still common in 1790 . The Mauritius blue pigeon was not seasonally poisonous like the pink pigeon , which still survives on Mauritius today , but it was reputed to be . In spite of this , it was hunted for food , and some early accounts praised the flavour the bird . Extant blue pigeons are also considered good food , and are heavily hunted as a result , and it appears another population of them was hunted to extinction from the Farquhar and Providence islands . The Mauritius blue pigeon was easy to catch due to island tameness . 
 The last confirmed specimen was shot in the Savanne district in 1826 , but the 1832 report by Desjardins suggests that some could still be found in remote forests in the centre of the island . Edward Newton ( convinced that the pigeon still survived ) interviewed two inhabitants of Mauritius about the Mauritius blue pigeon in 1863 , and these accounts suggest that the bird survived until at least 1837 . The first interviewee claimed he had killed two specimens when Colonel James Simpson stayed on the island , which was 1826 – 37 . The second was a woman who had last seen a bird around this time , and recalled hunts of it in approximately 1815 , in a swampy area near Black River Gorges , south western Mauritius : 
 When she was a girl and used to go into the forest with her father de <unk> , she has seen quantities of Pigeon Hollandais and <unk> [ Hypsipetes olivaceus ] , both species were so tame they might be knocked down with sticks , & her father used to kill more that way than by shooting them , as she was a nervous child . Her father always warned her before he fired , but she would entreat him to knock the bird down with his stick & not to shoot it – she said the last Pigeon Hollandais she saw was about 27 years ago just after she married poor old Moon , it was brought out of the forest by a marron . She said it was larger than a tame pigeon & was all the colours of the rainbow , particularly about the head , red , green & blue . 
 It can be concluded that the Mauritius blue pigeon became extinct in the 1830s . Apart from habitat destruction and hunting , introduced predators , mainly crab @-@ eating macaques , were probably also responsible . 
 = Women in Classical Athens = 
 The study of the lives of women in Classical Athens has been a significant part of classical scholarship since the 1970s . Our knowledge of Athenian women 's lives comes from a variety of ancient sources . Much of it is literary evidence from various genres , such as tragedy , comedy , and oratory . Other pieces of evidence are archaeological , for instance epigraphy and pottery . What links all of this evidence is that it was produced by , and largely for , men : there is therefore no direct ancient testimony by Classical Athenian women on their own lives . 
 Classical Athenian girls were not formally educated ; rather , their mothers would have taught them the skills they would need to run a household . They married young , often to much older men . When they married , Athenian women had two main roles : to bear children , and to run the household . In elite families , there was an ideology of seclusion , and wealthy women would not have been permitted to socialise with unrelated men . However , in most families this ideology would have been impractical : women were needed to carry out tasks such as going to the market and drawing water , which required taking time outside the house where interactions with men were possible . 
 Legally , women 's rights were limited . They were barred from political participation , and Athenian women were not permitted to represent themselves in law , though it seems that metic women ( a metic was a resident alien ; free , but without the rights and privileges of an Athenian citizen ) could . They were also forbidden from conducting any economic transactions worth more than a nominal amount . However , it seems that this restriction was not always obeyed . Especially in poorer families , women would have worked to earn money , and would also have been responsible for household tasks such as cooking and washing clothes . Athenian women had limited capacity to own property , though they could have significant dowries , and could inherit . 
 The area of civic life in which Athenian women were most free to participate was the religious and ritual sphere . Along with important festivals reserved solely for women , they participated in many mixed @-@ sex ritual activities . Of particular importance in Athens was the cult of Athena <unk> , whose priestess held considerable influence . Women played an important role in the <unk> , the annual festival in honour of Athena . Along with the city @-@ level religious rituals , women also played an important role in domestic religious ritual . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 = = = Approaches = = = 
 Before the 20th century , and in some cases as late as the 1940s , historians largely took ancient literary sources at face value as evidence for the lives of women in the ancient world . In the middle of the 20th century this began to change . Early innovations in the study of women in ancient history began in France , as the Annales School began to take a greater interest in underrepresented groups . Robert <unk> was an influential early author on women in Greece . Feminist philosophy also examined in women in the classical world : Simone de Beauvoir 's The Second Sex was an influential early work in this field . 
 Influenced by second @-@ wave feminism , the study of women in antiquity became widespread in the English @-@ speaking world in the 1970s . The amount of scholarship on women in the ancient world has increased dramatically since then . The first major publication in the field was a 1973 special issue of the journal Arethusa , which aimed to look at women in the ancient world from a feminist perspective . In 1975 , the first edition of Sarah Pomeroy 's Goddesses , Whores , Wives , and Slaves was published . This has been described as " the inauguration of women 's studies within classics " . Lin Foxhall called Pomeroy 's book " revolutionary " and " a major step forward " from previous English @-@ language scholarship on ancient women . According to Shelley Haley , Pomeroy 's work " legitimized the study of Greek and Roman women in ancient times " . 
 However , classics has been characterised as a " notoriously conservative " field , and initially women 's history was slow to be adopted : from 1970 to 1985 , only a few articles on ancient women were published in major journals . In 1976 , a single review covered " the entire field of recent scholarship on women in all of classical antiquity " . However , by 1980 , writing about women in classical Athens was called " positively trendy " , and in 1989 women 's studies was described as " one of the most exciting growth points " in classics . 
 Along with feminist theory , the work of Michel Foucault , influenced by structuralism and post @-@ structuralism , has had a significant impact on the study of gender in classical antiquity . Foucault has been praised for looking at gender through the lens of social systems . According to Lin Foxhall , his approach has " had more impact on the scholarship of gender than anything since second @-@ wave feminism " and is " virtually canonical in some quarters " . However , Foucault 's work has been criticised for its " shallow discussion of women as historical subjects " . 
 Scholarly interest in the lives of women in the ancient world has continued to increase . By 2000 , a review of books focused on women in ancient Greece published over a three @-@ year period could cover eighteen works without being exhaustive . The range of subjects covered by women 's historians also increased substantially ; in 1980 the question of women 's status was the most important topic to historians of Athenian women , but by 2000 scholars were also working on " gender , the body , sexuality , masculinity and other topics " . 
 Until the 1980s , scholars of women in classical Athens were primarily interested in the status of women and how they were viewed by men . Early feminist scholarship aimed to assert that women were significant in ancient history and to demonstrate how they had been oppressed . Early scholars held that Athenian women had an " ignoble " place , but in 1925 this position was challenged by Arnold Wycombe Gomme . According to Gomme , women had high social status despite their limited legal rights ; his view has reinforced that position ever since . Pomeroy attributes the variety of viewpoints to the types of evidence prioritised by scholars , with those arguing for the high status of Athenian women predominantly citing tragedy and those arguing against it emphasising oratory . 
 With increased interest in women 's history by classical scholars , a number of related disciplines have also become more significant . Classicists have become more interested in the family since the Second World War , with W. K. Lacey 's 1968 The Family in Classical Greece particularly influential . The history of childhood emerged as a sub @-@ discipline of history during the 1960s , and other disciplines such as the study of ancient medicine have been influenced by feminist approaches to the classics . 
 = = Childhood = = 
 Infant mortality was common in classical Athens , with perhaps 25 percent of children dying at or soon after birth . In addition to the natural risks of childbirth , the ancient Athenians practiced infanticide ; according to Sarah Pomeroy , girls were more likely to be killed than boys . Donald Engels has argued that a high rate of female infanticide was " demographically impossible " , although scholars have since largely dismissed this argument . Although scholars have tried to determine the rate of female infanticide , Cynthia Patterson rejects this approach as asking the wrong questions ; Patterson suggests that scholars should instead consider the social importance and impact of the practice . 
 Janet Burnett Grossman writes that girls appear to be commemorated about as frequently as boys on surviving Attic gravestones , although previous scholars suggested that boys were commemorated up to twice as often . If they survived , Athenian children were named in a ceremony ( the <unk> ) ten days after birth . Other Athenian ceremonies celebrating childbirth ( at five , seven , and forty days after birth ) were also observed . Later rites of passage were apparently more common and elaborate for boys than for girls . 
 Classical Athenian girls probably reached menarche at about age fourteen , when they would have married . Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity . Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides , and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi ( vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day ) . 
 Athenian girls were not formally educated ; instead , their mothers taught them the domestic skills necessary for running a household . Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric , necessary for effective political participation , and physical education in preparation for military service . These skills were not considered necessary for women , who were barred from learning them . Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops , hoops , and seesaws , and played games such as piggyback . The gravestone of <unk> , an Athenian girl aged about five which is in the <unk> museum in Munich , shows her holding a doll ; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background . 
 More is known about the role of Athenian children in religion than about any other aspect of their lives , and they seem to have played a prominent role in religious ceremonies . Girls made offerings to Artemis on the eve of their marriage , during pregnancy , and at childbirth . Although girls and boys appear on the wine jugs connected with the early @-@ spring festival of the Anthesteria , depictions of boys are far more common . 
 = = Family life = = 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 The primary role of free women in classical Athens was to marry and bear children . The emphasis on marriage as a way to perpetuate the family through childbearing had changed from archaic Athens , when ( at least amongst the powerful ) marriages were as much about making beneficial connections as they were about perpetuating the family . Athenian women typically first married much older men around age fourteen . Before this they were looked after by their closest male relative , who was responsible for choosing their husband ; the bride had little say in the choice . Since a classical Athenian marriage was concerned with the production of children who could inherit their parents ' property , women often married relatives . This was especially the case of women with no brothers ( epikleroi ) , whose nearest male relative was given the first option of marrying her . 
 Athenian women married with a dowry , which was intended to provide their livelihood . Depending on the family , a dowry might have been as much as 25 percent of the family 's wealth . Daughters of even the poorest families apparently had dowries worth ten minae . Rich families could provide much larger dowries ; Demosthenes ' sister , for instance , had a dowry of two talents ( 120 minae ) . <unk> usually consisted of movable goods and cash , although land was occasionally included . 
 Only in exceptional circumstances would there have been no dowry , since the lack of one could have been interpreted as proof that no legitimate marriage occurred . A dowry may have been occasionally overlooked if a bride 's family connections were very favorable ; Callias reportedly married <unk> , a daughter of the noble <unk> , to join that family and was sufficiently wealthy that her lack of a dowry did not concern him . 
 Married women were responsible for the day @-@ to @-@ day running of the household . At marriage , they assumed responsibility for the prosperity of their husband 's household and the health of its members . Their primary responsibilities were bearing , raising and caring for children , weaving cloth and making clothes . They would also have been responsible for caring for ill household members , supervising slaves , and ensuring that the household had sufficient food . 
 In classical Athenian marriages , husband or wife could legally initiate a divorce . The woman 's closest male relative ( who would be her kyrios if she were not married ) could also do so , apparently even against the couple 's wishes . After divorce , the husband was required to return the dowry or pay 18 percent interest annually so the woman 's livelihood would continue and she could remarry . If there were children at the time of the divorce , they remained in their father 's house and he remained responsible for their upbringing . If a woman committed adultery , her husband was legally required to divorce her . A married epikleros would be divorced so she could marry her nearest relative . 
 = = = Seclusion = = = 
 In classical Athens , women ideally remained apart from men . This ideology of separation was so strong that a party to a lawsuit ( Lysias ' Against Simon ) could claim that his sister and nieces were ashamed to be in the presence of their male relatives as evidence that they were respectable . Women tended to live in more remote rooms of the house , farther from windows and doors . Some historians have accepted this ideology as an accurate description of how Athenian women lived their lives ; W. B. Tyrrell , for example , said : " The outer door of the house is the boundary for the free women " . However , even in antiquity it was recognised that an ideology of separation could not be practiced by many Athenians . In Politics , Aristotle asked : " How is it possible to prevent the wives of the poor from going out of doors ? " 
 The ideal that respectable women should remain out of the public eye was so entrenched in classical Athens that simply naming a citizen woman could be a source of shame . <unk> were the only group of women to be exempt from this rule . Thucydides wrote in his History of the Peloponnesian War , " Great honour is hers whose reputation among males is least , whether for praise or blame " . Women were identified in terms of their male relatives , which could create confusion if two sisters were referred to as the son ( or brother ) of the same man . In law @-@ court speeches , where a woman 's position is often a key point ( especially in inheritance cases ) , orators seem to have deliberately avoided naming them . Although Demosthenes speaks about his mother and sister in five extant speeches relating to his inheritance , neither is ever named ; in his body of extant work , 27 women ( compared to 509 men ) are named . The use of a woman 's name – as in the case of Neaera and <unk> in <unk> ' speech Against Neaera – has been interpreted as implying that she is not respectable . John Gould has written that women named in classical Athenian oratory can be divided into three groups : women of low status , the speaker 's opponents , and the deceased . 
 In practice , only wealthy families would have been able to implement this ideology . Women 's responsibilities would have forced them to leave the house frequently – to fetch water from the well or wash clothing , for example . Although wealthy families may have had slaves to enable free women to remain in the house , but most would not have had enough slaves to prevent free women from leaving at all . According to Gould , even Athenian women forced to work outside the home for economic reasons would have had a conceptual ( if not physical ) boundary preventing them from interacting with unrelated men . In contrast , Kostas Vlassopoulos has posited that some areas of Athens ( such as the agora ) were " free spaces " where women and men could interact . 
 Even the most respectable citizen women emerged on ritual occasions ( primarily festivals , sacrifices , and funerals ) , where they would have interacted with men . The Thesmophoria , an important festival to Demeter which was restricted to women , was organised and conducted by Athenian citizen women . Athenian women also ventured outdoors socially . David Cohen writes , " One of the most important activities of women included visiting or helping friends or relatives " , and even wealthy women who could afford to spend their entire lives indoors probably interacted socially with other women outside in addition to the religious and ritual occasions when they were seen in public . According to D. M. Schaps ( citing Cohen ) , the ideology of separation in classical Athens would have encouraged women to remain indoors but necessary outside activities would have overridden it . 
 = = Legal rights = = 
 The juridical status of women in Athens is beautifully indicated by the single entry under " women " in the index to Harrison 's Law of Athens i : it reads simply " women , disabilities " . 
 Residents of Athens were divided into three classes : Athenians , metics , and slaves . Each of these classes had different rights and obligations : for instance , Athenians could not be made slaves , while metics could . Nicole <unk> writes that Athenian women were not considered citizens . This is not universally accepted , however . Eva Cantarella disagrees , arguing that both of the Greek words used to denote citizenship , <unk> and <unk> , were used to refer to Athenian women . <unk> Blok argues that military and political service were not <unk> of citizenship ; instead , she says , it was participation in the cultic life of the polis which made a person a citizen . Thus , according to Blok Athenian men and women were both considered citizens . Similarly , Cynthia Patterson says that while the English word " citizen " connotes sharing in political and judicial rights , the equivalent Classical Athenian concepts were more about " being a member of the Athenian family " . She thus argues that the English words " citizen " and " citizenship " are best avoided when discussing Classical Athenian concepts . 
 In most cases , Athenian women had the same rights and responsibilities as Athenian men . However , Athenian women did have some significant disabilities at law compared to their male counterparts . Like slaves and metics , they were denied political freedom , being were excluded from the law courts and the Assembly . The rights of metic women were closer to those of metic men . Metic women only paid 6 drachmas per year poll tax , compared to the 12 paid by their male counterparts , and did not perform military service , but other than this their legal rights and responsibilities were the same as those of male metics . 
 In Athenian law courts , juries were all male . Athenian women could not appear as litigants ; they were represented by their kyrios or , if he was on the other side of the dispute , by any man who wished to . According to Simon Goldhill , " The Athenian court seems to have been remarkably unwilling to allow any female presence in the civic space of the law court itself " . Metic women , however , apparently could appear in court cases on their own behalf , and could initiate legal action . 
 In the political sphere , men made up the Assembly and held political office . Although Athenian women were formally prevented from participating in the democratic process , Kostas Vlassopoulos writes that they would have been exposed to political debate in the agora . Additionally , some Athenian women do seem to have involved themselves in public affairs , despite their formal disbarment from the political arena . Plutarch , in his Life of Pericles , tells two stories about <unk> 's public actions . Once , he says , she criticised Pericles for making war against other Greek cities ; on another occasion she pleaded with him not to prosecute her brother Cimon on charges of treason . 
 Until the Periclean law of citizenship in 451 – 50 , any child with an Athenian father was considered an Athenian citizen . Blok suggests that in this period it was also legally possible for a child to be considered an Athenian citizen through an Athenian mother , even with a non @-@ citizen father , though she concedes that this would have been exceptional . However , other historians disagree – K. R. Walters , for instance , explicitly dismisses the possibility , arguing that without a citizen father a child had no way of gaining entry into a deme or phratry . Blok suggests that the child might have instead been enrolled in the deme and phratry of the maternal grandfather . After the passage of Pericles ' citizenship law , the importance of Athenian women seems to have increased , although they gained no legal rights . 
 = = Religion = = 
 Religion was the one area of public life in which women could participate freely ; according to Christopher Carey , it was the " only area of Greek life in which a woman could approach anything like the influence of a man " . Women 's religious activities , including responsibility for mourning at funerals and involvement in female and mixed @-@ sex cult activity , were an indispensable part of Athenian society . Both Athenian and non @-@ Athenian women participated in public religious activities . The state @-@ controlled Eleusinian mysteries , for instance , were open to all Greek speaking people , men and women , free and unfree alike . 
 = = = Cult of Athena = = = 
 The cult of Athena <unk> ( the city 's eponymous goddess ) was central to Athenian society , reinforcing morality and maintaining societal structure . Women played a key role in the cult ; the <unk> of Athena was a position of great importance , and the priestess could use her influence to support political positions . According to Herodotus , before the Battle of Salamis the priestess of Athena encouraged the evacuation of Athens by telling the Athenians that the snake sacred to Athena ( which lived on the Acropolis ) had already left . 
 The most important festival to Athena in Athens was the Lesser Panathenaea , held annually , which was open to both sexes . Men and women were apparently not segregated during the procession leading the animals sacrificed to the altar , the festival 's most religiously @-@ significant part . <unk> , both men and women , also had role in the Panathenaic procession , though it was subordinate to the role of the Athenians . In the procession , young noble girls ( <unk> ) carried sacred baskets . The girls were required to be virgins ; to prevent a candidate from being selected was , according to Pomeroy , to question her good name . The sister of <unk> was reportedly rejected as a kanephoros by the sons of Peisistratos , precipitating his assassination of Hipparchus . 
 Each year , the women of Athens weaved a new peplos for a wooden statue of Athena . Every four years , for the Great Panathenaea , the peplos was for a much larger statue of Athena and could be used as a sail . The task was begun by two girls chosen from those between the ages of seven and eleven , and was finished by other women . 
 = = = Women 's festivals = = = 
 The most important women 's festival was the Thesmophoria , a fertility rite for Demeter which was observed by married noblewomen . During the festival women stayed for three days on Demeter 's hilltop sanctuary , conducting rites and celebrating . Although the specific rituals of the Thesmophoria are unknown , pigs were sacrificed and buried ; the remains of those sacrificed the previous year were offered to the goddess . 
 Most women 's festivals were dedicated to Demeter , but some festivals ( including the <unk> and the <unk> ) honoured other goddesses . Both these festivals were rites of passage in which girls became adult women . In the <unk> , virgin girls were consecrated to Artemis of <unk> before marriage ; in the <unk> , girls ( <unk> ) who had spent the previous year serving Athena left the Acropolis by a passage near the precinct of Aphrodite carrying baskets filled with items unknown to them . 
 = = = Theatre = = = 
 The Athenian festival of the Great Dionysia included five days of dramatic performances in the Theatre of Dionysus , and the <unk> had a dramatic competition as part of its festival . Whether women were permitted to attend the theatre during these festivals has been the subject of lengthy debate by classicists , largely revolving around whether the theatre was considered a religious or a civic event . 
 Jeffrey Henderson writes that women were present in the theatre , citing Plato 's Laws and Gorgias as saying that drama was addressed to men , women and children . Henderson also mentions later stories about Athenian theatre , such as the tale that Aeschylus ' Eumenides had frightened women in the audience into <unk> . Other evidence of the presence of women at the theatre in Athens includes the absence of surviving prohibitions against their attendance and the importance of women in Athenian rituals , especially those associated with Dionysus . 
 According to Simon Goldhill , the evidence is fundamentally inconclusive . Goldhill writes that the theatre can be seen as a social and political event analogous with the Assembly and the courtroom , and women may have been excluded . David <unk> Roselli writes that although Goldhill 's perspective is valuable , he does not sufficiently consider the theatre 's ritual purpose . If women did attend the theatre , they may have sat separately from the men . 
 = = = Private religion = = = 
 Along with the major community @-@ based religious rituals , women played an important role in domestic religion . Women took part in a number of private rituals to prepare for and celebrate marriage . They also played a major role in funeral and mourning rituals . 
 Before marriage , girls made dedications to Artemis , often of childhood toys and locks of hair . Along with Artemis , girls made pre @-@ marital sacrifices to Gaia and Uranus , the Erinyes and Moirai , and to their ancestors . It was customary for the bride to bathe before her wedding ; jars called loutrophoroi were used to draw the water , and many of these were afterwards dedicated to nymphs . For instance , at a shrine to a nymph on the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens , many fragments of loutrophoroi have been discovered with the word Nymphe inscribed on them . 
 By the classical period , laws designated which women could mourn at a funeral ; mourners had to be cousins of , or more closely related to , the deceased . Women influenced funeral arrangements , with the speaker in Isaeus On the Estate of <unk> explaining that he acceded to his grandmother 's wishes for how his grandfather would be buried . This responsibility continued after the funeral , and women regularly visited the graves of family members to present offerings . A tomb was customarily visited three , nine , thirty days , and a year after the funeral . Images on Attic lekythoi show women bringing offerings to a grave . 
 = = Economic activity = = 
 The economic power of Athenian women was legally constrained . Historians have traditionally considered that ancient Greek women , particularly in Classical Athens , lacked economic influence . Athenian women were forbidden from entering a contract worth more than a <unk> of barley , enough to feed an average family for six days . In at least one instance , however , an Athenian woman dealt with a significantly larger sum and Deborah Lyons writes that the existence of such a law has " recently come under question " . Despite this , there is no evidence that Athenian women owned land or slaves ( the two most valuable forms of property ) . 
 Although Athenian women were not legally permitted to dispose of large sums of money , they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives . Income from a dowry could be significant . The larger a woman 's dowry relative to her husband 's wealth , the more influence she was likely to have in the household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced . Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative , but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property . 
 Respectable Athenian women remained separate from unrelated men and Athenian citizens considered it degrading for citizen @-@ women to work , but women ( free and unfree ) are attested as working in a number of capacities . Women engaged in occupations which were an extension of household jobs , such as textile work and washing , and those unrelated to household tasks : cobblers , <unk> , net @-@ weavers , potters , and grooms . 
 Some Athenian citizen women were merchants , and Athenian law forbade criticism of anyone ( male or female ) for selling in the marketplace . Women would also have gone to the market to purchase goods ; although wealthy women owned slaves they could send on errands , poorer women went to the market themselves . 
 = = = Prostitution = = = 
 In classical Athens , female prostitution was legal , albeit disreputable , and prostitution was taxed . Prostitutes in Athens were either " <unk> " or hetairai ( " companions " , a euphemism for higher @-@ class prostitution ) . Although many were slaves or metics ( and state @-@ run brothels staffed by slaves were said to have been part of Solon 's reforms ) , Athenian @-@ born women also worked in the sex trade in Athens . <unk> apparently charged one to six obols for each sexual act ; hetairai were more likely to receive gifts and favours from their clients , enabling to them to maintain a fiction that they were not being paid for sex . 
 Prostitutes were often hired by the hosts of symposia as entertainment for guests , as seen in red @-@ figure vase paintings . Prostitutes were also drawn on drinking cups as pinups for male entertainment . Dancing girls and musicians entertaining at symposia might have been sexually assaulted ; in Aristophanes ' comedy <unk> , a dancing girl is treated as a prostitute and Euripides charges a guard one drachma to have sex with her . 
 <unk> could be the most independent , wealthy , and influential women in Athens , and could form long @-@ term relationships with rich and powerful men . The most successful hetairai were free to choose their clients , and sometimes became concubines of their former clients . 
 Athenian prostitutes probably committed infanticide more frequently than married citizen women ; Sarah Pomeroy suggests that they would have preferred daughters – who could become prostitutes – to sons . Some prostitutes also bought slaves , and trained abandoned children to work in the profession . 
 = California State Route 37 = 
 State Route 37 ( SR 37 ) is a state highway in the northern part of California that runs 21 miles ( 34 km ) along the northern shore of San Pablo Bay . It is built from U.S. Route 101 in Novato and runs through the southern tips of Sonoma and Napa counties to Interstate 80 in Vallejo . It serves as a vital connection between the four counties of the North Bay Area , north of San Francisco ; Sonoma Raceway and Six Flags Discovery Kingdom are accessible from Route 37 . 
 Route 37 has been proposed to be built to freeway standards since the early 1950s . However , the proposal was met with many economic and environmental obstacles , making the task all but impossible for much of the route . Problems included a levee break in Vallejo which turned part of the land around the highway into a marsh that is home to endangered salt marsh harvest mice , and a section of highway known as " Blood Alley " for its high rate of fatal accidents . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Intended to run from State Route 251 , a highway that has not been constructed , SR 37 begins in Novato with a junction at U.S. Route 101 and heads northeast as a freeway for about a quarter mile before becoming a four @-@ lane expressway . The route passes over the Petaluma River into Sonoma County before meeting the southern terminus of State Route 121 at a signal @-@ controlled intersection near Sears Point and the Sonoma Raceway . 
 The route continues as a divided two @-@ lane expressway in a more easterly , then southeasterly , direction as it crosses <unk> Creek and proceeds through the Napa Sonoma Marsh at the northern edge of San Pablo Bay . Before the construction of the barrier in 1995 , this portion of SR 37 was three lanes with the middle lane alternately serving as a passing lane for each direction . This stretch of highway was given the nickname of " Blood Alley " for its high @-@ rate of fatal accidents . With the middle lane removed , accidents dropped dramatically . 
 SR 37 becomes a four @-@ lane freeway on Mare Island , approaching northern Vallejo . After it crosses over the Napa River Bridge , it continues as a freeway , overlapping the old highway alignment and passing north of the old road known as Marine World Parkway ( due to its proximity to the Six Flags Discovery Kingdom , previously known as Marine World ) . SR 37 travels in a northeasterly direction along the White Slough before turning east as it crosses over State Route 29 and heads to its eastern terminus at I @-@ 80 as the James <unk> Memorial Highway ( honoring a Vallejo police officer who was killed in the line of duty ) . In the early 1990s , the stretch between Fairgrounds Drive , which serves as the entrance to Discovery Kingdom , and Mini Drive was upgraded to a freeway . In 2004 and 2005 , following over fifty years of complications , the remaining non @-@ freeway section in Vallejo was upgraded as well . 
 Route 37 is also known as William " Randy " Bolt Memorial Highway from Route 29 to Skaggs Road ( honoring a California Department of Justice agent who was killed in the line of duty in an accident along SR 37 ) , and Sears Point Toll Road , which was originally a toll road that ran from Route 121 to Vallejo . This route is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System and is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System . However , it is not designated as a scenic highway by Caltrans . 
 = = History = = 
 The stretch of road east of Sears Point was once part of the historical El Camino Real . As a result of the State Highways Acts of the early 20th century , the Black Point Cut @-@ off was built over it and opened to traffic in 1917 . This highway followed the current alignment east of Sears Point , before diverting northeast along present @-@ day Route 121 . It was first designated Legislative Route 8 ( LRN 8 ) , later being signed as State Route 37 . 
 Prior to being under State control , the section between Sears Point and Vallejo was known as the Sears Point Toll Road , a toll road managed by Golden Gate Ferry that was built over an ancient Native American trail . When it was purchased by the State in 1938 , tolls were removed ; it then became signed as State Route 48 until 1964 . 
 Route 37 was redefined in the 1964 state highway renumbering as a route starting at SR 251 , then SR 17 , near <unk> and ending at I @-@ 80 near Lake Chabot . The whole of SR 37 has been proposed to be built to freeway standards since the early 1950s . However , the proposal was met with many economic and environmental obstacles , making the task all but impossible for much of the route . 
 = = = Sears Point Toll Road = = = 
 As late as 1926 , Golden Gate Ferries , owners of the Sears Point Toll Road Co . , began plans to build the Sears Point Toll Road , with a contract awarded to Oakland @-@ based Hutchinson Company in October 1927 . The paved toll road was to be built on top of an ancient Native American trail along the San Pablo Bay shore between the Sacramento Highway and the Black Point cut @-@ off ( LRN 8 ) near Sears Point . It was expected to cost $ <unk> , with a toll not exceeding $ 0 @.@ 35 . Toll road officials explained the purpose of the road ; to stimulate motor vehicle usage by reducing the commute times and expenses of motorists traveling from the East Bay and Sacramento areas by offering a more direct route toward Marin , Sonoma and the Redwood Highway . The road opened for traffic in 1928 . 
 On November 29 , 1932 , the California State Highway Commission received a recommendation to purchase the road and was able to invest $ <unk> by 1936 . However , the U.S. Navy owned rights to the right @-@ of @-@ way of part of the route , and opposed the purchase . This resulted in congressional actions to establish a clear title deed for the route . House Representative Richard J. Welch was one of the earliest government officials to pressure the State of California to acquire the toll road in order to convert it into a toll @-@ free highway . He argued that having only one toll road to travel in order to reach the Golden Gate Bridge would benefit commuters ; he also cited the ten and seventh @-@ tenths @-@ mile difference in distance between the toll road and a route through Napa . A Navy Department deed permitting the State to purchase the road was granted by the Attorney General on October 26 , 1938 . The highway then became signed as State Route 48 until the 1964 renumbering . 
 = = = Highway upgrading in Vallejo = = = 
 By 1955 , talks began about upgrading the highway . After a proposition to turn much of the route into a toll road failed , it was decided a four @-@ lane freeway would be the best decision . However , opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I @-@ 80 . In 1977 , a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land , turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species . Because of its new status , environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project . 
 Soon after , the project was split into different phases to handle problems with particular areas . It was first divided between the newly created marshlands and the section between Sonoma Blvd . ( SR 29 ) and I @-@ 80 . With Marine World being relocated , the city was able to the widen the latter section and build an overpass across Fairgrounds Drive in 1992 . 
 = = = " Blood Alley " = = = 
 While the Vallejo section of SR 37 was being updated , another problem with the route would hinder its progress . The section between Sears Point and Mare Island was plagued with fatal accidents , earning its nickname of " Blood Alley " . Between 1966 and 1970 , 27 people lost their lives to it . In a preliminary effort to reduce the fatalities , officials established both a daylight test section , requiring all cars to keep their headlights on during the day , and passing lanes . However , these efforts were ineffective . 
 In 1993 , local resident Jim Poulos campaigned to have a barrier erected after the death of his 18 @-@ year @-@ old son , Frankie , on " Blood Alley " . At this time , the situation with this stretch only worsened as the death toll between 1990 and 1996 rose to thirty @-@ one . At first , Caltrans thought the barrier would make matters worse since it would be difficult for emergency vehicles to attend to accidents ; environmental issues were also cited . Caltrans was waiting for the ability to create a causeway to span the area instead . Poulos continued his campaign despite opposition , and was granted the barrier in 1995 . The barrier was not built without controversy , as it also eliminated the passing lanes . However , since the barriers were built , there were no longer any crossover accidents as of 2005 . 
 While the median was built , a few problems needed to be resolved in order for the road to work both safely and in an environmentally friendly way . Emergency personnel needed to quickly access accidents and provide them easy transport to nearby hospitals . To alleviate this problem , Caltrans implemented electric gate technology , which would allow emergency vehicles to cut through certain parts of the median . The other problem was to both protect the plant life and the salt marsh harvest mice residing around the highway . As a result , crews placed timbers and sheeting to protect foliage , and added holes into the median barrier to allow the mice to cross the highway . 
 = = = White Slough and Sonoma Boulevard interchange = = = 
 To protect White Slough while still allowing the widening of SR 37 , the White Slough Protection and Development Act was passed in 1990 . It allowed up to 13 acres of wetlands to be filled but required at least four times as much wetland restoration elsewhere in the Bay Area . 
 After environmental studies on the White Slough , Caltrans widened and elevated that section of the road and converted it to a freeway . To accommodate bicycles and pedestrians , a cycleway was built along the eastbound side of the freeway . Finally , Caltrans completed the overpass which crossed SR 29 , Broadway , and Mini Drive ( bypassing Marine World Parkway , three traffic signaled intersections , and a railroad grade crossing ) . The project was completed in the summer of 2005 , and fully open to traffic on August 20 .

 Since 2011 , the Road Ecology Center at the University of California , Davis has partnered with Caltrans and other regional and local entities to collaboratively plan future scenarios for SR 37 . Since 2014 , this has focused on structural and locational adaptations to the highway in response to potential sea level rise impacts . This is one of the first highways in the country to face vertical or geographic re @-@ location due to likely sea level rise impacts . The most popular option with stakeholders is to place the highway on a causeway , allowing it to escape flooding from sea level rise and reduce impacts to the marshes . This would not eliminate traffic noise impacts to birds , mammals and human communities adjacent to and near ( < 1 km ) the highway . Other options considered have included placing the highway 3 – 4 meters higher on a levee , building a tunnel for the highway under the North Bay , and realigning the highway with existing highways to both eliminate impacts to the marshes and avoid sea level rise impacts .

 = Eddie Buczynski = 
 Edmund " Eddie " Buczynski ( January 28 , 1947 – March 16 , 1989 ) was a prominent American Wiccan and archaeologist who founded two separate traditions of Wicca : Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft and The Minoan Brotherhood . 
 Born to a working @-@ class family in New York City , Buczynski initially planned to become a Roman Catholic priest , before abandoning this idea and embracing his homosexuality by moving to Greenwich Village and associating with the city 's gay scene . Befriending the Wiccan Leo Martello , he was introduced to Herman Slater , with whom he began a relationship . Together they opened an occult supply store , The Warlock Shop . Initially initiated into the New Haven coven of Gwen Thompson , a part of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches ( NECTW ) , he rose to the position of acting high priest before leaving to found his own tradition , Welsh Traditional Witchcraft , in 1972 . Although the tradition proved a success and soon spread , Buczynski himself moved on to Gardnerian Wicca , which he was initiated into in 1973 . 
 In 1974 he was ordained into the Church of the Eternal Source , a Kemetic Pagan group , but moved on again in 1977 , when he founded the Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan tradition for gay and bisexual men . Turning to academia , from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor 's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College , which he followed up with a master 's degree in the subject at Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988 . Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV / AIDS in 1988 , and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year , converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand . In 2012 , the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Childhood : 1947 – 1964 = = = 
 Eddie Buczynski was born on January 28 , 1947 in Brooklyn , New York City to working class – lower middle class parents . His father Edmund , after whom he was named , was the youngest son of Polish parents and had been raised in a Brooklyn tenement with his four brothers and two sisters . Enlisting in the Naval Armed Guard in 1943 , he fought in the Second World War aboard two Liberty ships , the SS John Howard and the SS José Marti . Edmund Junior 's mother , Marie Mauro , was the granddaughter of southern Italian migrants , and had grown up in a Brooklyn apartment . She first began communicating with her future husband in 1944 as pen pals , before meeting him when he returned home on leave . They proceeded to marry against their parents ' wishes on April 27 , 1946 , following the culmination of the war . Settling down in their hometown , their first child was born nine months later . Following the outbreak of the Korean War , in which the U.S. sent troops to combat North Korea , Edmund senior was called back to active duty with the Navy Reserves before being permanently discharged in October 1951 . Returning to New York City , he moved his wife and child from Brooklyn to the middle @-@ class neighborhood of Ozone Park , Queens . 
 In 1952 , Buczynski began elementary education at the Old School Elementary in Queens , where he gained consistently good grades and particularly enjoyed music , reading , drawing and painting . In August 1954 , his mother gave birth to his first brother , Frank , whom he would remain fond of despite the seven @-@ year age gap . Although his family were nominally Catholic , Buczynski took an early interest in the pre @-@ Christian religions of Ancient Egypt and Classical Greece , which he read about in books . He began devising and performing his own rituals to the deities of these religions , sparking his lifelong interest in Contemporary Paganism . His interest in Pagan religion only increased following his father 's sudden death from a heart attack , aged 31 , in August 1958 . His mother would go on to remarry , this time to a man named Edward <unk> , in 1961 . 
 Eddie eventually decided that he wanted to become a Roman Catholic priest , largely following in the footsteps of his uncle , Father Michael . Receiving his Catholic confirmation in early 1961 , in September of that year he began his studies at the Monsignor <unk> Memorial High School in East Elmhurst , a Catholic institution . Bullied for being effeminate and homosexual , Eddie disliked the school , and was ultimately expelled for being overly critical of their religious instruction . In September 1962 he enrolled at John Adams High School , but was again bullied ; becoming increasingly rebellious , he took up smoking cigarettes and marijuana and undertook several failed suicide attempts . Family life became increasingly strained following the birth of a half @-@ brother , Tommy , in September 1962 , and in March 1964 he dropped out of high school and decided to leave home . 
 = = = Herman Slater and embracing Wicca : 1964 – 1972 = = = 
 From Ozone Park , he moved to Manhattan , where a counter @-@ cultural community had built up around the Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side that contained an array of gay people , hippies , occultists and others adopting bohemian lifestyles . Without money , he resorted to working as a rent boy , and made use of both marijuana and LSD . Although he briefly returned to Catholicism , in 1971 he read a copy of Witchcraft Today ( 1954 ) , a book authored by Englishman Gerald Gardner , the founder of Gardnerian Wicca , and it reignited his interest in Pagan religion . In the autumn , he tracked down Leo Martello ( 1931 – 2000 ) , a prominent gay rights activist and Pagan Witch who practiced his own Italian @-@ focused form of the Craft known as the Strega tradition . Although he felt that Buczynski was too inexperienced in magic to begin practicing Strega Craft , Martello befriended and shared his contacts with the young man , and took him with him on a visit to Herman Slater ( 1935 – 1992 ) , a fellow New Yorker who was of Jewish heritage . Like Buczynski and Martello , Slater was gay , and a romantic relationship soon developed between Buczynski – who was attracted to bears – and the older man . Buczynski moved in with Slater to an apartment in the Brooklyn Heights in June 1972 . 
 That year , the couple decided to open up an occult store , named The Warlock Shop , at 300 Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights , New York City ; alongside this venture , they also founded a company , Earth Religion Supplies , Inc , which would later go into publishing . Officially opening on June 21 , 1972 , the back room of the shop would also be used for weekly lectures and would be rented to various occult groups who wanted to assemble there . 
 Still eager to be initiated into a Pagan Witchcraft , or Wiccan , tradition , <unk> began contacting various covens requesting initiation , including the Gardnerian Wiccan coven run in Louisville , Kentucky by Fran and Gerry Fisher and the <unk> Wiccan coven that had been founded by Mary <unk> ; the former refused due to the long @-@ distance between them and the young man , while the latter declined due to Buczynski 's homosexuality . He then approached Gwen Thompson ( 1928 – 1986 ) , matriarch of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches ( NECTW ) , asking for initiation , although declined to inform her of his sexual orientation . Thompson took a liking to the young man , and welcomed him into her coven , where he proceeded to adopt the craft name of " Hermes " . They developed a strong friendship , much to Slater 's dismay , and Buczynski soon rose to a second degree position , adopting an adapted craft name of " Hermes Dionysos " and becoming High Priest of Thompson 's coven . Thompson ultimately became attracted to the young man , and repeatedly asked him to have sex with her , to which he refused . Their friendship broke down , and he was expelled from her North Haven coven . 
 = = = Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft : 1972 – 1973 = = = 
 Having left Thompson 's tradition , Buczynski decided to form his own form of Wicca , which he claimed had actually dated back to the Palaeolithic and transmitted to him by a figure whose anonymity he had to protect . Referring to this new tradition as Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft or the Traditionalist <unk> , it was heavily influenced by the Welsh mythology contained in texts like The Mabinogion and the Arthurian legends which fascinated him , despite his lack of Welsh heritage . It took as its basis the structure of the Gardnerian tradition , with its Book of Shadows being largely based upon that which he had obtained through his work with Thompson , accompanied by sections taken from the recently published Lady Sheba 's The Book of Shadows . Officially founded in October 1972 , later that year an outer court was founded through which to teach interested persons who were not yet initiated . Notably , he welcomed LGBT people and non @-@ caucasians into his tradition at a time when they were denied entry to most other Wiccan covens . Although taking an open attitude to spiritual seekers , Buczynski prevented the occult investigator , Hans Holzer , from entering the outer coven when the latter requested admission to undertake research for his book The Witchcraft Report ; like many in the Pagan and occult community , Buczynski was wary of Holzer 's intentions and the sensationalist claims he purported in his publications . 
 A number of teenagers who were interested in Wicca had begun hanging around at the Warlock Shop , and they too were initiated into the Traditionalist <unk> , after gaining parental permission . Proceeding through the outer court of Buczynski 's coven , they eventually <unk> off to form their own coven , the Children of Branwen , in December 1972 , with prominent members including Robert Carey , Denny Sargent , and Karen and Eddie <unk> . Buczynski initially attended some of the group 's meetings , in order to instruct these students in the Craft , but soon found his time preoccupied with his own primary coven , leaving the coven under the control of high priestess Kay Smith . She would subsequently go on to found a Welsh Traditionalist coven for adults , leaving the position of high priestess to <unk> Tamarack . 
 Through their work at The Warlock Shop , Buczynski and Slater came to meet and befriend Judith and Thomas <unk> ( also known by their craft names of <unk> and Phoenix ) , who had recently taken control of the Long Island coven of Gardnerians in New York after the former high priest and high priestess , Raymond Buckland and his wife Rosemary , had decided to divorce . In early 1973 , the shop hit financial difficulty , and the Kneitals personally lent several thousand dollars to Slater and Buczynski in order to help them out , which Buczynski promptly paid back . Their business quickly recovered , and they employed a young man from New Orleans named Robert Carey to work in the shop ; he was a close personal friend of Candy Darling , and used to visit The Factory , where he was known as " Chanel 13 " . The increasing relationship between Slater and Buczynski and the Kneitals led to socialising between their two covens ; despite their differing class backgrounds ( the Gardnerian Commack coven being largely middle class and the Welsh Traditionalist Brooklyn Heights coven being largely working class and counter @-@ cultural ) , they got on well . In February 1973 , Buczynski requested initiation into the <unk> Craft from the Kneitals , but they refused , being cautious of what uses he would put the Gardnerian liturgy to . 
 Still friends with Martello , Buczynski initiated him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist tradition , in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega tradition . At the same time , he was facing problems within his own tradition as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven , Claudia and Gerard Nero , had decided to abandon Buczynski 's tradition and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals ; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots . They took their initiates , including Margot Adler , with them , much to Buczynski and Slater 's annoyance , leading to a breakdown of the friendship that they had had with the Kneitals . His tradition nevertheless continued to grow and spread , and in January 1973 , the tradition joined the Council of Earth Religions ( <unk> ) , a pan @-@ Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement . His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973 . His high priestess , Kay Smith , decided to take lead of one of them , while Eddie remained in the other , being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith . By August , there were two outer court covens of the Welsh tradition in New York City , and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell , Virginia . 
 = = = Gardnerian Wicca : 1973 – 1974 = = = 
 After the Kneitals had rejected his request for initiation into Gardnerian Wicca , Buczynski met with another Gardnerian high priestess , Patricia Siero , who instead agreed to initiate both him and Slater . Siero herself had been initiated by Fran Fisher , high priestess of a coven located in Louisville , Kentucky , in June 1973 , who in turn had claimed initiation from Rosemary Buckland . The weekend after returning from Kentucky , Siero initiated Buczynski and Slater through all three degrees of the Gardnerian tradition , entitling them to operate as high priests of their own covens . Buczynski decided to do so , founding his own Gardnerian coven with an older German woman named Renate Springer as high priestess that operated in the Brooklyn Heights area . Nevertheless , the Kneitals refused to accept Buczynski 's Gardnerian credentials , asserting that Rosemary Buckland had never actually initiated Fran Fischer up to the third degree . As a result of the Kneitals ' claims , the Gardnerian community in the Northeastern United States widely refused to accept the Brooklyn Heights coven as legitimate , and Siero decided to take up the Kneitals ' offer for re @-@ initiation ; as a result , she disowned the initiations of Buczynski and Slater which she had carried out . Springer was uneasy at the situation , and decided to depose Buczynski from his position as high priest , replacing him with one of her initiates , Gilbert Littlebear . 
 Despite the internal " Witch Wars " that Buczynski had become involved in , he continued to propagate information on Wicca and Paganism in the media , giving talks for a group known as the Friends of the Craft , which had been co @-@ founded by Slater , and helping to organize the " <unk> " exhibit which was held at the Museum of American Folk Art . Activity also continued at The Warlock Shop , and in December he and Slater published the first issue of a Pagan newsletter called Earth Religion News , which would run for several years . They would subsequently publish a short book about Wicca that Buczynski had authored , entitled the Witchcraft Fact Book . Both he and Slater also befriended Raymond Buckland , the prominent English Wiccan who was credited with introducing the Gardnerian tradition to the United States ; at the time Buckland had ceased to operate in that tradition , and was in the process of developing Seax @-@ Wica , a tradition inspired by the medieval religion of Anglo @-@ Saxon paganism , which both Buczynski and Slater approved of despite opposition from the Kneitals . 
 His interest in Gardnerianism was however maintained , and in December 1973 he founded a second Gardnerian coven , and invited Jane <unk> , then working as the Warlock Shop 's book keeper , to take up the mantle as its high priestess . Meeting at Jane 's apartment in Brooklyn , which she shared with her husband Burt , Buczynski continued to maintain his own legitimacy within the tradition despite Siero 's denunciation of his original initiation . Making various alterations to the established liturgy in the Book of Shadows and increasing coven democracy , he recognized that these changes meant that the coven was more Neo @-@ Gardnerian than orthodox Gardnerian , and as such he decided to proclaim that the coven adhered to no specific tradition , instead referring to it simply as " The Wica . " Trouble hit the coven when Burt <unk> , a recovering heroin addict , proceeded to steal $ 3000 for the Warlock Shop , and disappeared . Embarrassed , Jane stood down as The Wica 's high priestess , with leadership of the group falling to another married couple , Ria and David Farnham , who moved the <unk> to their home in the Bronx ; involving a lengthy commute for most of the coven members , Buczynski and Slater ceased their active involvement with the group , which had dissolved by June 1974 . 
 = = = Church of the Eternal Source and the Huntington Coven : 1974 – 1975 = = = 
 In 1974 , Buczynski got in contact with Harold Moss , the founder of the Church of the Eternal Source ( CEW ) , a Kemetic Pagan group which he had created in 1970 . Fascinated by the religion of Ancient Egypt which the CES wanted to revive , Buczynski joined the order , being ordained as a priest on July 19 . Adopting the ritual name of " Un @-@ Nefer " , he devoted himself to the worship of the goddess Isis , organizing a temple based in New York and beginning the publication of a newsletter , which he titled <unk> . His relationship with Moss , and with the CES ' secretary Ron Myron , was however strained . Although Moss was himself a homosexual , he disagreed with Buczynski 's effeminate nature , while Myron had taken a dislike to Buczynski as soon as the latter had been ordained , in particular believing that he didn 't spend enough time responding to enquiries . 
 Problems had also arisen in Buczynski 's relationship with Slater . Living and working together at the same premises , they had begun to argue regularly , and had both been taking part in sexual activity with other men , particularly in the gay bathhouses which could then be found in New York . By the summer of 1974 they had broken up , and although they briefly remained roommates , Buczynski soon collected together his belongings and moved back in with his mother and step @-@ father in Ozone Park , where he converted the basement into a bedroom for himself . No longer working at The Warlock Shop , he found himself broke and isolated from the city 's occult community , ultimately ceasing active coven work by September 1974 . Eventually , he obtained a part @-@ time job at the <unk> bookstore at 1482 Broadway in Times Square , and it was while commuting home on the subway one night that he met Bennie Geraci ( 1950 – ) , a native of New Orleans who had moved to the city . Buczynski and Geraci soon entered into a relationship , with the former moving into the latter 's small rented flat in Rego Park , Queens , which was shared with four other men . In January 1975 , he lost his job due to the economic recession , but was able to secure a job as an office boy at J. Aron and Company , a commodities trading corporation based in Wall Street . 
 Buczynski 's continuing disagreements with senior members of the CES led him to resign from the priesthood on August 1 , 1975 . The New York Temple that he had led subsequently folded . Returning his interest to Wicca , he befriended a Gardnerian high priestess named Sheila Saperton , who had been initiated into the Craft years before by Raymond Buckland . Saperton had become increasingly interested in Buckland 's newly developed tradition of Seax @-@ Wica , and founded a Seax coven from her home in Huntington Station on Long Island . Although never initiated into Seax @-@ Wica , <unk> associated with the group , and attended many of their rites . Eventually however , the group tired of the practices of Seax @-@ Wica , and instead transformed into a Gardnerian coven , with Buczynski becoming high priest . Claiming that a mysterious witch known only as Jana , who had been involved in the New Forest coven back in Hampshire , England , had been communicating with him and providing him with a legitimate lineage , he began making further changes to the coven structure . Both Buczynski biographer Michael Lloyd and researcher Philip Heselton have expressed doubt that Jana was ever a real figure operating in England , instead suggesting that she was perhaps an invention of Buczynski 's to legitimize his practice of Gardnerian Wica . 
 Buczynski welcomed a number of friends and flatmates , including Geraci , into the Huntington coven , and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree ; Saperton disagreed , citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating a member of the same sex . Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic , and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica . Meanwhile , he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village . Despite same @-@ sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time , they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another , although were non @-@ monogamous , and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons , resulting in Buczynski 's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections . 
 = = = The Minoan Brotherhood : 1975 – 1979 = = = 
 Buczynski had become increasingly dissatisfied with Gardnerian Wicca and other forms of contemporary Paganism which he felt treated homosexual and bisexual individuals as inferior to their heterosexual counterparts . He was perturbed that while many covens and other groups did allow gay and bi men and women to join , they were required to work in a ritual framework that was explicitly heterosexual . He argued that this was inconsistent with the fact that a number of pre @-@ Christian societies in Europe and the Middle East had cults containing an exclusively homosexual priesthood . He was particularly interested in such cults that were found in the Minoan civilization of Bronze Age Crete , and began to voraciously read books on the subject . He would later place many of these texts on the required reading list for new initiates , including among them academic works of history and archaeology like Arthur Evans ' The Palace of Minos , Martin P. Nilsson 's A History of Greek Religion and George E. Mylonas ' Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries , books on mythology such as Robert Graves ' The White Goddess , fictional novels like Mary Renault 's The Bull from the Sea and Thomas Burnett Swann 's How Are the Mighty Fallen , and such works on occultism as Gerald Gardner 's Witchcraft Today . 
 Explicitly founded as a " Mystery / initiatory cult which erotically celebrates Life through male love " , Buczynski 's Minoan tradition took the rituals of Gardnerian Wicca as its basis , but adapted them , with a new liturgy being written by him and placed within a ritual text known as the Book of the Mysteries . He adopted the eight annual Gardnerian Sabbat festivals , but associated them with ancient Mediterranean religious festivals . Insisting that even though his coven would contain only men , it should still embrace gender polarity , he set up the Cretan Snake Goddess Rhea as the tradition 's primary deity . Accompanying her , the tradition was also founded to venerate her son , the Cretan Bull God , thereby being <unk> in nature , like most other Wiccan traditions . 
 The Minoan Brotherhood was officially inaugurated on January 1 , 1977 . Naming this first group the Knossos Grove coven , it initially began at his and Geraci 's shared flat , where they were joined by their friend Joseph <unk> . Setting up a lineage recording system to take into account which new initiates were being brought into the Brotherhood , the first man to be welcomed in was Kim Schuller , who was soon followed by Bruce @-@ Michael <unk> . Not long after , <unk> moved to New Orleans , where he founded a second coven , known as <unk> Grove . In 1977 , Buczynski began attending the Sheridan Square Gym , and it was here that he met Gene Muto the following year . A stage director and part @-@ time bartender , Muto entered into a sexual relationship with Buczynski , which Geraci accepted as per the rules of their open relationship . However , when Buczynski announced that he had fallen in love with Muto , it marked the end of his relationship with Geraci , who decided to move back to New Orleans in February 1979 . Muto proceeded to move in with Buczynski at his apartment on West 13th Street , but did not share his boyfriend 's magico @-@ religious beliefs , instead being a far left atheist . He felt that Buczynski was wasting his life on Witchcraft , and encouraged him to aim for an academic education ; Buczynski proceeded to attain a graduate equivalency diploma ( GED ) . The Knossos Grove had meanwhile begun to deteriorate , rarely meeting from late @-@ 1978 through early 1979 . He did however bring in Tony <unk> in late 1979 , who would go on to play a significant role in the Minoan tradition , which was then being eclipsed in size by the Radical Faerie movement . That year , Buczynski decided to stop using his flat as a <unk> , which he moved to the Earth Star Temple , the back room of The <unk> Childe , Herman Slater 's new shop . 
 = = = Entering academia : 1980 – 1988 = = = 
 In 1980 , Buczynski and Muto went on a package holiday to Greece , further inspiring the former 's interests in the region 's ancient cultures . Deciding to explore this topic further , he enrolled to study for an undergraduate degree in Classics and Ancient History at Hunter College , a part of the City University of New York ( CUNY ) located in Manhattan 's Upper East Side , beginning there in September 1980 . At the university , he became friends with one of his mentors , the classical archaeologist <unk> <unk> , and was saddened by her death before he had completed the course . He devoted himself to his studies , which he greatly enjoyed , and was sufficiently successful to be placed on the Thomas Hunter Honors Program . In June 1982 , he returned to Greece in order to take part in his first archaeological excavations , which were run by the American School of Classical Studies at Athens ( <unk> ) . Returning to New York City , he began to take all of the modules that he could which were devoted to field archaeology , considering a potential career in the profession . In the winter break between 1982 and 1983 , he once more returned to the Mediterranean , touring Greece and Italy with Muto . He would subsequently be laid off from his job , but gained work in the Hunter College Classics Office . His increased interest in academic archaeology came at the expense of his involvement in the occult , and in the Spring of 1981 he stepped down from his leadership of the Knossos Grove coven , handing control over to Tony <unk> . As his studies at Hunter College came to an end , he decided to continue his education to a postgraduate level , and successfully obtained a scholarship from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation . 
 The university which he decided upon was Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania , a socially liberal , gay @-@ friendly institution originally founded on Quaker principles . There , he enrolled in the Department of Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology , and began work on attaining his master 's degree . To study there , he had to move away from Muto and New York City , settling in <unk> Manor apartments , Montgomery Avenue , with his cats Maybelle and <unk> , renting a flat that was larger than that in which he and Muto lived in New York . At Bryn Mawr , he worked hard , and remained a popular student among both staff and pupils ; his dissertation was devoted to the role of marine objects within Minoan cult . Where possible , Muto and he met up , going on holiday together to Egypt and Israel in the winter of 1985 . In August 1986 , Muto then obtained a job in Atlanta , Georgia , and so the couple decided to cease renting the New York apartment . Deciding to found a coven of Minoan practitioners at Bryn Mawr , he put out adverts for interested persons , but received only one response , from a young man named Kevin <unk> , whom he initiated in the spring of 1986 . However , he decided to put a stop to <unk> 's training prematurely when he began to become increasingly concerned by the HIV / AIDS epidemic that was then sweeping through the Minoan tradition and the country 's wider gay community . In the winter of 1986 , he and Muto traveled to Colombia where they visited the Cartagena , but the following March Buczynski took ill , and although some of his friends suspected that he might be exhibiting symptoms of AIDS , he refused to get tested . That summer , he and Muto went for a vacation in Cape Cod , before he submitted his dissertation in September 1987 . 
 In November , Buczynski was taken seriously ill with pneumonia , requiring hospitalization . It was there that the doctors diagnosed him with the AIDS virus , having acquired HIV at some point during the 1970s . After returning to his flat , his mother and step @-@ father came to visit and help care for him . He spent Christmas that year on Crete with Muto , before his studies at Bryn Mawr came to an end in 1988 ; he was awarded his degree at a ceremony on 15 May , after which Muto whisked him off for a holiday in Cancún , Mexico . 
 = = = Final months : 1989 = = = 
 Although he had wanted to study for a doctorate and proceed with a career in archaeology , Buczynski was dying . He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite , which was able to invade his body due to its extremely weakened status . He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions , leaving him irritable and withdrawn , and required hospitalization . Upon release , it was decided that he would move to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989 . By this stage , he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own , including eating and dressing himself , and required almost constant care , from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital . He began to talk with the Roman Catholic priest based at the hospital , eventually deciding to return to the faith of his birth , and undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February . In March , his condition deteriorated , and he was admitted to the hospital , falling into a coma and dying on the morning on Thursday , March 16 .

 Buczynski could be hot tempered , with Lloyd describing him as " street @-@ smart , intelligent , opinionated , flamboyant , charismatic , driven , and ... often governed by mercurial emotions . He could be fiery , and he had a vicious temper when someone angered him , which admittedly was not easy to accomplish . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Following Buczynski 's death , Lady Rhea asserted that anyone initiated through one of his traditions could refer to themselves as an " Edwardian " Wiccan in his honor . Buczynski would come to be declared one of the Saints of Antinous by a Pagan group based in Hollywood , California , known as the Temple of Antinous . 
 In 2012 , Michael Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski through Asphodel Press . Entitled Bull of Heaven : The Mythic Life of Eddie Buczynski and the Rise of the New York Pagan , it contained a foreword by Margot Adler . The book 's launch party was held at Sala One @-@ Nine , a tapas restaurant at 35 West 19th Street in Manhattan , which existed on the site of Slater 's <unk> Childe store . The event was reported on by a journalist from The New York Times , Corey <unk> , who noted that there was a " strapping man " dressed in a headdress and loincloth working at the door , with around 80 attendees inside , most of whom were Pagans . Among them included Bennie Geraci , Carol <unk> , Kaye Flagg and Margot Adler , a number of whom gave speeches before a memorial service to Buczynski was held , in a ritual that <unk> thought resembled something from Stanley Kubrick 's film Eyes Wide Shut . 
 Bull of Heaven was positively reviewed by Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White in The Pomegranate academic journal , who asserted that the book was " eloquently and engagingly written " , and was important for documenting the life not only of Buczynski , but also of other important figures in the New York Pagan scene , like Herman Slater and Leo Martello . He praised Lloyd 's research as " thorough and far @-@ reaching " , although was critical of the poor quality of the images . Noting that the book 's scope would invite comparison with Chas S. Clifton 's Her Hidden Children and Adler 's Drawing Down the Moon , he labelled it a " must read " for those interested in the history of American Paganism and gay liberation , summing it up as " the finest independent Pagan studies scholarship to have been produced in the United States to date . " Elsewhere , he characterised the book as " first @-@ rate " . 
 = 1 November 1944 reconnaissance sortie over Japan = 
 On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) F @-@ 13 Superfortress conducted the first flight by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 . This photo reconnaissance sortie was highly successful , with the aircraft 's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids on Japan during the final months of World War II . Attempts by Japanese air units and anti @-@ aircraft gun batteries to destroy the F @-@ 13 failed , as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude it operated at . 
 = = Background = = 
 In late 1944 the United States Twentieth Air Force 's XXI Bomber Command prepared to conduct strategic bombing raids on the Japanese home islands from bases in the Mariana Islands . These attacks were to replace the largely unsuccessful Operation Matterhorn raids which had been conducted by XX Bomber Command aircraft based in India and staging through bases in China since June 1944 . While XX Bomber Command conducted photo reconnaissance sorties over Japan as part of this effort , the aircraft flying from China lacked the range to reach Japan 's main industrial centers . Without photographic intelligence XXI Bomber Command was unable to develop detailed plans for raids against its intended targets . 
 On 10 October 1944 the Committee of Operations Analysts , which provided advice to USAAF commanders on suitable strategic bombardment targets , recommended that photo reconnaissance flights be conducted over Japan 's main industrial areas as soon as possible to provide intelligence which could be used to direct raids from the Mariana Islands . These operations were to be conducted by the 3d Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron ( 3d PRS ) , which was the only photo reconnaissance unit in the XXI Bomber Command . 
 The 3d PRS had been formed on 10 June 1941 . After conducting flights over the Americas , it was deployed to the China @-@ Burma @-@ India Theater . The unit flew mapping missions over the region from 10 December 1943 until it was disbanded and re @-@ formed in the United States during April 1944 to be equipped with the new F @-@ 13 photo reconnaissance variant of the Boeing B @-@ 29 Superfortress heavy bomber . Due to delays to the development of the F @-@ 13 , the 3d PRS was unable to commence training on the type until 24 August , and began to receive its first operational F @-@ 13s on 4 October . 3d PRS F @-@ 13s began to depart for Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 19 October , where they would be supported by the unit 's ground echelon which had arrived on 18 September . 
 = = Photo reconnaissance sortie = = 
 The first two 3d PRS F @-@ 13s arrived at Saipan on 30 October after a 33 @-@ hour flight from Mather Field in California via Oahu and Kwajalein . While the commander of the XXI Bomber Command , Brigadier General Haywood S. Hansell , encouraged the exhausted airmen to rest , they insisted on conducting a flight over Japan as soon as possible . 
 At 5 @.@ 55 am on 1 November an F @-@ 13 whose crew was led by Captain Ralph D. Steakley took off from Saipan bound for Japan . Weather conditions over Tokyo were perfect for photo reconnaissance , with the skies free of clouds . Flying at 32 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 800 m ) , Steakley 's aircraft repeatedly passed over a complex of aircraft and engine plants to the west of Tokyo , before moving on to photograph a similar facility near the city of Nagoya . Overall , the American airmen took 7 @,@ 000 photos during the mission . Steakley was surprised to encounter strong head winds , and reported that his ground speed while passing over Tokyo was only about 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) . The strong winds over this region were not known to the USAAF at the time , and greatly complicated XXI Bomber Command 's later air raids . 
 The Imperial Japanese Army Air Service 's 47th Sentai had responsibility for providing fighter aircraft to guard the Tokyo area on 1 November . The unit 's Nakajima Ki @-@ 44 fighters began to take off from <unk> airfield to intercept the F @-@ 13 at 1 pm . These aircraft were not designed to be used at high altitudes , and the Japanese airmen were unable to get closer than about 3 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 000 m ) of Steakley 's aircraft . Two formations of fighters fired machine guns at the F @-@ 13 , but did not hit it . Several batteries of Japanese anti @-@ aircraft guns also unsuccessfully fired on the American aircraft . The F @-@ 13 was the first American aircraft to fly over Tokyo since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 , and was sighted by many Japanese civilians . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The F @-@ 13 returned to Saipan after a flight of 14 hours duration . Either later that day or the next day the crew named the aircraft " Tokyo Rose " in reference to the propaganda broadcaster . Steakley received the Distinguished Flying Cross for the flight , and the other members of the crew were also later issued with awards . 
 The photographs taken during the sortie were an important source of intelligence for the Twentieth Air Force and other American units , especially as 1 November proved to be the only day of the air campaign against Japan in which weather conditions over the home islands were entirely clear of cloud . Hansell later stated that the sortie had been " probably the greatest ... single contribution ... in the air war with Japan " . 
 The 3d PRS conducted a further 16 sorties over Japan before XXI Bomber Command 's first raid against Tokyo on 24 November , but several of these missions were frustrated by bad weather . One F @-@ 13 was lost during a mission to Nagoya on 21 November , but the squadron had nine aircraft at Saipan by the end of the month . The 3d PRS continued to fly reconnaissance sorties over Japan until the end of the war . 
 = Habsburg @-@ class battleship = 
 The Habsburg class was a group of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built by Austria @-@ Hungary at the turn of the 20th century . They were the first sea @-@ going battleship built by Austria @-@ Hungary since the center @-@ battery ship Tegetthoff in 1876 . The class was composed of three ships : Habsburg , Árpád , and Babenberg . They were armed with three 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two turrets and were capable of slightly better than 19 @.@ 5 knots ( 36 @.@ 1 km / h ; 22 @.@ 4 mph ) at full speed . Habsburg and Árpád were modernized in 1910 – 11 . 
 Habsburg was launched on 9 September 1900 , Árpád just over a year later on 11 September 1901 , and Babenberg on 4 October 1902 . The ships saw limited service during World War I in the IV Division of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet . Babenberg and Árpád bombarded the Italian port of Ancona in 1915 , but the three battleships were largely inactive for the remainder of their service . They were decommissioned in 1916 to free up the majority of their crews for service in the submarine and air forces . All three ships were ultimately ceded to Great Britain following the end of the war ; they were sold to Italian ship @-@ breakers and scrapped in 1921 .

 = = = General characteristics and machinery = = = 
 The ships of the Habsburg class were 113 @.@ 11 m ( 371 ft ) long at the waterline and 114 @.@ 55 m ( 375 ft 10 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 19 @.@ 8 m ( 65 ft ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 5 m ( 24 ft 6 in ) . Freeboard was approximately 5 @.@ 80 m ( 19 @.@ 0 ft ) forward and about 5 @.@ 50 m ( 18 @.@ 0 ft ) aft . They displaced 8 @,@ 364 metric tons ( 8 @,@ 232 long tons ) . The ships had a crew of 638 officers and enlisted men . The ships had a flush main deck that was planked with wood , while the upper decks were covered with linoleum or corticine . 
 The hulls for each ship were constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames , over which the outer hull plates were riveted . The hull incorporated a double bottom that ran for 63 % of its length . A series of watertight bulkheads extended from the keel to the gun deck ; there were a total of 174 watertight compartments in each ship . The ships had a metacentric height of between .82 m ( 2 @.@ 7 ft ) and 1 @.@ 02 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . Bilge keels were mounted on either side of the hull to reduce rolling . 
 Their machinery system consisted of 2 @-@ shaft 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines . They were supplied with steam by 16 Belleville boilers . Habsburg 's powerplant was rated at 15 @,@ 063 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 232 kW ) , which produced a top speed of 19 @.@ 62 knots ( 36 @.@ 34 km / h ; 22 @.@ 58 mph ) . Árpád 's system was slightly less efficient , at 14 @,@ 307 ihp ( 10 @,@ 669 kW ) , though it achieved a comparable speed of 19 @.@ 65 knots ( 36 @.@ 39 km / h ; 22 @.@ 61 mph ) on trials . Babenberg had the most powerful engines of the three , which ran at 16 @,@ 000 ihp ( 12 @,@ 000 kW ) and provided a top speed of 19 @.@ 85 knots ( 36 @.@ 76 km / h ; 22 @.@ 84 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The ships ' primary armament was three 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) L / 40 guns , with two mounted in a twin turret forward and one mounted in a single turret aft of the main superstructure . The guns were manufactured by Krupp in Germany , and were the C 97 type . 
 Secondary armament included twelve 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) SK L / 40 guns in casemates . They were mounted in an unusual arrangement : there were two decks of three guns each on either side amidships . These guns could fire armor @-@ piercing shells at a rate of 4 – 5 per minute . The guns could depress to − 7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees , for a maximum range of 13 @,@ 700 metres ( 15 @,@ 000 yd ) . They were manually elevated and trained . 
 The ships carried a wide array of smaller weapons , for defense against torpedo boats . These included ten 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) L / 45 guns , six 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 44 quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , and two 4 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 33 QF guns . All of these guns were emplaced in single mounts , either on the upper decks and superstructure , or in casemates at the bow and stern . With the exception of the main battery 24 cm weapons , all of the guns carried on the ships were manufactured by Škoda Works in Pilsen . The ships also carried two Whitehead 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) submerged torpedo tubes .

The belt tapered slightly to 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) on either end of the central section . Past the barbettes , the hull was protected by about 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of armor plate , up to the bow and stern . The entire belt , including the thinner portions forward and aft of the main battery barbettes , extended for 1 @.@ 30 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) below the waterline and 1 @.@ 06 m ( 3 @.@ 5 ft ) above . The belt was widened at the bow to cover the ram . Side protection was supplemented by 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick armor above the main belt ; this section of armor extended up to meet the gun deck . The armored deck was 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) thick . 
 The main battery turrets were protected by armor plate that was 210 mm ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) thick on the sides and faces of the gun mounts . The armored barbettes that held the turrets , working chambers , and shell rooms were protected with 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) of armor . The casemates for the 15 cm guns were 137 mm ( 5 @.@ 4 in ) on the outboard side and 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) on the less vulnerable inboard side . The forward conning tower was armored with sides that were 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick and contained a 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick communications tube ; the aft conning tower was less well @-@ protected . Its sides were 100 mm thick , and its communication tube was only 50 mm thick .

 Habsburg and Árpád took part in their first fleet maneuvers in mid 1903 . By the following summer , Babenberg was ready for active service , and she too participated in fleet drills . During the 1904 training exercises , the three Habsburgs engaged the three Monarch @-@ class battleships in simulated combat ; the maneuver marked the first time two homogeneous squadrons consisting of modern battleships operated in the Austro @-@ Hungarian navy . The three Habsburg @-@ class ships formed the I Division while the Monarchs formed the II Division . The ships were also active in the Mediterranean . Habsburg conducted a training cruise with the three Monarch @-@ class battleships in January 1903 . She was joined by Árpád the following year .

 At the outbreak of World War I in late July 1914 , Habsburg was serving as the flagship of the III Battleship Division of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet , under the command of Captain Miklós Horthy , alongside her two sisters . They were later transferred to the IV Division after the new Tegetthoff @-@ class battleships came into service . At around the same time , she was mobilized along with her sister ships Árpád and Babenberg and the remainder of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy to support the flight of SMS Goeben and Breslau . The two German ships were stationed in the Mediterranean and were attempting to break out of the strait of Messina , which was surrounded by British troops and vessels and make their way to Turkey . After the Germans successfully broke out of Messina , the navy was recalled . The fleet had by that time advanced as far south as Brindisi in south eastern Italy . After Italy entered the war on the side of France and England , the Austro @-@ Hungarian navy bombarded several Italian installations ; Babenberg took part in the attack on Ancona in 1915 . They were later decommissioned and served as harbor defense ships for the latter portion of the conflict . Their crews were then transferred to man new U @-@ boats and aircraft . By 1918 , Árpád was converted into a training ship . Following the end of the war , the ships were awarded to Great Britain as war prizes , but were instead sold and broken up for scrapping in Italy in 1921 .

 DakshinaChitra , meaning " a picture of the south " , is a heritage village where the lifestyle of South Indians is displayed based on their states . It was founded by the Madras Craft Foundation ( MCF ) , an NGO started in 1984 , by Deborah Thiagarajan . Thiagarajan came to Madras ( now Chennai ) in 1970 , and visited several rural villages in Tamil Nadu and Kerala . She founded MCF in 1984 with the intent of preserving the regional culture and heritage . In July 1991 , the MCF received 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) of land for the project from the Government of Tamil Nadu on a 33 @-@ year lease .

 = = Design = = 
 The museum ’ s plan concept was developed by architect , Laurie Baker , without charging any fee , because of his interest in rural architectural design . Baker 's approach included the use of local materials and the adaptation of artisanal production methods suited to the environment . Benny <unk> was the architect at site . <unk> , retained the main “ spatial types and syntax ” , but altered the layout plan . The southern part of the museum was devoted to restoring and recreating native structures and putting them together in a sequence in the order of the states of Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , and Tamil Nadu ; a separate area was initially earmarked for the tribal people of these states but this was not put into effect .

 The museum has 18 heritage houses representing the living styles of people from the states of South India such as Tamil Nadu , Andhra Pradesh , North Karnataka , Kerala and Telangana . These houses , which were actual houses that were allowed to be demolished by the original owners , were recreated by a team of architecture students , carpenters and workers . The original houses in their " vernacular style " were purchased by MCF and purchase costs varied from Rs . 50 @,@ 000 for ordinary mud houses to Rs . 1 @.@ 5 million for the Chettinad merchants ' mansions with crafted doors and woodwork . ) They were then dismantled systematically under the guidance of <unk> ( temple architects ) . The dismantled elements were transported to the museum site and recreated at the allotted space in their exact original form . Apart from recreating the homes , the roads and all other features that existed in the old village sites were recreated ..

 = Liberation of Arnhem = 
 Operation Anger ( sometimes known as Operation Quick Anger ) , was a military operation to seize the city of Arnhem in April 1945 , during the closing stages of the Second World War . It is occasionally referred to as the Second Battle of Arnhem or the Liberation of Arnhem . The operation was part of the Canadian First Army 's liberation of the Netherlands and was led by the 49th British Infantry Division , supported by armour of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division , Royal Air Force air strikes and boats of the Royal Navy . 
 The Western Allies first tried to liberate Arnhem in September 1944 during Operation Market Garden . Poor planning , the unexpected presence of German armoured units and a delayed advance by ground forces meant that the 1st British Airborne Division were defeated and a new front stabilised south of the city . Fresh planning to take Arnhem began in the new year as the Canadian First Army sought ways to link up its units advancing into the Netherlands . However it was not until April that the liberation of the city became a distinct possibility . After II Canadian Corps secured the eastern bank of the IJssel river and advanced north , I Canadian Corps prepared to assault Arnhem . 
 The operation began on 12 April 1945 and proceeded to plan , as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged each other through the city . Within four days Arnhem was totally under Allied control , allowing the Canadians to advance further into the Netherlands . Less than two weeks after the battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country to an end and on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army . Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered , bringing the war in Europe to a close .

 In September 1944 the Allies launched Operation Market Garden , an effort to advance around the Siegfried Line and open a route to the Ruhr . The British 1st Airborne Division landed at Arnhem and fought for nine days in the city and surrounding towns and countryside , but the British 2nd Army 's advance failed to reach them and they were nearly annihilated . After withdrawing south of the Nederrijn the front line stabilised on the “ Island ” ( the polder between Nijmegen and Arnhem ) over the winter . 
 The residents of Arnhem and Oosterbeek ( over 450 of whom had been killed in the battle ) were evicted from their homes which were then systematically looted of anything of value to aid refugees in Germany . The shattered settlements were then turned into strong defensive positions to resist future Allied advances . The Arnhem road bridge that the British had fought so hard for was bombed by the Allies in October 1944 to deny its use to the Germans . Arnhem itself was extensively shelled by the Allies over the winter and was even hit by short @-@ falling German @-@ fired V @-@ 2 rockets . In retaliation for a Dutch railway workers strike supposed to aid the Allies ' September advance , the Germans banned all inland freight movement . This prevented food being grown in the north from reaching the south and west of the country and caused thousands of deaths amongst the Dutch population in the <unk> .

 In February 1945 the Allies launched Operations Veritable and Grenade , striking east from land captured during Market Garden directly into Germany . These paved the way for Operations Plunder and Varsity , crossing the River Rhine further upstream from Arnhem . 21st Army Group then advanced rapidly into north @-@ west Germany . Whilst the British 2nd Army advanced west , General Henry Crerar ’ s Canadian First Army was given the task of liberating the Netherlands . 
 The Canadian Army had been instructed to plan advances across the Lower Rhine when it first assumed responsibility for the Nijmegen salient in November , but any plans were delayed by the winter and the subsequent allocation of resources for Operation Veritable . However , after Operation Veritable Crerar saw advantages to seizing Arnhem and opening a route to Emmerich during the coming crossing of the Rhine . The first draft of the plan to take the city – known as Operation Anger – was compiled in February as a subsidiary operation to Plunder , but Lieutenant General Charles Foulkes , commander of the recently arrived I Canadian Corps , thought it safer to wait until the Rhine had been crossed before launching an action on Arnhem , and Anger was shelved . 
 After Plunder the II Canadian Corps , commanded by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds , struck west and seized Emmerich , approaching the IJssel from the east . Crerar saw an opportunity to take Arnhem and open a route between the city and Zutphen to the north , and ordered his two Corps commanders to coordinate their advances accordingly . However , he was wary of trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged further north . 
 In March the 49th ( West Riding ) Division ( nicknamed The Polar Bears ) , who had been on the Nijmegen Island since November , came under the command of I Canadian Corps . On 2 April the division , supported by Canadian units , led Operation Destroyer to clear the Island , carefully timing the initial attack to coincide with II Corps ' clearance of the east bank of the IJssel . On 3 April elements of I Corps crossed the Nederrijn east of the IJssel and met units from II Corps in the town of Westervoort opposite Arnhem . The rest of the Island was cleared within another day and the Allies occupied the southern bank of the Nederrijn in preparation for the assault on Arnhem . 
 The original ( February ) plan for Operation Anger had called for an immediate crossing of the Nederrijn near Oosterbeek as soon as the river was reached , if the situation allowed it ( Operation Quick Anger ) . Alternatively , if the German defenses were considered too strong , a better prepared crossing downstream at Renkum could be made ( Operation Anger ) . However , Crerar had ruled that operations could not be made against Arnhem until II Corps had crossed the IJssel and advanced on Apeldoorn , and so Anger could not yet proceed . Additionally reconnaissance patrols on 3 and 4 April determined that German observation posts and positions on the <unk> Heights overlooking the river would make crossing the Nederrijn dangerous . Attempts were made to create smokescreens obscuring the southern bank of the Nederrijn from the watching Germans , a technique that had proved successful in the buildup to Operation Plunder . The screen stretched from the town of <unk> , 16 kilometres ( 10 miles ) west of Arnhem , along the south bank of the river to <unk> , south of Arnhem , but strong winds and a lack of appropriate generators reduced its effectiveness . Additionally the ground on the Island was deteriorating and on 7 April , after considering various alternatives , Foulkes decided Arnhem must be attacked from the east , across the IJssel .

 = = = Allied forces = = = 
 The attack was necessarily delayed whilst the 49th Division moved to Westervoort and II Canadian Corps prepared to cross the IJssel further north . The move caused serious logistical problems as the roads around the Island and Westervoort became jammed with traffic . This delay caused concern that the enemy would have time to prepare for the assault , but in the event it appeared they had neither the troops or equipment to improve their situation . 
 The attack was planned to proceed in three phases . The initial assault would be carried out by the 56th British Infantry Brigade who would cross the IJssel at night in Buffalo IVs of The Ontario Regiment before clearing the eastern and southern districts of the city . In phase two , the 146th British Infantry Brigade would move forward and attack the high ground north of Arnhem . In the third phase , the 147th British Infantry Brigade would advance through 56th 's positions and secure the high ground and north bank of the Nederrijn west of the city . With the heights around Arnhem secure the 5th Canadian Armoured Division would advance through the city and I Corps would resume its advance west . The British took several Canadian units under command along with Churchill Crocodile tanks of the 79th British Armoured Division . Most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and 5th Canadian Armoured Division were placed in support , and a composite group known as <unk> provided a diversion south of the Nederrijn . 
 The river crossing would be assisted by 552 Landing Craft Flotilla of the Royal Navy who provided several landing craft previously used in Plunder , and the Royal Army Service Corps ( RASC ) would run DUKWs across the river during the operation . I Corps ' Royal Canadian Engineers ( RCE ) , would build four Bailey pontoon ferries as soon as locations on the enemy bank were captured ( two across the IJssel and two across the Nederrijn ) . The RCE would also deploy a prefabricated Bailey bridge as soon as the situation allowed it . The bridge was built in advance further upstream at <unk> and floated nearer to the IJssel just prior to the attack . As soon as the situation allowed it this bridge would be floated into position between Westervoort and Arnhem , hopefully allowing armour to cross the river much faster than the enemy would expect . Canadian pioneers would lay a heavy artillery smokescreen over Arnhem during the attack and in the buildup to the battle they maintained the smoke screen along the Nederrijn , in the hope it would deceive the Germans as to the true direction of the crossing .
