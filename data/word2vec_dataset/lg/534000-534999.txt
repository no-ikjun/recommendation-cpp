 The two @-@ man EO @-@ 21 crew was launched on 21 February 1996 aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 23 and were soon joined by U.S. crew member Shannon Lucid , who was brought to the station by Atlantis during STS @-@ 76 . This mission saw the first joint U.S. spacewalk on Mir take place deploying the Mir Environmental Effects Payload package on the docking module . Lucid became the first American to carry out a long @-@ duration mission aboard Mir with her 188 @-@ day mission , which set the U.S. single spaceflight record . During Lucid 's time aboard Mir , Priroda , the station 's final module , arrived as did French visitor Claudie Haigneré flying the <unk> mission . The flight aboard Soyuz TM @-@ 24 also delivered the EO @-@ 22 crew of Valery <unk> and Aleksandr Kaleri . 
 Lucid 's stay aboard Mir ended with the flight of Atlantis on STS @-@ 79 , which launched on 16 September . This , the fourth docking , saw John Blaha transferring onto Mir to take his place as resident U.S. astronaut . His stay on the station improved operations in several areas , including transfer procedures for a docked space shuttle , " hand @-@ over " procedures for long @-@ duration American crew members and " ham " amateur radio communications , and also saw two spacewalks to reconfigure the station 's power grid . Blaha spent four months with the EO @-@ 22 crew before returning to Earth aboard Atlantis on STS @-@ 81 in January 1997 , at which point he was replaced by physician Jerry Linenger . During his flight , Linenger became the first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station and the first to test the Russian @-@ built Orlan @-@ M spacesuit alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev , flying EO @-@ 23 . All three crew members of EO @-@ 23 performed a " fly @-@ around " in Soyuz TM @-@ 25 spacecraft . Linenger and his Russian crewmates Vasili Tsibliyev and Aleksandr <unk> faced several difficulties during the mission , including the most severe fire aboard an orbiting spacecraft ( caused by a malfunctioning Vika ) , failures of various systems , a near collision with Progress M @-@ 33 during a long @-@ distance TORU test and a total loss of station electrical power . The power failure also caused a loss of attitude control , which led to an uncontrolled " tumble " through space . 
 Linenger was succeeded by Anglo @-@ American astronaut Michael Foale , carried up by Atlantis on STS @-@ 84 , alongside Russian mission specialist Elena <unk> . Foale 's increment proceeded fairly normally until 25 June when during the second test of the Progress manual docking system , TORU , Progress M @-@ 34 collided with solar arrays on the Spektr module and crashed into the module 's outer shell , puncturing the module and causing depressurisation on the station . Only quick actions on the part of the crew , cutting cables leading to the module and closing Spektr 's hatch , prevented the crews having to abandon the station in Soyuz TM @-@ 25 . Their efforts stabilised the station 's air pressure , whilst the pressure in Spektr , containing many of Foale 's experiments and personal effects , dropped to a vacuum . In an effort to restore some of the power and systems lost following the isolation of Spektr and to attempt to locate the leak , EO @-@ 24 commander Anatoly Solovyev and flight engineer Pavel Vinogradov carried out a risky salvage operation later in the flight , entering the empty module during a so @-@ called " intra @-@ vehicular activity " or " IVA " spacewalk and inspecting the condition of hardware and running cables through a special hatch from Spektr 's systems to the rest of the station . Following these first investigations , Foale and Solovyev conducted a 6 @-@ hour EVA outside Spektr to inspect the damage . 
 After these incidents , the U.S. Congress and NASA considered whether to abandon the programme out of concern for the astronauts ' safety , but NASA administrator Daniel Goldin decided to continue . The next flight to Mir , STS @-@ 86 , carried David Wolf aboard Atlantis . During the orbiter 's stay , Titov and Parazynski conducted a spacewalk to affix a cap to the docking module for a future attempt by crew members to seal the leak in Spektr 's hull . Wolf spent 119 days aboard Mir with the EO @-@ 24 crew and was replaced during STS @-@ 89 with Andy Thomas , who carried out the last U.S. expedition on Mir . The EO @-@ 25 crew arrived in Soyuz TM @-@ 27 in January 1998 before Thomas returned to Earth on the final Shuttle – Mir mission , STS @-@ 91 . 
 = = = = Final days and deorbit = = = = 
 Following the 8 June 1998 departure of Discovery , the EO @-@ 25 crew of Budarin and <unk> remained on Mir , completing materials experiments and compiling a station inventory . On 2 July , Roskosmos director Yuri Koptev announced that , due to a lack of funding to keep Mir active , the station would be deorbited in June 1999 . The EO @-@ 26 crew of Gennady Padalka and Sergei Avdeyev arrived on 15 August in Soyuz TM @-@ 28 , alongside physicist Yuri <unk> , who departed with the EO @-@ 25 crew on 25 August in Soyuz TM @-@ 27 . The crew carried out two spacewalks , one inside Spektr to <unk> some power cables and another outside to set up experiments delivered by Progress M @-@ 40 , which also carried a large amount of propellant to begin alterations to Mir 's orbit ready for the station 's decommissioning . 20 November 1998 saw the launch of Zarya , the first module of the International Space Station , but delays to the new station 's service module Zvezda had led to calls for Mir to be kept in orbit past 1999 . Roskosmos , however , confirmed that it would not fund Mir past the set deorbit date . 
 The crew of EO @-@ 27 , Viktor Afanasyev and Jean @-@ Pierre Haigneré , arrived in Soyuz TM @-@ 29 on 22 February 1999 alongside Ivan Bella , who returned to Earth with Padalka in Soyuz TM @-@ 28 . The crew carried out three EVAs to retrieve experiments and deploy a prototype communications antenna on Sofora . On 1 June it was announced that the deorbit of the station would be delayed by six months to allow time to seek alternative funding to keep the station operating . The rest of the expedition was spent preparing the station for its deorbit ; a special analog computer was installed and each of the modules , starting with the docking module , was mothballed in turn and sealed off . The crew loaded their results into Soyuz TM @-@ 29 and departed Mir on 28 August 1999 , ending a run of continuous occupation , which had lasted for eight days short of ten years . The station 's <unk> and main computer were shut down on 7 September , leaving Progress M @-@ 42 to control Mir and refine the station 's orbital decay rate . 
 Near the end of its life , there were plans for private interests to purchase Mir , possibly for use as the first orbital television / movie studio . The privately funded Soyuz TM @-@ 30 mission by MirCorp , launched on 4 April 2000 , carried two crew members , Sergei Zalyotin and Aleksandr Kaleri , to the station for two months to do repair work with the hope of proving that the station could be made safe . This was , however , to be the last manned mission to Mir — while Russia was optimistic about Mir 's future , its commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support the aging station . 
 Mir 's deorbit was carried out in three stages . The first stage involved waiting for atmospheric drag to reduce the station 's orbit to an average of 220 kilometres ( 140 mi ) . This began with the docking of Progress M1 @-@ 5 , a modified version of the Progress @-@ M carrying 2 @.@ 5 times more fuel in place of supplies . The second stage was the transfer of the station into a 165 × 220 km ( 103 × 137 mi ) orbit . This was achieved with two burns of Progress M1 @-@ 5 's control engines at 00 : 32 UTC and 02 : 01 UTC on 23 March 2001 . After a two @-@ orbit pause , the third and final stage of the deorbit began with the burn of Progress M1 @-@ 5 's control engines and main engine at 05 : 08 UTC , lasting 22 + minutes . Atmospheric reentry ( arbitrarily defined beginning at 100 km / 60 mi AMSL ) occurred at 05 : 44 UTC near Nadi , Fiji . Major destruction of the station began around 05 : 52 UTC and most of the unburned fragments fell into the South Pacific Ocean around 06 : 00 UTC . 
 = = = Visiting spacecraft = = = 
 Mir was primarily supported by the Russian Soyuz and Progress spacecraft and had two ports available for docking them . Initially , the fore and aft ports of the core module could be used for dockings , but following the permanent berthing of Kvant @-@ 1 to the aft port in 1987 , the rear port of the new module took on this role from the core module 's aft port . Each port was equipped with the plumbing required for Progress cargo ferries to replace the station 's fluids and also the guidance systems needed to guide the spacecraft for docking . Two such systems were used on Mir ; the rear ports of both the core module and Kvant @-@ 1 were equipped with both the Igla and Kurs systems , whilst the core module 's forward port featured only the newer Kurs . 
 Soyuz spacecraft provided manned access to and from the station allowing for crew rotations and cargo return , and also functioned as a lifeboat for the station , allowing for a relatively quick return to Earth in the event of an emergency . Two models of Soyuz flew to Mir ; Soyuz T @-@ 15 was the only Igla @-@ equipped Soyuz @-@ T to visit the station , whilst all other flights used the newer , Kurs @-@ equipped Soyuz @-@ TM . A total of 31 ( 30 manned , 1 unmanned ) Soyuz spacecraft flew to the station over a fourteen @-@ year period . 
 The unmanned Progress cargo vehicles were only used to resupply the station , carrying a variety of cargoes including water , fuel , food and experimental equipment . The spacecraft were not equipped with reentry shielding and so , unlike their Soyuz counterparts , were incapable of surviving reentry . As a result , when its cargo had been unloaded , each Progress was refilled with rubbish , spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed , along with the Progress itself , on reentry . However , in order to facilitate cargo return , ten Progress flights carried Raduga capsules , which could return around 150 kg of experimental results to Earth automatically . Mir was visited by three separate models of Progress ; the original 7K @-@ TG variant equipped with Igla ( 18 flights ) , the Progress @-@ M model equipped with Kurs ( 43 flights ) , and the modified Progress @-@ M1 version ( 3 flights ) , which together flew a total of 64 resupply missions . Whilst the Progress spacecraft usually docked automatically without incident , the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system , TORU , in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches . With TORU cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to dock ( with the exception of the catastrophic docking of Progress M @-@ 34 , when the long @-@ range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft 's striking the station , damaging Spektr and causing decompression ) . 
 In addition to the routine Soyuz and Progress flights , it was anticipated that Mir would also be the destination for flights by the Soviet Buran space shuttle , which was intended to deliver extra modules ( based on the same " <unk> " bus as Kvant @-@ 1 ) and provide a much improved cargo return service to the station . Kristall carried two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System ( APAS @-@ 89 ) docking ports designed to be compatible with the shuttle . One port was to be used for Buran ; the other for the planned Pulsar X @-@ 2 telescope , also to be delivered by Buran . The cancellation of the Buran programme , however , meant these capabilities were not realised until the 1990s when the ports were used instead by U.S. Space Shuttles as part of the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme ( after testing by the specially modified Soyuz TM @-@ 16 in 1993 ) . Initially , visiting Space Shuttle orbiters docked directly to Kristall , but this required the relocation of the module to ensure sufficient distance between the shuttle and Mir 's solar arrays . To eliminate the need to move the module and retract solar arrays for clearance issues , a Mir Docking Module was later added to the end of Kristall . The shuttles provided crew rotation of the American astronauts on station and carried cargo to and from the station , performing some of the largest transfers of cargo of the time . With a space shuttle docked to Mir , the temporary enlargements of living and working areas amounted to a complex that was the largest spacecraft in history at that time , with a combined mass of 250 tonnes ( 280 short tons ) . 
 = = = Mission control centre = = = 
 Mir and its resupply missions were controlled from the Russian Mission control center ( Russian : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) in <unk> , near the RKK Energia plant . Referred to by its acronym <unk> ( " TsUP " ) , or simply as ' Moscow ' , the facility could process data from up to ten spacecraft in three separate control rooms , although each control room was dedicated to a single programme ; one to Mir ; one to Soyuz ; and one to the Soviet space shuttle Buran ( which was later converted for use with the ISS ) . The facility is now used to control the Russian Orbital Segment of the ISS . The flight control team were assigned roles similar to the system used by NASA at their mission control centre in Houston , including : 
 The Flight Director , who provided policy guidance and communicated with the mission management team ; 
 The Flight Shift Director , who was responsible for real @-@ time decisions within a set of flight rules ; 
 The Mission Deputy Shift Manager ( MDSM ) for the MCC was responsible for the control room 's consoles , computers and peripherals ; 
 The MDSM for Ground Control was responsible for communications ; 
 The MDSM for Crew Training was similar to NASA 's ' <unk> , ' or capsule communicator ; usually someone who had served as the Mir crew 's lead trainer . 
 = = = Unused equipment = = = 
 Three command and control modules were constructed for the Mir program . One was used in space ; one remained in a Moscow warehouse as a source of repair parts if needed , and the third eventually was sold to an educational / entertainment complex in the U.S. In 1997 , " Tommy Bartlett 's World & Exploratory " purchased the unit and had it shipped to Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin , where it became the centerpiece of the complex 's Space Exploration wing .

 In the later years of the programme , particularly during the Shuttle @-@ Mir programme , Mir suffered from various systems failures . It had been designed for five years of use , but eventually flew for fifteen , and in the 1990s was showing its age , with constant computer crashes , loss of power , uncontrolled tumbles through space and leaking pipes . NASA astronaut John Blaha 's account of the air quality on Mir — " very healthy , it 's not dry , it 's not humid . Nothing smells . " — contradicts sharply the concerns about air quality on the space station that Jerry Linenger relates in his book about his time on the facility . Linenger says that due to the age of the space station , the cooling system had developed tiny leaks too small and numerous to be repaired , that permitted the constant release of coolant , making it unpleasant to breathe the air . He says that it was especially noticeable after he had made a spacewalk and become used to the bottled air in his spacesuit . When he returned to the station and again began breathing the air inside Mir , he was deeply shocked by the intensity of the chemical smell and very worried about the possible negative health effects of breathing such heavily contaminated air . 
 Various breakdowns of the Elektron oxygen @-@ generating system were a concern ; they led crews to become increasingly reliant on the backup Vika solid @-@ fuel oxygen generator ( SFOG ) systems , which led to a fire during the handover between EO @-@ 22 and EO @-@ 23 . ( see also ISS ECLSS ) 
 = = = = Accidents = = = = 
 Several accidents occurred which threatened the station 's safety , such as the glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM @-@ 17 during proximity operations in January 1994 . The three most alarming incidents , however , occurred during EO @-@ 23 . The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO @-@ 22 to EO @-@ 23 , when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system , a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid @-@ fuel oxygen generator ( SFOG ) . The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds ( according to official sources at the TsUP ; astronaut Jerry Linenger , however , insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes ) , and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes . This forced the crew to don respirators , but some of the respirator masks initially worn were broken . Some of the fire extinguishers mounted on the walls of the newer modules were immovable . 
 The other two accidents concerned testing of the station 's TORU manual docking system to manually dock Progress M @-@ 33 and Progress M @-@ 34 . The tests were to gauge the performance of long @-@ distance docking and the feasibility of removal of the expensive Kurs automatic docking system from Progress spacecraft . However , due to malfunctioning equipment , both tests failed , with Progress M @-@ 33 narrowly missing the station and Progress M @-@ 34 striking Spektr and puncturing the module , causing the station to <unk> and leading to Spektr being permanently sealed off . This in turn led to a power crisis aboard Mir as the module 's solar arrays produced a large proportion of the station 's electrical supply , causing the station to power down and begin to drift , requiring weeks of work to rectify before work could continue as normal . 
 = = = = Radiation and orbital debris = = = = 
 Without the protection of the Earth 's atmosphere , cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly . The station 's crews were exposed to an absorbed dose of about 5 @.@ 2 <unk> over the course of a 115 @-@ day expedition , producing an equivalent dose of 14 @.@ 75 <unk> , or 1133 µSv per day . This daily dose is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years . The radiation environment of the station was not uniform , however ; closer proximity to the station 's hull led to an increased radiation dose , and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules ; Kvant @-@ 2 's being better than the core module , for instance . 
 The increased radiation levels pose a higher risk of crews developing cancer , and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes . These cells are central to the immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts . Over time , lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members , especially in such confined areas . Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts . Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level , but data is scarce and longer @-@ term exposure will result in greater risks . 
 At the low altitudes at which Mir orbited there is a variety of space debris , consisting of everything from entire spent rocket stages and defunct satellites , to explosion fragments , paint flakes , slag from solid rocket motors , coolant released by <unk> nuclear powered satellites , small needles , and many other objects . These objects , in addition to natural micrometeoroids , posed a threat to the station as they could puncture pressurised modules and cause damage to other parts of the station , such as the solar arrays . <unk> also posed a risk to spacewalking cosmonauts , as such objects could puncture their spacesuits , causing them to <unk> . Meteor showers in particular posed a risk , and , during such storms , the crews slept in their Soyuz ferries to facilitate an emergency evacuation should Mir be damaged . 
 = Chew Valley = 
 The Chew Valley is an area in North Somerset , England , named after the River Chew , which rises at Chewton Mendip , and joins the River Avon at Keynsham . Technically , the area of the valley is bounded by the water catchment area of the Chew and its tributaries ; however , the name Chew Valley is often used less formally to cover other nearby areas , for example , Blagdon Lake and its environs , which by a stricter definition are part of the Yeo Valley . The valley is an area of rich arable and dairy farmland , interspersed with a number of villages . 
 The landscape consists of the valley of the River Chew and is generally low @-@ lying and undulating . It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north , the Lulsgate Plateau to the west , the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett , Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east . The valley 's boundary generally follows the top of scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively . The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake , which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas . The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley , a focus for recreation , and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest , because of the bird species , plants and insects . 
 The area falls into the domains of councils including Bath and North East Somerset , North Somerset and Mendip . Part of the area falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . Most of the undeveloped area is within the Bristol / Bath Green Belt . Many of the villages date back to the time of the Domesday Book and there is evidence of human occupation since the Stone Age . There are hundreds of listed buildings with the churches being Grade I listed . The main commercial centre is Chew Magna . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 There is no clear origin for the name " Chew " , found scarcely anywhere else ; however , there have been differing explanations of the etymology , including " winding water " , the ' ew ' being a variant of the French eau , meaning water . The word <unk> is a western dialect for a narrow passage , and <unk> is Old English for turning . One explanation is that the name Chew began in Normandy as Cheux , and came to England with the Norman Conquest during the eleventh century . However , others agree with Ekwall 's interpretation that it is derived from the Welsh <unk> meaning " the young of an animal , or chicken " , so that afon <unk> would have been " the river of the chickens " . Other possible explanations suggest it comes from the Old English word ceo , ' fish gill ' . 
 = = Government and politics = = 
 The villages in the valley have their own parish councils which have responsibility for local issues . They also elect councillors to district councils e.g. Mendip and Somerset County Council or unitary authorities e.g. Bath and North East Somerset or North Somerset , which have wider responsibilities for services such as education , refuse and tourism . 
 Each of the villages is also part of a constituency , either North East Somerset or North Somerset . The area is also within the South West England constituency of the European Parliament . Avon and Somerset Constabulary provides police services to the area . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Geology = = = 
 The western end of the area ( around Nempnett Thrubwell ) consists of the Harptree Beds which incorporate silicified clay , shale and Lias Limestone . Clifton Down Limestone , which includes <unk> and Dolomitic mudstones of the Carboniferous period , is found in the adjoining central band and Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period . There are two main soil types , both generally well @-@ drained . The mudstones around the lakes give rise to fertile silty clay soils that are a dull dusky red colour because of their high iron content . The clay content means that where unimproved they easily become waterlogged when wet , and hard with cracks and fissures during dry periods . The main geological outcrops around the lake are Mudstone , largely consisting of red <unk> resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape . Bands of Sandstone of the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area . There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew . The transition between the gently sloping landscape of the Upper Chew and Yeo Valleys and the open landscape of the Mendip Hills plateau is a scarp slope of 75 to 235 metres ( 250 – 770 ft ) . The predominant formation is Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Triassic period . It formed as a result of desert erosion and weathering of the scarp slopes . It takes the form of rock fragments mainly derived from older Carboniferous Limestone cemented together by lime and sand which hardened to give the appearance of concrete . The northern boundary is formed by the sides of the Dundry Plateau where the most significant geological formation is the Inferior Oolite of the Jurassic period found on the higher ground around Maes Knoll . This overlays the Lower Lias Clay found on the adjoining slopes . The clays make a poor foundation and landslips are characteristic on the slopes . This area was once connected to the Cotswolds . The intervening land has subsequently been eroded leaving this outlier with the characteristics of the Cotswold Plateau . The unusual geological features have been recognised as Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) for their geological interest including Barns Batch Spinney , <unk> Rocks Quarry and Dundry Main Road South Quarry . 
 The oldest geological formation in the valley is the Supra @-@ Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period . It is a significant feature towards the north @-@ eastern part of the area and is represented by the Pensford Syncline coal basin , which formed part of the Somerset coalfield . It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales . The landscape is typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone . Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils . Soils to the eastern part of the area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils . They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra @-@ Pennant Measures . They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates . They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour . In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton . In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through <unk> , <unk> and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils .

 The small and medium @-@ sized fields of the valley are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland , some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period . Hedgerows support the nationally rare <unk> vetch ( Vicia <unk> ) . Mature oak ( Quercus ) and ash ( Fraxinus excelsior ) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) and chestnuts ( Castanea sativa ) . Elm ( Ulmus ) trees have been lost in this area , and dead / dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape . 
 = = = = Fauna = = = = 
 Wildlife abounds in the valley , particularly the water birds around the rivers and lakes , with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl . In addition to the water birds including ducks , shoveller ( Anas clypeata ) , gadwall ( Anas strepera ) and great crested grebes ( Podiceps cristatus ) , a wide variety of other bird species can be seen . These range from small birds such as tits ( Paridae ) and wrens ( Troglodytidae ) to mistle thrush ( Turdidae ) . Larger birds include woodpeckers ( <unk> ) and common buzzard ( Buteo buteo ) . 
 The valley also has a wide variety of small mammals with larger species including Eurasian badger ( Meles meles ) and deer ( Cervidae ) . The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost , at Compton Martin Ochre Mine , for greater horseshoe bats ( Rhinolophus ferrumequinum ) . A rare and endangered species , the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive .

 Archaeological excavations carried out before the flooding of Chew Valley Lake found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic , Mesolithic and Neolithic ( Old , Middle and New Stone Age ) , Bronze Age and Iron Age , comprising implements such as stone knives , flint blades and the head of a mace , along with buildings and graves . Other evidence of occupation from prehistoric times is provided by the henge monument at Stanton Drew , long barrow at Chewton Mendip , and Fairy Toot tumulus at Nempnett Thrubwell . Maes Knoll fort , on Dundry Down in the northern reaches of the valley , is a Scheduled Ancient Monument that dates from the Iron Age ; it later served as a terminus for the early medieval Wansdyke earthworks . 
 There is evidence of Roman remains in particular a villa and burial pits . Artefacts from the valley were sent to the British Museum . Other Roman artefacts from the lake are on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery . There are historic parks and mansion houses , including Stanton Drew , <unk> , Stowey House , Chew Court , Chew Magna Manor House and Sutton Court . Almost all of the villages have churches dating back to the fifteenth or sixteenth century . 
 The area around Pensford was an important coal mining area during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield , although there are no working coal mines today . The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton . The area suffered serious flooding during the storm of 10 July 1968 , prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley , around Pensford and Keynsham . 
 = = = = Field patterns = = = = 
 The small fields in the western part of the area are particularly characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period . Fields of this category are generally small in size , regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve the outlines of the earlier strip field system . Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur . For example , there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell , south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of <unk> . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Along with the rest of South West England , the Chew Valley has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country . The annual mean temperature is approximately 10 ° C ( 50 @.@ 0 ° F ) . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures . The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately 21 ° C ( 69 @.@ 8 ° F ) . In winter mean minimum temperatures of 1 ° C ( 33 @.@ 8 ° F ) or 2 ° C ( 35 @.@ 6 ° F ) are common . In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south @-@ west of England , however convective cloud sometimes forms inland , reducing the number of hours of sunshine . Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1 @,@ 600 hours . In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton . Most of the rainfall in the south @-@ west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection . Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions , which is when they are most active . In summer , a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms . Average rainfall is around 700 mm ( 28 in ) . About 8 – 15 days of snowfall is typical . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds , and June to August have the lightest winds . The predominant wind direction is from the south @-@ west . 
 = = Population and demographics = = 
 Many of the large houses in the valley were built or bought by wealthy merchants from Bristol and Bath who employed local people in their households . Bess of Hardwick ( 1527 – 1606 ) is known to have lived in Sutton Court , Stowey , for a few years in the sixteenth century when , after the death of her first husband Sir William Cavendish , she married Sir William St. Loe , who was Chief Butler of England and captain of the guard to Queen Elizabeth , and owned several manors within the valley and surrounding areas . Around this period a close neighbour was Sir John Popham ( 1533 – 1607 ) who was a judge and the Speaker of Parliament . In the seventeenth century the eminent philosopher John Locke ( 1632 – 1704 ) lived in <unk> ; his house is still known as John Locke 's cottage . In the eighteenth century the poet John Langhorne ( 1735 – 1779 ) became the curate at Blagdon around the time that Augustus Montague <unk> ( 1740 – 1778 ) was the priest . Geologist William Smith ( 1769 – 1839 ) moved to the valley in 1791 to make a valuation survey of the Sutton Court estate and later worked for the Somersetshire Coal Canal Company . 
 John Sanger , the circus proprietor , was born in Chew Magna in 1816 . William Rees @-@ Mogg , former editor of The Times , took the title Baron Rees @-@ Mogg of Hinton Blewett in 1988 . Jazz clarinettist Acker Bilk lived in Pensford . Dr Phil Hammond and wildlife television producer Richard Brock also live in the valley . Actress Maisie Williams is a native of Clutton . 
 In the past part of the population worked in coal mining , although there are no working mines in the area now . There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries , although many people commute to surrounding cities for work . According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5 @,@ 000 , largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets . The average age of the population is 42 years , with unemployment rates of 1 – 4 % of all economically active people aged 16 – 74 , however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley . In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England .

 = Sonderbehandlung = 
 Sonderbehandlung ( abbr . S.B. ) is a German noun meaning special treatment in English , also existing as a verb : <unk> ( to treat specially ) . While it can refer to any sort of preferential treatment , it is known primarily as a euphemism used by Nazi functionaries and the SS for mass murder . It first came to prominence during Action T4 , where SS doctors killed mentally ill and disabled patients between 1939 and 1941 , and was one of a number of nonspecific words the Nazis used to document mass murder and genocide . Another notable example was Sonderbehandlung <unk> . 
 This term was also used to imprecisely refer to the equipment used to perpetrate their crimes , such as gas chambers and Zyklon B. The true meaning of Sonderbehandlung was widely known in the SS , and in April 1943 , Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler was so concerned about the security of it that he had it redacted in a secret report . 
 <unk> Lang states that disguised language was used " ... not only in communications issued to the Jewish public when the intention of those issuing the communications was to deceive the Jews in order to minimize the likelihood of resistance , but also in addresses to the outside world and , perhaps more significantly , in internal communications as well , among officials who unquestionably knew ( who were themselves sometimes responsible for ) the linguistic substitutions stipulated by the language rules . " 
 = = Background = = 
 By the summer of 1941 , Action T4 became widespread public knowledge in Germany ( and also in neutral countries and to Germany 's enemies ) , and on August 24 , 1941 , Hitler ordered the joint chief of the operation Dr. Karl Brandt to halt it due to public protest ( however it still continued , not only out of the public eye but in greater intensity ) . Hitler did not want to run the risk of an order publicly embarrassing him again and , as a result , the explicit order to carry out the Holocaust was given by him orally . Even if there had been any written instances of this order , they would have almost certainly been destroyed by the Nazis when they realised their defeat was inevitable . 
 Where the Nazis had to document murder , Sonderbehandlung was one of a number of euphemisms used . The Action T4 doctors used " <unk> " ( decontaminated ) to document the gassing of mentally ill and handicapped individuals . The actual plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe was called " Die Endlösung der Judenfrage " ( Final Solution to the Jewish Question ) . Other words to describe extermination operations included : 
 " <unk> " ( evacuation ) 
 " <unk> " ( expulsion ) 
 " <unk> " ( resettlement ) 
 " <unk> " ( thinning out – as in the removal of inhabitants from a ghetto ) 
 " <unk> " ( pacification ) 
 " <unk> <unk> " or " A.B. Aktion " ( special pacification ) 
 " <unk> " ( having @-@ been @-@ migrated ) 
 " <unk> " ( cleansing ) 
 " <unk> <unk> " ( directed or worked through in a manner in accordance with the Sicherheitsdienst ) 
 The Posen speeches made by Heinrich Himmler in October 1943 are the first known documents in which a high @-@ ranking member of the Nazi government spoke explicitly about the perpetration of the Holocaust during the war . Himmler mentions the " <unk> " or " evacuation of the Jews " , which he uses synonymously with their extermination . At one point in the speech , Himmler says : " elimination of the Jews , extermination , we 're doing it " , briefly pausing in the middle of " elimination " ( <unk> ) before going on to say " extermination " ( Ausrottung ) . His hesitation in the middle of saying " elimination " can be considered as a quick mental check to see whether or not it is acceptable to use such words in front of his given audience . The answer is yes : it is the seniority of the SS in private . This has been compared to another incident of self @-@ verification in the opposite way , where Josef Goebbels , in his Total War speech on February 18 , 1943 , begins to say " Ausrottung des Judentums " ( " extermination of Jewry " ) but switches to saying " <unk> " , bearing in mind that he is speaking very publicly . His resulting phrasing is " <unk> ... <unk> des Judentums " , which can be likened to " <unk> ... elimination " in English . 
 = = Usage = = 
 The term first appeared on September 20 , 1939 in a decree by the Gestapo and Sicherheitsdienst chief SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich to all state police departments : 
 " To avoid any misunderstandings , please take note of the following : ... a distinction must be made between those who may be dealt with in the usual way and those who must be given special treatment . The latter case covers subjects who , due to their most objectionable nature , their dangerousness , or their ability to serve as tools of propaganda for the enemy , are suitable for elimination , without respect for persons , by merciless treatment ( namely , by execution ) . 
 However , the usage is directed against Germans rather than Jews ( it relates to " the principles of internal state security in the war " ) . Nevertheless , the law allowed for the killing of any person the regime wished . A memo dated six days later from a meeting at the SS @-@ Reichssicherheitshauptamt defines Sonderbehandlung with " execution " following it in brackets . 
 A report from the Eastern Front dated October 25 , 1941 , reads that " due to the grave danger of epidemic , the complete liquidation of Jews from the ghetto in Vitebsk was begun on October 8 , 1941 . The number of Jews to whom special treatment is to be applied is around 3 @,@ 000 . " An excerpt of a decree dated February 20 , 1942 , from the RSHA and written by Himmler regarding the treatment of " foreign civilian workers " advises that in particularly difficult cases , application should be made to the RSHA for special treatment , adding that " special treatment takes place by hanging . " In a letter to the RSHA , SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Heinz <unk> requests additional gas vans for " ... a transport of Jews , which has to be treated in a special way ... " The gas vans were vehicles containing an airtight compartment in which the victims were locked and the exhaust gas was pumped into , killing the victims with the combined effects of carbon monoxide poisoning and suffocation . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 In German , " <unk> " , meaning " special " , can be used to form compound nouns . As well as in reference to actions , the Nazis used euphemisms to refer to the actual equipment used to carry out killing . In his letter , <unk> refers to the vans as " S @-@ wagen " ( S @-@ vans ) ; " <unk> " ( special vans ) in full . Other documented references include " <unk> " ( special vehicle ) , " <unk> " ( special van ) , and " <unk> " ( auxiliary equipment ) . 
 Several instances of this unspecific language in reference to equipment can be found in documents concerning Auschwitz concentration camp . A letter dated August 21 , 1942 referred to Bunker 1 and Bunker 2 ( farmhouses west of Birkenau converted into gas chambers ) as " <unk> für <unk> " ( bathing installations for special actions ) . In the letter , this is given in quotes , further suggesting the euphemistic nature of what is meant . On blueprints , the basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were simply marked as " <unk> 1 " ( basement morgue 1 ) , and the basement undressing rooms were marked as " <unk> 2 " . However , a letter dated November 27 , 1942 to chief Auschwitz architect SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Karl Bischoff referred to morgue 1 of Crematorium II as the " <unk> " ( special cellar ) . A letter from SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Rudolf <unk> concerning Crematoria II and III to oven builders J.A. <unk> and Sons dated March 6 , 1943 , refers to morgue 2 as an " <unk> " ( undressing room ) . The units of prisoners forced to empty gas chambers and load bodies into ovens were known as the Sonderkommando ( special squads ) . A document dated August 26 , 1942 granted the camp authorities to send a truck " ... to Dessau to pick up material for special treatment ... " - Dessau was one of two places where Zyklon B was manufactured . Standard usage of the term for killing at Auschwitz applied . A letter dated October 13 , 1942 , signed by Bischoff , states that construction of new crematoria facilities " ... was necessary to start immediately in July 1942 because of the situation caused by the special actions . " On September 8 , 1943 , 5 @,@ 006 Jews were transferred from Theresienstadt to Auschwitz under the designation " SB six months . " Six months later on March 9 , 1944 , those still alive were gassed . In his diary , SS @-@ Obersturmführer and doctor Johann Kremer describes seeing a mass gassing for the first time : 
 September 2 , 1942 : For the first time , at 3 : 00 A.M. outside , attended a special action . Dante 's Inferno seems to me almost a comedy compared to this . They don 't call Auschwitz the camp of annihilation for nothing ! 
 Three days later , Kremer described the mass gassing of emaciated prisoners , nicknamed Muslims : 
 September 5 , 1942 : In the morning attended a special action from the women 's concentration camp ( Muslims ) ; the most dreadful of horrors . Master @-@ Sergeant Thilo ( troop doctor ) was right when he said to me that this is the anus mundi . In the evening towards 8 : 00 attended another special action from Holland [ sic ] . Because of the special rations they get a fifth of a liter of schnapps , 5 cigarettes , 100 g salami and bread , the men all clamor to take part in such actions . Today and tomorrow ( Sunday ) work . 
 In a letter dated January 29 , 1943 by SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Bischoff to SS @-@ Oberführer Hans Kammler , Bischoff refers to basement morgue 1 of Crematorium II at Auschwitz as a " <unk> " , literally " gassing cellar " . In the letter , the word is underlined , and at the top of the document is written : " SS @-@ Untersturmführer <unk> ! " There was a very clear policy in the architecture office that words such as " gas chamber " should not be used ; Second Lieutenant <unk> should be informed of this slip . Citing this unique letter , Robert Jan van Pelt states that in using " special action " or " special treatment " in place of extermination and killing , the first Holocaust deniers were the Nazis themselves , in that they attempted to deny to themselves what they were doing . 
 = = Sensitivity = = 
 Heinrich Himmler became increasingly concerned about the security of documenting the destruction of the Jews . On April 9 , 1943 , he wrote a secret letter to Heydrich 's successor as chief of the Gestapo and SD , SS @-@ Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner , concerning the <unk> Report . Himmler considered the report " well executed for purposes of camouflage and potentially useful for later times . " The next day , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Rudolf Brandt passed a message to the author of the report , Richard <unk> , stating : 
 The Reichsführer @-@ SS has received your report on " The Final Solution of the European Jewish Question " . He wishes that " special treatment of the Jews " not be mentioned anywhere . On page 9 , it must be formulated as follows : 
 " They were guided : 
 through the camps in the General Government 
 through the camps in the <unk> " 
 No other formulation is to be employed . 
 Himmler was so sure that almost everyone knew what " special treatment " meant , and ordered for it to be replaced with the even more vague " <unk> " ( guided through ) , even though the document in question was top secret . The camps in question in the General Government were Treblinka , Sobibor and Belzec extermination camps , and Majdanek concentration camp . The only camp in the <unk> was Chełmno extermination camp . 
 = = Nazi perspectives = = 
 In the course of investigations and criminal proceedings for Nazi war crimes , it was shown that among those involved , there was no doubt what was meant by this term . At his trial , SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann stated that " everybody knew " special treatment meant killing . 
 According to SS @-@ Gruppenführer and senior SS and Polizeiführer Emil <unk> : 
 " During the war , the SS gave no meaning to Sonderbehandlung other than killing . I am certain that high @-@ ranking officers knew it . I don 't know whether the ordinary SS man did or not . According to the terminology used at the time , I understand ' special treatment ' to mean only killing and nothing else . "

 Valene " Val " Ewing ( maiden name Clements , formerly Gibson , <unk> ) , portrayed by Joan Van Ark , is a fictional character in the CBS primetime soap opera Knots Landing , a spin @-@ off from the long @-@ running series Dallas , in which she also appeared . The character originated in 1978 on Dallas as the mother of Lucy Ewing and ex @-@ wife of Gary Ewing ( the second son of oil baron Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing ) . Van Ark made several guest appearances on Dallas before becoming one of the main stars of the spin @-@ off Knots Landing in December 1979 , though she continued to make small appearances in Dallas for the next couple of years . Van Ark played Valene in Knots Landing for thirteen of its fourteen seasons , which made her one of the show 's longest running stars . The character made her last television appearance in 1997 , when she appeared in the reunion miniseries Knots Landing : Back to the Cul @-@ de @-@ Sac . In 2013 , Van Ark reprised her character for the new , updated version of Dallas . 
 Valene 's storyline in her first two episodes on Dallas focuses on the rebuilding of her relationship with estranged ex @-@ husband Gary Ewing . When Valene arrives in Texas to find her daughter , Lucy Ewing , she is brought back into the drama of the Ewing family . Upon arrival , she is reunited with Gary with whom she slowly falls back in love . Once Dallas became a hit , series creator David Jacobs proceeded to launch a spin @-@ off series titled Knots Landing , which would feature Valene and Gary prominently . The actress had strong input on how they would create her character outline . She recalled , " I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform , and the shoes . And then I was trying to get that Texas sound , her all important accent . And so we created her layer by layer . " 
 Van Ark received positive reviews for her portrayal of Valene , and received two Soap Opera Digest award nominations in the category " Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial " . Greg Hernandez said , " Her character of Valene was a best @-@ selling author , but her personal life was always a mess . She had her husband , Gary , stolen by another woman , then got pregnant by him , her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor , she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex @-@ husband 's fiancee , and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money . But she and Gary Ewing ( Ted Shackelford ) made for one of television 's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting for them to get back together . "

 = = = Casting and creation = = = 
 From the outset , Dallas was centered around the lives of the wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas , Texas . Once the show became a success after the initial run as a five @-@ episode miniseries , the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters . They introduced the parents of Lucy Ewing ( Charlene Tilton ) , who had not been shown on @-@ screen until that point . Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show . Her husband , John Marshall , convinced her to take the opportunity . In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings , Van Ark said : " At the time Dallas came up , I was doing two different jobs . They offered me to join Dallas , which would be shot in Dallas , Texas at Southfork . I read the script and it was buzzed about already ... they were saying this was the hot new show . I said to myself , ' How can I be in Los Angeles doing this , down in Dallas , and then back in New York doing two days worth of Estée Lauder commercials ? ' He ( my husband ) read it and said , ' You 've got to . It 's a wonderful part . So , my husband talked me into a role that would become a fifteen @-@ year chapter in my life . " 
 When asked about the casting process , Van Ark explained : " It all happened so fast . They sent me a script for a [ Dallas ] two @-@ part guest shot , but I was supposed to be in New York recording commercials . My husband - much like Larry Hagman 's wife , Maj , talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val . " She later added , " I thought the script was wonderful , and [ Valene ] was a great character . But we created her within those two episodes . I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform , and the shoes . And then I was trying to get that Texas sound , her all important accent . And so we created her layer by layer . " During the second season of Dallas , David Jacobs decided to create a spin @-@ off for the quickly growing franchise . He wanted to create a television show based on " family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level " . The production company , CBS , turned down this idea , as they wanted something more " glitzy " to put on the air , with wealthier characters , which would become Dallas . 
 After the success of Dallas , Jacobs ' presented his initial idea again and created Knots Landing , with some alterations of his original script . In an interview , Jacobs explained : " Well , that 's pretty good , but you know @-@ and then he pulled out the pages that we 'd left for them a few years ago on Knots Landing , or a year before on Knots , and he said , ' Is there any way we can make this a spin @-@ off ? ' I just took one of the couples and made it , you know , Val and Gary who had already been created on the parent series and putting them into the mix , but when you have four couples and you change one , you sort of have to change the dynamic all the way around . However , once I wrote the script , remarkably little changed from the script and the pilot as you would see it . " Gary Ewing was originally played by actor David Ackroyd , but Ackroyd was unable to sign on for the spin @-@ off , and Ted Shackelford assumed the role . Initially , it was presumed that Charlene Tilton would be joining Knots Landing as Gary and Val 's daughter , but the network decided to keep her on Dallas in order to keep the two shows separate . She did , however , make a guest appearance in the first season . 
 Van Ark appeared in Knots Landing for thirteen seasons of its fourteen season run before she left to pursue other interests . According to co @-@ star Michele Lee , Van Ark was apparently offered a role on an NBC sitcom after she left the show . The actress reprised her role for the series finale of Knots Landing , where Val is revealed to have been alive the whole time . When asked about her departure in an interview with the Los Angeles Times , she said : 
 " I could stay forever on the show and be safe . But three years ago I did Night of the Iguana in Williamstown [ Massachusetts ] , and I had a quote from Tennessee Williams taped on my mirror , taken from an essay he 'd written on success . It said , and I 'm paraphrasing here : ' Security is in the shape of a kidney @-@ shaped pool in Los Angeles , where you sit waiting for your residual checks . ' I was in a comfortable spot on Knots , and an artist should not be comfortable . I 'd forgotten that there was a character I 'd loved for 13 years . She was the seed of the show . I am the sole person to spin off from Dallas ( because actor David Ackroyd originated the role of Gary on that show ) . Valene gave Knots a note of spirituality . There was a heart that was Valene . I hope they treat her with respect , that she is seen out with a resolution she deserves . " 
 = = = Characterization and relationships = = = 
 Throughout the course of the show , Val was often played up as the good girl character . When asked about whether Val was a weak character , Van Ark said : " God , no . No she wasn ’ t . For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet . She was strong in a realistic kind of way . I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth , Wind and Fire . Michele was the Earth , I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire . I think that really captured it . " Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today . She said , " Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out . Why even bother otherwise ? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all . I think Valene was headed to , and my sister ’ s like this , after years of doing everything for her husband and her children , Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world . I think if you saw Valene today she ’ d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall . " The actress also said : 
 Since Valene , I ’ ve tried to do anything and everything but play a goody @-@ two @-@ shoes . I love Val , I adore her . But I spent a total of 15 years — if you count the first year I played her on Dallas . That was quite an investment for me as an actress . If you were playing a goody @-@ two @-@ shoes today , the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day . Look at what they ’ ve done to Tiger Woods . Look at what they ’ ve done to that man . My feeling is his father — or the absence of his father in his life — is ( the root of ) what ’ s going on with Tiger and that marriage . But the media won ’ t leave him alone . No matter who you are , ( the celebrity coverage ) is obsessive and constant . It ’ s hurtful . For me , if they show my face in a bad photo , they latch into me hook , line and sinker . Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands . It 's brutal . I wonder what they ’ ll do with Alec Baldwin now . He was my brother on Knots . They really threw him under a bus ( when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice @-@ mail rant against daughter Ireland , then 11 , in 2007 ) . He loves that child so much . " 
 Valene 's relationship with Gary is important to the understanding of her overall character . The Gary / Abby / Valene love triangle , which involved Gary cheating on Valene with Abby Cunningham – the show 's main villain – was a monumental storyline for all three characters . Van Ark described the storyline : 
 " There wasn ’ t really anything I could think of , but I will mention that Ted and I went in way early , whenever Donna Mills came on the show , and told David Jacobs that it made total sense that Gary would fall for Abby . I can ’ t believe I did that but it really provided me with some great stories . Because they were celebrating Donna Mills and she became the center but Gary and Val were supposed to be this enduring couple . Ted and I were saying Gary and Val should break up and Gary should go with Abby . It was a pretty big deal to break up the couple that the show began with . So ( the producers ) were going toward this , then they pulled away but eventually returned to it . David Jacobs was against it but we convinced him . And it was the longest running story on the show . It took a long time for them to get back together . Eight years . " 
 Ted Shackelford , who plays Gary , described the love story , " I can 't complain . I mean , Gary spent six or seven years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another . So with Val ... You 'd think after 13 years , at the age they are [ Val is 44 , Gary is 46 ] and the amount of bullshit they 've been through , they would have learned something ! They 'd probably have a very comfortable life by now . But it makes for a dead story line . " When asked about working with Van Ark , he said : " I don 't know how it could get any better . She 's remarkable , and I 'm not blowing smoke up your ass . I 'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass , although sometimes she is a pain in the ass . But my best work is done with Joan . " Van Ark also discussed Valene 's relationship with her daughter , Lucy Ewing . She said , " The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val , coming over from Dallas , so maybe there should have been more Lucy . I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots . " 
 = = Return = = 
 With the 2012 continuation of Dallas , there was talk of some Knots Landing characters returning to air . Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary . Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series . Van Ark refuted the claims , saying : " Well , rumor has it … I ’ m having lunch with Ted tomorrow . They asked him to come down and be part of it . It was several months ago , and he ’ s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless , the daytime soap for CBS . But if they asked Gary , maybe they ’ ll ask [ for Val ] . " She would , however , love to be involved if the producers asked her , especially to torment fellow cast @-@ member Larry Hagman . " There is no doubt about it . This man I loved so much , Larry Hagman … I was just at his birthday party several months ago … I would kill , that if Val came back , if it was trouble for J.R .. Because they were always at odds . " However , Gary and Valene 's daughter , Lucy Ewing , along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series . Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing " alternative " versions of Gary and Valene ( the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born ) , there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985 @-@ 86 season of each show ( which , on Dallas , turned out to be a dream had by Pamela Ewing ) . 
 On October 17 , 2012 , TV Guide reported that Joan Van Ark and Ted Shackelford are set to return to Dallas , reprising their characters Valene and Gary Ewing for three episodes in the show 's second season , which is set to air in 2013 . According to Joan Van Ark , she will appear as Valene in one episode only .

 Valene Ewing first appears in Dallas in 1978 , as the mother of Lucy Ewing ( Charlene Tilton ) and the ex @-@ wife of Gary Ewing ( David Ackroyd , later played by Ted Shackelford ) , the middle son and the black sheep of the Ewing family . Valene and Gary Ewing were first married in their adolescence in 1961 , when Gary was 17 years old and Valene was 15 . When a pregnant Valene persuades Gary to take her to the Southfork Ranch in order to introduce her to his family , they settle down at Southfork , and Miss Ellie gave Gary a job as ranch foreman . However , Gary and Valene were soon pressured and manipulated by Gary 's older brother , J.R. Ewing ( Larry Hagman ) , who constantly tried to undermine and destroy their marriage . Meanwhile , Gary 's father , Jock Ewing , put pressure on Gary to stand up and face his responsibilities for becoming a teenage husband and father @-@ to @-@ be . When Valene gives birth to their daughter Lucy , J.R. makes it clear that the child is a Ewing and will be raised by the Ewings themselves . J.R. ' s constant interference causes Gary and Val 's marriage to collapse . Under the pressure , Gary fell victim to alcoholism , became violent in the process and walked out on Val and Lucy . With Gary gone , Valene is then driven off Southfork by J.R. , but she soon returns to get baby Lucy and flees to Virginia , and later to Tennessee , where she tries to get help from her mother , <unk> Clements ( Julie Harris ) , to take them in , but they are turned away . At this point , Valene and Lucy had already been tracked down by heavies that were hired by J.R. and the heavies rip Lucy right out of Valene 's arms , and take Lucy back to Southfork to be raised by her paternal grandparents . When Valene later tried to take legal action to get Lucy back , J.R. warned Valene that he 'd kill her if she came back to the state of Texas . Valene is prevented from seeing her daughter again for many years as a result of this . 
 Valene 's bitterness over her mother 's indifference , and the subsequent loss of Lucy , is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing . Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing , and is only briefly referenced in Dallas . While working in a diner in 1978 , Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they got to know each other . They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterwards . In the fall of 1978 , Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents . Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time , but their reunion is again undermined by J.R. , who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company , hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away . Gary realised that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork , so he departed . J.R. then turned on Valene , trying to bribe her , before ordering her to leave . In December 1979 , Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas , and get married for the second time . Gary 's parents , Jock Ewing ( Jim Davis ) and Miss Ellie Ewing ( Barbara Bel Geddes ) , as well as Gary 's brother , Bobby ( Patrick Duffy ) , and sister @-@ in @-@ law Pamela Barnes Ewing ( Victoria Principal ) , attend the wedding . Shortly afterwards , they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift . Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R. ' s dream in which she meets Gary for the first time , highlighting the idea that they were destined to meet one way or another .

 After their remarriage , Valene and Gary Ewing move to Knots Landing , a coastal suburb of Los Angeles , California . Valene is initially skeptical of the move , and describes Knots Landing as " no place to start over " . She is struck by her neighbors , the <unk> , and particularly by Sid 's daughter , Annie , from Sid 's first marriage , who reminds Val of her own daughter , Lucy . Gary is determined to stay , and convinces Val to give Knots Landing a chance . Val becomes involved in Jimmy Carter 's 1980 re @-@ election effort , joining the local chapter of the Carter @-@ Mondale ' 80 campaign . She also signs up neighbor Karen Fairgate ( Michele Lee ) and the pair eventually become best friends , a relationship struck when Annie , on the run , turns to Val for help , and Val convinces her to return to her father and stepmother . Val remained a central character on the show from 1979 to 1992 . Gary and Val 's daughter , Lucy , visits her parents in Knots Landing , and appears in one episode in the show 's first season . Though largely uneducated , Valene discovers she has a talent for writing and writes a thinly @-@ veiled expose of the Ewings of Dallas called " Capricorn Crude " . Gary is extremely critical of the book , which affects their marriage . However , the book is published and Val becomes a best @-@ selling novelist and financially independent . Val leaves Gary after Gary 's affair with his neighbor and business partner , Abby Cunningham ( Donna Mills ) ; and Val keeps the house in Seaview Circle . Gary and Val 's second marriage ended in divorce nearly a year later . Val is subsequently married to Ben Gibson ( Doug Sheehan ) ( 1985 @-@ 1987 ) , and later briefly to Danny <unk> ( Sam Behrens ) ( 1990 ) . 
 One of Val 's most memorable storylines occurs during the 1984 @-@ 85 season when she is told that her infant twins are stillborn . Val senses that this could not be true as she clearly remembers hearing the babies cry . She suffers a nervous breakdown and disappears from Knots Landing for several months , and is later reunited with her babies , thanks largely to the investigations secretly undertaken by her neighbors Mack and Karen MacKenzie . In 1991 , over 8 years after their second divorce , Gary and Val got married for the third time ( Valene 's fifth marriage , and Gary 's fourth ) . While working on an assignment to write a biography about Greg Sumner ( William Devane ) in 1992 , Valene crosses paths with some mafioso type characters who are targeting Sumner . Fearing that she could expose them , they kidnap Val and she is later believed to have died in a car accident . Joan Van Ark had decided to leave the series in 1992 , at the end of Season 13 , which turned out to be the show 's penultimate season . However , Van Ark came back in the 2 @-@ part finale to the show 's final season in 1993 , when it was discovered that Val was never in the car . Having escaped her kidnappers , she later returns to the cul @-@ de @-@ sac . Valene is seen once again in the 1997 reunion mini @-@ series Knots Landing : Back to the Cul @-@ de @-@ Sac where she begins a new career as a screenwriter , and adapts her best @-@ selling novel " Hostage " , which tells the story of her kidnapping five years earlier , into a film .

 In 2013 , It transpires Gary and Valene have separated again due to Gary falling off the wagon . Sue Ellen Ewing calls Val on behalf of Gary , to tell her that Gary misses her .

Val realizes she has returned to Dallas under false pretenses and confronts Sue Ellen , who tells her to resume her relationship with Gary while she still has the chance .

 For her portrayal of Valene , Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards in the category " Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial " . Greg Hernandez said , " Before I go on , I have to confess that I was a die @-@ hard fan of Knots Landing , the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years . Her character of Valene was a best @-@ selling author but her personal life was always a mess . She had her husband , Gary , stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him , her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor , she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex @-@ husband 's fiancee , and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money . But she and Gary Ewing ( Ted Shackleford ) made for one of television 's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting for them to get back together . Joan keeps in touch with Ted ( pictured with Joan , above at a " Knots " reunion a few years back ) , Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother . " Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication . Van Ark said of this , " It ’ s amazing . It ’ s like having friends everywhere in the United States . I heard that a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this ( autograph convention ) . We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France , Germany , Russia . Knots has a huge following , and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal . Not many shows last 14 years on prime @-@ time . That ’ s a milestone , and I ’ m very proud of it . " 
 The Chicago Sun @-@ Times said , " Valene Ewing Gibson would be the first to admit that the past seven years have been no day at the beach . She lost her first husband to a sultry siren who applies eyeliner with a trowel . She opened her heart and her home to a nagging mother who could drive Mother Teresa to slit her wrists . She discovered a long @-@ lost brother who just happened to be a psychotic TV evangelist . She even had a nervous breakdown that left her convinced her name was Verna , and was an ' I do ' away from tying the knot with a scheming <unk> who was well aware of her family ties to the Ewings of Dallas even if she had forgotten .

 = Gateway Protection Programme = 
 The Gateway Protection Programme is a scheme operated by the British government in partnership with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) and co @-@ funded by the European Union ( EU ) , offering a legal route for a quota of UNHCR @-@ identified refugees to be resettled in the United Kingdom . Following a proposal by the British Home Secretary , David Blunkett , in October 2001 , the legal basis was established by the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the programme itself launched in March 2004 . Since its inception , the programme has enjoyed broad support from the UK 's main political parties . 
 The Gateway Protection Programme initially had a quota of 500 refugees per year , which was later increased to 750 , but the actual number of refugees resettled in most years has been fewer than the quota permitted . Liberian , Congolese , Sudanese , Burmese , Ethiopian , Mauritanian , Iraqi , Bhutanese , Eritrean , Palestinian , Sierra Leonean and Somali refugees have been resettled under the programme . Refugees have been resettled to a number of locations in England and Scotland . Of the 18 local authorities participating as resettlement locations by 2012 , eight are in the North West region of England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside . Evaluations of the programme have praised it as having a positive impact on the reception of refugees by local communities , but have also noted the difficulties these refugees have faced in securing employment . 
 = = Programme details = = 
 The programme is the UK 's " quota refugee " resettlement scheme . Refugees designated as particularly vulnerable by the UNHCR are assessed by the Home Office for eligibility under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees . If they meet the eligibility criteria they are then brought to the UK and granted indefinite leave to remain . The International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) helps facilitate pre @-@ departure medical screening , counselling , dossier preparation , transport and immediate arrival assistance . Once in the UK , refugees are entered into a 12 @-@ month support programme intended to aid their integration . The programme has involved local authorities and NGOs including the British Red Cross , the International Rescue Committee , Migrant Helpline , Refugee Action , the Refugee Arrivals Project , the Refugee Council , Scottish Refugee Council and Refugee Support . These organisations formed the Resettlement Inter @-@ Agency Partnership at the planning stage of the programme , in order to pool their resources and form a partnership for the delivery of services to the resettled refugees . 
 The programme is distinct from and in addition to ordinary provisions for claiming asylum in the United Kingdom . Since 2008 , it has been co @-@ funded by the European Union , first through the European Refugee Fund and then through its successor , the Asylum , Migration and Integration Fund ( <unk> ) . Over the period 2009 – 14 , the Home Office provided £ 29 @.@ 97 million in funding and the EU £ 18 @.@ 67 million . Anna Musgrave of the Refugee Council argues that the programme " is rarely talked about and the Home Office , in the main , stay fairly quiet about it . " 
 = = History = = 
 The Gateway Protection Programme is not the first British refugee resettlement programme . Other , informal resettlement programmes include the Mandate Refugee Scheme , and the UK has also participated in the Ten or More Plan . The former is for so @-@ called " mandate " refugees who have been granted refugee status by UNHCR in third countries . To qualify for the scheme , refugees must have close ties to the UK and it must also be demonstrated that the UK is the most appropriate country for their resettlement . The Ten or More Plan , established by UNHCR in 1973 and administered in the UK by the British Red Cross , is for refugees requiring medical attention not available in their current location . During the 1990s , 2 @,@ 620 refugees were settled in the UK through these two programmes . In 2003 , the UK 's Ten or More Plan had a resettlement goal of 10 people and the Mandate Refugee Scheme 300 . Refugees have also been resettled through specific programmes following emergencies . For example , 42 @,@ 000 Ugandan Asians expelled from Uganda during 1972 – 74 , 22 @,@ 500 Vietnamese during 1979 – 92 , over 2 @,@ 500 Bosnians in the 1990s , and over 4 @,@ 000 Kosovars in 1999 . 
 A new resettlement programme was proposed by the British Home Secretary , David Blunkett in October 2001 , having been hinted at by the previous Home Secretary , Jack Straw , in a speech to the European Conference on Asylum in Lisbon in June 2000 . The legal basis for the programme 's funding was established by Section 59 of the Nationality , Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 . This act was passed by the House of Commons by 362 votes to 74 in June 2002 and by the House of Lords – at the ninth attempt , following concern about the introduction of measures allowing for the detention of asylum seekers in rural areas ) – in November 2002 . 
 The Gateway Protection Programme was subsequently established in March 2004 , with the first refugees arriving in the UK on 19 March . Initially , the programme quota was set at 500 per year . The British government has faced criticism from academics and practitioners over the small number of refugees it has resettled in comparison with other developed states . For example , in 2001 the countries with the largest quota schemes were the United States ( 80 @,@ 000 refugees ) , Canada ( 11 @,@ 000 ) and Australia ( 10 @,@ 000 ) . Initially , David Blunkett had intended to raise the quota to 1 @,@ 000 in the second year of the programme 's operation , but local councils ' reluctance to participate in the scheme meant that it was slow to take off . It has been argued that their reluctance showed that hostile attitudes towards asylum seekers had carried over to affect the most genuinely needy refugees . The quota remained at 500 per year until the 2008 / 09 financial year , when it was increased to 750 refugees per year . The number of refugees resettled under the scheme is small in comparison to the number of asylum seekers offered protection in the UK . For example , in 2013 , 17 @,@ 647 initial decisions on asylum claims were made by the Home Office , of which 5 @,@ 734 ( 32 @.@ 5 per cent ) determined the applicant to be a refugee and granted them asylum , 53 ( 0 @.@ 3 per cent ) granted humanitarian protection and 540 ( 3 @.@ 1 per cent ) granted discretionary leave . 11 @,@ 105 applications ( 62 @.@ 9 per cent ) were refused . Worldwide , there were 51 @.@ 2 million forcibly displaced people at the end of 2013 , 16 @.@ 7 million of whom were refugees . 
 The programme has been supported by the main British political parties at the national level since its inception , and there has also been support from councillors from each of the main parties at the local authority level . On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the scheme in 2014 , refugee groups and others praised it as a successful programme and called for it to be expanded , particularly in light of the Syrian refugee crisis . In early 2014 , Amnesty International and the Refugee Council campaigned for the government to offer resettlement or humanitarian protection to Syrian refugees above and beyond the Gateway quota of 750 per year , " to ensure that resettlement opportunities continue to be available to refugees from the rest of the world " . The anniversary of the programme was also the occasion of further criticism of the 750 quota , with some commentators arguing that this is mean @-@ spirited and continues to compare unfavourably with the refugee resettlement programmes of states including the United States , Canada and Australia . Others , such as academic Jonathan Darling , have been more skeptical about expanding the scheme , for fear that any such move will be accompanied by greater restrictions on the ability of people to claim asylum in the UK . He argues that " we must be critical of any attempts to expand such a quota @-@ based scheme at the expense of a more progressive asylum system " . Furthermore , he argues that the " hospitality " of the scheme is highly conditional and can be viewed as a form of " compassionate repression " , with the UNHCR , the Home Office and local authorities all involved in " sorting , decision , and consideration over which individuals are the ' exceptional cases ' " , to the exclusion of others . 
 In September 2015 , in the context of the European migrant crisis , Labour Party leadership candidate Yvette Cooper called for an increase in the number of refugees resettled in the UK to 10 @,@ 000 . The prime minister , David Cameron , subsequently announced that the UK would resettle 20 @,@ 000 refugees from camps in countries bordering Syria over the period to 2020 under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme , which was established in early 2014 and is distinct from , but modelled on , the Gateway Protection Programme . 
 = = Refugees resettled = = 
 The number of refugees resettled under the programme has been below the quota in every year except for 2009 , 2012 and 2013 . Refugees resettled have included Liberians from Guinea and Sierra Leone , Congolese ( DRC ) from Uganda and Zambia , Sudanese from Uganda , Burmese ( including Karen , Mon , Pa <unk> and Rohingya people ) from Thailand , Ethiopians from Kenya , and Mauritanians from Senegal . Provision was made for 1 @,@ 000 Iraqi refugees to be resettled in the UK between 1 April 2008 and the end of March 2010 . In 2008 , 236 Iraqis were resettled and as of 18 May , a further 212 had been resettled in 2009 . However , in May 2009 the programme was shut down for those Iraqis resettling due to having worked in support of British occupying forces and therefore at risk for reprisals . This decision was criticised as premature and " mean @-@ spirited " by some members of Parliament . Nonetheless , other Iraqis continue to be resettled under the Gateway Protection Programme and between 2004 and 2014 , a total of 1 @,@ 344 Iraqis were resettled as part of the programme . Other nationalities of refugees resettled under the scheme include Bhutanese , <unk> , Palestinians , Sierra <unk> and Somalis . 
 = = Resettlement locations = = 
 In March 2009 , out of the 434 local authorities in the UK , 15 were participating in the programme . By 2012 , a total of 18 local authorities had participated . In a review of the scheme , academics Duncan Sim and <unk> Laughlin note that " it is clear that , as with asylum seekers dispersed by the UK Borders Agency under Home Office dispersal policy , most refugees have been resettled away from London and south east England , a policy which may lead to separation of extended families " . Of the 18 local authorities , eight are in North West England and three in Yorkshire and Humberside . 
 The first refugees resettled under the programme were housed in Sheffield , which was the first city to join the scheme and which had branded itself the UK 's first ' City of Sanctuary ' . Others have been housed in cities and towns including Bradford , Brighton and Hove , Bromley , Colchester , Hull , Middlesbrough , Motherwell , Norwich , and the Manchester area including Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Salford , Stockport and Tameside . Sheffield , Bolton and Hull have received the largest numbers , accounting for just under half of all refugees resettled under the programme between 2004 and 2012 . The large proportion of refugees who have been resettled in North West England has been attributed partly to strong leadership on migration issues in Greater Manchester . 
 In 2007 , North Lanarkshire Council won the " Creating Integrated Communities " category in the UK Housing Awards for its involvement in the Gateway Protection Programme . Research with Congolese refugees settled with North Lanarkshire Council in Motherwell has found that the majority want to stay in the town and that they view it positively both as a location in its own right , and in comparison with other resettlement locations . 
 In April 2007 , Bolton Museum held an exhibition of photos of Sudanese refugees resettled in the town under the programme . A film , titled Moving to Mars was made about two ethnic Karen families resettled from Burma to Sheffield under the Gateway Protection Programme . The film opened the Sheffield International Documentary Festival in November 2009 and was aired on the television channel More4 on 2 February 2010 . One ethnic Karen refugee resettled with his family in Sheffield in 2006 , <unk> <unk> , signed a professional contract to play football for Sheffield United F.C. in March 2015 . 
 On 17 July 2009 , three Congolese men resettled in Norwich under the programme were killed in a car crash on the A1 road . The Home Office released a promotional video in October 2009 that highlighted the success of the programme in resettling the first 15 Congolese families in Norwich in 2006 . In 2011 , the Home Office stopped using Norwich as a resettlement location in favour of locations in Yorkshire and Lancashire , reportedly to the disappointment of the local council .

 Resettlement has been presented as a means of the UK fulfilling its obligations towards displaced people in the context of hostile public attitudes towards asylum seekers . Research has shown that members of the British public are generally well disposed to providing protection to genuine refugees , but are sceptical about the validity of asylum seekers ' claims . A report published in 2005 states that " some participating agencies have been reluctant to pursue a proactive media strategy due to local political considerations and issues relating to the dispersal of asylum seekers " . However , in February 2006 , the Parliamentary Under @-@ Secretary of State for the Home Department Andy Burnham , when asked about how the programme fitted in with community cohesion strategies , stated in the House of Commons that : 
 " The early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in the programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of the attacks on the notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years . In Bolton and Sheffield in particular , the towns have rallied around the individuals who have come to them . The programme has been a positive experience for the receiving community and , of course , for the vulnerable individuals who have benefited from the protection that those towns have offered " . 
 A report into the experience of refugees resettled in Brighton and Hove under the scheme between October 2006 and October 2007 was published by the Sussex Centre for Migration Research at the University of Sussex in December 2007 . The report found that the refugees had struggled to gain employment and English language skills . Another evaluation report undertaken for the Home Office and published in 2011 also found that only small numbers of resettled refugees were in paid employment , noting that many were still more concerned about meeting their basic needs . 
 In February 2009 , the Home Office published a report evaluating the effectiveness of the Gateway Protection Programme . The research it was based upon focused on refugees ' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement . The research found that refugees showed signs of integration , including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship . The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns . Younger refugees and children had made the most progress . No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme . Instead , Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages ( ESOL ) courses , which are run by a range of state , voluntary and community @-@ based organisations . However , the International Catholic Migration Commission ( <unk> ) Europe reports that in Sheffield , it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme 's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013 . The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment , but that many of them were not in jobs that allowed them to use their skills . The majority of women were not in work , reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision . 
 A number of programme evaluations have found that many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK . The Home Office 's 2009 evaluation notes that between one @-@ quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment . An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one @-@ fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation ( who had been in the UK for a year ) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK , and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement . Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities , and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers , who generally suggested that community relations were good . Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation . 
 = Third Anglo @-@ Maratha War = 
 The Third Anglo @-@ Maratha War ( 1817 – 1818 ) was the final and decisive conflict between the British East India Company ( EIC ) and the Maratha Empire in India . The war left the Company in control of most of India . It began with an invasion of the Maratha territory by British East India Company troops , the largest such British controlled force massed in India . The troops were led by the Governor General Hastings ( no relation to Warren Hastings , the first Governor @-@ General of Bengal ) supported by a force under General Thomas Hislop . Operations began against the Pindaris , a band of Muslims and Marathas from central India . 
 Peshwa Baji Rao II 's forces , supported by those of <unk> II Bhonsle of Nagpur and <unk> Holkar III of Indore , rose against the EIC . Pressure and diplomacy convinced the fourth major Maratha leader , <unk> Shinde of Gwalior , to remain neutral even though he lost control of Rajasthan . 
 British victories were swift , resulting in the breakup of the Maratha Empire and the loss of Maratha independence . The Peshwa was defeated in the battles of Khadki and Koregaon . Several minor battles were fought by the Peshwa 's forces to prevent his capture . 
 The Peshwa was eventually captured and placed on a small estate at Bithur , near Kanpur . Most of his territory was annexed and became part of the Bombay Presidency . The Maharaja of Satara was restored as the ruler of his territory as a princely state . In 1848 this territory was also annexed by the Bombay Presidency under the doctrine of lapse policy of Lord Dalhousie . Bhonsle was defeated in the battle of <unk> and Holkar in the battle of Mahidpur . The northern portion of Bhonsle 's dominions in and around Nagpur , together with the Peshwa 's territories in Bundelkhand , were annexed by British India as the <unk> and <unk> Territories . The defeat of the Bhonsle and Holkar also resulted in the acquisition of the Maratha kingdoms of Nagpur and Indore by the British . Along with Gwalior from Shinde and Jhansi from the Peshwa , all of these territories became princely states acknowledging British control . The British proficiency in Indian war @-@ making was demonstrated through their rapid victories in Khadki , <unk> , Mahidpur , Koregaon , and Satara . 
 = = The Marathas and the British = = 
 The Maratha Empire was founded in 1645 by Shivaji of the Bhosle dynasty . Common elements among the citizens of Shivaji 's Maratha Empire were the Marathi language , the Hindu religion , a strong sense of belonging , and a national feeling . Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the Hindus from the Muslim Sultanate of Bijapur and once again established rule of the native Indian Hindus . This kingdom was known as the <unk> Swarajya ( " Hindu self @-@ rule " ) in the Marathi language . Shivaji 's capital was located at Raigad . Shivaji successfully defended his kingdom from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India . A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers , called the Ashta Pradhan ( council of eight ) . The senior @-@ most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the Peshwa or the Mukhya Pradhan ( prime minister ) . The Peshwa was the right @-@ hand man of Shivaji . 
 Shivaji and most of the Maratha warriors belonged to the Maratha caste of the four @-@ tier Hindu caste system , whereas all of the Peshwas belonged to the Brahmin caste . After Shivaji 's death , the Peshwas gradually became the effective rulers of the state . 
 = = = Growing British power = = = 
 While the Marathas were fighting the Mughals in the early 18th century , the British held small trading posts in Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . The British fortified the naval base of Bombay after they saw the Marathas defeat the Portuguese at neighbouring Vasai in May 1739 . In an effort to keep the Marathas out of Bombay , the British sent envoys to negotiate a treaty . The envoys were successful , and a treaty was signed on 12 July 1739 that gave the British East India Company rights to free trade in Maratha territory . In the south , the Nizam of Hyderabad had enlisted the support of the French for his war against the Marathas . In reaction to this , the Peshwa requested support from the British , but was refused . Unable to see the rising power of the British , the Peshwa set a precedent by seeking their help to solve internal Maratha conflicts . Despite the lack of support , the Marathas managed to defeat the Nizam over a period of five years . 
 During the period 1750 – 1761 , British defeated the French East India company in India , and by 1793 they were firmly established in Bengal in the east and Madras in the south . They were unable to expand to the west as the Marathas were dominant there , but they entered Surat on the west coast via the sea . 
 The Marathas marched beyond the Indus as their empire grew . The responsibility for managing the sprawling Maratha empire in the north was entrusted to two Maratha leaders , Shinde and Holkar , as the Peshwa was busy in the south . The two leaders did not act in concert , and their polices were influenced by personal interests and financial demands . They alienated other Hindu rulers such as the Rajputs , the Jats , and the Rohillas , and they failed to diplomatically win over other Muslim leaders . A large blow to the Marathas came in their defeat on 14 January 1761 at Panipat against the Afghan Ahmad Shah Abdali . An entire generation of Maratha leaders lay dead on the battlefield as a result of that conflict . Between 1761 and 1773 , the Marathas regained the lost ground in the north . 
 = = = Anglo @-@ Maratha relations = = = 
 The Maratha gains in the north were undone because of the contradictory policies of Holkar and Shinde and the internal disputes in the family of the Peshwa , which culminated in the murder of <unk> Peshwa in 1773 . Due to this , the Marathas virtually disappeared from north India . Raghunathrao was ousted from the seat of Peshwa due to continuing internal Maratha rivalries . He sought help from the British , and they signed the Treaty of Surat with him in March 1775 . This treaty gave him military assistance in exchange for control of Salsette Island and Bassein Fort . 
 The treaty set off discussions amongst the British in India as well as in Europe because of the serious implications of a confrontation with the powerful Marathas . Another cause for concern was that the Bombay Council had exceeded its constitutional authority by signing such a treaty . The treaty was the cause of the start of the First Anglo @-@ Maratha War . This war was virtually a stalemate , with no side being able to defeat the other . The war concluded with the treaty of <unk> in May 1782 , mediated by <unk> Shinde . The foresight of Warren Hastings was the main reason for the success of the British in the war . He had destroyed the anti @-@ British coalition and created a division between the Shinde , the Bhonsle , and the Peshwa . 
 The Marathas were still in a very strong position when the new Governor General of British controlled territories Cornwallis arrived in India in 1786 . After the treaty of <unk> , the British followed a policy of coexistence in the north . The British and the Marathas enjoyed more than two decades of peace , thanks to the diplomacy of Nana <unk> , the Brahmin minister in the court of the 11 @-@ year @-@ old Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao . The situation changed soon after Nana 's death in 1800 . The power struggle between Holkar and Shinde caused Holkar to attack the Peshwa in Pune in 1801 , since the Peshwa sided with Shinde . The Peshwa Baji Rao II fled Pune to safety on a British warship . Baji Rao feared loss of his own powers and signed the treaty of Bassein . This made the Peshwa in effect a subsidiary ally of the British . 
 In response to the treaty , the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked the British , refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to the British by the Peshwa . This was the start of the Second Anglo @-@ Maratha War in 1803 . Both were defeated by the British , and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to the British .

 The British had travelled thousands of miles to arrive in India . They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages to deal with the Indians . They were technologically advanced , with superior equipment to that available locally . Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted , they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks . After the First Anglo @-@ Maratha war , Warren Hastings declared in 1783 that the peace established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it was not going to be shaken for years to come . 
 The British believed that a new permanent approach was needed to establish and maintain continuous contact with the Peshwa 's court in Pune . The British appointed Charles Malet , a senior merchant from Bombay , to be a permanent Resident at Pune because of his knowledge of the languages and customs of the region .

The Maratha Empire lacked an efficient spy system , and they were poor students of diplomacy . Maratha artillery was outdated , and they did not manufacture their own guns . Weapons were imported and the supply often failed . Foreign officers were responsible for the handling of the imported guns ; the Marathas never trained their own men in any considerable numbers for the purpose . Military movements were made without knowledge of local geography ; when moving troops or retreating , they would suddenly come across a river and be trapped when they were unable to locate boats or a crossing . The enemy would take advantage of this to gain the best position , and the Marathas would lose the battle or would be overtaken and slaughtered while fleeing . 
 At the time of the war , the power of the British East India Company was on the rise , whereas the Maratha Empire was on the decline . The British had been victorious in the previous Anglo @-@ Maratha war . The Peshwa of the Maratha Empire at this time was Baji Rao II . Several Maratha leaders who had formerly sided with the Peshwa were now under British control or protection . The British had an arrangement with the Gaekwad dynasty of the Maratha province of Baroda to prevent the Peshwa from collecting revenue in that province . Gaekwad sent an envoy to the Peshwa in Pune to negotiate a dispute regarding revenue collection . The envoy , Gangadhar Shastri , was under British protection . He was murdered , and the Peshwa 's minister <unk> Dengle was suspected of the crime . 
 The British seized the opportunity to force Baji Rao into a treaty . The treaty ( The Treaty of Pune ) was signed on 13 June 1817 . Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle 's guilt , renouncing claims on Gaekwad , and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British . These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan , the seaboard of Konkan , and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers . The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India . The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry . 
 = = = Maratha planning = = = 
 The Peshwa disbanded his cavalry , but secretly asked them to stand by , and offered them seven months ' advance pay . Baji Rao entrusted Bapu Gokhale with preparations for war . In August 1817 , the forts at Sinhagad , Raigad , and Purandar were fortified by the Peshwa . Gokhale secretly recruited troops for the impending war . Many <unk> and <unk> were hired . Efforts were made to unify Bhonsle , Shinde , and Holkar ; even the mercenary Pindaris were approached . The Peshwa identified unhappy Indians in the service of the British Resident Elphinstone and secretly recruited them . One such person was Jaswant Rao <unk> . Efforts were made to secretly recruit Europeans as well . Some Indians , such as Balaji Pant Natu , stood steadfastly with the British . Several of the Indian sepoys rejected the Peshwa 's offers , and others reported the matter to their superior officers . On 19 October 1817 , Baji Rao II celebrated the <unk> festival in Pune , where troops were assembled in large numbers . During the celebrations , a large flank of the Maratha cavalry pretended they were charging towards the British sepoys but wheeled off at the last minute . This display was intended as a slight towards Elphinstone and as a scare tactic to prompt the defection and recruitment of British sepoys to the Peshwa 's side . The Peshwa made plans to kill Elphinstone , despite opposition from Gokhale . Elphinstone was fully aware of these developments thanks to the espionage work of Balaji Pant Natu and <unk> . 
 Burton provides an estimate of the strength of various Maratha powers in or around 1817 : He estimated the various Maratha powers totals to 81 @,@ 000 infantry , 106 @,@ 000 horse or cavalry and 589 guns . Of these the Peshwa had the highest number of cavalry at 28 @,@ 000 , along with 14 @,@ 000 infantry and 37 guns . The Peshwa headquarters was in Pune , which was the southernmost location amongst the other Maratha powers . Holkar had the second largest cavalry , amounting to 20 @,@ 000 , and an infantry force of 8 @,@ 000 . His guns totaled to 107 guns . Shinde and Bhonsle had similar numbers of cavalry and infantry , with each having 15 @,@ 000 and 16 @,@ 000 cavalry , respectively . Shinde had 16 @,@ 000 infantry and Bhonsle , 18 @,@ 000 . Shinde had the larger share of guns amounting to 140 whereas Bhonsle had 85 . Holkar , Shinde and Bhonsle were headquartered in Indore , Gwalior and Nagpur respectively . The Afghan leader Amir Khan was located in Tonk in Rajputana and his strength was 12 @,@ 000 cavalry , 10 @,@ 000 infantry and 200 guns . The Pindaris were located north of the Narmada valley in Chambal and Malwa region of central India . Three Pindari leaders sided with Shinde , these were Setu , Karim Khan and Dost Mohammad . They were mostly horsemen with strengths of 10 @,@ 000 , 6 @,@ 000 and 4 @,@ 000 . The rest of the Pindari chiefs , Tulsi , Imam Baksh , Sahib Khan , Kadir Baksh , Nathu and Bapu were allied with Holkar . Tulsi and Imam Baksh each had 2 @,@ 000 horsemen , Kadir Baksh , 21 @,@ 500 . Sahib Khan , Nathu and Bapu had 1 @,@ 000 , 750 and 150 horsemen .

 The Peshwa 's territory was in an area called the Desha , now part of the modern state of Maharashtra . The region consists of the valleys of the Krishna and Godavari rivers and the plateaus of the Sahyadri Mountains . Shinde 's territory around Gwalior and Bundelkhand was a region of rolling hills and fertile valleys that slopes down toward the Indo @-@ Gangetic Plain to the north . The Pindari territory was the valleys and forests of the Chambal , the north western region of the modern state of Madhya Pradesh . It was a mountainous region with a harsh climate . The Pindaris also operated from Malwa , a plateau region in the north west of the state of Madhya Pradesh , north of the Vindhya Range . Holkar was based in the upper Narmada River valley . 
 The war was mostly a mopping @-@ up operation intended to complete the expansion of the earlier Anglo @-@ Maratha war , which was stopped due to economic concerns of the British . The war began as a campaign against the Pindaris . Seeing that the British were in conflict with the Pindaris , the Peshwa 's forces attacked the British at 16 : 00 on 5 November 1817 with the Maratha left attacking the British right . The Maratha forces comprised 20 @,@ 000 cavalry , 8 @,@ 000 infantry , and 20 guns whereas the British had 2 @,@ 000 cavalry , 1 @,@ 000 infantry , and eight guns . On the Maratha side , an additional 5 @,@ 000 horse and 1 @,@ 000 infantry were guarding the Peshwa at Parvati Hill . The British numbers include Captain Ford 's unit , which was en route from <unk> to Khadki . The British had also asked General Smith to come to Khadki for the battle but they did not anticipate he would arrive in time . 
 Three hills in the region were the Parvati Hill , the <unk> Hill , and the Khadki hill . The Peshwa watched the battle from the Parvati Hill whereas the British East India Company troops were based on the Khadki hill . The two hills are separated by a distance of four kilometres . The river Mula is shallow and narrow and could be crossed at several locations . A few canals ( <unk> in Marathi ) joined the river and though these were not obstacles , some of them were obscured due to the vegetation in the area . 
 The Maratha army was a mix of Rohillas , Rajputs , and Marathas . It also included a small force of the Portuguese under their officer , de Pinto . The left flank of the Maratha army , commanded by Moropant Dixit and <unk> , was stationed on the flat ground on which the University of Pune stands today . The centre was commanded by Bapu Gokhale and the right was under <unk> . British troop movements began on 1 November 1817 when Colonel Burr moved his forces towards what is now Bund Garden via the Holkar Bridge . The Maratha were successful initially in creating and exploiting a gap in the British left and centre . These successes were nullified by the Maratha horses being thrown into disarray by a hidden canal and the temporary loss of command by Gokhale , whose horse was shot . The Marathas were rendered leaderless when Moropant Dixit on the right was shot dead . The British infantry advanced steadily , firing volley after volley , causing the Maratha cavalry to retreat in a matter of four hours . The British soon claimed victory . The British lost 86 men and the Maratha about 500 . 
 = = = The Pindaris = = = 
 After the second Anglo @-@ Maratha war , Shinde and Holkar had lost many of their territories to the British . They encouraged the Pindaris to raid the British territories . The Pindaris , who were mostly cavalry , came to be known as the <unk> and the <unk> after the patronage they received from the respective defeated Maratha leaders . The Pindari leaders were Setu , Karim Khan , Dost Mohammad , Tulsi , Imam Baksh , Sahib Khan , Kadir Baksh , Nathu , and Bapu . Of these , Setu , Karim Khan , and Dost Mohammad belonged to <unk> and the rest to <unk> . The total strength of the Pindaris in 1814 was estimated at 33 @,@ 000 . The Pindaris frequently raided villages in Central India . The result of the Pindari raids was that Central India was being rapidly reduced to the condition of a desert because the peasants were unable to support themselves on the land . They had no option but to join the robber bands or starve . In 1815 , 25 @,@ 000 Pindaris entered the Madras Presidency and destroyed over 300 villages on the Coromandel coast . Another band swept the Nizam 's kingdom while a third entered Malabar . Other Pindari raids on British territory followed in 1816 and 1817 . Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings saw that there could not be peace or security in India until the predatory Pindaris were extinguished . 
 = = = British planning = = = 
 To lead an army against the Pindaris in the hope of engaging them in a regular battle was not possible . To effectively crush the Pindaris , they would have to be surrounded so that they could have no means of escape . Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings obtained authority from the British government to take action against the Pindaris while performing diplomacy with the principal Maratha leaders to act in concert with him . The Pindaris continued to have the sympathy of almost all the Maratha leaders . In 1817 Rawdon @-@ Hastings collected the strongest British army which had yet been seen in India , numbering roughly 120 @,@ 000 men . The army was assembled from two smaller armies , the Grand Army or Bengal army in the north under his personal command , and the Army of the Deccan under General Hislop in the south . The British plan was to normalize relations with the Shinde , Holkar , and Amir Khan . The three were known to be well disposed towards the Pindaris and harboured them in their territories . Shinde was secretly planning with the Peshwa and the Nepal Ministry to form a coalition against the British . His correspondence with Nepal was intercepted and presented to him in Durbar . He was forced to enter into a treaty by which he pledged to assist the British against the Pindaris and to prevent any new gangs being formed in his territory . Diplomacy , pressure , and the treaty of Gwalior kept Shinde out of the war . Amir Khan disbanded his army on condition of being guaranteed the possession of the principality of Tonk in Rajputana . He sold his guns to the British and agreed to prevent predatory gangs from operating from his territory . The army for the war was composed of two armies , the Grand Army or the Bengal Army with a strength of 40 @,@ 000 troops and the Army of the Deccan with a strength of 70 @,@ 400 . The Grand Army was divided into three divisions and a reserve . The left division was led by Major General Marshall and the central division was under Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings . The reserve was under General Ochterlony . The second army , the Army of the Deccan was composed of five divisions . The divisions were led by General Hislop , Brigadier General Doveton , General Malcolm , Brigadier General Smith , Lieutenant Colonel Adams . The Army of Deccan comprised 70 @,@ 400 troops , bringing the total strength of the entire composite British East India Company army to 110 @,@ 400 . In addition the Madras and Pune residencies each had two battalions and a detail of an artillery unit . The Madras residency had an additional three troops of the 6th Bengal Cavalry . In October and early November , the first division of the Grand Army was sent to Sind , the second to Chambal , the third to Eastern Narmada . The reserve division was used to pressurise Amir Khan . The effect of the dispatching of the first and second divisions was to cut off Shinde from his potential allies . He and Amir Khan were thus pressured into signing a treaty . 
 The first and third division of the army of the Deccan were concentrated at <unk> to hold the fords of the Narmada . The second division was used placed at <unk> to keep a watch on the Berar Ghats . The fourth division marched to <unk> occupying the region between Pune and Amravati ( Berar ) administrative divisions whereas the fifth division was placed at <unk> and the reserve division was placed between the Bhima and Krishna rivers . 
 = = = Attack on the Pindaris = = = 
 The attack on the Pindaris was carried out as planned . The Pindaris were attacked , and their homes were surrounded and destroyed . General Hislop from the Madras Residency attacked the Pindaris from the south and drove them beyond the Narmada river , where governor general Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings was waiting with his army . Karim Khan surrendered to the British and was given lands in Gorakhpur . The principal routes from Central India were occupied by British detachments . The Pindari forces were completely broken up , scattered in the course of a single campaign . They made no stand against the regular troops , and even in small bands they were unable to escape the ring of forces drawn around them . The Pindaris rapidly dispersed over the country . The Pindari chiefs were reduced to the condition of hunted outlaws . The desperate Pindaris expected the Marathas to help them , but none dared to give them even a place of shelter for their families . Karim and Setu had still 23 @,@ 000 men between them but such a force was no match for the armies that surrounded them . In whatever direction they turned they were met by British forces . Defeat followed defeat . One gang made their escape to the south , leaving all their baggage behind them . Many fled to the jungles and perished . Others sought refuge in the villages , but were killed without mercy by the villagers who had not forgotten the sufferings they had been inflicted upon by the Pindaris . The Pindari chiefs Karim Khan and <unk> Mohammed had been present with their <unk> at the battle of Mahidpur . Since by this time the Maratha powers had been reduced significantly , the pursuit of Setu and the other leaders was resumed with vigor . All the leaders had surrendered before the end of February and the Pindari system and power was brought to a close . They were removed to <unk> where they obtained grants of land for their subsistence . Karim Khan became a farmer on the small estate he received beyond the Ganges in <unk> . <unk> Mohammed attempted to escape . He was found and committed suicide by taking poison . Setu , a Jat by caste , was hunted by John Malcolm from place to place until he had no followers left . He vanished into the jungles of Central India in 1819 and was killed by a tiger . 
 = = = Flight of the Peshwa = = = 
 On the orders of Elphinstone , General Smith arrived in Yerwada near Pune on 13 November at the site of the present Deccan College . Smith and his troops crossed the river on 15 November and took up positions at <unk> . On the morning of 16 November , the Marathas were engaged in a battle with the British . While the Maratha generals such as Purandare , <unk> , and Bapu Gokhale were ready to advance on to the British forces , they were demoralized after learning that the Peshwa and his brother had fled to Purandar . A force of 5 @,@ 000 additional Marathas was located at the confluence of two rivers — the Mula and the <unk> — under the leadership of <unk> , but they remained idle . Bapu Gokhale retreated to guard the Peshwa in flight . The next morning , General Smith advanced towards the city of Pune and found that the Peshwa had fled towards the city of Satara . During the day Pune surrendered , and great care was taken by General Smith for the protection of the peaceful part of the community . Order was soon re @-@ established . The British forces entered <unk> Wada on 17 November and the Union flag was hoisted by Balaji Pant Natu . However the saffron flags of the Peshwa were not removed from Kotwali <unk> until the defeat of Baji Rao at Ashti ; it might seem that the British still believed that the war was not raised by Baji Rao but he was forced to do so under pressure from Bapu Gokhle , <unk> Dengle and <unk> Dikshit . 
 The Peshwa now fled to the town of Koregaon . The Battle of Koregaon took place on 1 January 1818 on the banks of the river Bhima , north west of Pune . General <unk> arrived near Koregaon along with 500 infantry , two six @-@ pounder guns , and 200 irregular horsemen . Only 24 of the infantry were of European origin ; they were from the Madras Artillery . The rest of the infantry was composed of Indians employed by the British . The village of Koregaon was on the north bank of the river , which was shallow and narrow at this time of year . The village had a fortified enclosure constructed in the standard Maratha fashion . <unk> occupied the village but was unable to take the fortified enclosure , which was occupied by the Marathas . The British were cut off from the river , their only source of water . A fierce battle ensued that lasted the entire day . Streets and guns were captured and recaptured , changing hands several times . Baji Rao 's commander <unk> killed Lt. <unk> thereby avenging the death of <unk> Gokhle , the only son of Bapu Gokhle . The Peshwa watched the battle from atop a nearby hill about two miles away . The Marathas evacuated the village and retreated during the night . This move on the part of the Marathas may seem justifiable because they were employing the tactics of <unk> Kawa rather than <unk> <unk> . The British lost 175 men and about a third of the irregular horse , with more than half of the European officers wounded . The Marathas lost 500 to 600 men . When the British found the village evacuated in the morning , Staunton took his battered troops and pretended to march on to Pune , but actually went to <unk> . 
 After the battle the British forces under general <unk> pursued the Peshwa , who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara . The Peshwa continued his flight southward throughout the month of January . Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore , the Peshwa doubled back and passed General <unk> to head towards Solapur . Until 29 January the pursuit of the Peshwa had not been productive . Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British , Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots . Some skirmishes took place , and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery . There was , however , no advantageous result to either party . On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas . He symbolically raised the British flag . The next day , the <unk> Zenda — the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas — was raised in its place . To gain the support of the population , the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion . They announced that all <unk> , <unk> , pensions , and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao . During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur . 
 On 19 February , General Smith got word that the Peshwa was headed for Pandharpur . General Smith 's troops attacked the Peshwa at Ashti en route . During this battle , Gokhale died while defending the Peshwa from the British . The Raja of Satara was captured along with his brother and mother . The Maratha king , first imprisoned by Tarabai in the 1750s had lost power much earlier but was reinstated by Madhav <unk> Peshwa in 1763 after Tarabai 's death . Since then the king had retained a titular position of appointing the Peshwas . The Emperor Alamgir II in his <unk> to the Peshwa had complimented them for looking after the Chhatrapati family . The Chhatrapati declared in favour of the British and this ended the Peshwa 's legal position as head of the Maratha confederacy , this was done by a jahirnama which stated Peshwas were no longer the head of the Maratha confederacy . However Baji Rao II challenged the jahirnama of removing him from his position as Peshwa by issuing another jahirnama removing Mountstuart Elphinstone as British Resident to his state . The death of Gokhale and the skirmish at Ashti hastened the end of the war . Soon after this Baji Rao was deserted by the <unk> . 
 By 10 April 1818 , General Smith 's forces had taken the forts of Sinhagad and Purandar . Mountstuart Elphinstone mentions the capture of <unk> in his diary entry for 13 February 1818 : " The garrison contained no Marathas , but consisted of 100 Arabs , 600 <unk> , and 400 Konkani . The <unk> was a boy of eleven ; the real Governor , <unk> Punt <unk> , a mean @-@ looking <unk> . The garrison was treated with great liberality ; and , though there was much property and money in the place , the <unk> was allowed to have whatever he claimed as his own . " On 3 June 1818 Baji Rao surrendered to the British and negotiated the sum of ₹ eight lakhs as annual maintenance . Baji Rao obtained promises from the British in favor of the <unk> , his family , the Brahmins , and religious institutions . The Peshwa was sent to Bithur near Kanpur . While the downfall and banishment of the Peshwa was mourned all over the Maratha Empire as a national defeat , the Peshwa seemed unaffected . He contracted more marriages and spent his long life engaged in religious performances and excessive drinking . 
 = = = Events in Nagpur = = = 
 <unk> Bhonsle , also known as Appa Saheb , consolidated his power in Nagpur after the murder of his cousin , the imbecile ruler <unk> Bhonsle . He entered into a treaty with the British on 27 May 1816 . He ignored the request of the British Resident Jenkins to refrain from contact with Baji Rao II . Jenkins asked Appa Saheb to disband his growing concentration of troops and come to the residency , which he also refused to do . Appa Saheb openly declared support for the Peshwa , who was already fighting the British near Pune . As it was now clear that a battle was in the offing , Jenkins asked for reinforcements from nearby British East India Company troops . He already had about 1 @,@ 500 men under Lieutenant @-@ Colonel <unk> Scott . Jenkins sent word for Colonel Adams to march to Nagpur with his troops . Like other Maratha leaders , Appa <unk> employed Arabs in his army . They were typically involved in holding fortresses . While they were known to be among the bravest of troops , they were not amenable to discipline and order . The total strength of the Marathas was about 18 @,@ 000 . 
 The Residency was to the west of the <unk> hill , a 300 @-@ yard ( 270 m ) hillock running north @-@ south . The British East India Company troops occupied the north end of the hillock . The Marathas , fighting with the Arabs , made good initial gains by charging up the hill and forcing the British to retreat to the south . British commanders began arriving with reinforcements : Lieutenant Colonel <unk> on 29 November , Major Pittman on 5 December , and Colonel Doveton on 12 December . The British counterattack was severe and Appa Saheb was forced to surrender . The British lost 300 men , of which 24 were Europeans ; the Marathas lost an equal number . A treaty was signed on 9 January 1818 . Appa Saheb was allowed to rule over nominal territories with several restrictions . Most of his territory , including the forts , was now controlled by the British . They built additional fortifications on <unk> hill . 
 A few days later Appa Saheb was arrested . He was being escorted to Allahabad when he escaped to Punjab to seek refuge with the Sikhs . They turned him down and he was captured once again by the British near Jodhpur . Raja Mansingh of Jodhpur stood surety for him and he remained in Jodhpur , where he died on 15 July 1849 at 44 years of age . 
 = = = Subjugation of Holkar = = = 
 Holkar was offered terms similar to those offered to Shinde ; the only difference was that Holkar accepted and respected the independence of Amir Khan . The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent . When <unk> Jog , an official of the Holkar , urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British . In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware of the power of the British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past . Holkar responded to the Peshwa 's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur . 
 The battle of Mahidpur between Holkar and the British was fought on 21 December 1817 . The charge on the British side was led by Malcolm himself . A deadly battle ensued lasting from midday until 3 : 00 am . Lieutenant General Thomas Hislop was commander in chief of the Madras army . Hislop came in sight of the Holkar army about 9 : 00 am . The British East India Company 's army lost 800 men but Holkar 's force was destroyed . The British East India Company 's losses were 800 killed or wounded but Holkar 's loss was much larger with about 3 @,@ 000 killed or wounded . These losses meant Holkar was deprived of any means of rising in arms against the British , and this broke the power of the Holkar dynasty . The battle of Mahidpur proved disastrous for the Maratha fortunes . Henry Durand wrote , " After the battle of Mahidpur not only the Peshwa 's but the real influence of the Mahratta States of Holkar and Shinde were dissolved and replaced by British supremacy . " Although the power of the Holkar family was broken , the remaining troops remained hostile and a division was retained to disperse them . The ministers made overtures of peace , and on 6 January 1818 the Treaty of <unk> was signed ; Holkar accepted the British terms in totality . Holkar came under British authority as an independent prince subject to the advice of a British Resident . 
 = = End of the war and its effects = = 
 At the end of the war , all of the Maratha powers had surrendered to the British . Shinde and the Afghan Amir Khan were subdued by the use of diplomacy and pressure , which resulted in the Treaty of <unk> on 5 November 1817 . Under this treaty , Shinde surrendered Rajasthan to the British and agreed to help them fight the Pindaris . Amir Khan agreed to sell his guns to the British and received a land grant at Tonk in <unk> . Holkar was defeated on 21 December 1817 and signed the Treaty of <unk> on 6 January 1818 . Under this treaty the Holkar state became subsidiary to the British . The young Malhar Rao was raised to the throne . Bhonsle was defeated on 26 November 1817 and was captured but he escaped to live out his life in Jodhpur . The Peshwa surrendered on 3 June 1818 and was sent off to Bithur near Kanpur under the terms of the treaty signed on 3 June 1818 . Of the Pindari leaders , Karim Khan surrendered to Malcolm in February 1818 ; Wasim Mohammad surrendered to Shinde and eventually poisoned himself ; and Setu was killed by a tiger . 
 The war left the British , under the auspices of the British East India Company , in control of virtually all of present @-@ day India south of the Sutlej River . The famed Nassak Diamond was acquired by the Company as part of the spoils of the war . The British acquired large chunks of territory from the Maratha Empire and in effect put an end to their most dynamic opposition . The terms of surrender Malcolm offered to the Peshwa were controversial amongst the British for being too liberal : The Peshwa was offered a luxurious life near Kanpur and given a pension of about 80 @,@ 000 pounds . A comparison was drawn with Napoleon , who was confined to a small rock in the south Atlantic and given a small sum for his maintenance . <unk> <unk> was captured after the war and was sent to the fortress of <unk> in Bengal where he spent the rest of his life . With all active resistance over , John Malcolm played a prominent part in capturing and pacifying the remaining fugitives . 
 The Peshwa 's territories were absorbed into the Bombay Presidency and the territory seized from the Pindaris became the Central Provinces of British India . The princes of Rajputana became symbolic feudal lords who accepted the British as the paramount power . Thus Francis Rawdon @-@ Hastings redrew the map of India to a state which remained more or less unaltered until the time of Lord Dalhousie . The British brought an obscure descendant of Shivaji , the founder of the Maratha Empire , to be the ceremonial head of the Maratha Confederacy to replace the seat of the Peshwa . An infant from the Holkar family was appointed as the ruler of Nagpur under British guardianship . The Peshwa adopted a son , Nana Sahib , who went on to be one of the leaders of the Rebellion of 1857 . After 1818 , <unk> Elphinstone reorganized the administrative divisions for revenue collection , thus reducing the importance of the Patil , the Deshmukh , and the Deshpande . The new government felt a need to communicate with the local Marathi @-@ speaking population ; Elphinstone pursued a policy of planned standardization of the Marathi language in the Bombay Presidency starting after 1820 . 
 = Joe Biden presidential campaign , 2008 = 
 The Joe Biden presidential campaign , 2008 began when Biden , then the senior Senator from Delaware , announced his candidacy for President of the United States on the edition of January 7 , 2007 of Meet the Press . He officially became a candidate on January 31 , 2007 after filing papers with the Federal Elections Commission . Biden had previously run for president in 1988 , but failed to receive the nomination of the Democratic Party . If elected , Biden would have been the first sitting Senator and Roman Catholic to be president since John F. Kennedy , and the first President to be born during World War II . ( b . 1942 ) 
 During the campaign , Biden focused on his plan to achieve political success in the Iraq War through a system of federalization . He touted his record in the Senate as the head of several congressional committees and experience in foreign policy . Despite a few notable endorsements , Biden failed to garner significant support in opinion polls , and was marred by controversial comments made while campaigning . He ultimately dropped out of the race on January 3 , 2008 , after capturing less than 1 % of the vote in the Iowa caucus . 
 Seven months after conclusion of his campaign , Biden was selected to be Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama 's vice presidential running mate . The pair won in the general election , and were sworn in on January 20 , 2009 .

 Biden had run for president once before , but his 1988 presidential campaign had lasted for only three and a half months . He had been forced to withdraw due to controversies arising over reusing other politicians ' speeches without credit , and falsely recollecting parts of his academic record . 
 Biden first mentioned his intentions to run for president for 2008 on the Don Imus radio show on December 8 , 2004 . In the edition of January 23 , 2006 of The News Journal , Delaware 's largest daily newspaper , columnist Harry F. Themal reported that Biden " occupies the sensible center of the Democratic Party . " Themal concludes that this is the position Biden desires , and that in a campaign " he plans to stress the dangers to the security of the average American , not just from the terrorist threat , but from the lack of health assistance , crime , and energy dependence on unstable parts of the world .

 Biden declared his candidacy for president on January 31 , 2007 , although he had discussed running for months prior . It had been speculated that Biden would be offered and accept the position of Secretary of State because of his foreign policy experience and credentials . Biden rejected the notion outright , saying " Under no administration will I accept the job of Secretary of State " . He stated that he was focused only on the presidency . At a campaign event , Biden commented , " I know a lot of my opponents out there say I 'd be a great secretary of state . Seriously , every one of them . Do you watch any of the debates ? ' Joe 's right , Joe 's right , Joe 's right . ' " Other candidates commenting that " Joe is right " in the Democratic debates has been converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad . 
 On January 31 , 2007 as Biden entered the presidential race he attacked frontrunner Hillary Clinton 's plan for the War in Iraq . During an interview on Good Morning America , Biden called Clinton 's plan " a disaster " and " counterproductive " . Biden stated that his plan called for a " political solution " unlike Clinton 's " military solution " . Biden praised Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate , calling her " fully qualified " . He also spoke highly of Illinois Senator Barack Obama referring to him as " the first mainstream African @-@ American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice @-@ looking guy . " 
 During February campaigning Biden appeared on the edition of February 18 , 2007 of Face the Nation , criticizing the new surge policy of the Bush administration in Iraq . He spoke about a piece of legislation that he put forth before the Senate to stall the surge policy from enactment , which would strip the president of the authorization he was given to go to war in 2002 . After the legislation went up for a vote it failed by four votes in the Senate . Biden stated : 
 While campaigning in March 2007 , Biden stated that he would put a great quantity of focus on the first Southern primary state of South Carolina as a strategy . While speaking to rural audiences Biden noted that the war in Iraq continued to be an important facet of his campaign agenda . He said that he would talk to Independent voters to convince them to propel him to the nomination stating that if " the Democratic nominee cannot attract independents , Democrats cannot win " . Biden would later drop out of the race before the South Carolina primary would take place .

 In April 2007 Biden criticized Republican presidential candidate John McCain calling him " fundamentally wrong " for his support of the surge policy in Iraq . Biden wrote an opinion column to the Sacramento Bee , which called the surge a " failed policy " . He conceded that violence was down in Iraq but that the " militia ... simply waiting out the surge " accounted for the downward trend . Biden argued that no political change had occurred as there had been " no trust of the government by the [ Iraqi ] people . " He later described his plan which calls for a system of federalism . 
 As the debate stage of the election began , Biden participated in the first presidential debate of the election on April 26 , 2007 in South Carolina . He was the second to respond to a question originally posed to Senator Hillary Clinton on whether Senator Harry Reid 's assessment that the war in Iraq was " lost " is factual . Biden responded by stating the war is not a " game show " or a " football game " , which can be lost . He went on to argue that the real question that should be asked is , " Are we going to be able to leave Iraq ... and leave behind something other than chaos ? " He elaborated on this statement revealing his belief in the need for a change in the strategy for Iraq , declaring that the United States has to " change the fundamental premise of this engagement , and that is ... to decentralize Iraq ... give the regions control over their own destiny ... " 
 After the South Carolina debate , Biden campaigned in California to begin May 2007 attending events in San Francisco . Later in the month after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur , Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur . He released a statement on the campaign trail that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions . However , Biden argued that it was not enough , calling for a No @-@ Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation . 
 On June 3 , Biden participated in the second Democratic Debate featured on CNN , and set in the first primary state of New Hampshire . Biden discussed the War in Iraq , his recent vote to continue the funding of the troops and briefly about illegal immigration . On immigration Biden stated that it would cost too much money to send all 14 million illegal immigrants back to their native countries . He stated that those who commit crimes should be sent back and the rest should be given a pathway to citizenship . His statement : " Folks , being commander in chief requires you to occasionally be practical . " drew some laughter from the audience . Later in the debate Biden addressed his opposition to the " Don 't ask , don 't tell " policy of the military and touched on the situation in Darfur . 
 Later in June , Biden participated in another debate , this time featured on PBS and set at Howard University in Washington D.C. At the debate the candidates discussed issues pertinent to African @-@ Americans including education , civil rights and reproductive safety . Biden stated that to prevent the spread of AIDS public servants have to communicate to " black men ... [ that ] it is not unmanly to wear a condom , getting women to understand they can say no , getting people in the position where testing matters . I got tested for AIDS . I know Barack [ Obama ] got tested for AIDS . "

 The next month Biden participated in two debates : The July 12 Debate in Detroit , Michigan and most notably the July 23 YouTube debate in Charleston , South Carolina featured on CNN . In this debate when asked what Republican he would pick as a running mate if forced , Biden answered , " I would pick Chuck Hagel , and I 'd consider asking Dick Lugar to be secretary of state . " In regards to Iraq , Biden stated that it was unrealistic to say that all troops would be redeployed . He instructed those who used that rhetoric to " Tell the truth for a change . " When he discussed education Biden declared that he " would scrap " the No Child Left Behind Act . He concluded his participation in the debate after being asked to say something he didn 't like about the candidate to his left , Dennis Kucinich . Biden replied , " I don 't like a damn thing about him ... only kidding . " 
 The next month Biden was not able to participate in two debates , the August 4 debate sponsored by the <unk> and the August 9 LGBT Debate featured on the gay network Logo . He participated in the August 7 AFL @-@ CIO Debate and the August 19 Iowa debate featured on ABC . On August 20 Biden aired his first campaign advertisement in the first caucus state of Iowa . In the 30 @-@ second ad a voiceover states that Biden has a plan to end the Iraq War , and that " We ( America ) must end this war in a way that doesn 't require us to send their ( soldiers ) grandchild back . " It continues by declaring , " Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan to get us out of Iraq and keep us out . " 
 As September began , while on the campaign trail in Iowa , Biden confided to the Associated Press that he was " counting on Iowa a lot " . He hoped to come in " first , second or an indistinguishable third " and if not he would leave the campaign trail and return to Washington . His early statements seemed to mirror the future as he would ultimately drop out of the race after finishing lower than third in the Iowa Caucus . The results also presented a refutation of what he stated in September 2007 when he said that the campaign was " gaining some traction [ in Iowa ] . " The September 2007 assessments made by University of Iowa professor Bruce <unk> and Drake University professor Dennis Goldford displayed more merit at the end of the race after <unk> stated that Biden was not gaining traction in the race and with Goldford adding that " [ Biden ] talks like a senator , not a president " . Democratic strategist Ron Parker argued in September that Biden still had a chance but just had to sell his case to the American people . 
 On September 9 , two days before the Iraq commanding General David Petraeus addressed the Senate , Biden stated that , " I really respect him , and I think he 's dead flat wrong [ about the War in Iraq ] " . He criticized the president , arguing , " This president has no plan – how to win and / or how to leave " . During the September 11 testimony by the General , Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was " Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago ? " He answered his own question by stating " In my judgment , I must tell you , based on my experience and my observation here , as well as in @-@ country , the answer to ... [ the ] questions is no . " After the testimony concluded , Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations . In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning . 
 At the September 26 MSNBC debate , Biden explained how he would allow for Social security to last . He said that in the 1980s he had a meeting with prominent members of Congress and the solution they came up with was the raise the cap level , he stated that now the same solution would apply and that unity between the two parties was also necessary , " It was Joe Biden , Pat Moynihan , Bob Dole ... [ and ] George Mitchell when we made that deal [ to reform social security ] . I 'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying , ' we all got to jump in this boat at the same time . ' So the bottom line here is , you can 't do it by growing the economy alone . So I would raise the cap . " Later in the debate Biden was one of three participants ( along with Dodd and Richardson ) who said they would ban smoking in public places .

 On October 23 Biden revealed his health care plan . It called for expanded coverage for children and adults but stops short of mandates for complete universal coverage . It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment . Biden stated it would cost between $ 80 billion and $ 110 billion per year . He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1 % bracket , capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners . The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300 % above the poverty level . 
 At the October 30 , 2007 debate in Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas , Biden was noted for some one @-@ liners that drew some laughter from the audience . First , when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate , Biden stated , " There 's only three things he mentions in a sentence : a noun , and a verb and 9 / 11 . " At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated , " I know there 's more to say , Campbell . I appreciate you asking me the question and I 'm sorry I answered it . I know you 're not supposed to answer questions , based on what I 've heard . " 
 In his final debate before the Iowa Caucus , Biden participated in the December 13 forum sponsored by The Des Moines Register . His most notable part came when asked to respond to allegations that he was " uncomfortable " speaking about race since making remarks earlier in the year when he referred to Barack Obama using the adjectives " clean " and " articulate " . Biden answered the question remarking that anyone who has known him knew of this commitment to civil rights and race relations . Barack Obama came to his defense , saying : " Joe is on the right side of the issues and is fighting every day for a better America . " 
 Following the debate and subsequent assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , Biden shifted focus of his campaign to the issue of relations toward the nation of Pakistan . He stated that the country was " the most dangerous nation on the planet " and that he had made that assertion on previous occasions . The event marked an opportunity for a candidate such as Biden with past foreign policy experience to gain momentum in the opinion polls with the looming Iowa Caucus less than a week away . Biden finished off the year 's campaigning trying to improve his standing in the race by speaking of the events surrounding the situation in Pakistan and particularly his solution of protecting the nuclear weapons of the nation .

 After a finishing fifth place in the Iowa Caucus on January 3 , 2008 , garnering only one percent of the total vote , Biden ended his presidential bid . In a tearful rally with family and friends by his side , Biden declared , " I ain 't going away . I 'll be going back to the Senate as the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and I will continue to make the case I 've been making ... " The end of this campaign marked the end of all presidential campaigns for Biden who stated that this run would be his last .

 Perhaps the biggest problem Biden faced was the fact that voters did not know about him and his candidacy . An April 2 – 5 poll conducted by Gallup found that 38 % of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and 17 % had no opinion at all about him . In contrast , 0 % of the public had never heard of Hillary Clinton and only 3 % had no opinion according to a June 1 – 3 poll by Gallup . A September poll conducted by Clemson University found that 36 % of the public had never heard of Joe Biden and only 44 % had a favorable opinion of him . However , this was the highest awareness rating in the Democratic field outside of the frontrunners ( Clinton , Obama , and Edwards ) and non @-@ declared but highly discussed Al Gore . A September 18 poll found that 56 % of respondents had not heard enough about Biden to form an opinion about him . 
 Biden had remained low in the opinion polls when compared to other candidates . A Rasmussen survey taken September 19 – 24 put him in fourth place among his Democratic opponents at 4 % , trailing Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , John Edwards . In the American Research Group , Biden was fourth at 5 % behind Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards , for the month of October 2007 . In head @-@ to @-@ head matchups with Republican candidates , Biden trailed Senator John McCain on January 10 , 2007 38 % to 46 % . On July 17 , Biden trailed former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani 37 % to 46 % . The closest Biden came to a GOP candidate in a head to head matchup was against former Senator Fred Thompson , trailing him 38 % to 40 % on July 17 , 2007 . 
 = = = Experience vs. change = = = 
 Biden spoke of the fact that he had spent 34 years in the Senate and had been active in many congressional committees including being the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and formerly holding the post as chairman of the Judiciary Committee . On the campaign trail he touted his years of foreign policy experience particularly in regard to the conflict in Bosnia , which he feels he played a role in ending . Biden stated earlier in his campaign that " [ he ] truly believe [ s ] the American public is waiting for leaders to come along who have the experience to say what they will do to restore America 's leadership in the world . " At times during his campaign he believed his experience would help him win the Democratic nomination , but when Barack Obama 's campaign began to surge with the candidate 's emphasis on change , Biden shifted his focus from his experience in politics to his ability for action . He stated during a November 2007 debate , " This [ election ] is not about experience . It 's not about change . It 's about action . Who among us is going to be able to , on Day 1 , step in and end the war ? " 
 = = = Plan for Iraq = = = 
 Earlier in his campaign the most important issue for Biden was the Conflict in Iraq . In November 2006 , Biden and Leslie Gelb , President Emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations , released a comprehensive strategy to end sectarian violence in Iraq . Rather than continuing the present approach or withdrawing , the plan calls for " a third way " : federalizing Iraq and giving Kurds , Shiites , and Sunnis " breathing room " in their own regions . With public approval of the handling of the conflict decreasing considerably since the invasion in 2003 , Biden believed this plan would have helped his campaign among the electorate had he been nominated . The key points included : 
 Giving Iraq 's major groups a measure of autonomy in their own regions . A central government would be left in charge of interests such as defending the borders and distributing oil revenues . 
 <unk> Sunnis – who have no oil rights – a proportionate share of oil revenue and reintegrating those who have not fought against Coalition forces . 
 Increase , not end , reconstruction assistance but insist that Arab States of the Persian Gulf fund it and tie it to the creation of a jobs program and to the protection of minority rights . 
 Initiate a diplomatic offensive to enlist the support of the major powers and neighboring countries for a political settlement in Iraq and create an Oversight Contact Group to enforce regional commitments . 
 Begin the phased redeployment of U.S. forces in 2007 and withdraw most of them by 2008 , leaving a small follow @-@ on force for security and policing actions . The plan named as The Biden @-@ Brownback Resolution passed on the Senate floor 75 – 23 on September 25 , 2007 , including 26 Republican votes .

 On January 31 , 2007 , Biden took his first steps into the presidential campaign , but his comments about other candidates overshadowed his entrance . Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama ; Biden was quoted in the New York Observer as saying : " I mean , you got the first mainstream African @-@ American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice @-@ looking guy , ... I mean , that 's a storybook , man . " The audio of the interview , posted on the Observer 's website , reportedly includes a significant pause after " African @-@ American " which would drastically change the meaning of the statement . Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening : " Look , the other part of this thing that got me in trouble is using the word clean . I should have said fresh . " Some media observers labeled Biden 's announcement a " launch pad disaster . " Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward " Senator Biden ... assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted . He was serious and contrite . To me , this was a gaffe , not a statement about his philosophy or ideology . " 
 The remark did much to undermine the start of Biden 's campaign , and severely damaged his fund @-@ raising ability .

Biden opposes oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and believes that the government must take action against global warming . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While Biden 's presidential campaign did not last beyond the first caucuses , he created a favorable impression during the debates and increased his stature among Washington politicos . In particular , Barack Obama changed his opinion of Biden , liking how he had handled himself at campaign stops and appreciating his appeal to working class voters . 
 On May 30 , 2008 , it was reported by The Washington Times that likely Democratic nominee Obama asked Biden to play a " more prominent " and " deeply involved " role in his campaign , with some speculating that Biden was on Obama 's shortlist of vice presidential candidates . On August 23 , 2008 , the Obama campaign announced that Biden would become Barack Obama 's running mate .

 = Bupropion = 
 Bupropion is a medication primarily used as an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid . It is marketed as Wellbutrin and Zyban among other trade names . It is one of the most frequently prescribed antidepressants in the United States and Canada , although in many countries this is an off @-@ label use . Bupropion is taken in tablet form and is available only by prescription in most countries . 
 Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine @-@ dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( NDRI ) . It is an atypical antidepressant different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) . It is an effective antidepressant on its own , but is also popular as an add @-@ on medication in cases of incomplete response to first @-@ line SSRI antidepressants . In comparison to many other antidepressants , it does not cause as much weight gain or sexual dysfunction . The most important side effect is an increase in risk for epileptic seizures , which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced . 
 Bupropion is known to affect several different biological targets . It often is described as a norepinephrine @-@ dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( NDRI ) , and is also a nicotinic antagonist . But bupropion does not appear to have significant dopaminergic actions in humans under normal clinical circumstances . Chemically , bupropion belongs to the class of <unk> and is similar in structure to stimulants such as cathinone and <unk> , and to phenethylamines in general . 
 Bupropion was synthesized by Nariman Mehta and patented by Burroughs Wellcome in 1969 , which later became part of what is now GlaxoSmithKline . It was first approved for clinical use in the United States in 1989 . It was originally called by the generic name <unk> , before being renamed in 2000 . It is a substituted cathinone ( β @-@ <unk> ) , and by extension , a substituted amphetamine . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 = = = Depression = = = 
 Bupropion is one of the most widely prescribed antidepressants , and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs , including fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and paroxetine ( Paxil ) , although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram ( <unk> ) , sertraline ( Zoloft ) and venlafaxine ( <unk> ) over bupropion have been observed . <unk> ( <unk> ) , on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion . Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants : for instance , unlike the majority of antidepressants , it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction . Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants . 
 In depressed people who experience symptoms of sleepiness and fatigue , bupropion has been found to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) in alleviating these symptoms . There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression . 
 According to surveys , the addition to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people do not respond to the SSRI , even though this is not an officially approved indication . The addition of bupropion to an SSRI ( most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline ) may result in an improvement in some people who have an incomplete response to the first @-@ line antidepressant . 
 Bupropion was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , in 2006 , for the prevention of seasonal affective disorder . In some countries ( including Australia , New Zealand and the UK ) this is an off @-@ label use . 
 = = = Smoking cessation = = = 
 The next most common use is as an aid for smoking cessation where it reduces the severity of nicotine cravings and withdrawal symptoms . A typical bupropion treatment course lasts for seven to twelve weeks , with the patient halting the use of tobacco about ten days into the course . Bupropion approximately doubles the chance of quitting smoking successfully after three months . One year after treatment , the odds of sustaining smoking cessation are still 1 @.@ 5 times higher in the bupropion group than in the placebo group . 
 The evidence is clear that bupropion is effective at reducing nicotine cravings . Whether it is more effective than other treatments is not as clear , due to a limited number of studies . The evidence that is available suggests that bupropion is comparable to nicotine replacement therapy , but somewhat less effective than <unk> . 
 In Australia and the UK smoking cessation is the only licensed indication of bupropion . 
 = = = Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder = = = 
 Bupropion has been used as a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) since at least 2004 , with reports of positive results in both minors and adults . In a double @-@ blind study of children , while aggression and hyperactivity as rated by the children 's teachers were significantly improved in comparison to placebo , parents and clinicians could not distinguish between the effects of bupropion and placebo . The 2007 guideline on the ADHD treatment from American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry notes that the evidence for bupropion is " far weaker " than for the FDA @-@ approved treatments . Its effect may also be " considerably less than of the approved agents ... Thus it may be prudent for the clinician to recommend a trial of behavior therapy at this point , before moving to these second @-@ line agents . " Similarly , the Texas Department of State Health Services guideline recommends considering bupropion or a tricyclic antidepressant as a fourth @-@ line treatment after trying two different stimulants and atomoxetine . 
 = = = Sexual dysfunction = = = 
 Bupropion is one of few antidepressants that do not cause sexual dysfunction . A range of studies demonstrate that bupropion not only produces fewer sexual side effects than other antidepressants , but can actually help to alleviate sexual dysfunction . According to a survey of psychiatrists , it is the drug of choice for the treatment of SSRI @-@ induced sexual dysfunction , although this is not an indication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . There have also been a few studies suggesting that bupropion can improve sexual function in women who are not depressed , if they have hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( HSDD ) . 
 = = = Obesity = = = 
 Bupropion , when used for treating obesity over a period of 6 to 12 months , may result in weight loss of 2 @.@ 7 kg over placebo . This is not much different from the weight loss produced by several other medications , such as <unk> , orlistat and <unk> . 
 It has been studied in combination with naltrexone . Concerns from bupropion include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate . In September 2014 , a combination ( bupropion / naltrexone ) was approved by the US FDA for the treatment of obesity . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 There has been controversy about whether it is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar depression , but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit . 
 Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence , but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence . 
 Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the inflammatory mediator TNF @-@ alpha , there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions , but very little clinical evidence is available . 
 Bupropion — like other antidepressants , with the exception of <unk> ( <unk> ) — is not effective in treating chronic low back pain . It does , however , show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain . 
 = = Contraindications = = 
 The drug label advises that bupropion should not be prescribed to individuals with epilepsy or other conditions that lower the seizure threshold , such as anorexia nervosa , bulimia nervosa , active brain tumors , or concurrent alcohol and / or benzodiazepine use and / or withdrawal . It should be avoided in individuals who are also taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) . When switching from MAOIs to bupropion , it is important to include a washout period of about two weeks between the medications . The label recommends that caution should be exercised when treating patients with liver damage , severe kidney disease , and severe hypertension , and in pediatric patients , adolescents and young adults due to the increased risk of suicidal ideation . 
 = = Side effects = = 
 Epileptic seizures are the most important adverse effect of bupropion . A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989 . The risk of seizure is strongly dose @-@ dependent , but also dependent on the preparation . The sustained @-@ release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0 @.@ 1 % at daily dosages of less than 300 mg of bupropion and 0 @.@ 4 % at 300 – 400 mg . The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0 @.@ 4 % for dosages below 450 mg ; the incidence climbs to 5 % for dosages between 450 – 600 mg per day . For comparison , the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0 @.@ 07 to 0 @.@ 09 % , and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0 and 0 @.@ 6 % at recommended dosage levels . Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures , and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases , low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all . However , this study also found that bupropion and <unk> were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures . 
 The prescribing information notes that hypertension , sometimes severe , was observed in some patients , both with and without pre @-@ existing hypertension . The frequency of this adverse effect was under 1 % and not significantly higher than found with placebo . A review of the available data carried out in 2008 indicated that bupropion is safe to use in patients with a variety of serious cardiac conditions . 
 In the UK , more than 7 @,@ 600 reports of suspected adverse reactions were collected in the first two years after bupropion 's approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency as part of the Yellow Card Scheme , which monitored side effects . Approximately 540 @,@ 000 people were treated with bupropion for smoking cessation during that period . The MHRA received 60 reports of " suspected [ emphasis MHRA 's ] adverse reactions to Zyban which had a fatal outcome " . The agency concluded that " in the majority of cases the individual 's underlying condition may provide an alternative explanation . " This is consistent with a large , 9 @,@ 300 @-@ patient safety study that showed that the mortality of smokers taking bupropion is not higher than the natural mortality of smokers of the same age . 
 = = = Psychiatric = = = 
 Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are rare in clinical trials , and the FDA requires all antidepressants , including bupropion , to carry a boxed warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in persons younger than 25 . This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2 @-@ fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents , and 1 @.@ 5 @-@ fold increase in the 18 – 24 age group . For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results . Considered in isolation , bupropion was not statistically different from placebo . 
 Suicidal behavior is less of a concern when bupropion is prescribed for smoking cessation . According to a 2014 Cochrane review , while there is an association with suicide it is unclear if bupropion was the cause . 
 In 2009 the FDA issued a health advisory warning that the prescription of bupropion for smoking cessation has been associated with reports about unusual behavior changes , agitation and hostility . Some patients , according to the advisory , have become depressed or have had their depression worsen , have had thoughts about suicide or dying , or have attempted suicide . This advisory was based on a review of anti @-@ smoking products that identified 75 reports of " suicidal adverse events " for bupropion over ten years . 
 Bupropion @-@ induced psychosis may develop in select patient populations , or worsen a pre @-@ existing psychotic syndrome . Symptoms may include delusions , hallucinations , paranoia , and confusion . In most cases these symptoms can be reduced or eliminated by reducing the dose , ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication . However , adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis , instead of an antipsychotic , may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine @-@ induced psychosis . Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion , a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis , concomitant medications , for example , lithium or benzodiazepines , old age , or substance abuse . 
 In a large @-@ scale study of programs where bupropion was used for smoking cessation or treatment of depression , no withdrawal symptoms were observed . As of 2002 there were two case reports of people experiencing withdrawal symptoms when discontinuing <unk> taken to aid smoking cessation ; the prescribing information states that dose tapering is not required when discontinuing treatment for smoking cessation . 
 = = Overdose = = 
 Bupropion is considered moderately dangerous in overdose . 
 In the majority of childhood exploratory ingestions involving one or two tablets , children show no apparent symptoms . 
 For significant overdoses , seizures have been reported in about a third of all cases ; other serious effects include hallucinations , loss of consciousness , and arrhythmias when bupropion was one of several kinds of pills taken in an overdose , fever , muscle rigidity , muscle damage , hypertension or hypotension , stupor , coma , and respiratory failure have been reported . While most people recover , some people have died , and before they died suffered multiple uncontrolled seizures and heart attacks . 
 = = Interactions = = 
 Since bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme , drug interactions with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible : this includes medications like paroxetine , sertraline , fluoxetine , diazepam , clopidogrel , and <unk> . The expected result is the increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration . The reverse effect ( decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion ) can be expected with CYP2B6 <unk> , such as carbamazepine , clotrimazole , rifampicin , ritonavir , St John 's wort , phenobarbital , phenytoin and others . Conversely , because bupropion is itself an inhibitor of CYP2D6 ( Ki = 21 μM ) , as is its active metabolite , hydroxybupropion ( Ki = 13 @.@ 3 μM ) , it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme . 
 Bupropion lowers the threshold for epileptic seizures , and therefore can potentially interact with other medications that also lower it , such as <unk> , cholinergic agents , fluoroquinolones , interferons , chloroquine , mefloquine , <unk> , theophylline , systemic corticosteroids ( e.g. , prednisone ) , and some tricyclic antidepressants ( e.g. , <unk> ) . The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol , since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance , and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold . Also , bupropion should not be taken by individuals undergoing abrupt cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use . 
 Caution should be observed when combining bupropion with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) . 
 = = Pharmacology = = 
 = = = Pharmacodynamics = = = 
 Based on animal and human proteins research , bupropion has been characterized as a weak norepinephrine @-@ dopamine reuptake inhibitor ( NDRI ) . It has also been found to act as a releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine ( <unk> ) . However , in actual humans , bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activity and influence on the effects of bupropion during first @-@ pass metabolism . These metabolites are present in significantly higher levels in the body compared to bupropion itself . The most important example of this is bupropion 's most major metabolite , hydroxybupropion , a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( and likely releasing agent ) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( <unk> ) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions , which , with oral bupropion treatment , can reach area under the curve ( AUC ) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16 – 20 times greater than those of bupropion itself . Hence , its effects cannot be understood without reference to its metabolism . 
 The occupancy of dopamine transporter ( DAT ) sites by bupropion and its metabolites in the human brain as measured by positron emission tomography was 26 % according to GlaxoSmithKline researchers and 14 % in an independent study . Despite this weak DAT occupancy however , a subsequent study looked at the actual extracellular concentrations of dopamine in the human brain after an acute oral treatment of bupropion and failed to observe any increase , concluding that the weak DAT occupancy was not sufficient to increase dopamine levels . In contrast , the same study also looked at dopamine levels in the rat brain after administration of bupropion via intraperitoneal injection and did see an increase , which could have been related to species differences . However , an alternative explanation is that the difference had to do with the different routes of administration employed ( i.e. , oral vs. <unk> ) and the associated differences in pharmacokinetics and metabolism , namely , the bypassing of first @-@ past metabolism with the latter route , that resulted . Although oral bupropion at clinical doses does not appear to have a significant potential for abuse , there are many isolated case reports of bupropion abuse and " cocaine @-@ like " effects in humans who ingested the drug via a non @-@ oral route ( e.g. , injection , insufflation , etc . ) . Notably , awareness of the abuse potential of bupropion via non @-@ conventional routes appears to be especially prominent in correctional facilities . 
 Bupropion is also known to act as a non @-@ competitive antagonist of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and , very weakly , <unk> <unk> receptors , and these actions appear to be importantly involved in its beneficial properties not only in smoking cessation , but in depression as well . The metabolites of bupropion also act as non @-@ competitive antagonists of these <unk> receptors , and hydroxybupropion is even more potent in comparison . Pharmacological data on bupropion and its metabolites are shown in the table . Bupropion is known to weakly inhibit the α1 adrenergic receptor , with a 14 % potency of its dopamine uptake inhibition , and the H1 receptor , with a 9 % potency . 
 = = = Pharmacokinetics = = = 
 Bupropion is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 <unk> CYP2B6 . It has several active metabolites : R , R @-@ hydroxybupropion , S , S @-@ hydroxybupropion , <unk> @-@ hydrobupropion and <unk> @-@ hydrobupropion , which are further metabolized to inactive metabolites and eliminated through excretion into the urine . Both bupropion and its primary metabolite hydroxybupropion act in the liver as potent inhibitors of the enzyme CYP2D6 , which metabolizes not only bupropion itself but also a variety of other drugs and biologically active substances . This mechanism creates the potential for a variety of drug interactions . 
 The biological activity of bupropion can be attributed to a significant degree to its active metabolites , in particular to S , S @-@ hydroxybupropion . GlaxoSmithKline developed this metabolite as a separate drug called <unk> , but discontinued development in 2006 due to " an unfavourable risk / benefit assessment " . 
 Bupropion is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6 , an isozyme of the cytochrome P450 system . Alcohol causes an increase of CYP2B6 in the liver , and persons with a history of alcohol use metabolize bupropion faster . Bupropion is metabolized to <unk> @-@ hydrobupropion via cortisone reductase . The metabolic pathway responsible for the creation of <unk> @-@ hydrobupropion remains elusive . 
 The metabolism of bupropion is highly variable : the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest the same amount of the drug may differ by as much as 5 @.@ 5 times ( with a half @-@ life of 12 – 30 hours ) , while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by as much as 7 @.@ 5 times ( with a half @-@ life of 15 – 25 hours ) . Based on this , some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion . The half @-@ lives of <unk> and <unk> are roughly 23 – 43 hours and 24 – 50 hours respectively . 
 There have been reported cases of false @-@ positive urine amphetamine tests in persons taking bupropion .

 Bupropion is a substituted cathinone . It is synthesized in two chemical steps starting from 3 ' <unk> @-@ <unk> . The alpha position adjacent to the ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha @-@ <unk> with t @-@ <unk> and treated with hydrochloric acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75 – 85 % overall yield . 
 = = History = = 
 Bupropion was invented by Nariman Mehta of Burroughs Wellcome ( now GlaxoSmithKline ) in 1969 , and the US patent for it was granted in 1974 . It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) as an antidepressant on 30 December 1985 , and marketed under the name Wellbutrin . However , a significant incidence of epileptic seizures at the originally recommended dosage caused the withdrawal of the drug in 1986 . Subsequently , the risk of seizures was found to be highly dose @-@ dependent , and bupropion was re @-@ introduced to the market in 1989 with a lower maximum recommended daily dose . 
 In 1996 , the FDA approved a sustained @-@ release formulation of bupropion called Wellbutrin SR , intended to be taken twice a day ( as compared with three times a day for immediate @-@ release Wellbutrin ) . In 2003 , the FDA approved another sustained @-@ release formulation called Wellbutrin XL , intended for once @-@ daily dosing . Wellbutrin SR and XL are available in generic form in the United States and Canada . In Canada , generic XR bupropion is distributed by Mylan . In 1997 , bupropion was approved by the FDA for use as a smoking cessation aid under the name Zyban . In 2006 , Wellbutrin XL was similarly approved as a treatment for seasonal affective disorder . 
 In April 2008 , the FDA approved a formulation of bupropion as a <unk> salt instead of a hydrochloride salt , to be sold under the name <unk> by Sanofi @-@ Aventis .

 On 11 October 2007 , two providers of consumer information on nutritional products and supplements , <unk> and The People 's Pharmacy , released the results of comparative tests of different brands of bupropion . The People 's Pharmacy received multiple reports of increased side effects and decreased efficacy of generic bupropion , which prompted it to ask <unk> to test the products in question . The tests showed that " one of a few generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg , sold as Budeprion XL 300 mg , didn 't perform the same as the brand @-@ name pill in the lab . " The FDA investigated these complaints and concluded that Budeprion XL is equivalent to Wellbutrin XL in regard to bioavailability of bupropion and its main active metabolite hydroxybupropion . The FDA also said that coincidental natural mood variation is the most likely explanation for the apparent worsening of depression after the switch from Wellbutrin XL to Budeprion XL . On 3 October 2012 , however , the FDA reversed this opinion , announcing that " Budeprion XL 300 mg fails to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to Wellbutrin XL 300 mg . " The FDA did not test the <unk> of any of the other generic versions of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg , but requested that the four manufacturers submit data on this question to the FDA by March 2013 . As of October 2013 the FDA has made determinations on the formulations from some manufacturers not being <unk> . 
 In 2012 , the U.S. Justice Department announced that GlaxoSmithKline had agreed to plead guilty and pay a $ 3 @-@ billion fine , in part for promoting the unapproved use of Wellbutrin for weight loss and sexual dysfunction . 
 In France , marketing authorization was granted for Zyban on 3 August 2001 , with a maximum daily dose of 300 mg ; only sustained @-@ release bupropion is available , and only as a smoking cessation aid . Bupropion was granted a licence for use in adults with major depression in the Netherlands in early 2007 , with GlaxoSmithKline expecting subsequent approval in other European countries .

 According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications , bupropion is " non @-@ <unk> " .

There have been a number of anecdotal and case @-@ study reports of bupropion abuse , but the bulk of evidence indicates that the subjective effects of bupropion via the oral route are markedly different from those of addictive stimulants such as cocaine or amphetamine . That said , bupropion , via non @-@ conventional routes of administration ( e.g. , injection , insufflation ) , is reported to be abused in the United States and Canada , notably in prisons . 
 = Wolf @-@ Dietrich Wilcke = 
 Wolf @-@ Dietrich Wilcke ( 11 March 1913 – 23 March 1944 ) was a German Luftwaffe pilot during World War II , a fighter ace credited with 162 enemy aircraft shot down in 732 combat missions . He claimed the majority of his victories over the Eastern Front , and 25 over the Western Front , including four four @-@ engined bombers . 
 Born in <unk> in the Province of Posen , Wilcke volunteered for military service in the Reichswehr of the Third Reich in 1934 . Initially serving in the Heer ( Army ) , he transferred to the Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) in 1935 . Following flight training , he was posted to Jagdgeschwader " Richthofen " ( Fighter Wing " Richthofen " ) in April 1936 . After an assignment as fighter pilot instructor he volunteered for service with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in early 1939 . After his return from Spain , he was appointed Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of the 7 . Staffel ( 7th squadron ) of Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 — 53rd Fighter Wing ) . Following the outbreak of World War II , he claimed his first aerial victory on 7 November 1939 . On 18 May 1940 , during the Battle of France , he was shot down and taken prisoner of war . After the armistice with France , he returned from captivity and was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the III . Gruppe ( 3rd group ) of JG 53 during the Battle of Britain , claiming 10 victories over England . 
 Wilcke then fought in the aerial battles of Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . There , after 25 aerial victories , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 6 August 1941 . In September 1941 , he relocated with his group to the Mediterranean Theater , where he was able to claim further victories . At the end of May 1942 , he was transferred to the Stab ( headquarters unit ) of Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) " Udet " , and that August he was appointed as its Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) . Following his 100th aerial victory on 6 September , he received the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . During the Battle of Stalingrad , on 17 December , he claimed his 150th aerial victory . On 23 December 1942 , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords , his total now 155 aerial victories . 
 Subsequent to the presentation of the Swords to his Knight 's Cross , he was officially banned from operational flying . Occasionally he still flew combat missions and on 23 March 1944 , flying in defense of the Reich , he claimed his 162nd and last aerial victory and was killed in action by United States Army Air Forces long @-@ range P @-@ 51 Mustang fighters near <unk> , in Lower Saxony . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Wilcke was born on 11 March 1913 at <unk> in the Province of Posen , part of the Kingdom of Prussia at the time , now <unk> in the Greater Poland Voivodeship , Poland . He was the son of a Hauptmann ( captain ) of Infanterie @-@ Regiment 47 ( 47th Infantry Regiment ) , Hans Wilcke , who died of pneumonia when Wilcke was just four weeks of age . His mother , Hertha von <unk> , married again on 14 June 1919 . In 1931 , Wilcke was arrested for attending a then @-@ illegal demonstration of the Nazi Party . Although his loyalty to the Nazi cause is emphasized multiple times in his personal military files , according to biographers Prien and <unk> , he was a firm opponent of the National Socialist regime ; later in his career , for a time after taking command of III . Gruppe ( 3rd group ) of Jagdgeschwader 53 ( JG 53 — 53rd Fighter Wing ) , he had the Swastikas on his unit 's aircraft painted over . He volunteered for military service in the Reichswehr after receiving his Abitur ( diploma ) . He joined Artillerie @-@ Regiment 6 ( 6th Artillery Regiment ) in Minden as a Fahnenjunker ( officer cadet ) on 1 April 1934 . His legal guardian and stepfather , Friedrich von Scotti , also served in this regiment . 
 As a Fähnrich ( officer candidate ) , Wilcke was posted to the Kriegsschule ( war school ) in Dresden on 1 October 1934 . On 1 November 1935 , he was transferred to the newly emerging Luftwaffe holding the rank of Oberfähnrich ( senior officer candidate ) . On 20 April 1936 , while serving at the flight school in <unk> , he was promoted to Leutnant ( second lieutenant ) . On 15 October he was transferred to Jagdgeschwader " Richthofen " ( Fighter Wing " Richthofen " ) , also known as Jagdgeschwader 132 ( JG 132 — 132nd Fighter Wing ) , named after the World War I fighter ace Manfred von Richthofen and forerunner of Jagdgeschwader 2 ( JG 2 — 2nd Fighter Wing ) " Richthofen " . There he excelled as a pilot and showed exceptional leadership ability and was sent as fighter pilot instructor to the Jagdfliegerschule ( fighter pilot school ) in Werneuchen in the second half of 1937 . 
 In March 1939 , Wilcke volunteered for service with the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War . For a few weeks , he flew with 1 . Staffel ( 1st squadron ) of Jagdgruppe 88 ( J / 88 — 88th Fighter Group ) without claiming any aerial victories . He was awarded the Spanish Cross in Bronze with Swords for his service in Spain . In Spain he became friends with Werner Mölders and when Mölders was appointed Gruppenkommandeur ( group commander ) of the newly created III . Gruppe of JG 53 , he selected Wilcke as Staffelkapitän ( squadron leader ) of the 7 . Staffel ( 7th squadron ) of JG 53 . 
 = = World War II = = 
 World War II in Europe began on Friday , 1 September 1939 , when German forces invaded Poland . Wilcke , who at the time was still a member of 3 . Staffel ( 3rd squadron ) of JG 53 , flew missions over Poland . He claimed his first aerial victory on 7 November 1939 over the Western Front when he shot down an Armée de l 'Air ( French Air Force ) Potez 630 , a twin @-@ engined fighter , near <unk> during the Phoney War . For this achievement he was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 25 November 1939 . 
 From 2 – 16 January 1940 , Wilcke and other pilots from III . Gruppe went on a ski vacation to the Vorarlberg . On 11 March 1940 , he shot down another Potez at an altitude of 7 @,@ 000 meters ( 23 @,@ 000 feet ) near the " three @-@ nations @-@ corner " north of Metz . He claimed his third victory at 2 : 55 pm on 25 March . 7 . Staffel engaged a flight of Morane @-@ Saulnier M.S.406 at 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . In the resulting aerial battle , Wilcke shot down one of the <unk> over <unk> .

 The Battle of France , the German invasion of France and the Low Countries , began on 10 May 1940 . On 18 May 1940 , he engaged in aerial combat with eight French Curtiss P @-@ 36 Hawk fighter aircraft and was shot down west of <unk> . His victor may have been sous lieutenant Camille <unk> . Wilcke bailed out and was taken prisoner of war . Following the armistice with France , he and Mölders , who had also been a prisoner of war , returned to the unit on 30 June 1940 . Wilcke was promoted to Hauptmann the next day and again took command of 7 . Staffel . On 11 July 1940 , he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class . 
 On 13 August 1940 , during the Battle of Britain , Wilcke replaced Hauptmann <unk> Harder as Gruppenkommandeur of the III . Gruppe . Harder had been last seen at 1 : 35 pm on 12 August and was reported as missing in action following combat east of the Isle of Wight . The day of his appointment , Wilcke almost lost his life as well , when he was forced to bail out after engine failure over the English Channel . He was rescued that night by a Dornier Do 18 flying boat . III . Gruppe flew a bomber escort mission targeting London on 30 August . Wilcke destroyed a barrage balloon on the morning mission and claimed his fourth victory , a Supermarine Spitfire in the vicinity of Dover during his second mission of the day . On 1 September 1940 , on another bomber escort mission that started at 11 : 20 am , Wilcke claimed his fifth victory , a Hawker Hurricane , south of London . He claimed his sixth victory , probably a Fairey Swordfish biplane , on 11 September over the Channel between Dover and Calais . 
 On 15 September 1940 , III . Gruppe engaged 20 to 30 Royal Air Force ( RAF ) fighters south of London . In the resulting combat , Wilcke claimed the destruction of his second Hurricane . Two days later , on a mission that began at 4 : 35 pm , Wilcke achieved his ninth victory , another Hurricane . He claimed his tenth victory , again a Hurricane , on a mission targeting the London area that took off at 11 : 15 am on 20 September . On the last day of September 1940 , he claimed two more victories to bring his total to 12 ; the action took place during his second mission of the day , which began at 1 : 45 pm , escorting Dornier Do 17s to London . In combat with RAF Spitfires , Wilcke claimed his 13th victory at 11 : 45 am on 10 October 1940 , his final of the Battle of Britain . In recognition of these achievements he was awarded the Honor Goblet of the Luftwaffe ( Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe ) on 1 April 1941 .

 On 8 June 1941 , the bulk of JG 53 's air elements moved via Jever , in northern Germany , to Mannheim @-@ Sandhofen . There the aircraft were given a maintenance overhaul prior to moving east . On 12 June , III . Gruppe was ordered to transfer to a forward airfield at <unk> . On 21 June , the Geschwaderkommodore ( wing commander ) of JG 53 and its Gruppenkommandeure were summoned to nearby Suwałki , where Generalfeldmarschall ( field marshal ) Albert Kesselring gave the final instructions for the upcoming attack . Wilcke briefed his pilots that evening . 
 On 22 June , the Geschwader crossed into Soviet airspace in support of Operation Barbarossa , the invasion of the Soviet Union , which opened the Eastern Front . III . Gruppe took off on its first mission at 3 : 20 am with the Gruppenstab ( headquarters unit ) and 7 . Staffel targeting Soviet airfields at <unk> and <unk> . Wilcke shot down three Polikarpov I @-@ 15 biplane fighter aircraft . The second mission of the day by III . Gruppe was a Stuka escort mission to Grodno at 6 : 00 am , during which Wilcke claimed another victory . He led another attack at 4 : 10 pm ; while strafing airfields , he claimed his fifth aerial victory of the day , an " ace @-@ in @-@ a @-@ day " achievement , taking his total to 18 . 
 On 25 June 1941 , JG 53 was relocated with III . Gruppe arriving at Vilnius at 8 : 30 am . The same day , Wilcke was slightly injured when he collided with another aircraft during takeoff . He claimed his 19th victory on the evening of 30 June 1941 , flying a combat air patrol into the <unk> area . Wilcke was ordered to form " Gefechtsverband Wilcke " ( " Battle Group Wilcke " ) on 1 July 1941 . He commanded his III . Gruppe and II . Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 52 ( JG 52 — 52nd Fighter Wing ) to counter @-@ attack Soviet bombers . On 9 July , Wilcke destroyed a Petlyakov Pe @-@ 2 ground attack aircraft . He claimed a victory on 25 July during fighter escort missions in the Vyazma area . On 29 July 1941 , III . Gruppe provided fighter cover for the German armored spearheads in the <unk> area . During this mission , Wilcke claimed another victory . The next day , over the spearheads at <unk> @-@ Bely , Wilcke shot down a Polikarpov I @-@ 180 fighter . He was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross on 6 August 1941 for 25 victories . Both Wilcke and Leutnant Herbert Schramm were decorated by Kesselring on 9 August 1941 . 
 On 23 August 1941 , the 9th Army began its assault on the Soviet forces in the Velikiye Luki area . Wilcke claimed two aerial victories while supporting these operations . III . Gruppe began returning to Germany in early October 1941 . The air elements left the Soviet Union on 4 October , while the ground units were transported back by train to Mannheim on 13 October . Since 22 June 1941 , III . Gruppe had claimed 769 aerial victories for the loss of 6 pilots killed , 7 missing in action , 2 captured and 12 wounded .

 After its return to Germany , III . Gruppe was deployed to the Mediterranean Theater . The ground elements of III . Gruppe arrived in Catania in Sicily on 28 November 1941 . Wilcke and his adjutant Jürgen Harder arrived on 2 December , with the rest of the Gruppe arriving the next day . On 6 December 1941 , III . Gruppe was ordered to move to <unk> in Libya . Wilcke claimed his 34th aerial victory on 11 December , during a fighter escort mission for Junkers Ju 88 bombers attacking Bir Hakeim . 
 III . Gruppe relocated back to Sicily on 17 December 1941 for operations in the Siege of Malta . The island of Malta had a strategically important position in the Mediterranean Sea . With the opening of a new front in North Africa in mid @-@ 1940 , British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa . To counter this threat , the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica ( Italian Royal Air Force ) conducted bombing raids to neutralize the RAF defenses and the ports . During the siege , Wilcke claimed four victories over RAF fighters in April – May 1942 . He claimed his first victory during the siege , and 35th overall , over a Spitfire fighter on 2 April 1942 . His 36th aerial victory on 22 April may have been Hurricane ( <unk> ) " B " of No. 185 Squadron flown by Pilot Officer " Sonny " Ormrod , who was killed in the engagement . On 12 May 1942 , III .

 On 18 May 1942 , Wilcke was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 3 " Udet " ( JG 3 — 3rd Fighter Wing ) , named after the World War I fighter ace Ernst Udet . Operating on the Eastern Front , Wilke became a Geschwaderkommodore of JG 3 " Udet " on 11 August , replacing Oberst ( Colonel ) Günther Lützow , who was posted to the staff of the General der Jagdflieger ( General of Fighters ) as Inspector of the Day Fighters on the Eastern Front . Operating from the <unk> Airfield , JG 3 " Udet " saw combat in the Kharkov area , present @-@ day Kharkiv , during the Second Battle of Kharkov . On 26 June 1942 , JG 3 " Udet " was assembled at <unk> on the southern sector of the Eastern Front for the upcoming summer offensive , supporting the Wehrmacht 's advance towards Stalingrad . In the following months , JG 3 " Udet " was based at airfields at <unk> , Olkhovatka , <unk> , Nowy @-@ Cholan , <unk> , <unk> and Pitomnik . 
 On 13 June 1942 , Wilcke claimed his first victory with JG 3 " Udet " , shooting down a Lavochkin @-@ Gorbunov @-@ Gudkov LaGG @-@ 3 fighter for his 39th victory . He followed this with another LaGG @-@ 3 on 22 June , and a LaGG @-@ 3 and a Polikarpov R @-@ 5 reconnaissance bomber on 24 June 1942 .

On 24 July he was credited with a Polikarpov I @-@ 153 biplane fighter and two days later two Hurricanes and two Pe @-@ 2s . On both 27 and 28 July he claimed victory over a LaGG @-@ 3 , his last victories in July 1942 . 
 Wilcke 's first victories in August 1942 , a Sukhoi Su @-@ 2 light bomber followed by two LaGG @-@ 3s , occurred on 5 and 6 August . On 9 August he filed a victory claim for an unknown aircraft type , bringing his " score " to 79 aerial victories . He took command of JG 3 " Udet " and achieved his first victory as Geschwaderkommodore on 12 August , again over an unknown type of aircraft . He claimed eight further victories of unknown types , two on 13 August , one on 17 August , three on 20 August , and two on 23 August . His first victory on 26 August was identified as a Yakovlev Yak @-@ 7 fighter , the other two that day were again unknown types . Another series of unidentified aircraft shot down followed . He claimed one aircraft destroyed on 28 August , one more on 30 August and four on 31 August , taking his total to 96 aerial victories by the end of August 1942 . Wilcke claimed his next two victories on 3 September and two more on 6 September , all four of unknown types of aircraft . This brought his total to 100 aerial victories . Wilcke was the 20th Luftwaffe pilot to achieve the century mark .

 From 10 – 19 September 1942 , Wilcke claimed another series of victories over aircraft of unknown type , which included one on 10 September , one on 12 September , four on 18 September and two on 19 September . On 16 September 1942 , the Soviets launched an offensive north of Stalingrad . Wilcke led about 40 serviceable German fighters against the Soviet 8 <unk> Armiya ( 8 VA — 8th Air Army ) , 16 <unk> Armiya ( 16 VA — 16th Air Army ) , and 102 Istrebitel <unk> Aviatsionnaya <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( 102 IAD PVO — Fighter Aviation Division of the Home Air Defense ) over Stalingrad . At the time , Wilcke often flew with Hauptmann Walther Dahl as his wingman . On 20 September 1942 , Wilcke shot down two LaGG @-@ 3s . Two days later , he shot down six Yakovlev Yak @-@ 1 fighters over Stalingrad , his third " ace @-@ in @-@ day " feat , taking his total to 116 aerial victories . It is possible that one of his opponents was Leytenant ( Second Lieutenant ) Nikolai <unk> of 434 Istrebitel 'nyy <unk> Polk ( 434 IAP — 434th Fighter Aviation Regiment ) , who was killed in action that day and was posthumously made a Hero of the Soviet Union . 
 The Geschwaderstab ( headquarters unit ) was based at the Pitomnik Airfield from 23 September to 21 November 1942 . There Wilcke directed fighter operations for the Battle of Stalingrad . During the previous offensive towards Stalingrad , the Geschwaderstab of JG 3 " Udet " had claimed 137 victories , of which 97 victories were credited to Wilcke . While based at Pitomnik , Wilcke claimed four victories on 24 September , one on 25 September , three on 28 September , four on 29 September , one on 3 October and two more on 24 October . On 25 and 26 October he claimed one victory on each day and his final two while based at Pitomnik on 1 November 1942 , taking his personal total to 135 victories . For these achievements he received the German Cross in Gold , awarded on 3 November 1942 . 
 In the aftermath of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942 , the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya @-@ West , outside the Stalingrad pocket . Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army . Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads , Morozovskaya @-@ West had to be abandoned by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December , and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya @-@ South , which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army . On 3 January 1943 , this airfield had to be abandoned as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to <unk> , there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended . During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories , 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl , for the loss in action of two pilots . 
 Wilcke claimed two victories on 24 November 1942 , an Il @-@ 2 Sturmovik and a Yak @-@ 1 , his first victories in support of the Stalingrad pocket . On 30 November he claimed the destruction of three aircraft of unknown type , one more on 2 December , and three more on 8 December . Four victories claimed on 12 December , one Lavochkin La @-@ 5 and three Yak @-@ 1s , took his total to 148 aerial victories . Wilcke became the fourth German fighter pilot to achieve 150 aerial victories in combat . He achieved this mark on 17 December 1942 , claiming victories 149 – 151 . The next day he claimed victory over three more aircraft . Following this 154th victory , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 23 December 1943 , the 23rd member of the Wehrmacht to be so honored . Along with the Swords came the ban from flying further operational combat missions . Although banned from flying , he was credited with two more victories on the Eastern Front , a Yak @-@ 1 on 28 December and an aircraft of unknown type on 5 January 1943 . 
 In March 1943 , Wilcke led Geschwaderstab and II. and III . Gruppe during operations against the Kuban bridgehead as part of the IV . Fliegerkorps ( 4th Air Corps ) . In early May 1943 , the Geschwaderstab was ordered out of actions and returned to München @-@ Gladbach , present @-@ day Mönchengladbach . Wilcke had only the Geschwaderstab and I. Gruppe under his effective command and no further combat missions were flown until October 1943 . 
 = = = Defense of the Reich and death = = = 
 Wilcke was promoted to Oberst on 1 December 1943 and requested permission to fly operationally and lead his Geschwader from the air . In February 1944 , although still officially banned from flying operations , Wilcke ignored the order and flew several missions leading his Stabsschwarm against the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) in Defense of the Reich missions . He claimed his 157th victory , over a Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning , on 10 February and his 158th , over a Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberator , on 24 February . He shot down two Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bombers on 4 March 1944 , his 159th and 160th aerial victories . On 6 March , his Bf 109G @-@ 6 was crippled in aerial combat and he made an emergency landing at <unk> . Combat on 6 March cost both sides heavy losses . The Eighth Air Force lost 75 four @-@ engined bombers and 14 escort fighters , the Luftwaffe lost 65 aircraft ; 36 German pilots were killed and 27 wounded . 
 On 23 March 1944 , Wilcke led JG 3 " Udet " against a USAAF bomber formation near Braunschweig . On this day , the USAAF was attacking aircraft factories at Braunschweig and other targets of opportunity in Münster , Osnabrück and Achmer . In total , the Eighth Air Force had committed 768 B @-@ 17s and B @-@ 24s bombers to this attack , supported by 841 long @-@ range fighters . The Luftwaffe countered this attack with 13 day fighter Gruppen , mustering 259 fighters on this day . Following combat , the Luftwaffe claimed the destruction of 51 enemy aircraft , including 44 four @-@ engined bombers . The Luftwaffe suffered 16 pilots killed and six wounded as well as 33 aircraft lost . The USAAF admitted the loss of 29 bombers and 5 escort fighters while claiming 62 German aircraft shot down and another 2 destroyed on the ground . 
 During this engagement , Wilcke shot down a B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress bomber and a North American P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter , but was then shot down in his Bf 109G @-@ 6 ( Werknummer 160 613 — factory number ) near <unk> . It is assumed that the victors were Captain Don Gentile and Captain John Trevor Godfrey of the 4th Fighter Group . By this date , Wilcke had claimed 162 enemy aircraft in 732 combat missions . His death was announced in the Wehrmachtbericht , an information bulletin issued by the headquarters of the Wehrmacht , on 30 March . 
 Wilcke had been nicknamed " Fürst " ( prince ) by his comrades on account of his attitude towards his men and paternal sense of responsibility . He had also been very conscious of his style and appearance and wore a very expensive and custom tailored leather coat , a trade which also added to his perception and fostered the nickname . His funeral ceremony was held at the airfield in München @-@ Gladbach . Among others , the funeral ceremony was attended by his stepfather . Wilcke was buried in the honor section of the cemetery in Mönchengladbach @-@ Holt .

It is the sixth installment in the Rocky franchise with Balboa in retirement , a widower living in Philadelphia , and the owner and operator of a local Italian restaurant called " Adrian 's " , named after his late wife . 
 According to Stallone , he was " negligent " in the production of Rocky V , leaving him and many of the fans disappointed with the presumed end of the series . Stallone also mentioned that the storyline of Rocky Balboa parallels his own struggles and triumphs in recent times . 
 The film also stars Burt Young as Paulie , Rocky 's brother @-@ in @-@ law in his last appearance in the Rocky series and real @-@ life boxer Antonio Tarver as Mason " The Line " Dixon , the current World Heavyweight Champion in the film . Boxing promoter Lou DiBella plays himself and acts as Dixon 's promoter in the film . Milo Ventimiglia plays Rocky 's son Robert , now an adult . A pair of minor characters from the original film return in larger roles : Marie , the young woman that Rocky attempts to steer away from trouble , and Spider Rico , the first opponent Rocky is shown fighting in the 1976 film . There are many references to people and events from previous installments in the series , especially the first . 
 The film was released on December 20 , 2006 , by Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , Columbia Pictures and Revolution Studios . It exceeded box office expectations and critical reaction was positive . Rocky Balboa was released in several formats for its home media release , and DVD sales have exceeded $ 34 million . The film was followed by a sequel / spin @-@ off , Creed , released November 25 , 2015 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Former Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa has been retired from boxing for 16 years and lives a quiet life as a widower following the death of his wife , Adrian Pennino Balboa , due to cancer four years earlier . He runs a small but successful Italian restaurant named after her , where he regales his patrons with stories of his past . He also battles personal demons involving his grief over Adrian 's death , the changing times , and his eroding relationship with his son Robert , a struggling corporate employee . Paul " Paulie " Pennino , Rocky 's brother @-@ in @-@ law and best friend , continues to keep by his side , but is tired of reliving the past . 
 Late one night , Rocky reunites with a much @-@ older " Little " Marie , a once mischievous neighborhood girl Rocky met when she was a child , now working as a bartender at Rocky 's former neighborhood bar , the Lucky Seven . She is a single parent of a teenaged son born out of wedlock : Stephenson , nicknamed " Steps " . Rocky 's friendship with the two blossoms over the following weeks . Marie becomes a hostess at his restaurant and Steps takes to him as a father figure . 
 Meanwhile , on the professional boxing circuit , Mason " The Line " Dixon reigns as the undisputed yet unpopular world heavyweight champion . ESPN broadcasts a computer simulation of a fight between Rocky ( in his prime ) and Mason — likened to a modern @-@ day version of The Super Fight , a 1970 computer simulation of a 15 @-@ round fight between Rocky Marciano and Muhammad Ali in their prime ( that Marciano " won " by a KO in the 13th round ) — which ends in a controversial KO victory for Balboa , riling the champ . In contrast , the simulation inspires Rocky to take up boxing again — an intention that goes public when he successfully renews his license . Dixon 's promoters pitch the idea of holding a charity exhibition bout at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas to bolster Dixon 's falling popularity . 
 With some hesitation , both men agree to the match , creating a media buzz that stabs at Rocky 's has @-@ been status and Dixon 's credibility ; Dixon having yet to face a challenging opponent . Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting , blaming his own personal failings on his father 's celebrity shadow , but Rocky rebukes him with some advice : that to succeed in life , " it ain 't about how hard you hit ; it 's about how hard you can get hit , and keep moving forward " , and that blaming others won 't help him . The next day , father and son meet over Adrian 's grave and reconcile ; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky 's side . Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed 's old trainer Duke who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky cannot depend on sparring as he did in the past , and can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible , focusing on " blunt force trauma " to pound his opponent . 
 The fight becomes an HBO Pay @-@ per @-@ View event billed as " Will Vs . Skill . " Rocky is given little chance , and a TV commentator jokes that it is being called an " exhibition " because it can 't be called an " execution . " But Rocky enters the ring to the tune of Frank Sinatra 's " High Hopes " and wearing the same gold @-@ trimmed black trunks he wore when he beat Apollo Creed and the large crowd is clearly in his corner . 
 Dixon easily dominates the first round , only to injure his left hand against Rocky 's hip in the second . Rocky makes a dramatic comeback ; he manages to knock Dixon down once and then continues to surprise the audience with his prowess and chin against the younger and faster fighter . Dixon , unprepared for Rocky 's resilience , sends Rocky to one knee in the final round , but the elder fighter pulls himself to his feet for one last assault . The two continue to punish each other until the end . Rocky thanks an appreciative Dixon for the fight and leaves the ring to the adulation of the crowd before the result is even announced . It is a win for Mason Dixon by a narrow split decision , but Rocky clearly does not mind . 
 Back in Philadelphia , Rocky brings roses to Adrian 's grave again , thanking her for helping him .

 Following the negative reception and poor box office performance of Rocky V , Stallone felt obligated to give his Rocky Balboa character a more proper closure . He began pitching his ideas to MGM studio executives in 1996 but was repeatedly turned down . After Harry E. Sloan became chairman of MGM in 2005 , the new studio executive and his team were willing to listen . Stallone also gained an ally in Revolution Studios president Joe Roth .

 Filming began in December 2005 in Las Vegas , Nevada . In 2006 , it moved to Los Angeles , California and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The production budget on the 38 @-@ day shoot was projected to be $ 24 million . The film was scheduled for release during the President 's Day holiday in 2007 , but was moved up to right before Christmas 2006 . In late March 2006 , the first movie teaser was released on the Internet . The full @-@ length trailer accompanied the theatrical release of Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest on July 7 in select theaters . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The film gives nods to previous installments via the casting . The most obvious is the return of Stallone , Young , and Burton : the only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments . Tarver 's appearance marks the sixth time an active professional boxer has appeared in the series . Previously , Joe Frazier ( Rocky ) , Pedro Lovell ( Rocky ) , Roberto Durán ( Rocky II ) , Tommy Morrison ( Rocky V ) , and Michael Williams ( Rocky V ) have appeared in the series . Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones , Jr. to portray Dixon , but after Jones did not return Stallone 's phone calls , he tapped Tarver to fill the role . The character of Marie appeared in the original Rocky ; she was portrayed by Jodi Letizia . For this film , Marie is portrayed by Geraldine Hughes . ( Letizia did reprise the role for Rocky V , but her scene was deleted . In that version , Marie was homeless on the streets of Philadelphia . ) Another recognizable character who appeared in the previous five films , sportscaster Stu Nahan , provided the commentary for the computer @-@ generated fight between Dixon and Balboa . Nahan was part of the ringside commentary team during all the bouts in the first three films and the Apollo Creed / Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV ; he was then one of the members of the press , seen asking questions to Rocky upon return from Russia in Rocky V at the start of the movie , and then again towards the end with new champion Tommy Gunn . He was diagnosed with lymphoma during the Rocky Balboa filming , though , and died on December 26 , 2007 . Finally , Pedro Lovell , who portrayed Spider Rico in the original film , returns to the role in Rocky Balboa as a guest and later employee at Rocky 's restaurant . 
 A number of sports personalities portray themselves . Jim Lampley , Larry Merchant , and Max Kellerman comprise the ringside broadcast team ( all three were commentators for HBO Boxing at the time of the film 's release ) . Sportswriters such as Bert Sugar , Bernard Fernandez and Steve Springer also appear . As for actual boxers , Mike Tyson ( who had retired by the film 's release ) makes a cameo appearance , taunting Dixon as the fighter enters the ring . Lou DiBella , a real @-@ life boxing promoter , portrays himself as Dixon 's promoter . Several of ESPN 's personalities also portray themselves . SportsCenter anchor ( and Friday Night Fights host ) Brian Kenny is the host of the fictional Then and Now series , while Cold Pizza and 1st and 10 hosts Jay Crawford , Dana Jacobson , Skip Bayless , and Woody Paige also appear . Ring announcer Michael Buffer appeared as himself , as did referee Joe Cortez . 
 Regarding his decision not to have Talia Shire reprise her role as Adrian , Stallone told USA Today that , " in the original script , she was alive . But it just didn 't have the same dramatic punch . I thought , ' What if she 's gone ? ' That would cut Rocky 's heart out and drop him down to ground zero " . Shire herself said that , in her view , " The film has great regard for the process of mourning . Sly utilizes mourning to empower Rocky , and Adrian is made very mythical . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Composed by Academy Award winner Bill Conti , the Rocky Balboa film score is both an updated composition of Rocky music and a tribute to the music that has been featured in previous Rocky films . Conti , who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except Rocky IV ( which was instead helmed by Vince <unk> when Conti had other commitments at the time ) , chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies . Only one original theme was written specifically for Rocky Balboa , which is the theme written to represent the character of Marie . 
 The roughly 40 @-@ minute score was recorded in the summer of 2006 at Capitol Studios in Hollywood , California . Conti chose to pre @-@ record the string , brass , and piano tracks and then have those tracks mixed with the work of a 44 @-@ piece orchestra which he conducted . He also performed all of the piano work himself which is something he has done with each movie for which he has composed the score . Stallone also was involved in every part of the process and attended several of the recording sessions . A soundtrack album entitled Rocky Balboa : The Best of Rocky was released by Capitol Records on December 26 , 2006 to coincide with the release of the film , though most of its tracks originate from previous Rocky installments . 
 In addition to the score , the film features original tracks performed by Natasha Bedingfield , Three 6 Mafia , and Frank Stallone as well as classic tracks such as Frank Sinatra 's " High Hopes " and The Miracles ' " Ooh Baby Baby " . Of the original tracks , the most significant is the Diane Warren song " Still Here " , performed by Bedingfield , which was reported to be the film 's theme in early articles . Though it is still listed in the credits , the song was dropped from the film .

 = = = Continuity = = = 
 A plot element from the fifth film is not addressed in Rocky Balboa 's plot . In the previous film , Rocky was diagnosed with brain damage and advised never to fight again . Stallone clarified this apparent inconsistency in an interview , remarking : 
 " When Rocky was diagnosed with brain damage , it must be noted that many athletes have a form of brain damage including football players , soccer players , and other individuals in contact sports such as rugby , etc . Rocky never went for a second opinion and yielded to his wife 's wishes to stop . So with the advent of new research techniques into brain damage , Rocky was found to be normal among fighters , and he was suffering the results of a severe concussion . By today 's standards Rocky Balboa would be given a clean bill of health for fighters . " 
 = = = Cinematography and fight choreography = = = 
 While the dramatic portions of the movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style , the bout between Balboa and Dixon is shot in a number of different ways . The lead @-@ in to the bout , as well as the first two rounds , are shot in a style similar to a major pay @-@ per @-@ view broadcast . Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa , while stock footage from actual Tarver fights , as well as footage from Dixon 's previous fight ( shown at the beginning of the film ) are used as clips for Dixon 's part of the teaser . The fight itself was shot in high definition to further enhance the TV @-@ style look of the fight . 
 After the first two rounds , the bout is shot in a more " cinematic " style , reminiscent of the way the fights in the other Rocky films were shot . However , unlike the other films in the series , the fight is less choreographed and more improvised than previous installments and is closer to an actual boxing match than a choreographed fight . This is a departure from the previous films , where every punch , feint , and step was carefully scripted and practiced . 
 There were also slight continuity problems during the filming of the final fight . This was said to have been due to the fact that real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver , resulting in some swelling and nosebleeds occurring earlier than scripted . " When you see the outtakes you 'll actually see Antonio [ Tarver ] coming up and hooking me , blasting me , and then he starts laughing in hysterics , " explained Stallone . " Then he said " What are you crazy ? ! " And I said " Look , I just couldn 't get out of the way , I didn 't want to get hit . " Just slow . You see it coming , you go " Move head ... head , move ... move . "

 While Rocky loses by split decision in the original theatrical screenplay ( mirroring the ending of the original Rocky ) , an alternative ending was filmed in which the third and final judge 's decision goes in favor of Rocky , making him the winner . The speaker starts " and still ... " for which Dixon <unk> while he continues " still ... Philadelphia 's undisputed heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa ! " . Dixon 's crew jeers while the crowd roars , but Dixon himself is still gracious even in defeat . From there , the ending continues the same as in the original .

On Metacritic , the film has a score of 63 out of 100 , based on 36 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 On the television show Ebert & Roeper , both Richard Roeper and guest reviewer Aisha Tyler gave the film a " thumbs up " rating . Among other positive reviews were those from Variety , David <unk> of New York magazine , Ethan Alter of Premiere Magazine , Victoria Alexander of <unk> , Jeanne <unk> of Palo Alto Weekly , Brett Buckalew of <unk> , The Hollywood Reporter , and Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly . 
 Some criticism came from Christy Lemire , who described the film as self @-@ parody . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also criticized the film 's premise as implausible and derivative , and the plot development as cursory . Colm Andrew of the Manx Independent said the film " captures the look and feel of the first Rocky but becomes too much of a sentimental homage " and overall " there is little point in joining Stallone on this ultimately dull nostalgia trip " . 
 Stallone was quoted as having told reporters that he would rather " do something that he enjoyed badly , than feel bad about not doing something he enjoyed . " 
 The film was greeted warmly by the majority of the boxing community , with many experts believing the Rocky character is still a key symbol of the sport and that the boxing scenes were the most realistic of any film . On the DVD , Stallone attributes this to the fact that he used realistic sound effects ( the previous installments had become notorious for their unrealistic and loud sounds of punches landing ) and the fact that both Stallone and Tarver threw real punches at each other . 
 = Agharta ( album ) = 
 Agharta is a 1975 live double album by American jazz musician Miles Davis . By the time he recorded the album , Davis was 48 years old and had alienated many in the jazz community while attracting younger rock audiences with his radical electric fusion music . After experimenting with different line @-@ ups , he established a stable live band in 1973 and toured constantly for the next two years , despite physical pain from worsening health issues and emotional instability brought on by substance abuse . During a three @-@ week tour of Japan in 1975 , Davis performed two concerts at the Festival Hall in Osaka on February 1 ; the afternoon show produced Agharta and the evening show was released as Pangaea the following year . 
 Davis led a septet at the concert ; saxophonist Sonny Fortune , bassist Michael Henderson , and guitarist Pete Cosey were given space to improvise against a dense backdrop of riffs , electronic effects , cross @-@ beats , and funk grooves from the rhythm section — drummer Al Foster , guitarist Reggie Lucas , and percussionist James Mtume . Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures , phrases played on his wah @-@ wah processed trumpet , and drones from an accompanying electric organ . The evolving nature of the performance led to the widespread misunderstanding that Agharta 's music had no compositional basis . 
 Agharta was first released in Japan by CBS / Sony in August 1975 just before Davis retired due to increasingly poor health and exhaustion . At the record label 's suggestion , it was titled after the legendary subterranean city . Davis enlisted Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo to design its artwork , which depicted the cityscape of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism . An alternate cover was produced for the album 's 1976 release in North America by Columbia Records . 
 A highly divisive record , Agharta further challenged Davis ' jazz audience and was widely panned by contemporary critics ; reviewers found the music discordant , and complained of Cosey 's loud guitar sounds and Davis ' sparse trumpet playing . It was reevaluated positively in subsequent years , while a generation of younger musicians was influenced by the band 's abrasive music and cathartic playing , particularly Cosey 's effects @-@ laden free improvisations . Agharta became viewed as an important jazz @-@ rock record , a dramatically dynamic group performance , and the culmination of Davis ' electric period spanning the late 1960s and mid @-@ 1970s .

 In the early 1970s , Miles Davis continued exploring directions radically different from the jazz music that made him renowned in the 1950s and 1960s . The music from this electric period in his career found him experimenting with rock , funk , African rhythms , emerging electronic music technology , and an ever @-@ changing lineup of musicians who played electric instruments . Davis attracted younger audiences as his fusion music became more radical and abstract while alienating older listeners , musicians , and critics in the jazz scene who accused him of selling out . After his 1972 album On the Corner , he began to focus more on performing live , working in the studio only sporadically and haphazardly ; the 1974 releases Big Fun and Get Up with It compiled recordings he made between 1969 and 1974 . By 1973 , Davis had established most of his band 's line @-@ up , a septet featuring bassist Michael Henderson , guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas , drummer Al Foster , percussionist James Mtume , and saxophonist Dave Liebman ; Liebman left the group in 1974 and was replaced by Sonny Fortune . Lucas , Foster , and Mtume functioned as the band 's rhythm section , while Cosey , Henderson , and Fortune were given space to improvise as soloists . Their concerts — played frequently at rock venues and festivals — became opportunities for Davis and his sidemen to test new musical ideas and ways to exploit electronic equipment . 
 Davis toured relentlessly for two years while tolerating intense physical pain and difficulty walking , caused by joint pain from sickle @-@ cell anaemia , badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck , and osteoporosis in his left hip , which had been operated on a decade earlier . He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath , especially when playing the trumpet . To numb the pain , he became increasingly dependent on self @-@ medicating with painkillers , cocaine , and morphine , which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings ; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile . By the end of 1974 , a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine 's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished . Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles , he kept his touring schedule intense . " He was like the general looking at the fort and they had a moat and we were going to get in that fort " , Henderson later said . " That was the attitude of the band . We didn 't give a shit what the critics said . People are gonna like what they like , but if you don 't like it , respect it . Respect that I have the right to do what I do . Because with or without you , we 're going to do it anyway . " 
 In 1975 , the 48 @-@ year old Davis embarked on a three @-@ week tour of Japan ; between January 22 and February 8 , he played 14 concerts in large @-@ hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews . Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his " magnificent and energetic " band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra : " Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent . " Throughout the tour , Davis had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse , while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket . Unable to work his trumpet 's volume and effects pedals because of the pain in his legs , he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances . To relieve his pain and perform , Davis used codeine and morphine , smoked , and drank large quantities of Heineken beer . On several occasions , he was able to play two concerts in one day , as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka . " The Japanese people were very beautiful " , Henderson recalled from the concerts . " They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers . " The performances were recorded by Japan 's CBS / Sony record label under the supervision of Teo Macero , Davis ' producer of 15 years . They were released as two double albums — Agharta , featuring the afternoon concert , was first released in Japan in August 1975 and later in North America in 1976 ; the evening show was issued in Japan as Pangaea in 1976 . 
 = = Composition and performance = = 
 For the first of the afternoon concert 's two sets , Davis ' septet performed the compositions " Tatu " , " Agharta Prelude " , and " Maiysha " ( from Get Up with It ) , making up Agharta 's first disc of music . The second @-@ set performances of " Right Off " ( from Davis ' 1971 album Jack Johnson ) , " Ife " ( from Big Fun ) , and " Wili ( = For Dave ) " spanned the second disc ; between the " Right Off " and " Ife " segments , the band improvised a passage based on " So What " ( from Davis ' 1959 album Kind of Blue ) for 41 seconds after Henderson started to play its ostinato . The pieces were performed in medleys , which were given generic track titles on the record , such as " Prelude " and " Interlude " . As with his other live releases in the 1970s , Davis refused to have individual compositions specified in the track listing because he felt critics and other listeners often overlooked the music 's intrinsic meaning by indulging in abstract musical analysis . " I 'm not doing anything , it doesn 't need an explanation " , Davis later told Leonard Feather . Music scholars were able to identify the pieces through an examination of what Davis researcher Enrico Merlin called " coded phrases " , which Davis played on trumpet or organ to signify the end of one segment and direct the band toward the next section . He first used such cues and modulations when recording " Flamenco Sketches " in 1959 , Merlin said . 
 The pieces featured on Agharta were part of a typical set list for the group , but their performances of each sometimes changed almost beyond recognition from concert to concert . This , along with the track names , led to the widespread misunderstanding that the music was mostly or entirely improvised and unstructured . Lucas explained that the band started each performance with a " very defined compositional basis " before developing it further in a highly structured yet " very free way " ; the " Right Off " segment was improvised from the original recording 's E @-@ flat riff . Davis had the band play around a single chord in a piece for several minutes with variations as each member performed in a different time signature ; Foster might have been playing in common time and Mtume in compound duple metre or septuple time , while the guitarists would comp in another tempo altogether . " That 's a lot of intricate shit we were working off this one chord " , Davis remarked . From Lucas ' perspective , this kind of " structured improvisation " resulted in significant interplay between the rhythm section and allowed the band to improvise " a lot more than just the notes that were being played in the solos ; we were improvising the entire song as we went along . " 
 Like Pangaea and Dark Magus — the two other albums showcasing the septet — Agharta revealed what Amiri Baraka described as Davis ' affinity for minimalism . He abandoned melodic and harmonic conventions in favor of riffs , cross @-@ rhythms , and funk grooves as a backdrop for soloists to improvise throughout . Davis had preferred understated compositions throughout his career but by the mid 1970s he showed a deeper embrace of rhythm , inspired by Afrocentric politics . When Mtume and Cosey joined the band , his live music lost most of its " European sensibilities " and " settled down into a deep African thing , a deep African @-@ American groove " emphasizing rhythm and drums rather than individual solos , Davis said , although he did not completely reject melody . " We ain 't in Africa , and we don 't play just chants . There 's some theory under what we do . " Simon Reynolds , who categorized Agharta as a jazz @-@ rock record , wrote in The Wire that the music " offered a drastic intensification of rock 's three most radical aspects : space , timbre , and groove " . In Martha Bayles ' opinion , it drew from jazz only in its element of free improvisation and from rock only in its use of electronics and " ear @-@ bleeding volume " . The album also showcased Davis ' avant @-@ garde impulses ; according to Greg Tate , the septet created " a pan @-@ ethnic web of avant @-@ garde music " , while Phil Alexander from Mojo said it was " both ambient yet thrashing , melodic yet coruscating " , and suggestive of Karlheinz Stockhausen 's electronic experiments . 
 During the concert , Davis directed approximately 50 stops or breaks to the band , particularly the rhythm section , by gesturing with his head or hand . These stops served as dramatic turning points in the tension @-@ release structure of the performances , changing their tempo and allowing the band to alternate between quiet passages and intense climaxes . Davis also interjected the performances with drone washes from his Yamaha organ , achieving a " strange , nearly perverse presence " that Mikal Gilmore believed " defined the temper " of the music . Lucas said Davis applied a feel for dynamics he had developed earlier in his career playing jazz but with a greater array of contrasts , including atonal , dissonant chords , and his own bebop trumpet playing set against the group 's funk rhythms . " Extreme textures and extreme volume " , Lucas explained , " were as much part of the palette as the contrasting chord and rhythmic structures . Being equipped like a full rock band , we sometimes literally blew the walls out . " During the " Tatu " and " Agharta Prelude " segments , Davis abruptly stopped and started the septet several times to shift tempos by playing a dissonant , cacophonous organ figure , giving Cosey space to generate eccentric , psychedelic figures and effects . The main theme for " Tatu " had been played at a slower tempo when Cosey first joined Davis ' band , but they played it faster as their rapport grew , especially by the time of the Japanese tour . Cosey credited Davis with having the ability to " transmit thoughts and ideas " to the soloists with his playing . 
 The rhythmic direction of the music was occasionally interrupted by densely layered percussive and electronic effects , including repeated whirring and grinding sounds . Cosey generated these sounds by running his guitar through a ring modulator and an EMS Synthi A. The latter device was an early synthesizer with knobs and buttons but no keyboard , making it useful for producing abstract noises rather than exact pitches and melodies . He used it to suggest a certain soundscape during each performance , " whether we were in space , or underwater or a group of Africans playing — just different soundscapes " . Onstage , he also had a table set up holding a mbira , claves , <unk> bells , and several other hand percussion instruments , which he played or struck with a mallet to indicate a different break or stop . " I would hit them just like they do at [ boxing ] fights ! " , Cosey recalled . His synthesizer sometimes interacted with the experimental sounds Mtume was able to generate from his drum machine , such as during the " Ife " segment . Davis gave the instrument to Mtume after receiving it from Yamaha , the Japanese tour 's sponsor , and told him " see what you can do with it . " Rather than use it to create rhythms , Mtume processed the drum machine through several different pedals and phase shifters such as the Mu @-@ Tron Bi @-@ Phase , creating a sound he said was " total tapestry " . 
 Unlike Davis ' previous recordings , the cadenzas throughout Agharta were mostly played by Fortune and Cosey . Fortune alternated between soprano and alto saxophones and the flute , performing with a " substance and structure " Gilmore believed was very much indebted to John Coltrane during his A Love Supreme ( 1965 ) period . He performed his longest alto saxophone solo on " Right Off " , which opened the record 's second disc in a " propulsive " segment Gilmore said " flies by like a train ride in a dream , where scenes flash past the window in a fascinating and illusive dream " . Cosey played a Guild S @-@ 100 electric guitar and heavily employed chromaticism , dissonance , and feedback in his improvisations on Agharta . He alternated between several effects pedals set up underneath his table of percussion instruments , including a fuzzbox for distorting guitar sounds and two different wah @-@ wah pedals he used during solos or when playing more mellow tones . Cosey often arranged his guitar strings in different places on the fretboard and never played in standard tuning , using at least 36 different tuning systems , each of which altered the style and sound of his playing . According to <unk> <unk> from Premier Guitar , his experimental guitar playing was rooted in the blues and displayed a sense of phrasing that was aggressive and " blistering " yet " somehow also restrained " , particularly in his control of feedback . 
 Davis had enlisted Cosey to provide his music with sounds from the electric blues and Jimi Hendrix , whose use of distortion and the E @-@ flat tuning was shared by Cosey . According to Charles Shaar Murray , he evoked the guitarist 's <unk> , free jazz @-@ inspired solos while Lucas performed in the manner of Hendrix 's more lyrical rhythm and blues songs ; Cosey 's guitar was separated to the left channel and Lucas ' to the right on Agharta . Jazz scholar Stuart Nicholson wrote that Davis utilized his guitarists in a way which realized the " waves of harmonic distortion " Hendrix had explored in his own music . In Murray 's view , the album invoked his influence on Davis more explicitly than any other of his records ; Nicholson considered it to be the " closest approximation " to the music they could have recorded together . Davis veered from succinct and expressive solos to unsentimental wails on his trumpet , which suggested he was still mourning Hendrix 's 1970 death , Murray surmised . That year , Davis had started playing with a wah @-@ wah pedal affixed to his trumpet in order to emulate the register Hendrix achieved on his guitar . By the time of the concert , Davis had developed what Philip Freeman described as " a new tone , the wiggly , shimmering ribbons of sound that are heard on Agharta " , where his wah @-@ wah processed solos often sounded frantic and melancholic , like " twisted streams of raw pain " . 
 Davis played his trumpet sparsely throughout the concert , often sounding obscured by the rhythm section . His presence on Agharta reflected what John Szwed called " the feel and shape of a musician 's late work , an egoless music that precedes its creator 's death " . Drawing on Theodor W. Adorno 's commentary of Ludwig van Beethoven 's late works , Szwed said " the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality . It was as if Miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for the past thirty years , both terrifying and joyful . " After Lucas ' first and only solo of the show climaxed the " Ife " segment , Davis introduced " Wili ( = For Dave ) " with a few organ chords , culminating in Cosey 's final solo and a trumpet passage by Davis , which Paul Tingen characterized as plaintive and introspective . According to him , live music shows typically developed toward reaching a final climax , but Davis ' concerts " often dissolved into entropy " . On Agharta , Tingen said , a " deep sadness " hung over the music as the energy of the " Wili ( = For Dave ) " piece " slowly drained away " to the record 's fade out . The Japanese CD edition ended with nine more minutes of atmospheric feedback , percussion , and synthesizer sounds .

 Agharta 's title was proposed by CBS / Sony as a reference to the subterranean utopian city . The city 's legend was one of several Eastern versions of the Hollow Earth theory proposing that an ancient high culture originally lived on the Earth 's surface but was forced to flee below because of some political or geological crisis . The myth depicted the city as a divine source of power , claiming that its inhabitants were highly spiritual , advanced beings who would save the Earth from materialism and destructive technology after a cataclysmic event . It was first conceived by 19th @-@ century French thinker Louis <unk> as a land ruled by an Ethiopian ruler ; Alexandre Saint @-@ Yves d <unk> later described it as " drowning in celestial <unk> all visible distinctions of race in a single chromatic of light and sound , singularly removed from the usual notions of perspective and acoustics . " 
 The album 's artwork was designed by Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo , who had been creating silkscreen prints on themes of Agharta and the mythical kingdom of Shambhala the year before the Festival Hall concert ; his artwork for Carlos Santana 's 1974 album Lotus featured such themes . In the early 1970s , Yokoo had found his growing popularity in Japan distracting and moved to the United States , where he was able to get more of his work published . After returning to Japan , he received a phone call from Davis , who had seen his work and wanted him to create a cover for the Agharta record . Before designing the cover , Yokoo listened to a preliminary tape of the concert , meditated , and reflected on his reading of Raymond W. Bernard 's 1969 book The Hollow Earth . Bernard had written that the city existed in a large cavern in the center of the Earth , while Yokoo said he believed " Agharta could be down there under the sea like Atlantis or even hidden in the jungle like the lost city of El Dorado . " He also drew on elements from other Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism in his design . Critics who eventually saw the album 's packaging thought he had been inspired instead by the psychedelic drugs popular at the time . 
 The front cover depicted an advanced civilization with a vast landscape of skyscrapers and red , sunburst @-@ like flames rising out of the cityscape as representations of Agharta 's power . Yokoo used a combination of collage , airbrushing , and painting techniques as he had with his previous work , along with postcards collected from his trips to Tahiti and New York City ; the cityscape on the front cover was taken from one of his postcards . The back cover showed the city submerged in water , embedded in coral reefs , and hovered over by a diver , fish , and a squid ascending from the city . According to graphic designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell , Yokoo depicted groups of jellyfish , coral reefs , and brightly colored fish to suggest an association between Agharta and Atlantis . The foreground of the back cover 's illustration featured a reptilian creature . Cultural studies researcher Dagmar Buchwald interpreted this image as an allusion to similar ideas about Lemuria , a mythological continent during Earth 's prehistory that was inhabited by an advanced civilization later forced under the Earth 's surface after its homeland was destroyed by a great flood . 
 A UFO was also depicted on the back cover , either ascending or descending in a spotlight over Agharta . The album 's inside packaging featured images of winged superhuman beings known as the Agharta supermen , who guarded the city 's entrances and secret tunnels . An inscription in the original LP 's gatefold sleeve explained the connection between the UFO and the Agharta supermen : " During various periods in history the supermen of Agharta came to the surface of Earth to teach the human race how to live together in peace and save us from wars , catastrophe , and destruction . The apparent sighting of several flying saucers soon after the bombing of Hiroshima may represent one visitation . " The album 's 1976 North American release had different artwork designed by John Berg , the art director from Davis ' U.S. label Columbia Records . In its liner notes , an inscription said the record should be listened to at the highest possible volume , and Davis was credited for the arrangements . After it was released , Macero received a complaint from Columbia 's accounting department about Davis being compensated $ 2 @,@ 500 per arrangement , arguing that none of the music sounded as if it had been arranged .

 Agharta was originally panned by critics , becoming the most widely criticized of Davis ' double albums in the 1970s . According to The Stranger 's Dave Segal , it was one of the most divisive records ever , challenging both critics and the artist 's core audience much in the same way Lou Reed 's Metal Machine Music album had in 1975 . In The New York Times , Robert Palmer wrote that Agharta was marred by long stretches of " sloppy , one @-@ chord jams " , disjointed sounds , and a banal quality clearly rendered by the impeccable Japanese engineering . He complained that Davis ' use of the wah @-@ wah pedal inhibited his ability to phrase notes and that the septet sounded poor " by rock standards " , particularly Cosey , whose <unk> guitar " whined and rumbled like a noisy machine shop " , relegating Lucas to background riffs . Jazz Forum critic Andrzej <unk> said Fortune seemed to be the only jazz musician on the record , finding his solos often flawless while disparaging the performances of Davis , Lucas , and Cosey , whose guitar and synthesizer effects he found pointlessly brutal . In <unk> 's opinion , the individual segments did not cohere as a whole and were further hampered by the clichéd " rock phraseology " of the guitarists , whom he said lacked wit , harmony , and taste . Ian Carr , a biographer of Davis , felt his trumpet sounded fatigued , dejected , and out of place with the band 's intense rhythms and monotonously noisy guitars ; in general , he found the music " too non @-@ Western in the sense of too much rhythm and not enough structure " . 
 In The Village Voice , Gary Giddins penned an angrily dismissive review of Agharta , in which he charged Davis with failing to assert his musical presence on the terribly " sad " record . A few days after it was published , he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs , industrial @-@ strength scouring pads , and a card that read , " The next time you review Miles Davis clean out your head . " Although Giddins dismissed the message , Agharta grew to become one of his favorite albums from Davis ' electric period , as he reevaluated its elements of drama , relentless tension , and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey 's careers . " There really is not a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself " , Giddins wrote . Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976 , calling it " a kind of firestorm for the ' 70s " with a " positively cosmic " rhythmic foundation and Davis " the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock " . In Down Beat , Gilmore said the band performed best on the side one and three 's breakneck segments , where Cosey 's ferocious playing " achieved a staggering emotional dimension " lacking on the slower passages , which were redeemed by Davis ' elegiac trumpet . The concert itself was received enthusiastically by the Osaka audience . " I had no idea what [ they ] were going to do " , Henderson recalled . " They gave us a standing ovation that was almost as long as the concert . " 
 After returning from Japan , Davis fell ill again and was hospitalized for three months . He held a few more concerts and studio sessions with the band , but his health worsened ; their last show on September 5 , 1975 , in Central Park ended abruptly when Davis left the stage and began to cry in pain . He retired soon after — citing physical , spiritual , and creative exhaustion — and lived as a recluse for the next several years , often struggling with bouts of depression and further medical treatment . Agharta was reassessed positively by critics during this period , and in 1980 Davis returned to recording music . He abandoned the direction he had pursued in the 1970s , instead playing a style of fusion far more melodic and accessible to audiences , until his death in 1991 . The day after he died , Prague 's Wenceslas Square saw the opening of the <unk> Jazz Centrum , a small jazz club named after the album , hosting nightly performances and an annual jazz festival played by local and international acts . In January of that year , the album was reissued in the U.S. by Columbia on CD , featuring a remaster Tingen said was inferior to the original LP in sound and mix quality . Sony later remastered the album again as part of their Miles Davis reissue campaign and Master Sound series in Japan , which improved its sound using Super Bit Mapping . This remaster was made available in the U.S. for the first time in 2009 , when Agharta was one of 52 albums re @-@ issued in mini @-@ LP replica sleeves as a part of Miles Davis : The Complete Columbia Album Collection , a box set released by Sony Legacy . 
 Of the albums documenting Davis ' 1973 – 75 band , Agharta was considered by many critics to be the best . For Tingen , it represented the " high plateau " of Davis ' electric explorations ; because he had given the band leeway for constant interplay , the music exhibited an " organic and fluid quality " , with a greater variety of textures , rhythms , timbres , and moods than Dark Magus . Davis biographer Jack Chambers believed it proved far better than most of his other electric albums ; the " Maiysha " and " Jack Johnson " segments , Chambers wrote , " magically brought into focus the musical forces over which many thought Davis had lost control " . Reflecting on his 1970s concert recordings , J. D. Considine contended that Agharta 's " alternately audacious , poetic , hypnotic , and abrasive " music had endured the passage of time best . Although Davis ' use of wah @-@ wah was frequently dismissed in the past as a failed experiment , Richard Cook and Brian Morton wrote in The Penguin Guide to Jazz ( 2006 ) that the effects pedal in fact helped him achieve remarkably adventurous playing on the album , " creating surges and ebbs in a harmonically static line , allowing Miles to build huge melismatic variations on a single note " . Cook named it among Davis ' best works and the culmination of the music he had begun to explore on Bitches Brew ( 1970 ) ; as well as possessing an " epic " sound and scope , Agharta was " a great band record " , in his opinion . " Even though Davis contributed only telling details , he still cued exceptional performances from his men . " Robert Christgau saw it as his finest music since Jack Johnson , an " angry , dissociated , funky " record built on the septet 's virtuosic performance , particularly Foster 's " guileless show of shops " and Fortune 's woodwind playing , which he deemed the best on a Davis album from this decade . Henry Kaiser called Agharta the best ensemble performance of jazz 's electric era , and Steve <unk> , writing in MusicHound Jazz ( 1998 ) , credited Davis with conducting the album 's " heroes " to sculpt " moments of shattering beauty and soul @-@ rending vehemence " . 
 Despite being one of Davis ' lesser @-@ known records , Agharta belonged to a period in his career that influenced artists in British jazz , new wave , and punk rock , including guitarists Robert Quine and Tom Verlaine . It inspired a generation of musicians to focus on cathartic playing rather than precise instrumentation and composition . Quine was particularly fascinated by Cosey 's electric guitar sounds ; Lester Bangs , who attended his performance with the Voidoids in 1977 , claimed " he steals from Agharta ! And makes it work ! " Other writers later lauded the quality and originality of Cosey 's playing on the album , viewing it as a standard for guitar mastery and compositional contrast . Down Beat critic Bill Milkowski credited his excursive style for " spawning an entire school of ' sick ' guitar playing " and said the combination of Fortune 's acerbic sax lines atop Foster , Henderson , and Lucas ' syncopated grooves were 10 years ahead of Steve Coleman and Greg <unk> 's M @-@ Base experiments . Tingen found Cosey 's solos amazingly revealing and still ahead of their time when heard decades later : " Sometimes growling , scurrying around all corners like a caged tiger , sometimes soaring like a bird , sometimes deliriously abstract , sometimes elegantly melodic and tender , his electric guitar concept is one of the most original to have been devised on the instrument . " In Christgau 's opinion , " the noises he produced for the second half of side one comprise some of the greatest free improvisations ever heard in a ' jazz ' - ' rock ' context . " 
 According to Nicholson , Agharta and other jazz @-@ rock recordings such as Emergency ! ( 1970 ) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward " a whole new musical language ... a wholly independent genre quite apart from the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before " . This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s , he said , although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s , especially on artists in the experimental rock genre . Along with On the Corner , it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys ' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication . In 1998 , composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University . In it , he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences " to evolve or modernize itself " . In an interview several years later , Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the " fringes of jazz " and a place most other music has not explored since . In the All Music Guide to Jazz ( 2002 ) , Thom Jurek considered it to be inarguably the " greatest electric funk @-@ rock jazz record ever " and declared " there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music .

Part 1 first aired on November 11 and Part 2 aired on November 18 , 2001 on Fox in the United States . The episodes were written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz . " Nothing Important Happened Today I " was directed by Kim Manners and " Nothing Important Happened Today II " was directed by Tony Wharmby . The episode helped to explore the series ' overarching mythology and earned a Nielsen rating of 6 @.@ 5 and was viewed by 10 @.@ 6 million viewers , whereas the second part earned a rating of 5 @.@ 9 and was viewed by 9 @.@ 4 million viewers . Critical reception to the episode was largely mixed . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files ; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) , and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) . " Nothing Important Happened Today " is a storyline milestone for the series . It introduced both the story arc about baby William which would continue to develop throughout the ninth season and AD Brad Follmer , a recurring character for the show 's ninth season . Part 1 deals with the investigation of Deputy Director Alvin Kersh by special agent John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Doggett 's related investigation into the death of EPA official Carl Wormus . In Part 2 , Scully , Reyes , and Doggett are led to a ship , where they find evidence of experimentation on human embryos . 
 The episode was supposed to mark the first appearance of recurring regular Lucy Lawless as Shannon McMahon , a female Super Soldier , but Lawless ' high @-@ risk pregnancy prevented her from returning to the show after these episodes . These episodes marked , however , the first appearance of recurring regular , Cary Elwes as Brad Follmer , an FBI Assistant Director . The phrase " Nothing Important Happened Today " comes from King George III 's supposed diary entry on 4 July 1776 , the same day that America declared Independence from Britain .

 Carl Wormus , an EPA official , picks up a beautiful woman , Shannon McMahon ( Lucy Lawless ) , in a Baltimore bar . While he is driving her home , she forces the car off a bridge and holds Wormus underwater until he drowns . Later , Monica Reyes ( Annabeth Gish ) meets FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer ( Cary Elwes ) in his office , where he hands her two videotapes from the night Dana Scully 's ( Gillian Anderson ) son was born . The tapes show no evidence of the paranormal events John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) has reported . Doggett goes to Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) apartment to consult him , but finds it empty . Meanwhile , McMahon surfaces at a water reclamation plant and drowns a worker there . 
 Scully refuses to disclose Mulder 's whereabouts to Doggett , Meanwhile AD Skinner urges him to drop his investigation of Deputy Director Alvin Kersh 's ( James Pickens , Jr . ) actions against the X @-@ Files . Doggett tries to contact some of his old friends from the Marine Corps to find out what happened to Knowle Rohrer ( Adam Baldwin ) ; one of them turns out to be McMahon . Meanwhile , at FBI headquarters , an unseen figure slips Wormus ' obituary to Reyes . Scully 's baby causes the mobile of his crib to spin without touching it . Scully is shocked , contacts Doggett , and retracts her request , telling him to continue his investigation . Scully also performs an autopsy on Wormus ' body , where she finds fingerprints on his ankle . After leaving , Scully and Reyes see McMahon , who removes the body from the morgue . Follmer , whom Kersh has ordered to rein in Doggett , arrives at the scene and accuses Scully and Reyes of moving the body . 
 The Lone Gunmen find that Wormus had been receiving data from Roland McFarland , the drowned reclamation worker . Doggett breaks into McFarland 's office with Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) and finds files on <unk> , a mutation @-@ inducing chemical , but Follmer arrives . Doggett slips into a filtration tank to hide , but is pulled deep underwater by McMahon .

 The Captain ( Ryan Cutrona ) of a navy ship delivers a communication to Doctor <unk> ( Jeff Austin ) , who orders the ship 's captain to return the vintage WWII vessel to its base . Follmer leaves the water reclamation facility after failing to spot Doggett , who is still underwater ; Shannon McMahon keeps him alive by passing air from her lungs into his . Back at FBI headquarters , Reyes is warned by Follmer to distance herself from Doggett and his investigation of Kersh . Reyes believes that Follmer simply wants to get Doggett out of the FBI and storms out of the office . Doggett wakes up at his home to find McMahon , who tells him that both she and Knowle Rohrer are Super Soldiers , and that they cannot be killed , part of a military program . Doggett calls Dana Scully to his house , and McMahon tells them that the program is to be expanded by adding <unk> to the water supply . The navy ship is now docked in Baltimore and the Captain leaves the ship against security rules to call Carl Wormus , who was previously drowned by McMahon . Upon The Captain 's return to the ship , Knowle Rohrer approaches him , informing him that he is now second @-@ in @-@ command . He later queries The Captain as to the vessel 's mission . The body of the original officer is found in the water nearby . 
 Scully examines McMahon and finds her to be physically normal , Doggett thinks that they may be onto something whilst Reyes remains skeptical . Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer . Reyes tries to find out more about McMahon 's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans to contaminate the water supply . The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus , who tells him to contact the FBI , Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping . The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab , demanding that <unk> surrender the project 's data . He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him . After hearing Reyes ' findings , Scully , Reyes and Doggett go to the ship . They expect to meet the captain , but instead find Rohrer . Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett 's skull , he is decapitated by McMahon . Rohrer is presumed dead , but soon awakens and stabs McMahon . Both bodies tumble into the water . The three agents board the ship , which is abandoned , and find the captain 's decapitated body . Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova . However , she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge . The agents narrowly escape the explosion . 
 Later , Doggett confronts Kersh , who was not implicated in the conspiracy . Kersh explains to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett , and that he had told Mulder to flee , but ultimately it was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so . Meanwhile , Scully dreams of McMahon 's and Rohrer 's lifeless bodies below the harbor . Suddenly , she sees McMahon 's eyes snap open . Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William 's mobile ; it begins to move on its own accord . 
 = = Production = = 
 The style of the opening credits in " Nothing Important Happened Today " were changed from the original credits , which , more or less , had been the same for the previous eight seasons . The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Annabeth Gish and Mitch Pileggi . As Pileggi was absent from the following episode , " Dæmonicus " , the opening titles were altered and only featured Gillian Anderson , Robert Patrick and Gish . This version was used for all the episodes in the season without Pileggi . 
 The phrase " Nothing Important Happened Today " comes from King George III 's supposed diary entry on 4 July 1776 , the same day that America declared Independence from Britain . The first part of the episode marks the first appearance of Assistant Director Brad Follmer , who was named after Chris Carter 's writing assistant . Five different actors portrayed Baby William : Rikki Held , Rowdy Held , Ashley Knutson , James Riker and Travis Riker . The tagline for Part 2 is " Nothing Important Happened Today " , replacing the usual phrase " The Truth is Out There " . 
 After learning about the 2001 cancellation of Xena Warrior Princess , Lawless was approached by the producers of The X @-@ Files for a spot on the show . According to Lawless , one reason why she made an appearance on the show was that her daughter was a " mad X @-@ Files fan " . She further commented that she knew about the show and based her character Xena on Fox Mulder . 
 Originally , Shannon McMahon was to be a recurring character and was due to be featured in " The Truth " , the series finale of The X @-@ Files . However , Lawless , who has a history of miscarriages , became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed ; her high @-@ risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes . Carter called Lawless " hot stuff " , saying it was " fun " having a female Super Soldier , something that had never occurred to him or to the show 's production crew . 
 In the first underwater scene , most of which was shot at the water tank at Universal , Lawless had to be seat @-@ belted into a car that was supposed to be submerged thirteen feet . In actuality , the water tank was four feet deep . Lawless , being six feet tall , had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene . For the special effects team , one of the hardest parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit .

 " Nothing Important Happened Today , Part 1 " earned a Nielsen household rating of 6 @.@ 5 share , meaning that it was seen by 6 @.@ 5 % of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , of the nation 's estimated households . The episode was viewed by 10 @.@ 6 million viewers and ranked number 55 for the week ending November 11 and subsequently became the second most watched episode of the ninth season behind the series finale " The Truth " .

The first part of the episode , which aired on Sunday , November 11 , competed with Saving Private Ryan which aired on ABC . The second part of the episode earned the lowest rating on the night of November 18 , receiving lower ratings and viewership numbers than The Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle . When talking about the ninth season , Carter stated , " We lost our audience on the first episode . It 's like the audience had gone away , and I didn 't know how to find them . I didn 't want to work to get them back because I believed what we are doing deserved to have them back " . 
 The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 4 – Super Soldiers , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The episode received mixed reviews from critics . Daryl H. Miller of Los Angeles Times wrote positively of the episode , claiming it is " craftily written , solidly acted and moodily photographed " . Michael R. Farkash of The Hollywood Reporter gave the first part of the episode a largely positive review . Farkash called it " entertaining and appealing " and noted its " suspenseful plot twists and fascinating visuals " . An unnamed staff writer of Airlock Alpha was mostly positive about the episode , with the exception of Cary Elwes as Brad Follmer , calling Elwes ' acting " forced " . Rob Lowman from the Los Angeles Daily News said that Carter had been able to " breathe new life " into the series mythology arc , and had a positive view of Lucy Lawless ' performance . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B + . Starpulse named the changed credits the " Most Shocking Moment " in the series run , writing that the most drastic moment " came with the opening credits for season nine , a complete re @-@ design that saw Annabeth Gish and Mitch Pileggi added to the opening sequence and the familiar graphics totally scrapped . These credits looked like they belonged to a different series and at that point , it was . " 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the first part a " C " , and the second part a " C – " . He argued that the series was unable to figure both out how to re @-@ situate itself after the events of September 11 , and deal with the permanent departure of Duchovny . Ultimately , he wrote that the episodes as a whole represent " a limp piece of storytelling that has maybe enough good ideas for three @-@ quarters of an episode but is stretched across two for no particular reason . " M.A. Crang , in his book Denying the Truth : Revisiting The X @-@ Files after 9 / 11 , was highly critical of the script , arguing it was difficult " to pinpoint any significant moments that occur during either episode " , but he did praise the production team 's execution of " some impressive set @-@ pieces . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated both episodes one star out of five . In a review of the first part , the two noted that " this isn 't quite the dullest season opener to The X @-@ Files [ but ] this episode [ … ] has all the passion of a wet Monday morning . " In a review of the second half , the two noted , " there is at least the semblance of drama here , but this second episode isn 't significantly better than the first . " Marisa Guthrie from the Boston Herald felt that Gillian Anderson 's character , Dana Scully had been " rendered impotent " . 
 = Alan Charlesworth = 
 Air Vice Marshal Alan Moorehouse Charlesworth , CBE , AFC ( 17 September 1903 – 21 September 1978 ) was a senior commander in the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . Born in Tasmania , he graduated from the Royal Military College , Duntroon , and served with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment in Queensland before transferring to the Air Force in 1925 . Most of his pre @-@ war flying career was spent with No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria . In 1932 he undertook a series of survey flights around Australia , earning the Air Force Cross . Charlesworth 's early wartime commands included No. 2 Squadron at Laverton , and RAAF Station Pearce in Western Australia . Appointed Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Eastern Area in December 1943 , he was promoted temporary air commodore the following year and took over as AOC North @-@ Western Area in Darwin , Northern Territory . 
 Charlesworth 's control of air operations during the North @-@ Western Area Campaign led to his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire following the end of World War II . Retaining his wartime rank , he took charge of the newly formed School of Land / Air Warfare from 1947 until 1949 , when he assumed command of RAAF Station Williamtown , New South Wales . He was posted to Japan later that year as Chief of Staff , British Commonwealth Occupation Force , and organised support for RAAF units involved in the Korean War . Returning to Australia in 1951 , he was raised to acting air vice marshal and became AOC Southern Area . Charlesworth 's final appointment before retiring from the Air Force was commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , in 1954 – 55 . After leaving the military he served as Director of Recruiting in the late 1950s , and later as a judge 's associate at the Supreme Court of Victoria . He died at his home in Glen Iris , Victoria , in 1978 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Born in <unk> , Tasmania , on 17 September 1903 , Alan Charlesworth was the son of a storeman , Edwin Charlesworth , and his wife Louisa . The youth attended <unk> Public School and St Virgil 's College , Hobart , before entering the Royal Military College , Duntroon , in 1920 . He won the Silver Boomerang trophy , awarded to the college 's champion athlete , three years running in 1921 – 23 . In 1923 he was appointed company sergeant major at Duntroon , and received the Sword of Honour upon graduating as a lieutenant later that year . Following service as adjutant and quartermaster with the 2nd Light Horse Regiment in Queensland , Charlesworth transferred to the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as a flying officer on 27 January 1925 . Among his classmates on the 1925 pilots ' course at Point Cook , Victoria , was fellow Duntroon graduate Frederick Scherger . During a training flight on 25 March , Charlesworth 's Avro 504K stalled and spun into a field , injuring him and killing his instructor . Recovering , he was subsequently involved in an accident with future lieutenant general and Governor of New South Wales Eric Woodward , when their plane flipped on landing and came to rest upside down on a fence ; neither man was badly hurt . 
 Charlesworth graduated as a pilot in July 1925 , and was posted to No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria . In January 1926 , he took part in experiments to test parachutes by attaching them to dummies and throwing them out of aircraft in flight . His secondment to the Air Force was made permanent in January 1928 , and he was promoted to flight lieutenant the following month . On 30 April , Charlesworth married Edith Bennett at All Saints Anglican Church , St Kilda ; the couple had a daughter . The next month , he was posted to the United Kingdom on attachment to the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . He attended the RAF School of Photography at Farnborough , before serving with the RAF Survey Flight in British Somaliland during 1929 – 30 . Returning to Australia he was again posted to No. 1 Squadron , taking command of a round @-@ Australia aerial survey conducted in three phases during 1932 in association with the Commonwealth Geologist , Doctor Walter <unk> . Charlesworth 's study in Britain and his experience in Somaliland had made him the RAAF 's leading expert in photographic reconnaissance , which was to be utilised in the search for potential oil fields . 
 The first phase of the survey took place in January – February , employing two Westland Wapitis and seven other Air Force personnel from Nos. 1 and 3 Squadrons to photograph sites in southern Queensland . Despite both aircraft being damaged in a gale at Bourke in northern New South Wales while returning to base , the expedition was considered a success . For the second phase , lasting from July to September , Charlesworth and his team journeyed around the whole of Australia from New South Wales to Queensland , thence to the Northern Territory and Western Australia , before returning to Laverton . The final phase in December explored Tasmania . Charlesworth was awarded the Air Force Cross ( AFC ) for his leadership of the survey , described as a " milestone " in the country 's exploration . Following his survey work , Charlesworth was appointed Staff Officer Photography at RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . In 1934 he returned to Laverton to take up his third and final posting with No. 1 Squadron . By September 1937 , he had been raised to Squadron Leader and was in temporary command of the unit . He had overall charge of a training flight in November – December that ended in disaster , when a Hawker Demon crashed near Cootamundra , New South Wales , and its pilot burned to death ; this was one of a spate of incidents during the year that led to serious questions being raised about the level of flying safety in the RAAF . In March 1939 , Charlesworth was raised to wing commander and took command of No. 2 Squadron , operating Avro Ansons out of Laverton . 
 = = World War II = = 
 As part of the RAAF 's reorganisation following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , No. 2 Group was formed in Sydney on 20 November ; Charlesworth was appointed its Senior Air Staff Officer ( SASO ) . He continued to serve in this position when the group was re @-@ formed as Central Area in March 1940 . Posted to Western Australia to take command of RAAF Station Pearce in August , he was promoted to temporary group captain on 1 September 1940 . He became Senior Administration Officer at the newly established Western Area , Perth , in January the following year . In September 1942 , Charlesworth took over No. 2 Bombing and Gunnery School in Sale , Victoria . He handed over to Group Captain Charles " Moth " Eaton in August 1943 , before briefly taking charge of RAAF Headquarters Forward Echelon in Brisbane . Charlesworth was appointed Air Officer Commanding ( AOC ) Eastern Area , headquartered at Bradfield Park , Sydney , in December 1943 . Eastern Area was responsible for maritime patrol and anti @-@ submarine warfare off the coast of New South Wales and southern Queensland . Japanese submarine activity had decreased in the months prior to Charlesworth taking command , and he was concerned that Allied ships were becoming complacent . He observed " a general slackening off in procedure ; ships are seldom where they should be , and a minority of merchant ships identify themselves to aircraft " . The RAAF 's patrols had also settled into a predictable pattern that would have been easy for an observant submarine captain to avoid . 
 Charlesworth was promoted to temporary air commodore on 1 August 1944 . The following month he was appointed AOC North @-@ Western Area ( NWA ) in Darwin , Northern Territory , replacing Air Vice Marshal Adrian " King " Cole . By this stage of the war , the Allies were advancing north and the tempo of operations in the Darwin area had decreased . Charlesworth immediately raised concerns regarding No. 80 Wing , which operated three squadrons of Spitfire fighters , warning higher command that its morale could drop if it was not either given a more active role in the war or transferred to southern Australia for rest . By October , the wing had received orders to depart NWA for the forward base of Morotai to join the RAAF 's main mobile strike force , First Tactical Air Force ; this move would leave Charlesworth with twelve squadrons at his disposal , including one B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bomber unit and three other Spitfire squadrons . In the meantime , NWA supported the assault on Leyte with attacks on enemy ports , oil facilities , and shipping in the Dutch East Indies using Beaufighters , B @-@ 25 Mitchells , and Liberators . These operations continued through November – December . In April 1945 , Charlesworth sent Mitchells and Liberators against a Japanese convoy led by the cruiser Isuzu ; the bombers damaged the cruiser , and it was subsequently sunk by Allied submarines . The same month , NWA 's Liberators attacked targets in Java in the lead @-@ up to the Battle of Tarakan that commenced on 1 May . By July , Charlesworth 's area command had been denuded of much of its strength as two of its bomber wings were transferred to First Tactical Air Force . 
 = = Postwar career = = 
 Among a small coterie of wartime RAAF commanders considered suitable for further senior roles , Charlesworth retained his rank of air commodore following the cessation of hostilities . He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1946 King 's Birthday Honours for his " conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese " while leading North @-@ Western Area Command . The same year , he relinquished command of North @-@ Western Area and briefly took charge of Eastern Area Command . He was then posted to Britain to undertake a course at the RAF School of Air Support . Returning to Australia , he became the inaugural Commandant of the School of Land / Air Warfare at Laverton in April 1947 . The school transferred to RAAF Station Williamtown , New South Wales , the following year . Charlesworth took overall command of Williamtown in 1949 . In June that year , he succeeded fellow Duntroon graduate Air Commodore John McCauley as Chief of Staff to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . 
 Charlesworth 's workload at BCOF increased considerably with the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 and the need to supply the RAAF 's contribution to the conflict , chiefly No. 77 Squadron . In October , following the death in combat of Squadron Leader Lou Spence , Charlesworth temporarily transferred from Tokyo to Iwakuni so that he could administer No. 77 Squadron and its ancillaries until No. 91 ( Composite ) Wing was formed to take over the task . Upon his return to Australia in June 1951 , he was promoted to acting air vice marshal and appointed AOC Southern Area , headquartered in Albert Park , Melbourne . Towards the end of his tenure , the RAAF 's wartime area command system was transformed into a structure based on function rather than geography . As a result , Southern Area was re @-@ formed as Training Command in October 1953 . In 1954 he returned to the UK to command RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Completing his term in London , Charlesworth retired from the Air Force on 31 December 1955 , and was made an honorary air vice marshal the following year . He was then appointed a technical advisor to the committee organising the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne . In 1958 – 59 , he served as Director of Recruiting Combined Services , and later became a judge 's associate with the Supreme Court of Victoria . In retirement he made his home in Glen Iris , Victoria , where he died on 21 September 1978 . Survived by his wife and daughter , he was accorded an Air Force funeral and cremated .

 = = Design and portrayal = = 
 Leon was created by Hideki Kamiya as a contrast to Chris Redfield from the original Resident Evil , who he felt was the " blunt , tough @-@ guy type " . Though Kamiya admitted that while he was a fan of characters like Chris , as it had already been done , he opted to take Leon 's development in a different direction . He was surprised at how popular Leon had become , praising his later evolution into a " cool looking guy " for Resident Evil 4 and adding that he " fell in love all over again " . Leon was created for Resident Evil 2 as the staff wanted to use a character who had no experience with terrifying situations in contrast to using returning protagonists . While he was originally designed as a veteran police officer , he was changed to a rookie after the original version of Resident Evil 2 ( popularly known as " Resident Evil 1 @.@ 5 " ) had been scrapped . Leon 's design was inspired by the bloodhound of Capcom artist Isao Ohishi . 
 Leon was announced as Resident Evil 4 's protagonist in November 2002 . As the game was developed , it was intended that Leon would be infected with the Progenitor virus . This concept was expanded upon in 2004 , when Leon was meant to contract a bizarre disease in his fight against the game 's enemies . In a documentary explaining the conception of the game 's characters , it was stated that Leon was intended to " look tougher , but also cool " . His face in Resident Evil 4 was modeled after the game 's animation department director Christian <unk> . 
 During development of Resident Evil : Degeneration , producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi stated that he would like to make another game starring Leon as the main character . Resident Evil 5 's producer Jun Takeuchi said that the series ' fans " would really love " a video game featuring both Leon and Chris as the protagonists due to their popularity , and at the same time , it would be " pretty dramatic " if the two characters never met before the series would end . Resident Evil 6 's producer Kobayashi took a liking to Leon and decided to include him in the game since " he is central to the story " . 
 Leon is voiced by Paul Haddad in Resident Evil 2 , by Paul Mercier in Resident Evil 4 , Resident Evil : Degeneration and Resident Evil : The Darkside Chronicles , and by Matthew Mercer in Resident Evil 6 and Resident Evil : Damnation . Mercer described himself as a fan and friend of Mercier and said that he felt honored to take over as the voice of Leon .
