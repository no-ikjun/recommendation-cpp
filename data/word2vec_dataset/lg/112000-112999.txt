 When asked in 1930 what inspired him for A Trip to the Moon , Méliès credited Jules Verne 's novels From the Earth to the Moon and Around the Moon . Cinema historians , the mid @-@ 20th @-@ century French writer Georges Sadoul first among them , have frequently suggested H. G. Wells 's The First Men in the Moon , a French translation of which was published a few months before Méliès made the film , as another likely influence . Sadoul argued that the first half of the film ( up to the shooting of the projectile ) is derived from Verne and that the second half ( the travelers ' adventures on and in the moon ) is derived from Wells . 
 In addition to these literary sources , various film scholars have suggested that Méliès was heavily influenced by other works , especially Jacques Offenbach 's operetta Le voyage dans la lune ( an unauthorized parody of Verne 's novels ) and the A Trip to the Moon attraction at the 1901 Pan @-@ American Exposition in Buffalo , New York . The French film historian Thierry Lefebvre hypothesizes that Méliès drew upon both of these works , but in different ways : he appears to have taken the structure of the film — " a trip to the moon , a moon landing , an encounter with extraterrestrials with a deformity , an underground trek , an interview with the Man in the Moon , and a brutal return to reality back on earth " — directly from the 1901 attraction , but also incorporated many plot elements ( including the presence of six astronomers with pseudo @-@ scientific names , telescopes that transform into stools , a <unk> cannon mounted above ground , a scene in which the moon appears to approach the viewer , a lunar snowstorm , an <unk> scene , and umbrella @-@ wielding travelers ) , not to mention the parodic tone of the film , from the Offenbach operetta . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 As the science writer Ron Miller notes , A Trip to the Moon was one of the most complex films that Méliès had made , and employed " every trick he had learned or invented " . It was his longest film at the time ; both the budget and filming duration were unusually lavish , costing ₣ 10 @,@ 000 to make and taking three months to complete . The camera operators were Théophile <unk> and Lucien <unk> , who worked on a daily basis with Méliès as salaried employees for the Star Film Company . In addition to their work as cameramen , Méliès 's operators also did odd jobs for the company such as developing film and helping to set up scenery , and another salaried operator , François Lallement , appeared onscreen as the marine officer . By contrast , Méliès hired his actors on a film @-@ by @-@ film basis , drawing from talented individuals in the Parisian theatrical world , with which he had many connections . They were paid one Louis d 'or per day , a considerably higher salary than that offered by competitors , and had a full free meal at noon with Méliès . 
 Méliès 's film studio , which he had built in Montreuil , Seine @-@ Saint @-@ Denis in 1897 , was a greenhouse @-@ like building with glass walls and a glass ceiling to let in as much sunlight as possible , a concept used by most still photography studios from the 1860s onward ; it was built with the same dimensions as Méliès 's own Théâtre Robert @-@ Houdin ( 13 @.@ 5 × <unk> ) . Throughout his film career , Méliès worked on a strict schedule of planning films in the morning , filming scenes during the brightest hours of the day , tending to the film laboratory and the Théâtre Robert @-@ Houdin in the late afternoon , and attending performances at Parisian theaters in the evening . 
 According to Méliès 's recollections , much of the unusual cost of A Trip to the Moon was due to the mechanically operated scenery and the Selenite costumes in particular , which were made for the film using cardboard and canvas . Méliès himself sculpted prototypes for the heads , feet , and kneecap pieces in terra cotta , and then created plaster molds for them . A specialist in mask @-@ making used these molds to produce cardboard versions for the actors to wear . One of the backdrops for the film , showing the inside of the glass @-@ roofed workshop in which the space capsule is built , was painted to look like the actual glass @-@ roofed studio in which the film was made . 
 Many of the special effects in A Trip to the Moon , as in numerous other Méliès films , were created using the substitution splice technique , in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered , added , or taken away . Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects , such as the transformation of the astronomers ' telescopes into stools or the disappearance of the exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke . Other effects were created using theatrical means , such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics . The film also features transitional dissolves . 
 The pseudo @-@ tracking shot in which the camera appears to approach the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head . Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor , he set a pulley @-@ operated chair upon a rail @-@ fitted ramp , placed the actor ( covered up to the neck in black velvet ) on the chair , and pulled him toward the camera . In addition to its technical practicality , this technique also allowed Méliès to control the placement of the face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed . A substitution splice allowed a model capsule to suddenly appear in the eye of the actor playing the Moon , completing the shot . Another notable sequence in the film , the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location , was created through multiple exposure , with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean . The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface , created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets . The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots , taking up about twenty seconds of film time . 
 = = = Coloring = = = 
 As with at least 4 % of Méliès 's output ( including major films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies , The Impossible Voyage , and The Barber of Seville ) , some prints of A Trip to the Moon were individually hand @-@ colored by Elisabeth Thuillier 's coloring lab in Paris . Thuillier , a former colorist of glass and celluloid products , directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes , in the colors she chose and specified . Each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style , with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film . On average , Thuillier 's lab produced about sixty hand @-@ colored copies of a film . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Though Méliès 's films were of course silent , they were not intended to be seen silently ; exhibitors often used a <unk> , or narrator , to explain the story as it unfolded on the screen , accompanied by sound effects and live music . Méliès himself took considerable interest in musical accompaniment for his films , and prepared special film scores for several of them , including The Kingdom of the Fairies and The Barber of Seville . However , Méliès never required a specific musical score to be used with any film , allowing exhibitors freedom to choose whatever accompaniment they felt most suitable . When the film was screened at the Olympia music hall in Paris in 1902 , an original film score was reportedly written for it . 
 In 1903 , the English composer Ezra Read published a piano piece called A Trip to the Moon : Comic Descriptive Fantasia , which follows Méliès 's film scene by scene and may have been used as a score for the film ; it may have been commissioned by Méliès himself , who had likely met Read on one of his trips to England . More recent composers who have recorded scores for A Trip to the Moon include Nicolas Godin and Jean @-@ Benoit <unk> of Air ( for the 2011 restoration ; see the Hand @-@ colored version section below ) , Frederick Hodges , Robert Israel , Eric Le Guen , Lawrence <unk> ( a great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Méliès ) , Donald <unk> , and Victor Young ( for an abridged print featured as a prologue to the 1956 film Around the World in 80 Days ) . 
 = = Style = = 
 The film 's style , like that of most of Méliès 's other films , is deliberately theatrical . The mise en <unk> is highly stylized , recalling the traditions of the 19th @-@ century stage , and is filmed by a stationary camera , placed to evoke the perspective of an audience member sitting in a theatre . This stylistic choice was one of Méliès 's first and biggest innovations . Although he had initially followed the popular trend of the time by making mainly actuality films ( short " slice of life " documentary films capturing actual scenes and events for the camera ) , in his first few years of filming Méliès gradually moved into the far less common genre of fictional narrative films , which he called his <unk> <unk> or " artificially arranged scenes . " The new genre was extensively influenced by Méliès 's experience in theatre and magic , especially his familiarity with the popular French féerie stage tradition . In an advertisement he proudly described the difference between his innovative films and the actualities still being made by his contemporaries : " these fantastic and artistic films reproduce stage scenes and create a new genre entirely different from the ordinary cinematographic views of real people and real streets . " 
 Because A Trip to the Moon preceded the development of narrative film editing by filmmakers such as Edwin S. Porter and D. W. Griffith , it does not use the cinematic vocabulary to which American and European audiences later became accustomed , a vocabulary built on the purposeful use of techniques such as varied camera angles , intercutting , juxtapositions of shots , and other filmic ideas . Rather , each camera setup in Méliès 's film is designed as a distinct dramatic scene uninterrupted by visible editing , an approach fitting the theatrical style in which the film was designed . Similarly , film scholars have noted that the most famous moment in A Trip to the Moon plays with temporal continuity by showing an event twice : first the capsule is shown suddenly appearing in the eye of an anthropomorphic moon ; then , in a much closer shot , the landing occurs very differently , and much more realistically , with the capsule actually plummeting into believable lunar terrain . This kind of nonlinear storytelling — in which time and space are treated as repeatable and flexible rather than linear and causal — is highly unconventional by the standards of Griffith and his followers ; before the development of continuity editing , however , other filmmakers performed similar experiments with time . ( Porter , for instance , used temporal discontinuity and repetition extensively in his 1903 film Life of an American Fireman . ) Later in the twentieth century , with sports television 's development of the instant replay , temporal repetition again became a familiar device to screen audiences . 
 Because Méliès does not use a modern cinematic vocabulary , some film scholars have created other frameworks of thought with which to assess his films . For example , some recent academicians , while not necessarily denying Méliès 's influence on film , have argued that his works are better understood as spectacular theatrical creations rooted in the 19th @-@ century stage tradition of the féerie . Similarly , Tom Gunning has argued that to fault Méliès for not inventing a more intimate and cinematic storytelling style is to misunderstand the purpose of his films ; in Gunning 's view , the first decade of film history may be considered a " cinema of attractions , " in which filmmakers experimented with a presentational style based on spectacle and direct address rather than on intricate editing . Though the attraction style of filmmaking declined in popularity in favor of a more integrated " story film " approach , it remains an important component of certain types of cinema , including science fiction films , musicals , and avant @-@ garde films . 
 = = Themes = = 
 With its pioneering use of themes of scientific ambition and discovery , A Trip to the Moon is sometimes described as the first science fiction film . A Short History of Film argues that it codified " many of the basic generic situations that are still used in science fiction films today " . However , several other genre designations are possible ; Méliès himself advertised the film as a pièce à grand spectacle , a term referring to a type of spectacular Parisian stage extravaganza popularized by Jules Verne and Adolphe d <unk> in the second half of the nineteenth century . Richard Abel describes the film as belonging to the féerie genre , as does Frank Kessler . It can also be described simply as a trick film , a catch @-@ all term for the popular early film genre of innovative , special @-@ effects @-@ filled shorts — a genre Méliès himself had codified and popularized in his earlier works . 
 A Trip to the Moon is highly satirical in tone , poking fun at nineteenth @-@ century science by exaggerating it in the format of an adventure story . The film makes no pretense whatsoever to be scientifically plausible ; the real waves in the splashdown scene are the only concession to realism . The film scholar Alison McMahan calls A Trip to the Moon one of the earliest examples of <unk> film , saying it " aims to show the illogicality of logical thinking " with its satirically portrayed inept scientists , anthropomorphic moon face , and impossible transgressions of laws of physics . The film historian Richard Abel believes Méliès aimed in the film to " invert the hierarchal values of modern French society and hold them up to ridicule in a riot of the carnivalesque " . Similarly , the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht described the film as a work " satirizing the pretensions of professors and scientific societies while simultaneously appealing to man 's sense of wonder in the face of an unexplored universe . " 
 There is also a strong anti @-@ imperialist vein in the film 's satire . The film scholar Matthew Solomon notes that the last part of the film ( the parade and commemoration sequence missing in some prints ) is especially forceful in this regard . He argues that Méliès , who had previously worked as an anti @-@ <unk> political cartoonist , mocks imperialistic domination in the film by presenting his colonial conquerors as bumbling <unk> who mercilessly attack the alien lifeforms they meet and return with a mistreated captive amid fanfares of self @-@ congratulation . The statue of Barbenfouillis shown in the film 's final shot even resembles the pompous , bullying colonialists in Méliès 's political cartoons . The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra agrees that " Méliès mocks the pretensions of colonialist accounts of the conquest of one culture by another , " and adds that " his film also thematizes social differentiation on the home front , as the hierarchical patterns on the moon are shown to bear a curious resemblance to those on earth . " 
 = = Release = = 
 Méliès , who had begun A Trip to the Moon in May 1902 , finished the film in August of that year and began selling prints to French distributors in the same month . From September through December 1902 , a hand @-@ colored print of A Trip to the Moon was screened at Méliès 's Théâtre Robert @-@ Houdin in Paris . The film was shown after Saturday and Thursday matinee performances by Méliès 's colleague and fellow magician , Jules @-@ Eugène Legris , who appeared as the leader of the parade in the two final scenes . Méliès sold black @-@ and @-@ white and color prints of the film through his Star Film Company , where the film was assigned the catalogue number 399 – 411 and given the descriptive subtitle Pièce à grand spectacle en 30 tableaux . In France , black @-@ and @-@ white prints sold for ₣ 560 , and hand @-@ colored prints for ₣ 1 @,@ 000 . Méliès also sold the film indirectly through Charles Urban 's Warwick Trading Company in London . 
 Many circumstances surrounding the film — including its unusual budget , length , and production time , as well as its similarities to the 1901 New York attraction — indicate that Méliès was especially keen to release the film in the United States . Because of rampant film piracy , Méliès never received most of the profits of the popular film . One account reports that Méliès sold a print of the film to the Paris photographer Charles <unk> for use in an Algiers theatre , under strict stipulation that the print only be shown in Algeria . <unk> sold the print , and various other Méliès films , to the Edison Manufacturing Company employee Alfred C. <unk> , who sent them directly to Edison 's laboratories to be duplicated and sold by Vitagraph . Copies of the print spread to other firms , and by 1904 Siegmund Lubin , the Selig Polyscope Company , and Edison were all redistributing it . Edison 's print of the film was even offered in a hand @-@ colored version available at a higher price , just as Méliès had done . Méliès was often uncredited altogether ; for the first six months of the film 's distribution , the only American exhibitor to credit Méliès in advertisements for the film was Thomas Lincoln Tally , who chose the film as the inaugural presentation of his Electric Theater . 
 In order to combat the problem of film piracy that became clear during the release of A Trip to the Moon , Méliès opened an American branch of the Star Film Company , directed by his brother Gaston Méliès , in New York in 1903 . The office was designed to sell Méliès 's films directly and to protect them by registering them under United States copyright . The introduction to the English @-@ language edition of the Star Film Company catalog announced : " In opening a factory and office in New York we are prepared and determined energetically to pursue all counterfeiters and pirates . We will not speak twice , we will act ! " 
 In addition to the opening of the American branch , various trade arrangements were made with other film companies , including American Mutoscope and Biograph , the Warwick Trading Company , the Charles Urban Trading Co . , Robert W. Paul 's studio , and Gaumont . In these negotiations , a print sale price of US $ 0 @.@ 15 per foot was standardized across the American market , which proved useful to Méliès . However , later price <unk> by the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908 hastened Méliès 's financial ruin , as his films were impractically expensive under the new standards . In addition , in the years following 1908 his films suffered from the fashions of the time , as the fanciful magic films he made were no longer in vogue . 
 = = Reception = = 
 According to Méliès 's memoirs , his initial attempts to sell A Trip to the Moon to French fairground exhibitors met with failure because of the film 's unusually high price . Finally , Méliès offered to let one such exhibitor borrow a print of the film to screen for free . The applause from the very first showing was so enthusiastic that fairgoers kept the theater packed until midnight . The exhibitor bought the film immediately , and when he was reminded of his initial reluctance he even offered to add ₣ 200 to compensate " for [ Méliès 's ] inconvenience . " The film was a pronounced success in France , running uninterrupted at the Olympia music hall in Paris for several months . 
 A Trip to the Moon was met with especially large enthusiasm in the United States , where ( to Méliès 's chagrin ) its piracy by Lubin , Selig , Edison and others gave it wide distribution . Exhibitors in New York City , Washington D.C. , Cleveland , Detroit , New Orleans , and Kansas City reported on the film 's great success in their theaters . The film also did well in other countries , including Germany , Canada , and Italy , where it was featured as a headline attraction through 1904 . 
 A Trip to the Moon was one of the most popular films of the first few years of the twentieth century , rivaled only by a small handful of others ( similarly spectacular Méliès films such as The Kingdom of the Fairies and The Impossible Voyage among them ) . Late in life , Méliès remarked that A Trip to the Moon was " surely not one of my best , " but acknowledged that it was widely considered his masterpiece and that " it left an indelible trace because it was the first of its kind . " The film which Méliès was proudest of was Humanity Through the Ages , a serious historical drama now presumed lost .

 After Méliès 's financial difficulties and decline , most copies of his prints were lost . In 1917 , his offices were occupied by the French military , who melted down many of Méliès 's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid . When the Théâtre Robert @-@ Houdin was demolished in 1923 , the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second @-@ hand film . Finally , in that same year , Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil . In 1925 , he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris . A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten to history and went unseen for years . 
 Thanks to the efforts of film history <unk> , especially René Clair , Jean @-@ George Auriol , and Paul Gilson , Méliès and his work were rediscovered in the late 1920s . A " Gala Méliès " was held at the Salle Pleyel in Paris on 16 December 1929 in celebration of the filmmaker , and he was awarded the Legion of Honor in 1931 . During this renaissance of interest in Méliès , the cinema manager Jean Mauclaire and the early film experimenter Jean Acme LeRoy both set out independently to locate a surviving print of A Trip to the Moon . Mauclaire obtained a copy from Paris in October 1929 , and LeRoy one from London in 1930 , though both prints were incomplete ; Mauclaire 's lacked the first and last scenes , and LeRoy 's was missing the entire final sequence featuring the parade and commemorative statue . These prints were occasionally screened at retrospectives ( including the Gala Méliès ) , avant @-@ garde cinema showings , and other special occasions , sometimes in presentations by Méliès himself . 
 Following LeRoy 's death in 1932 , his film collection was bought by the Museum of Modern Art in 1936 . The museum 's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon , under the direction of MoMA 's film curator Iris Barry , opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema . LeRoy 's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies , including the Cinémathèque française 's print . A complete version of the film , including the entire celebration sequence , was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès , a foundation set up by the Méliès family . 
 = = = Hand @-@ colored print = = = 
 No hand @-@ colored prints of A Trip to the Moon were known to survive until 1993 , when one was given to the <unk> de Catalunya by an anonymous donor as part of a collection of two hundred silent films . It is unknown whether this version , a hand @-@ colored print struck from a second @-@ generation negative , was colored by Elisabeth Thuillier 's lab , but the perforations used imply that the copy was made before 1906 . The flag waved during the launching scene in this copy is colored to resemble the flag of Spain , indicating that the hand @-@ colored copy was made for a Spanish exhibitor . 
 In 1999 , Anton Gimenez of the <unk> de Catalunya mentioned the existence of this print , which he believed to be in a state of total decomposition , to Serge Bromberg and Eric Lange of the French film company Lobster Films . Bromberg and Lange offered to trade a recently rediscovered film by Segundo de <unk> for the hand @-@ colored print , and Gimenez accepted . Bromberg and Lange consulted various specialist laboratories in an attempt to restore the film , but because the reel of film had apparently decomposed into a rigid mass , none believed restoration to be possible . Consequently , Bromberg and Lange themselves set to work separating the film frames , discovering that only the edges of the film stock had decomposed and congealed together , and thus that many of the frames themselves were still salvageable . Between 2002 and 2005 , various digitization efforts allowed 13 @,@ 375 fragments of images from the print to be saved . In 2010 , a complete restoration of the hand @-@ colored print was launched by Lobster Films , the <unk> Gan Foundation for Cinema , and the Technicolor Foundation for Cinema Heritage . The digitized fragments of the hand @-@ colored print were reassembled and restored , with missing frames recreated with the help of a black @-@ and @-@ white print in the possession of the Méliès family , and time @-@ converted to run at an authentic silent @-@ film speed , 14 frames per second . The restoration was completed in 2011 at Technicolor 's laboratories in Los Angeles . 
 The restored version premiered on 11 May 2011 , eighteen years after its discovery and 109 years after its original release , at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival , with a new soundtrack by the French band Air . The restoration was released by Flicker Alley in a 2 @-@ disc Blu @-@ Ray and DVD edition also including The Extraordinary Voyage , a feature @-@ length documentary by Bromberg and Lange about the film 's restoration , in 2012 . In The New York Times , A. O. Scott called the restoration " surely a cinematic highlight of the year , maybe the century . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 As A Short History of Film notes , A Trip to the Moon combined " spectacle , sensation , and technical wizardry to create a cosmic fantasy that was an international sensation . " It was profoundly influential on later filmmakers , bringing creativity to the cinematic medium and offering fantasy for pure entertainment , a rare goal in film at the time . In addition , Méliès 's innovative editing and special effects techniques were widely imitated and became important elements of the medium . The film also spurred on the development of cinematic science fiction and fantasy by demonstrating that scientific themes worked on the screen and that reality could be transformed by the camera . In a 1940 interview , Edwin S. Porter said that it was by seeing A Trip to the Moon and other Méliès films that he " came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres , and set to work in this direction . " Similarly , D. W. Griffith said simply of Méliès : " I owe him everything . " Since these American directors are widely credited with developing modern film narrative technique , the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht once summed up Méliès 's importance to film history by commenting that Méliès " profoundly influenced both Porter and Griffith and through them the whole course of American film @-@ making . " 
 It remains Méliès 's most famous film as well as a classic example of early cinema , with the image of the capsule stuck in the Man in the Moon 's eye particularly well @-@ known . The film has been evoked in other creative works many times , ranging from Segundo de <unk> 's 1908 unauthorized remake Excursion to the Moon through the extensive tribute to Méliès and the film in the Brian Selznick novel The Invention of Hugo <unk> and its 2011 Martin Scorsese film adaptation Hugo . Film scholar Andrew J. Rausch includes A Trip to the Moon among the " 32 most pivotal moments in the history of [ film ] , " saying it " changed the way movies were produced . " Chiara Ferrari 's essay on the film in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die , which places A Trip to the Moon as the first entry , argues that the film " directly reflects the histrionic personality of its director " , and that the film " deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in world cinema history . " 
 = Rivadavia @-@ class battleship = 
 The Rivadavia class consisted of two battleships designed by the American Fore River Shipbuilding Company for the Argentine Navy . Named Rivadavia and Moreno after important figures in Argentine history , they were Argentina 's entry in the South American dreadnought race and a counter to Brazil 's two Minas Geraes @-@ class battleships . 
 In 1904 , Brazil scrapped a previous naval building program in favor of an order that included three warships of the new " dreadnought " type , despite signs that such an action would spark a South American naval arms race . To counter this acquisition by a major rival , Argentina began seeking bids for at least two dreadnoughts in 1908 . Over the next two years , shipbuilders from five countries vied for the contracts , complemented by efforts from their respective governments . Argentina was able to play this hyper @-@ competitive environment to its own advantage by rejecting all of the initial proposals and calling for new ones that required the best aspects of each . They then repeated this process , despite complaints from shipbuilders that their trade secrets were being given away . The contracts were awarded to the lowest bidder , Fore River , in early 1910 . This move shocked the European bidders , but could partly be explained by the American steel trust 's ability to produce steel at a lower cost than any other country . 
 With increasing tensions in Europe that would eventually lead to the First World War , newspapers speculated that the Argentine dreadnoughts would be sold to another country . Under diplomatic pressure , Argentina kept the ships . Throughout their careers , Rivadavia and Moreno were based in Puerto Belgrano and served principally as training ships and diplomatic envoys . They were modernized in the United States in 1924 and 1925 and were inactive for much of the Second World War due to Argentina 's neutrality . Struck from the navy lists on 1 February 1957 , Rivadavia was scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959 . Moreno was struck on 1 October 1956 and was towed to Japan in 1957 for scrapping in what was then the world 's longest tow ( 96 days ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 The raison d 'être for the Rivadavia class can be traced back to Argentine – Chilean territorial disputes over the boundary of Patagonia and control of the Beagle Channel going back to the 1840s . It nearly led to war in 1878 and kindled a naval arms race from 1887 to 1902 which was only settled via British mediation . As part of the three pacts which ended the dispute , restrictions were placed on the navies of both countries . The British Royal Navy bought two Swiftsure @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships that were being built for Chile , and Argentina sold its two Rivadavia @-@ class armored cruisers under construction in Italy to Japan . Meanwhile , beginning in the late 1880s , Brazil 's navy fell into obsolescence after an 1889 revolution , which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II , and a 1893 civil war . By the turn of the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage , despite Brazil having nearly three times the population of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile . 
 By 1904 , however , Brazil began to seriously consider upgrading its navy to compete with Argentina and Chile . Soaring demand for coffee and rubber brought the Brazilian economy an influx of revenue , which paid for a US $ 31 @.@ 25 million naval repair scheme , a substantial amount for the time period . The bill authorized 28 ships , including three battleships and three armored cruisers . It was not possible to lay down the battleships until 1906 , the same year the trend @-@ setting HMS Dreadnought was constructed . This ship prompted the Brazilians to cancel their battleship plans in favor of two Minas Geraes @-@ class dreadnoughts . The ordering of these powerful ships — designed to carry the heaviest armament in the world at the time — shocked Argentina and Chile . Historian Robert Scheina comments that the dreadnoughts alone " outclassed the entire [ elderly ] Argentinian fleet . " 
 Debates raged in Argentina over the wisdom of acquiring dreadnoughts to counter Brazil 's . The National Autonomist Party cabinet was in favor , despite a probable cost of nearly $ 10 million , but a specific plan for two 14 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 14 @,@ 225 t ) battleships and ten destroyers was not popular with the public . Alarmed , the American ambassador to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State , warning them of the destabilizing effects that would occur if the situation devolved into a full naval arms race . 
 Despite American entreaties to preclude the naval arms race , Brazil continued development on the ships . This , combined with renewed border disputes , particularly in the River Plate ( Río de la Plata , literally " Silver River " ) area , spurred Argentina to move forward with plans for their own battleships . <unk> by newspaper editors , the public was now fully supportive of a naval building program . While an early plan called for $ 35 million to be invested — $ 7 million from foreign loans — a $ 55 million plan was adopted in August 1908 . Hoping to end the arms race , Argentina made an offer to purchase one of the two Brazilian ships , but the refusal prompted the dispatch of an Argentine naval commission to Europe to acquire dreadnoughts . 
 = = Bidding = = 
 Proposals from shipbuilders for two dreadnoughts ( along with a possible third , to match Brazil should a third ship be ordered ) and twelve destroyers were solicited in 1908 by open tender . In order to ensure that the designs reflected the most modern practices , the requirements were intentionally vague . 
 Fifteen shipyards from the United States , Great Britain , Germany , France , and Italy began bidding on the battleships . Diplomatic pressure to give the contracts was brought to bear from all these countries , especially the first three . Even with this assistance , industry leaders in the United States believed that they had no chance in the bidding without active cooperation from their government , as Europe was the traditional arms supplier to Argentina ( and to all of South America ) . Even when this was given , including the removal of import tariffs on hides from Argentina , promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected , and an offer to include the most technologically advanced fire @-@ control system and torpedo tubes available on the Argentine battleships , the United States was widely viewed as a non @-@ contender . Historian Seward W. Livermore remarked that " opposition to the United States was formidable . The naval commission was pro @-@ British ; the vice @-@ president of the republic , Roque Sáenz Peña , favored Italy , where he had been the Argentine envoy for many years ; and the minister of war wanted the contracts to go to Germany , so as to standardize the military and naval equipment of the country .

 The president of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company believed that the United States would not receive contracts due to what he saw as a large amount of European meddling in Argentina : 
 The political influence of foreign powers is being exerted in a very forceful manner to turn the business to English and Continental firms ; the King of Italy , the German Emperor , and the force of English diplomacy are being made use of ; and American firms will have very little consideration , I fear , unless our government will exert some very powerful influence in favor of this country . 
 The United States , however , found an ally in Buenos Aires ' main daily newspaper , La Prensa . The owner , editor , and naval editor were all in favor of acquiring American @-@ designed dreadnoughts . In addition , the paper found evidence of British wrongdoing in a related naval contract . Under public pressure , the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list , which had placed Italy first and Britain second . It now featured the United States first , Britain second , and Italy last . 
 In a surprise move , the Argentine naval commission then threw out all of the opening tenders and called for another round of bidding ; they simultaneously updated the specifications to include what were judged to be the best aspects of all the plans . The competitors were given three weeks to come up with new designs and cost estimates . After diplomatic protests , this was modified slightly ; the original bids were kept , but alterations to attempt to conform to the new desired characteristics were allowed . 
 The commission found that the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company bid was lowest on one battleship , and the Fore River Shipbuilding Company was lowest on the other . Despite a British attempt to allow the Armstrong Whitworth @-@ Vickers team to lower their price by $ 570 @,@ 000 , prompt American diplomacy granting various assurances regarding recent events between the United States and Brazil , the upcoming 1910 Pan @-@ American Conference , and a guarantee of American participation in the Argentine centennial celebrations secured the battleship contracts for Fore River on 21 January 1910 . The maximum price Fore River tendered , $ 10 @.@ 7 million , underbid the British by more than $ 973 @,@ 000 , but their ship 's displacement was 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ) smaller , the belt armor was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thinner , and the top speed was slightly lower . Orders for the twelve destroyers were divided among Britain , France , and Germany . 
 Rivadavia was built by Fore River at its shipyard in Massachusetts , but they were contractually obligated to subcontract the second ship to a different shipyard in the hope that both would be completed faster , so Moreno was constructed by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden , New Jersey . The steel for the ships was largely supplied by the Bethlehem Steel Company of Pennsylvania , which , due to their ability to produce steel at a lower price than other nations , was an integral cost @-@ saving measure . The Secretary of the Argentine Naval Commission , the body which chose the final design , said the reason the American tender was lower than that of the English was that " steel for construction work and armor @-@ plating is a great deal cheaper in the United States than in England . Wages are higher there , but the contractors ... are able to obtain it more cheaply owing to the manipulations of the Steel Trust . " 
 A third dreadnought , provided for in the contract , was strongly supported by Argentina and by U.S. diplomats during 1910 , while the Minas Geraes class was still under construction . La Prensa and one of its rivals , La Argentina , heavily advocated a third ship ; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship . An American diplomat wrote back to the United States that " this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds . " However , Brazil 's 21 – 26 November Revolt of the Lash — in which the three most powerful ships in the fleet ( the battleships Minas Geraes , São Paulo , and the cruiser Bahia ) and several smaller warships violently rebelled — crushed the previous sentiment for a new battleship . About two years later in October 1912 , a third dreadnought was authorized by Argentina in case Brazil 's Rio de Janeiro was completed and delivered . The ship was never named or built , as Rio de Janeiro was sold to the Ottoman Empire due to monetary issues , and a later planned Brazilian ship ( Riachuelo ) was canceled due to the beginning of the First World War . 
 = = International reaction = = 
 The choice of Fore River came as a complete surprise to the European bidders . Britain 's reaction in particular was scathing : Sir John H. Biles , a professor and well @-@ known naval architect , decried the bidding process as " unethical " : 
 ... it may be presumed that everything ... good in the first proposals [ was ] seized upon by the Argentine authorities and asked for in the new design . This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world , and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government .... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry ; and so the process of leakage went merrily on , and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government . 
 Various British newspapers also cried foul . The Evening Standard believed that as " Argentina 's greatest creditor and greatest client " , Britain ought to have been awarded the two ships . The Times took a different track , accusing American shipbuilders of slashing prices to an obscene degree , and accusing the government of exerting undue diplomatic pressure to obtain the contracts . 
 New Zealand 's Evening Post noted that the United States had previously built major warships for other countries , including Russia , and Britain 's ally Japan , and commented , " The severity of the blow to England rests in ... the amount of English capital in [ Argentina ] " , possibly echoing the Evening Standard 's argument . They referred to a " startling " fact printed by the Daily Mail : the steel used for the armor of the American design was obtained for a much lower price . With Bethlehem 's ability to produce it at £ 8 less per ton than British foundries , a cost savings of more than 10 % in steel over the British ship could be realized . 
 Germany asserted that the United States was given the opportunity to view the other nations ' tenders and lower their price accordingly . Germany also alleged that the United States had secured the deal by pledging to come to Argentina 's defense should they become embroiled in a military conflict . 
 The New York Times noted that with Argentina 's and Brazil 's dreadnought orders , countries in North and South America were building the five biggest capital ships in the world ( Brazil 's Rio de Janeiro , Argentina 's Rivadavia and Moreno , and the United States ' New York and Texas ) in addition to seven of the ten largest ( including the United States ' Wyoming and Arkansas ) . Shortly after Rivadavia had completed its trials , the U.S. Navy 's Board of Inspection and Survey remarked that the ship " handle [ d ] remarkably well ... with comparatively minor modifications the vessel would practically meet the requirements of our own vessels . " The Board of Inspection was less pleased with the wing turrets , stating that " while theoretically the Rivadavia has an ahead and astern fire of six guns , this is not so in reality , as it is almost certain that the blast from the waist turrets would dish in the <unk> and damage the uptakes . " 
 = = Possible sale = = 
 After Brazil sold Rio de Janeiro to the Ottoman Empire , Argentina began to actively seek a buyer for their two ships so the profits could be invested in education . In the tension that preceded the First World War , there were many suitors . The United States , however , abhorred the idea of their latest technological advances falling into the hands of a possible future combat opponent . While the contract allowed the United States Navy an option to acquire the ships if a deal was reached with a third nation , the Navy did not want the ships ; with the rapid advances in dreadnought technology , such as the " all or nothing " armor arrangement , even new ships like Rivadavia and Moreno were seen as outmoded . 
 Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the Argentine National Congress in the summer of 1914 , but all were defeated . Still , soon after the beginning of the First World War , the German ambassador to Argentina alleged to the U.S. State Department that Britain 's Royal Navy was going to take over the ships as soon as the ships reached the River Plate , and the British put diplomatic pressure on the United States to try to ensure the ships were not sold to any other country ( as this new country could in turn sell them to Germany ) . Italy , the Ottomans , and Greece were all reportedly interested in buying both ships , the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro . The United States , worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign competitor , put diplomatic pressure on Argentina to keep the ships , which it eventually did . 
 = = Design influences = = 
 The Rivadavia design was very similar to a 1906 proposal from Fore River for an American dreadnought class . This ship would have mounted a main battery of fourteen 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) guns in dual turrets ( two superfiring fore , two wing , and three non @-@ superfiring aft ) , a secondary battery of twenty 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns and four torpedo tubes on a hull of 22 @,@ 000 long tons ( 22 @,@ 000 t ) that would be capable of 21 knots ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) . Foreign practices also bore a large influence on the design ; most were acquired through the unique design process of rejecting multiple bids and calling for the best aspects of each . For example , the superfiring arrangement of the main battery was an American innovation , while the wing turrets were similar to British designs of the time . The secondary battery of 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns and the three @-@ shaft system were influenced by German design practices , while the engine and boiler layout was reminiscent of the Italian battleship Dante Alighieri . 
 = = Service histories = = 
 Rivadavia was named after Bernardino Rivadavia , the first president of Argentina , and was built by Fore River Shipyard . The ship was laid down on 25 May 1910 , launched on 26 August 1911 , and completed in December 1914 . Moreno was named after Mariano Moreno , a member of the first Argentine government ; laid down on 10 July 1910 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation , it was launched on 23 September 1911 and completed in February 1915 . Both ships had engine trouble soon after completion : Rivadavia 's completion was delayed due to a damaged turbine , while Moreno had an entire turbine fail while on its trials . 
 The ships finally arrived in Argentina in February and May 1915 , respectively . In the early 1920s , both ships spent time in the reserve fleet due to an economic depression , but enough money was available by 1924 to have the dreadnoughts modernized in the United States . Both refits included a conversion from coal to fuel oil , a new fire @-@ control system , and other minor improvements . In the 1930s they participated in training cruises and diplomatic trips , including : 
 Moreno 's 1933 visit to Brazil with Argentine president Agustín Pedro Justo aboard ; 
 A second visit in 1934 to mark the centennial of Brazilian independence ; 
 Rivadavia 's and Moreno 's 1937 voyage to Europe , where they visited Brest ( France ) , Wilhelmshaven , Bremen , and Hamburg ( Germany ) ; 
 Moreno 's additional participation on the same voyage in the British Spithead Naval Review , where the New York Times ' Hanson Baldwin described it as a " a strange vestigial sea monster in this company of more modern fighting ships " ; 
 Rivadavia 's and Moreno 's 1939 training cruise to Brazil with naval cadets embarked ; with the beginning of the Second World War in September , destroyers had to be sent from Argentina to escort them home . 
 During the war , both ships were mainly inactive due to Argentine neutrality . Rivadavia undertook a last diplomatic cruise to Trinidad , Venezuela , and Colombia in 1946 , but both ships were immobile by 1948 . Moreno was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1956 and was brought to Japan in 1957 for scrapping in a then @-@ world @-@ record 96 @-@ day tow . Rivadavia was stricken on 1 February 1957 and scrapped in Italy beginning in 1959 . The money gained from selling the two dreadnoughts along with an older armored cruiser , Pueyrredón , was used to buy an aircraft carrier from the United Kingdom , Independencia ( ex @-@ Warrior ) . 
 = = Specifications = = 
 The two ships of the Rivadavia class were 594 feet 9 inches ( 181 @.@ 28 m ) overall and 585 feet ( 178 m ) between perpendiculars . They had a beam of 98 feet 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 29 @.@ 985 m ) , a normal draft of 27 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 8 @.@ 446 m ) , and displaced 27 @,@ 500 long tons ( 27 @,@ 900 t ) normally and 30 @,@ 100 long tons ( 30 @,@ 600 t ) at full load . The ships were staffed by 130 officers and about 1000 enlisted men . 
 For armament , the Rivadavia class was equipped with a main battery of twelve 12 @-@ inch / 50 caliber guns , a secondary battery of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 155 mm ) / 50 and twelve 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) / 50 QF , and two 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo tubes . 
 The 12 " / 50 was a Bethlehem development . It was most likely based on the weapon used in the United States ' Wyoming @-@ class battleship , the 12 " / 50 caliber Mark 7 gun . The twelve guns were mounted in six dual turrets . Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft , while the other two were located en echelon in wing turrets . The latter weapons could , in theory , fire on a 180 ° range on their respective sides of the hull and 100 ° on the other , but in reality this was not possible , as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship . A more reasonable estimate would be 90 ° on their sides . The 6 @-@ inch secondary armament was placed in casemates , with six on either side of the ship . For protection , they were provided with 6 inches of armor . The 4 @-@ inch weaponry , intended for use against marauding destroyers , was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship , including the main deck , superstructure , and far up near the bow . As originally built , there were sixteen 4 @-@ inch guns , but four of those were replaced with four 3 @-@ inch AA guns and four 3 @-@ pounders during the 1924 @-@ 1926 modernization . The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment . 
 Full ammunition loads were 1 @,@ 440 rounds for the 12 @-@ inch guns ( 120 per gun ) , 3 @,@ 600 rounds for the 6 @-@ inch ( 300 ) , 5 @,@ 600 rounds for the 4 @-@ inch ( 350 ) , and 16 torpedoes manufactured by Whitehead . To assist the main battery with targeting during a battle , the two ships were equipped with two Barr & Stroud rangefinders that were located above the conning towers . 
 Rivadavia and Moreno used Brown – Curtis geared steam turbines , powered by 18 Babcock & Wilcox boilers and connected to three propellers . With a total output of about 40 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 30 @,@ 000 kW ) , the ships were designed to travel at a maximum speed of 22 @.@ 5 knots ( 41 @.@ 7 km / h ; 25 @.@ 9 mph ) and may have been capable of slightly more . At speeds of 11 to 15 knots ( 20 to 28 km / h ; 13 to 17 mph ) , their endurance ranged from 11 @,@ 000 to 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 20 @,@ 000 to 13 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 700 to 8 @,@ 100 mi ) , respectively . Their fuel was a coal – oil mix and the ships carried 3 @,@ 900 long tons ( 4 @,@ 000 t ) of the former and 590 long tons ( 600 t ) of the latter . 
 Typical of American @-@ designed dreadnoughts at the time , the Rivadavia class included substantial armor protection . A 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) belt was fitted amidships , covering 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above and 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below the designed waterline , gradually decreasing towards the bow and stern to 5 inches ( 130 mm ) and 4 inches ( 100 mm ) , respectively . The gun turrets received heavy armor , including 12 inches ( 300 mm ) on the front , 9 inches ( 230 mm ) on the sides , 9 @.@ 5 inches ( 240 mm ) on the back , and 4 inches ( 100 mm ) on the top . Deck armor consisted of .5 inches ( 13 mm ) medium steel and 2 inches ( 51 mm ) nickel steel .

 = Cyclogenesis = 
 Cyclogenesis is the development or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere ( a low @-@ pressure area ) . Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for at least three different processes , all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone , and at any size from the microscale to the synoptic scale . 
 Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity , and are warm core . 
 Extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones . 
 Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land , and can lead to tornado formation . Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones , but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear . 
 The process in which an extratropical cyclone undergoes a rapid drop in atmospheric pressure ( 24 millibars or more ) in a 24 @-@ hour period is referred to as explosive cyclogenesis , and is usually present during the formation of a nor 'easter . The anticyclonic equivalent , the process of formation of high pressure areas , is anticyclogenesis . The opposite of cyclogenesis is cyclolysis . 
 = = Meteorological scales = = 
 There are four main scales , or sizes of systems , dealt with in meteorology : the macroscale , the synoptic scale , the mesoscale , and the microscale . The macroscale deals with systems with global size , such as the Madden – Julian oscillation . Synoptic scale systems cover a portion of a continent , such as extratropical cyclones , with dimensions of 1 @,@ 000 @-@ 2 @,@ 500 km ( 620 @-@ 1 @,@ 550 mi ) across . The mesoscale is the next smaller scale , and often is divided into two ranges : meso @-@ alpha phenomena range from 200 @-@ 2 @,@ 000 km ( 125 @-@ 1 @,@ 243 mi ) across ( the realm of the tropical cyclone ) , while meso @-@ beta phenomena range from 20 – 200 km ( 12 @-@ 125 mi ) across ( the scale of the mesocyclone ) . The microscale is the smallest of the meteorological scales , with a size under two kilometers ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) ( the scale of tornadoes and waterspouts ) . These horizontal dimensions are not rigid divisions but instead reflect typical sizes of phenomena having certain dynamic characteristics . For example , a system does not necessarily transition from meso @-@ alpha to synoptic scale when its horizontal extent grows from 2 @,@ 000 to 2 @,@ 001 km ( 1 @,@ 243 mi ) .

 = = = Norwegian Cyclone Model = = = 
 The Norwegian Cyclone Model is an idealized formation model of cold @-@ core cyclonic storms developed by Norwegian meteorologists during the First World War . The main concept behind this model , relating to cyclogenesis , is that cyclones progress through a predictable evolution as they move up a frontal boundary , with the most mature cyclone near the northeast end of the front and the least mature near the tail end of the front . 
 = = = Precursors for development = = = 
 A preexisting frontal boundary , as defined in surface weather analysis , is required for the development of a mid @-@ latitude cyclone . The cyclonic flow begins around a disturbed section of the stationary front due to an upper level disturbance , such as a short wave or an upper @-@ level trough , near a favorable quadrant of the upper level jet . However , enhanced along @-@ frontal stretching rates in the lower troposphere can suppress the growth of extratropical cyclones . 
 = = = Vertical motion affecting development = = = 
 Cyclogenesis can only occur when temperature decreases polewards ( to the north , in the northern hemisphere ) , and pressure perturbation lines tilt westward with height . Cyclogenesis is most likely to occur in regions of cyclonic vorticity advection , downstream of a strong westerly jet . The combination of vorticity advection and thermal advection created by the temperature gradient and a low pressure center cause upward motion around the low . If the temperature gradient is strong enough , temperature advection will increase , driving more vertical motion . This increases the overall strength of the system . <unk> updrafts are the most important factor in determining cyclonic growth and strength . 
 = = = Modes of development = = = 
 The surface low could have a variety of causes for forming . Topography can force a surface low when dense low @-@ level high pressure system ridges in east of a north @-@ south mountain barrier . Mesoscale convective systems can spawn surface lows which are initially warm core . The disturbance can grow into a wave @-@ like formation along the front and the low will be positioned at the crest . Around the low , flow will become cyclonic , by definition . This rotational flow will push polar air equatorward west of the low via its trailing cold front , and warmer air will push poleward low via the warm front . Usually the cold front will move at a quicker pace than the warm front and “ catch up ” with it due to the slow erosion of higher density airmass located out ahead of the cyclone and the higher density airmass sweeping in behind the cyclone , usually resulting in a narrowing warm sector . At this point an occluded front forms where the warm air mass is pushed upwards into a trough of warm air aloft , which is also known as a trowal ( a trough of warm air aloft ) . All developing low pressure areas share one important aspect , that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere . Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air , which lower surface pressure . 
 = = = Maturity = = = 
 Maturity is after the time of occlusion when the storm has completed strengthening and the cyclonic flow is at its most intense . Thereafter , the strength of the storm diminishes as the cyclone couples with the upper level trough or upper level low , becoming increasingly cold core . The spin @-@ down of cyclones , also known as cyclolysis , can be understood from an energetics perspective . As occlusion occurs and the warm air mass is pushed upwards over a cold air airmass , the atmosphere becomes increasingly stable and the centre of gravity of the system lowers . As the occlusion process extends further down the warm front and away from the central low , more and more of the available potential energy of the system is exhausted . This potential energy sink creates a kinetic energy source which injects a final burst of energy into the storm 's motions . After this process occurs , the growth period of the cyclone , or cyclogenesis , ends , and the low begins to spin down ( fill ) as more air is converging into the bottom of the cyclone than is being removed out the top since upper @-@ level divergence has decreased . 
 Occasionally , cyclogenesis will re @-@ occur with occluded cyclones . When this happens a new low center will form on the triple @-@ point ( the point where the cold front , warm front , and occluded front meet ) . During triple @-@ point cyclogenesis , the occluded parent low will fill as the secondary low deepens into the main <unk> . 
 = = Tropical cyclones = = 
 Tropical cyclones exist within a mesoscale alpha domain . As opposed to mid @-@ latitude cyclogenesis , tropical cyclogenesis is driven by strong convection organised into a central core with no baroclinic zones , or fronts , extending through their center . Although the formation of tropical cyclones is the topic of extensive ongoing research and is still not fully understood , there are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis : sea surface temperatures that are warm enough , atmospheric instability , high humidity in lower to middle levels of the troposphere , enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center , a pre @-@ existing low level focus or disturbance , and low vertical wind shear . These warm core cyclones tend to form over the oceans between 10 and 30 degrees of the equator . 
 = = Mesocyclones = = 
 Mesocyclones range in size from mesoscale beta to microscale . The term mesocyclone is usually reserved for mid @-@ level rotations within severe thunderstorms , and are warm core cyclones driven by latent heat of its associated thunderstorm activity . 
 Tornadoes form in the warm sector of extratropical cyclones where a strong upper level jet stream exists . Mesocyclones are believed to form when strong changes of wind speed and / or direction with height ( " wind shear " ) sets parts of the lower part of the atmosphere spinning in invisible tube @-@ like rolls . The convective updraft of a thunderstorm is then thought to draw up this spinning air , tilting the rolls ' orientation upward ( from parallel to the ground to perpendicular ) and causing the entire updraft to rotate as a vertical column . 
 As the updraft rotates , it may form what is known as a wall cloud . The wall cloud is a spinning layer of clouds descending from the mesocyclone . The wall cloud tends to form closer to the center of the mesocyclone . It should be noted the wall clouds do not necessarily need a mesocyclone to form and do not always rotate . As the wall cloud descends , a funnel @-@ shaped cloud may form at its center . This is the first stage of tornado formation . The presence of a mesocyclone is believed to be a key factor in the formation of the strong tornadoes associated with severe thunderstorms . 
 = = Tornadoes = = 
 Tornadoes exist on the microscale or low end of the mesoscale gamma domain . The cycle begins when a strong thunderstorm develops a rotating mesocyclone a few miles up in the atmosphere , becoming a supercell . As rainfall in the storm increases , it drags with it an area of quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft ( RFD ) . This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground , and drags the rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it . 
 As the mesocyclone approaches the ground , a visible condensation funnel appears to descend from the base of the storm , often from a rotating wall cloud . As the funnel descends , the RFD also reaches the ground , creating a gust front that can cause damage a good distance from the tornado . Usually , the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground ( becoming a tornado ) within minutes of the RFD reaching the ground . 
 = = Waterspouts = = 
 Waterspouts exist on the microscale . While some waterspouts are strong ( tornadic ) like their land @-@ based counterparts , most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics . They normally develop in moisture @-@ laden environments with little vertical wind shear along lines of convergence , such as land breezes , lines of frictional convergence from nearby landmasses , or surface troughs . Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus , or as significant as a thunderstorm . Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development , and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal wind shear near the surface , and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm . Weak tornadoes , known as landspouts , across eastern Colorado have been witnessed to develop in a similar manner . An outbreak occurred in the Great Lakes in late September and early October 2003 along a lake effect band . September is the peak month of landspout and waterspout occurrence around Florida and for waterspout occurrence around the Great Lakes .

 = Tartu Offensive = 
 The Tartu Offensive Operation ( Russian : <unk> <unk> операция ) , also known as the Battle of Tartu ( Estonian : Tartu <unk> ) and the Battle of Emajõgi ( Estonian : <unk> <unk> , German : Schlacht am <unk> ) was a campaign fought over southeastern Estonia in 1944 . It took place on the Eastern Front during World War II between the Soviet 3rd Baltic Front and parts of the German Army Group North . 
 The Soviet tactical aim was to defeat the 18th Army and to capture the city of Tartu . The strategic goal was a quick occupation of Estonia . The Soviet command planned to reach the coast of the Gulf of Riga and trap the Army Detachment " Narwa " . The German side involved Estonian conscripts , which fought to defend their country against the looming Soviet annexation . The 3rd Baltic Front captured Tartu . The conquest caused the destruction of the Estonian National Museum and 40 million rubles worth of damage to the University of Tartu . Kampfgruppe " Wagner " stabilised the front at the Emajõgi River . The XXVIII Army Corps supported by Omakaitse militia stalled the front at the Väike Emajõgi and <unk> Rivers , preventing the 3rd Baltic Front from cutting off the " Narwa " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Attacks of the Leningrad Front had pushed the Army Group North to the west of Lake Peipus resulting in a series of operations around Narva . The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland , which eased the situation in Finland and kept the Soviet Baltic Fleet in its eastern bay . From a military economy viewpoint , the preservation of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida @-@ Viru was also important . In the south , Soviet forces advanced towards the Baltic seacoast at the end of their Operation Bagration of June – August 1944 against the German Army Group Centre . 
 = = = Comparison of forces = = = 
 At the beginning of the Soviet Tartu Operation , the ratio of Soviet to German strength was 4 @.@ 3 : 1 for troops , 14 @.@ 8 : 1 for artillery and 4 @.@ 1 : 1 for armour . The German forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller units from different branches . A significant proportion of the German side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor weaponry and little fighting ability . 
 = = Combat activities = = 
 The main thrust of the Soviet operation was first aimed at the southern <unk> County . On 10 August , the Soviet 67th Army broke through the defence of the XXVIII Army Corps and captured the town of <unk> on 13 August . The XXVIII Army Corps were forced to the banks of the Väike Emajõgi and <unk> Rivers in the west where they were supported by the Viljandi County Omakaitse militia battalion . While the defence prevented the 3rd Baltic Front from cutting off the retreat of the Army Detachment " Narwa " from Estonia , there was open ground towards the city of Tartu , the capital of Southeast Estonia . Army Group North created a Kampfgruppe ( an ad @-@ hoc combat formation ) , led by SS @-@ Brigadeführer Jürgen Wagner and manned by the army detachment , for the defence of the new line . The Soviet tank units forced a wedge between the Kampfgruppe and the <unk> Army Corps ; Wagner had insufficient troops ahead of the city . On 16 August , Lieutenant General Alexey <unk> 's group launched an amphibious assault over Lake Peipus behind the German left ( east ) flank , beating the Omakaitse defence and forming a bridgehead in the village of <unk> . In fierce battles , a local border guard regiment stopped their advance . 
 The 3rd Baltic Front launched an artillery barrage at the positions of the 2nd Battalion , 45 Waffen SS Grenadier Regiment ( 1st Estonian ) covering the German right flank in the village of <unk> southeast of Tartu on 23 August . The Soviet <unk> Rifle Division backed by the 16th Single Tank Brigade and two self @-@ propelled artillery regiments bypassed the defence on the west side and captured the <unk> Bridge across the Emajõgi River west of Tartu . Being one of only four bridges across the 100 kilometres long marshy floodplains of the river , it was of high strategic importance . After sappers failed to destroy the bridge , Sturmbannführer Leon Degrelle improvised a defence line of the 5th SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade Wallonien , avoiding a Soviet breakthrough to Tartu . As a result , he was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves . 
 A heavy German tank assault had been planned to attack behind the western flank of the Soviet lines in Elva on 24 August . On the night before the attack , the designated commander of the operation Brigadeführer <unk> von Strachwitz had a serious car accident . The Soviet tank squadrons repulsed the German attack on the following day . Four Soviet rifle divisions launched an attack at Tartu with the support of armour and artillery . After fierce street battles , the Soviet forces conquered the city and established a bridgehead on the north bank of the Emajõgi on 25 August . Due to " Wagner " ' s inability to hold back the Soviet offensive , the headquarters of the Army Group North turned over command of the Emajõgi Front to the II Army Corps , commanded by Infantry General Wilhelm Hasse . At the end of August , the III . Battalion , 1st Estonian Regiment was formed from the 1st Battalion of the Finnish Infantry Regiment 200 , recently returned to Estonia . As their largest operation , supported by Estonian Police Battalions No. 37 , 38 and Mauritz Freiherr von Strachwitz 's tank squadron , they destroyed the bridgehead of two Soviet divisions and recaptured <unk> Bridge by 30 August . The operation shifted the entire front back to the southern bank of the Emajõgi and encouraged the II Army Corps to launch an operation attempting to recapture Tartu . The attack of 4 – 6 September reached the northern outskirts of the city but was repulsed by units of four Soviet rifle divisions . Relative calm settled on the front for the subsequent thirteen days . 
 = = Losses = = 
 The property of the University of Tartu suffered heavy losses in the campaign , accounting for 40 million rubles of damage ( equalling to the purchasing power of 90 million U.S. dollars in 2008 ) . The university lost fifteen buildings permanently . The damage done to the roofs , interiors , doors , windows , heating systems , study cabinets and laboratories was three times the damage to the ruined buildings . The Museum of Zoology lost all of its wet preparations . The interiors of the laboratories of chemistry , physics , pathology and dairy , and a large amount of instruments for the observatories of astronomy and geophysics were destroyed by shrapnel or looted . Bombing destroyed <unk> Manor the main building of the Estonian National Museum .

 = = = Baltic Offensive = = = 
 The 2nd Shock Army crossed Lake Peipus in 5 – 11 September and acquired command over the Emajõgi front . In the Riga Offensive Operation on 14 – 16 September , the 3rd Baltic Front attacked the German XXVIII Army Corps and the Omakaitse militia battalions in the front segment from the Valga railway junction to Lake Võrtsjärv . In fierce battles , the German and Estonian units held their positions . 
 The Soviet Tallinn Offensive of the 2nd Shock and 8th Armies commenced on the early morning of 17 September . The 2nd Shock Army forced its way through the II Army Corps divisional headquarters and artillery positions along the Emajõgi . The Army Detachment " Narwa " and the XXVIII Army Corps , the northernmost elements of Army Group North , were at risk of being encircled and destroyed . The headquarters of the Army Group North ordered the II Army Corps to abandon the defence of the Emajõgi line and to move quickly around the northern tip of Lake Võrtsjärv to Latvia . 
 The code name for the withdrawal of the Army Detachment " Narwa " from mainland Estonia was Operation " Aster " . Beginning on 17 September 1944 , a naval force under Vice @-@ Admiral Theodor Burchardi evacuated elements of the Army Detachment and Estonian civilians . Within six days , around 50 @,@ 000 troops , 20 @,@ 000 civilians and 1 @,@ 000 prisoners were evacuated . The remaining elements of the Army Detachment were ordered to withdraw into Latvia by way of Pärnu and Viljandi . The III SS ( Germanic ) Panzer Corps reached Pärnu by September 20 , while the II Army Corps retreated south of Viljandi to form the 18th Army 's rearguard . As they retreated , the Soviet 2nd Shock and 8th Armies advanced and took Tallinn on September 22 . 
 = = = Soviet reoccupation = = = 
 Soviet rule of Estonia was re @-@ established by force , and sovietisation followed , which was mostly carried out in 1944 – 1950 . The forced collectivisation of agriculture began in 1947 , and was completed after the mass deportation of Estonians in March 1949 . All private farms were confiscated , and farmers were made to join the collective farms . An armed resistance movement of ' forest brothers ' was active until the mass deportations . A total of 30 @,@ 000 participated or supported the movement ; 2 @,@ 000 were killed . The Soviet authorities fighting the forest brothers suffered also hundreds of deaths . Among those killed on both sides were innocent civilians . Besides the armed resistance of the forest brothers , a number of underground nationalist schoolchildren groups were active . Most of their members were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment . The punitive actions decreased rapidly after Joseph Stalin 's death in 1953 ; from 1956 – 58 , a large part of the deportees and political prisoners were allowed to return to Estonia . Political arrests and numerous other crimes against humanity were committed all through the occupation period until the late 1980s . After all , the attempt to integrate Estonian society into the Soviet system failed . Although the armed resistance was defeated , the population remained anti @-@ Soviet . This helped the Estonians to organise a new resistance movement in the late 1980s , regain their independence in 1991 , and then rapidly develop a modern society . 
 = Tropical Storm Gabrielle ( 1995 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Gabrielle caused moderate flooding in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas in August 1995 . The eighth tropical cyclone and seventh named storm of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season , Gabrielle developed from a tropical wave in the west @-@ central Gulf of Mexico on August 9 . Initially a tropical depression , the system gradually intensified and by the following day , it became a tropical storm . Favorable conditions caused Gabrielle to continue to strengthen , with the storm nearly reaching hurricane status late on August 11 . However , it soon made landfall near La Pesca , Tamaulipas , thus halting further intensification . Once inland , Gabrielle rapidly weakened and dissipated by early on August 12 . 
 As Gabrielle was impacting the east coast of Mexico , Hurricane Flossie in the Eastern Pacific was brushing the Baja Peninsula . The storm produced torrential rainfall in northeastern Mexico , totaling to 19 @.@ 44 inches ( 494 mm ) . As a result , numerous reservoirs were filled , forcing dozens in southern Nuevo Leon to evacuate their homes . Additionally , highway infrastructure and streets in the region were affected . Damage in Mexico is unknown , though six fatalities were reported . Rainfall up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) brought minor flooding to Texas , mainly damaging unharvested cotton . Three days after dissipation , the remnants of Gabrielle also produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August 15 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean off the west coast of Africa during the last week of July . As it tracked across the Atlantic , it remained a well @-@ defined system , but never organized into a tropical cyclone . On August 8 , the system entered the Gulf of Mexico , and by the following day , it developed a weak low @-@ level circulation . The circulation became better defined later that day , and was confirmed by Reconnaissance aircraft that afternoon , when it was declared Tropical Depression Eight while east of Tamaulipas . 
 From the outset , the cyclone 's motion was altered by Hurricane Flossie off the Pacific coast of Mexico . Initially , deep convection fired up gradually as the depression slowly tracked westward in the Gulf of Mexico . At 1200 UTC on August 10 , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Gabrielle , as the storm curved southward . Gabrielle then strengthened slowly over the warm sea surface temperatures in a low wind shear environment , although land interaction slowed the intensification somewhat . The storm shifted once again onto a west @-@ northwest course on August 11 , moving very slowly towards the coast . 
 The storm made landfall at 2000 UTC on August 11 , just south of La Pesca in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas , about 175 miles ( 280 km ) south of the United States @-@ Mexico border and about 90 miles ( 145 km ) north of Tampico . Simultaneously , Gabrielle attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 988 mbar ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) . After landfall , the storm rapidly weakened , deteriorating to tropical depression status by early on August 12 over northeast Mexico . Six hours later , the surface circulation of Gabrielle dissipated over the mountains of the Sierra Madre Oriental , although its cloud pattern transited Mexico intact , moving into the Gulf of California before it sheared across northwest Mexico on August 15 . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Starting at 2100 UTC on August 9 , a tropical storm warning was issued from Baffin Bay , Texas to La Pesca , Tamaulipas while Gabrielle was still Tropical Depression Eight . By 0900 UTC on the following day , the warning was expanded to include areas south to Tampico , Tamaulipas and extended further to Tuxpan , Veracruz twelve hours later . As the latter was occurring , the tropical storm warning was discontinued for Texas . Early on August 12 , all the warnings in Mexico were discontinued , as the storm had already moved inland . 800 people were evacuated in Soto la Marina and San Fernando in Tamaulipas . People in poor villages in the Rio Grande Valley were given sandbags with Tropical Storm Gabrielle approaching . 
 Overall damage was generally minor . There were no reports of wind damage , although tropical storm @-@ force winds affected the northern coast of Tamaulipas . A newspaper in Mexico reported up to 24 inches ( 600 mm ) of precipitation across much of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon ; this figure is in dispute , however , as the rainfall database maintained by Mexico 's National Weather Service shows the maximum amount to lie under 20 inches ( 508 mm ) . The heavy rainfall from the storm filled nearly half the reservoirs in Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas , which were almost empty due to drought conditions in the region . As a result , dozens in southern Nuevo Leon were forced to evacuation their homes . Rains from Gabrielle flooded streets and destroyed bridges and highways in northern Mexico . No storm surge recordings were taken in Mexico , although it is estimated by the National Hurricane Center that a surge of a few feet took place to the north of the track . Six fatalities were reported in Mexico as a result of Gabrielle . 
 In Texas , rainfall from the storm peaked at 6 @.@ 26 inches ( 159 mm ) in <unk> , while many other areas in southern Texas reported only 1 to 3 inches ( 25 to 76 mm ) of precipitation . Gabrielle 's rain came after a drought , and some of it soaked in . The rains also damaged unharvested cotton . Otherwise , minor flooding occurred . Brownsville reported up to 4 inches ( 102 mm ) of rain in association with Gabrielle . In extreme southern Texas , minor beach flooding took place at some of the beaches in the region . The remains of Gabrielle produced heavy thunderstorms in New Mexico on August 15 . 
 = Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement = 
 The Connecticut Indian Land Claims Settlement was an Indian Land Claims Settlement passed by the United States Congress in 1983 . The settlement act ended a lawsuit by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe to recover 800 acres of their 1666 reservation in Ledyard , Connecticut , sold in 1855 , allegedly in violation of the Nonintercourse Act that regulates commerce between Native Americans and non @-@ Indians . 
 The settlement act appropriated $ 900 @,@ 000 to buy the disputed lands and transferred those lands and the state reservation to the federal government in trust . The settlement act permits the state of Connecticut to exercise civil and criminal , but not regulatory , jurisdiction over the lands . This laid the foundation for the Mashantucket Pequot to create the Foxwoods Resort Casino , the largest casino in the world by revenue and floor space , and ( at one time ) the most profitable . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Pequot War ( 1634 – 1638 ) all but exterminated the Pequots , dividing the captives up between the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes who had allied with the settlers . In 1651 , John Winthrop the Younger persuaded the Connecticut Colony to create a 500 @-@ acre reservation for the Pequots in Noank , removing them from their previous places of residence . In 1666 , the Connecticut General Assembly voted to create a 2 @,@ 000 acre reservation for the " western " Pequots ( the group previously in the custody of the Mohegans ) in Ledyard , Connecticut ; the eastern Pequots were given 280 acres in present @-@ day North Stonington , Connecticut . By 1790 ( the year that Congress passed the first Nonintercourse Act ) , the reservation was only 1 @,@ 000 acres . In 1855 , Connecticut sold 800 of the remaining acres at $ 10 / acre , putting the money into a state administered trust account for the Pequots . 
 In the 1970s , David Crosby of Pine Tree Legal Assistance , a non @-@ profit law firm that was then litigating Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton in Maine , arrived on the Pequot reservation to discuss the possibility of a land claim . Advised by Crosby , the Pequots established a non @-@ profit corporation — Western Pequot Indians of Connecticut , Inc . — in 1974 . In April 1975 , Crosby finished his research and presented his findings to the Pequots . 
 = = Litigation = = 
 The Pequots filed suit in May 1976 in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut . The case was assigned to Judge Mosher Joseph Blumenfeld . The named plaintiffs were the Western Pequot Tribe and Richard " Skip " <unk> ( the leader of the Pequot tribe ) ; among the named defendants were Holdridge Enterprises and its president , David Holdridge . The 800 @-@ acre claim embraced only about a dozen to thirty @-@ five landowner defendants . The state of Connecticut was sued , and declined requests from the defendants to become involved in the litigation . 
 One of the lawyers for the defendants was Jackson King , a partner at Brown , Jacobson , Jewett & <unk> . King was first in his class at University of Connecticut School of Law and became involved in the case when one of the named defendants , who had served with him on a local land conservation commission , contacted him .

 HUD 
 The Pequots pursued federal recognition in parallel with their land claims litigation . They applied to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) to participate in HUD 's Indian housing assistance program . In March 1976 , Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso certified to HUD that the Pequots were " an autonomous unit or government " for the purposes of the revenue sharing program . At this time , there were thirty @-@ two tribal members . 
 BIA 
 On January 15 , 1979 , the Pequots filed a preliminary petition for federal tribal recognition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) . Historian Jack <unk> , who had previously worked as an expert witness with attorney Tom Tureen ( known for his role in Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton ( 1975 ) and other Nonintercourse Act claims ) , authored the petition . The Pequots did not submit a full recognition application to the BIA until mid @-@ 1983 . 
 = = Settlement Act = = 
 With the passage of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act in 1980 , attorney Tom Tureen turned his attention to the Mashantucket Pequot case . 
 In October 1981 , Tureen approached King ( the defendants ' lawyer ) regarding a federally legislated settlement . Tureen proposed that the state of Connecticut turn over the reservation to the federal government , and that the federal government pay the property owners fair market value to include their land in the federal reservation . As part of the deal , the state would retain civil and criminal , but not regulatory , authority of the reservation . The state approved the settlement in June 1982 . 
 The federal settlement bill included a $ 900 @,@ 000 appropriation , the appraisal value of the 800 acres , which the Pequots would use to buy the land from the landowner defendants . The legislation also provided that the landowners would not have to pay capital gains tax as long as they reinvested the money in real estate . 
 Senator Lowell P. Weicker , Jr . ( R @-@ CT ) delivered the draft bill to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs . Peter Taylor , the committee 's general counsel noticed that the bill did not limit the amount or location of the lands that the Pequots could buy with the settlement funds . Tureen and King prepared a map in accordance with Taylor 's wishes . 
 Senator William Cohen ( R @-@ ME ) , the chairman of the committee , began hearings on July 14 , 1982 . William <unk> , the solicitor general of the Department of the Interior , testified against the bill , which he viewed as circumventing the BIA 's recognition process and as costing too much money . Cohen criticized <unk> for lacking enough knowledge about the Pequots . Representative Sam <unk> ( D @-@ CT ) also supported the bill . 
 The House passed the bill , H.R. <unk> , on October 1 , 1982 , and the Senate passed a different version on December 21 . The compromise version was passed by the Senate on February 24 , 1982 by voice vote , and by the House on March 22 . However , President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill , opining that the state should pay more of the cost and that the Pequots may not meet the BIA 's definition of a tribe . Tureen , King , Hayward , and Sandy Cadwalader of the Indian Rights Association began lobbying for a veto override . Once 67 Senators had committed to voting for the bill — enough to have been the first veto override of Reagan 's presidency — a compromise was proposed whereby Connecticut would contribute $ 200 @,@ 000 toward road improvements ( which became known as " the veto road " ) . 
 At a new set of hearings in July 1983 , Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs John W. Fritz declared that the administration would not object to the new bill . Reagan signed the new bill , S. 1499 , into law on October 18 , 1983 . Since 1983 , the <unk> Pequots have appeared on every list of federally recognized tribes published by the Department of the Interior in the Federal Register .

 On April 30 , 1984 , the Pequot corporate body voted 12 @-@ 1 with two abstentions to approve the construction of a high @-@ stakes bingo operation . Barry Margolin , Tureen 's law partner , took the lead in representing the Pequots in this matter . After Connecticut 's chief state criminal attorney wrote the tribe a letter threatening to shut down the bingo operation if opened as planned , the Pequots filed for a federal preliminary injunction , which Judge Peter C. Dorsey ( who , as a magistrate , had ruled favorably for the Pequots in their land claim ) granted . Dorsey granted a permanent injunction on January 9 , 1986 , holding that Connecticut 's bingo laws did not apply to the reservation . The bingo hall opened on July 5 , 1986 .

 The Supreme Court 's decision in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians ( 1987 ) fueled the Pequot 's desire to upgrade their bingo hall to a full casino . In the wake of that decision , Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act ( IGRA ) on October 17 , 1988 . Tureen and Margolin concluded that the IGRA required Connecticut to negotiate a tribal @-@ state compact with the Pequot in good faith because of a state statute that permitted non @-@ profits , with a state license , to hold " Las Vegas nights " twice a year . The state statute in question had been lobbied for by Mothers Against Drunk Driving ( MADD ) in 1987 . At the request of Governor O 'Neill , acting state attorney general <unk> Riddle prepared a memorandum highlighting the differences between high school students playing casino games for monopoly money and a full @-@ scale , for @-@ profit casino . O 'Neill denied the Pequot 's request . 
 = = = Creation of Foxwoods = = = 
 When the state failed to negotiate , on November 3 , 1989 , the tribe sued the state under a provision of the IGRA — subsequently declared unconstitutional in Seminole Tribe v. Florida ( 1996 ) — that permitted such suits if state did not negotiate in good faith within 180 days . The case was <unk> again before Judge Dorsey . Dorsey granted the tribe summary judgment in May 1990 , ordering the state to resume negotiations and conclude a compact within 60 days . The Second Circuit upheld Dorsey 's ruling on September 4 , 1990 . The compact was forwarded to Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan , Jr. on October 1990 for his approval . On April 22 , 1991 , the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari to the state 's appeal from the Second Circuit 's ruling . 
 Former Senator Weicker replaced O 'Neil as governor in January 1991 . Weicker was opposed to gambling , and was advised that repealing the " Las Vegas night " statute was the only way to avoid a Pequot casino . Moreover , Weicker would have had to repeal the law before Secretary Lujan gave final approval to the compact . The Pequots retained lobbyists , reached out to charity groups that utilized the " Las Vegas night " statute , and brought in Native American Rights Fund executive director John <unk> to defeat Weicker 's proposed bill . Weicker 's bill prevailed by 18 @-@ 17 with one absent in the Connecticut Senate . However , the House rejected the bill by more than 20 votes . Secretary Lujan approved the compact on May 31 , 1991 . 
 The Pequots signed a financing agreement with Malaysian partners on February 25 , 1991 for the construction of Foxwoods Resort Casino . Foxwoods opened on February 12 , 1992 . That year , even though slot machines had yet to be installed , the 245 @-@ member Pequot tribe received $ 148 million in revenue and $ 51 million in profit from Foxwoods . Threatened with the possibility of competition from non @-@ Indian gambling , the Pequots offered the state a share of slot machine revenue in October 1992 ( the issue of slot machines had been left for the courts in the original compact ) . A provision of the agreement provided that if slot machine gambling were to be legalized in the state , the revenue sharing would cease . On January 13 , 1993 , the tribe and state announced a deal that would give the state 25 % of gross slot machine revenue , guaranteeing at least $ 100M / year . By 1998 , Foxwoods was generating $ 1 billion in revenue and $ 152 million in net income for the tribe .

 Starting in 1993 , the Pequot began negotiations to purchase additional lands and convey those lands to the Department of Interior in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 . Local towns sued the tribes to prevent this . In 1996 and 1998 , Interior Department , under Secretary Bruce Babbitt , approved the tribe 's request to put 165 new acres ( 0 @.@ 67 km2 ) and 146 new acres ( 0 @.@ 59 km2 ) , respectively , into trust . The Supreme Court 's decision in <unk> v. Salazar ( 2009 ) prevents any further such transfers . 
 = North American XB @-@ 70 Valkyrie = 
 The North American Aviation XB @-@ 70 Valkyrie is the prototype of the B @-@ 70 nuclear @-@ armed , deep @-@ penetration strategic bomber for the U.S. Air Force 's Strategic Air Command . In the late 1950s North American Aviation designed the Valkyrie bomber as a large , six @-@ engined aircraft capable of reaching Mach 3 + while flying at 70 @,@ 000 feet ( 21 @,@ 000 m ) . 
 At these speeds , it was expected that the B @-@ 70 would be almost immune to interceptor aircraft , the only effective weapon against bomber aircraft at the time . The bomber would spend only a few minutes over a particular radar station , flying out of its range before the controllers could position their fighters in a suitable location for an interception . Its high speed also made the aircraft difficult to see on the radar displays , and its high altitude flight could not be matched by any contemporary Soviet fighter . 
 The introduction of the first Soviet surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles in the late 1950s put the near @-@ invulnerability of the B @-@ 70 in doubt . In response , the US Air Force ( USAF ) began flying its missions at low level , where the missile radar 's line of sight was limited by local terrain . In this low @-@ level penetration role , the B @-@ 70 offered little additional performance over the B @-@ 52 it was meant to replace . It was , however , far more expensive and had shorter range . Other alternate missions were proposed , but these were of limited scope . As the strategic role passed from bombers to intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) during the late 1950s , manned bombers were increasingly seen as obsolete . 
 The USAF eventually gave up fighting for its production , and the B @-@ 70 program was canceled in 1961 . Development was then turned over to a research program to study the effects of long @-@ duration high @-@ speed flight . As such , two prototype aircraft were built , and designated XB @-@ 70A ; these aircraft were used for supersonic test @-@ flights during 1964 – 69 . In 1966 , one prototype crashed after colliding in mid @-@ air with a smaller jet aircraft ; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton , Ohio . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 As an offshoot of Boeing 's MX @-@ 2145 manned boost @-@ glide bomber project , Boeing partnered with RAND Corporation in January 1954 to explore what sort of bomber aircraft would be needed to deliver the various nuclear weapons then under development . At the time , nuclear weapons weighed several tons , and the need to carry enough fuel to fly that payload from the continental United States to the Soviet Union demanded large bombers . They also concluded that after release of bombs the aircraft would need supersonic speed to escape the critical blast @-@ radius . 
 The aviation industry had been studying this problem for some time . From the mid @-@ 1940s , there was much interest in using nuclear @-@ powered aircraft in the bomber role . In a conventional jet engine , thrust is provided by heating air using jet fuel and accelerating it out a nozzle . In a nuclear engine , heat is supplied by a reactor , whose consumables last for months instead of hours . Most designs also carried a small amount of jet fuel for use during high @-@ power portions of flight — take @-@ off and high @-@ speed dashes . 
 Another possibility being explored at the time was the use of boron @-@ enriched " zip fuels " , which improves the energy density of jet fuel by about 40 percent , and could be used in modified versions of existing jet engine designs . Zip fuels appeared to offer sufficient performance improvement to produce a strategic bomber with supersonic speed . 
 = = = WS @-@ 110A = = = 
 The U.S. Air Force ( USAF ) followed these developments closely , and in 1955 issued General Operational Requirement No. 38 for a new bomber combining the payload and intercontinental range of the B @-@ 52 with the Mach 2 top speed of the Convair B @-@ 58 Hustler . The new bomber was expected to enter service in 1963 . Both nuclear and conventional designs would be considered . The nuclear @-@ powered bomber was organized as " Weapon System <unk> " and pursued simultaneously with the jet @-@ powered version , " Weapon System 110A " . 
 The USAF Air Research and Development Command 's ( ARDC ) requirement for WS @-@ 110A asked for a chemical fuel bomber with Mach 0 @.@ 9 cruising speed and " maximum possible " speed during a 1 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 1 @,@ 852 km ) entrance and exit from the target . The requirement also called for a 50 @,@ 000 pound ( 22 @,@ 670 kg ) payload and a combat radius of 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 600 mi , 7 @,@ 400 km ) . The Air Force formed similar requirements for a WS @-@ <unk> intercontinental reconnaissance system in 1955 , but this was later canceled in 1958 due to better options . In July 1955 , six contractors were selected to bid on WS @-@ 110A studies . Boeing and North American Aviation ( NAA ) submitted proposals , and on 8 November 1955 were awarded contracts for Phase 1 development . 
 In mid @-@ 1956 , initial designs were presented by the two companies . Zip fuel was to be used in the afterburners to improve range by 10 to 15 percent over conventional fuel . Both designs featured huge wing tip fuel tanks that could be jettisoned when their fuel was depleted before a supersonic dash to the target . The tanks also included the outer portions of the wing , which would also be jettisoned to produce a smaller wing suitable for supersonic speeds . Both became trapezoidal wings after ejection , at that time the highest performance planform known . They also featured flush cockpits to maintain the highest fineness ratio possible in spite of its effects on visibility . 
 The two designs had takeoff weights of approximately 750 @,@ 000 pounds ( 340 @,@ 000 kg ) with large fuel loads . The Air Force evaluated the designs , and in September 1956 deemed them too large and complicated for operations . General Curtis LeMay was dismissive , declaiming , " This is not an airplane , it 's a three @-@ ship formation . " The USAF ended Phase 1 development in October 1956 and instructed the two contractors to continue design studies . 
 = = = New designs = = = 
 During the period that the original proposals were being studied , advances in supersonic flight were proceeding rapidly . The narrow delta was establishing itself as a preferred planform for supersonic flight , replacing earlier designs like the swept @-@ wing and trapezoidal layouts seen on designs like the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter and the earlier WS @-@ 110 concepts . Engines able to cope with higher temperatures and widely varying intake ramp air speeds were also under design , allowing for sustained supersonic speeds . 
 This work led to an interesting discovery . When an engine was optimized specifically for high speed , it burned perhaps twice as much fuel at that speed than when it was running at subsonic speeds . However , the aircraft would be flying as much as four times as fast . Thus its most economical cruise speed , in terms of fuel per mile , was its maximum speed . This was entirely unexpected and implied that there was no point in the dash concept ; if the aircraft was able to reach Mach 3 , it may as well fly its entire mission at that speed . The question remained whether such a concept was technically feasible , but by March 1957 , engine development and wind tunnel testing had progressed enough to suggest it was . 
 WS @-@ 110 was redesigned as an aircraft flying Mach 3 for the entire mission . Zip fuel was retained for the engine 's afterburner to increase range . Both North American and Boeing returned new designs with very long fuselages and large delta wings . They differed primarily in engine layout ; the NAA design arranged its six engines in a semi @-@ circular duct under the rear fuselage , while the Boeing design used separate podded engines located individually on pylons below the wing , like the Hustler . 
 North American had scoured the literature to find any additional advantage . This led them to an obscure report by two NACA wind tunnel experts , who wrote a report in 1956 titled " Aircraft Configurations Developing High Lift @-@ Drag <unk> at High Supersonic Speeds " . Known today as compression lift , the idea was to use the shock wave generated off the nose or other sharp points on the aircraft as a source of high @-@ pressure air . By carefully positioning the wing in relation to the shock , the shock 's high pressure could be captured on the bottom of the wing and generate additional lift . To take maximum advantage of this effect , they redesigned the underside of the aircraft to feature a large triangular intake area far forward of the engines , better positioning the shock in relation to the wing . 
 North American improved on the basic concept by adding a set of drooping wing tip panels that were lowered at high speed . This helped trap the shock wave under the wing between the downturned wing tips . It also added more vertical surface to the aircraft to maintain directional stability at high speeds . NAA 's solution had an additional advantage , as it decreased the surface area of the rear of the wing when the panels were moved into their high @-@ speed position . This helped offset the rearward shift of the center of pressure , or " average lift point " , with increasing speeds . Under normal conditions this caused an increasing nose @-@ down trim , which had to be offset by moving the control surfaces , increasing drag . When the wing tips were drooped the surface area at the rear of the wings was lowered , moving the lift forward and counteracting this effect , reducing the need for control inputs . 
 The buildup of heat due to skin friction during sustained supersonic flight had to be addressed . During a Mach 3 cruise , the aircraft would reach an average of 450 ° F ( 230 ° C ) , with leading edges reaching 630 ° F ( 330 ° C ) , and up to 1 @,@ 000 ° F ( 540 ° C ) in engine compartments . NAA proposed building their design out of sandwich panels , with each panel consisting of two thin sheets of stainless steel brazed to opposite faces of a honeycomb @-@ shaped foil core . Expensive titanium would be used only in high @-@ temperature areas like the leading edge of the horizontal stabilizer , and the nose . For cooling the interior , the XB @-@ 70 pumped fuel en route to the engines through heat exchangers . 
 On 30 August 1957 , the Air Force decided that enough data was available on the NAA and Boeing designs that a competition could begin . On 18 September , the Air Force issued operational requirements which called for a cruising speed of Mach 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 2 , an over @-@ target altitude of 70 @,@ 000 – 75 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 300 – 22 @,@ 700 m ) , a range of up to 10 @,@ 500 mi ( 16 @,@ 900 km ) , and a gross weight not to exceed 490 @,@ 000 lb ( 222 @,@ 000 kg ) . The aircraft would have to use the hangars , runways and handling procedures used by the B @-@ 52 . On 23 December 1957 , the North American proposal was declared the winner of the competition , and on 24 January 1958 , a contract was issued for Phase 1 development . 
 In February 1958 , the proposed bomber was designated B @-@ 70 , with the prototypes receiving the " X " experimental prototype designation . The name " Valkyrie " was the winning submission in early 1958 , selected from 20 @,@ 000 entries in a USAF " Name the B @-@ 70 " contest . The Air Force approved an 18 @-@ month program acceleration in March 1958 that rescheduled the first flight to December 1961 . But in late 1958 the service announced that this acceleration would not be possible due to lack of funding . In December 1958 , a Phase II contract was issued . The mockup of the B @-@ 70 was reviewed by the Air Force in March 1959 . Provisions for air @-@ to @-@ surface missiles and external fuel tanks were requested afterward . At the same time , North American was developing the F @-@ 108 supersonic interceptor . To reduce program costs , the F @-@ 108 would share two of the engines , the escape capsule , and some smaller systems with the B @-@ 70 . In early 1960 , North American and the USAF released the first drawing of the XB @-@ 70 to the public . 
 = = = The " missile problem " = = = 
 The B @-@ 70 was planned to use a high @-@ speed , high @-@ altitude bombing approach that followed a trend of bombers flying progressively faster and higher since the start of manned bomber use . Through that same period , only two weapons proved effective against bombers , fighter aircraft and anti @-@ aircraft artillery ( AAA ) . Flying higher and faster made it more difficult for both ; higher speeds allowed the bomber to fly out of range of the weapons more quickly , while higher altitudes increased the time needed for fighters to climb to the bombers , and greatly increased the size of the AAA weapons needed to reach those altitudes . 
 As early as 1942 , German flak commanders had already concluded that AAA would be essentially useless against jet aircraft , and began development of guided missiles to fill this role . Most forces reached the same conclusion soon after , with both the US and UK starting missile development programs before the war ended . The UK 's Green Mace was one of the last attempts to develop a useful high @-@ altitude AAA weapon , but its development ended in 1957 . 
 Interceptor aircraft with ever @-@ improving performance remained the only effective anti @-@ bomber weapons by the early 1950s , and even these were having problems keeping up with the latest designs ; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high @-@ altitude U @-@ 2 reconnaissance aircraft , in spite of its relatively low speeds . It was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip @-@ to @-@ scan ratio , and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters . 
 The introduction of the first effective anti @-@ aircraft missiles by the late 1950s changed this picture dramatically . Missiles could stand ready for immediate launch , eliminating operational delays like the time needed to get the pilot into the cockpit of a fighter . Guidance did not require wide @-@ area tracking or calculation of an intercept course : a simple comparison of the time needed to fly to the altitude of the target returned the required deflection . Missiles also had greater altitude capability than any aircraft , and improving this to adapt to new aircraft was a low @-@ cost development path . The US was aware of Soviet work in the field , and had reduced the expected operational lifetime of the U @-@ 2 , knowing that it would become vulnerable to these missiles as they were improved . This later happened with the 1960 downing of the U @-@ 2 flown by Gary Powers . 
 Faced with this problem , military doctrine had already started shifting away from high @-@ altitude supersonic bombing toward low @-@ altitude penetration . Radar is line @-@ of @-@ sight , so aircraft could dramatically shorten detection distances by flying close to the Earth and hiding behind terrain . Missile sites spaced to overlap in range when attacking bombers at high altitudes would leave large gaps between their coverage for bombers flying at lower levels . With an appropriate map of the missile sites , the bombers could fly between and around the defences . Additionally , early missiles generally flew unguided for a period of time before the radar systems were able to track the missile and start sending it guidance signals . With the SA @-@ 2 Guideline missile , this minimum altitude was roughly 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . Flying below this would make the bomber effectively invulnerable to the missiles , even if they happened to fly into range . 
 Flying at low level provided protection against fighters as well . Radars of the era did not have the ability to look down ; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude , the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target . An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it . The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes to increase the amount of visible sky , but doing so would limit its radar range in the same way as the missile sites , as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time . The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look @-@ down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar , and even this model had very limited capability . 
 Strategic Air Command found itself in an uncomfortable position ; bombers had been tuned for efficiency at high speeds and altitudes , performance that had been purchased at great cost in both engineering and financial terms . Before the B @-@ 70 was to replace the B @-@ 52 in the long @-@ range role , SAC had introduced the B @-@ 58 Hustler to replace the Boeing B @-@ 47 Stratojet in the medium @-@ range role . The Hustler was expensive to develop and purchase , and required enormous amounts of fuel and maintenance in comparison to the B @-@ 47 . It was estimated that it cost three times as much to operate as the much larger and longer @-@ ranged B @-@ 52 . 
 The B @-@ 70 , designed for even higher speeds , altitudes and range than the B @-@ 58 , suffered even more in relative terms . At high altitudes , the B @-@ 70 was as much as four times as fast as the B @-@ 52 , but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach 0 @.@ 95 , only modestly faster than the B @-@ 52 at the same altitudes . It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range . Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover , especially on the long journey from the USA to USSR . The value was limited ; the USAF 's doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack . In this case , the higher speed would be used for only a short period of time between the staging areas and the Soviet coastline . 
 Adding to the problems , the zip fuel program was canceled in 1959 . After burning , the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components . Although the B @-@ 70 was intended to use zip only in the afterburners , and thus avoid this problem , the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation . This by itself was not a fatal problem , however , as newly developed high @-@ energy fuels like JP @-@ 6 were available to make up some of the difference . Most of the range lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank . However , another problem arose when the F @-@ 108 program was canceled in September 1959 , which ended the shared development that benefited the B @-@ 70 program . 
 = = = <unk> , upswing , cancellation = = = 
 At two secret meetings on 16 and 18 November 1959 , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Air Force General Twining , recommended the Air Force 's plan for the B @-@ 70 to reconnoiter and strike rail @-@ mobile Soviet ICBMs , but the Chief of Staff of the Air Force , General White , admitted the Soviets would " be able to hit the B @-@ 70 with rockets " and requested the B @-@ 70 be downgraded to " a bare minimum research and development program " at $ 200 million for fiscal year 1960 . President Eisenhower responded that the reconnaissance and strike mission was " crazy " since the nuclear mission was to attack known production and military complexes , and emphasized that he saw no need for the B @-@ 70 since the ICBM is " a cheaper , more effective way of doing the same thing " . Eisenhower also identified that the B @-@ 70 would not be in manufacturing until " eight to ten years from now " and " said he thought we were talking about bows and arrows at a time of gunpowder when we spoke of bombers in the missile age " . In December 1959 the Air Force announced the B @-@ 70 project would be cut to a single prototype , and most of the planned B @-@ 70 subsystems would no longer be developed . 
 Then interest increased due to the politics of presidential campaign of 1960 . A central plank of John F. Kennedy 's campaign was that Eisenhower and the Republicans were weak on defense , and pointed to the B @-@ 70 as an example . He told a San Diego audience near NAA facilities , " I endorse wholeheartedly the B @-@ 70 manned aircraft . " Kennedy also made similar campaign claims regarding other aircraft : near the Seattle Boeing plant he affirmed the need for B @-@ 52s and in Fort Worth he praised the B @-@ 58 . 
 The Air Force changed the program to full weapon development and awarded a contract for an XB @-@ 70 prototype and 11 YB @-@ 70s in August 1960 . In November 1960 , the B @-@ 70 program received a $ 265 million appropriation from Congress for FY 1961 . Nixon , trailing in his home state of California , also publicly endorsed the B @-@ 70 , and on 30 October Eisenhower helped the Republican campaign with a pledge of an additional $ 155 million for the B @-@ 70 development program . 
 On taking office in January 1961 , Kennedy was informed that the missile gap was an illusion . On 28 March 1961 , after $ 800 million had been spent on the B @-@ 70 program , Kennedy canceled the project as " unnecessary and economically unjustifiable " because it " stood little chance of penetrating enemy defenses successfully . " Instead , Kennedy recommended " the B @-@ 70 program be carried forward essentially to explore the problem of flying at three times the speed of sound with an airframe potentially useful as a bomber . " After Congress approved $ 290 million of B @-@ 70 " add @-@ on " funds to the President 's 12 May 1960 modified FY 1961 budget , the Administration decided on a " Planned Utilization " of only $ 100 million of these funds . The Department of Defense subsequently presented data to Congress that the B @-@ 70 would add little performance for the high cost . 
 However , after becoming the new Air Force Chief of Staff in July 1961 , Curtis LeMay increased his B @-@ 70 advocacy , including interviews for August Reader 's Digest and November Aviation Week articles , and allowing a 25 February General Electric tour at which the press was provided artist conceptions of , and other info about , the B @-@ 70 . Congress had also continued B @-@ 70 appropriations in an effort to resurrect bomber development . After Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara explained again to the House Armed Services Committee ( HASC ) on 24 January 1962 that the B @-@ 70 was unjustifiable , LeMay subsequently argued for the B @-@ 70 to both the House and Senate committees — and was chastised by McNamara on 1 March . By 7 March 1962 , the HASC — with 21 members having B @-@ 70 work in their districts — had written an appropriations bill to " direct " — by law — the Executive Branch to use all of the nearly $ 500 million appropriated for the RS @-@ 70 . McNamara was unsuccessful with an address to the HASC on 14 March , but a 19 March 1962 11th hour White House Rose Garden agreement between Kennedy and HASC chairman Carl Vinson retracted the bill 's language and the bomber remained canceled .

 The XB @-@ 70s were intended to be used for the advanced study of aerodynamics , propulsion , and other subjects related to large supersonic transports . The crew was reduced to only the two pilots , as a navigator and a bombardier were not needed for this research role . The production order was reduced to three prototypes in March 1961 with the third aircraft to incorporate improvements from the previous prototype . The order was later reduced to two experimental XB @-@ <unk> , named Air Vehicle 1 and 2 ( AV @-@ 1 and AV @-@ 2 ) . XB @-@ 70 No. 1 was completed on 7 May 1964 , and rolled out on 11 May 1964 at Palmdale , California . One report stated " nothing like it existed anywhere " . AV @-@ 2 was completed on 15 October 1964 . The manufacture of the third prototype ( AV @-@ 3 ) was canceled in July 1964 before completion . The first XB @-@ 70 carried out its maiden flight in September 1964 and many more test flights followed . 
 The data from the XB @-@ 70 test flights and aerospace materials development were used in the later B @-@ 1 bomber program , the American supersonic transport ( SST ) program , and via espionage , the Soviet Union 's Tupolev Tu @-@ 144 SST program . The development of the Lockheed U @-@ 2 and the SR @-@ 71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft , as well as the XB @-@ 70 , prompted Soviet aerospace engineers to design and develop their high @-@ altitude and high @-@ speed MiG @-@ 25 interceptor . 
 = = Design = = 
 The Valkyrie was designed to be a high @-@ altitude Mach 3 bomber with six engines . Harrison Storms shaped the aircraft with a canard surface and a delta wing , which was built largely of stainless steel , sandwiched honeycomb panels , and titanium . The XB @-@ 70 was designed to use supersonic technologies developed for the Mach 3 Navaho , as well as a modified form of the SM @-@ 64 Navaho 's all @-@ inertial guidance system . 
 The XB @-@ 70 used compression lift , which arose from a shock wave generated by the sharp leading edge of the central engine intake splitter plate below the wing . At Mach 3 cruising speed , the shock wave attached along the wing leading edge , preventing the high pressure behind the shock front from leaking up over the wing . The compression lift provided five percent of the total lift . The wing included inboard camber to more effectively use the higher pressure field behind the strong shock wave . Unique among aircraft of its size , the outer portions of the wings were hinged , and could be pivoted downward by up to 65 degrees , acting almost as a type of variable @-@ geometry wingtip device . This increased the aircraft 's directional stability at supersonic speeds , shifted the center of lift to a more favorable position at high speeds , and strengthened the compression lift effect . With the wingtips drooped downwards , the compression lift shock wave would be further trapped under the wings . 
 The XB @-@ 70 was equipped with six General Electric YJ93 @-@ GE @-@ 3 turbojet engines , designed to use JP @-@ 6 jet fuel . The engine was stated to be in the " 30 @,@ 000 @-@ pound class " , but actually produced 28 @,@ 000 lbf ( 124 @.@ 6 kN ) with afterburner and 19 @,@ 900 lbf ( 88 kN ) without afterburner . The Valkyrie used fuel for cooling ; it was pumped through heat exchangers before reaching the engines . To reduce the likelihood of autoignition , nitrogen was injected into the JP @-@ 6 during refueling , and the " fuel pressurization and <unk> system " vaporized a 700 lb ( 320 kg ) supply of liquid nitrogen to fill the fuel tank vent space and maintain tank pressure .

 The XB @-@ 70 's maiden flight was on 21 September 1964 . In the first flight test , between Palmdale and Edwards AFB , one engine had to be shut down shortly after take @-@ off , and an undercarriage malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution , limiting speed to 390 mph - about half that planned . On landing , the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked , the tires ruptured , and a fire started . 
 The Valkyrie first became supersonic ( Mach 1 @.@ 1 ) on the third test flight on 12 October 1964 , and flew above Mach 1 for 40 minutes during the following flight on 24 October . The wing tips were also lowered partially in this flight . XB @-@ 70 No. 1 surpassed Mach 3 on 14 October 1965 by reaching Mach 3 @.@ 02 at 70 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 300 m ) . The first aircraft was found to suffer from weaknesses in the honeycomb panels , primarily due to inexperience with fabrication and quality control of this new material . On two occasions , honeycomb panels failed and were torn off during supersonic flight , necessitating a Mach 2 @.@ 5 limit being placed on the aircraft . 
 The deficiencies discovered on AV @-@ 1 were almost completely solved on the second XB @-@ 70 , which first flew on 17 July 1965 . On 3 January 1966 , XB @-@ 70 No. 2 attained a speed of Mach 3 @.@ 05 while flying at 72 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 900 m ) . AV @-@ 2 reached a top speed of Mach 3 @.@ 08 and maintained it for 20 minutes on 12 April 1966 . On 19 May 1966 , AV @-@ 2 reached Mach 3 @.@ 06 and flew at Mach 3 for 32 minutes , covering 2 @,@ 400 mi ( 3 @,@ 840 km ) in 91 minutes of total flight . 
 A joint NASA / USAF research program was conducted from 3 November 1966 to 31 January 1967 for measuring the intensity and signature of sonic booms for the National Sonic Boom Program ( <unk> ) . Testing was planned to cover a range of sonic boom <unk> on the ground similar to but higher than the proposed American SST . In 1966 , AV @-@ 2 was selected for the program and was outfitted with test sensors . It flew the first sonic boom test on 6 June 1966 , attaining a speed of Mach 3 @.@ 05 at 72 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 900 m ) . Two days later , AV @-@ 2 crashed following a mid @-@ air collision with an F @-@ 104 while flying in a multi @-@ aircraft formation . Sonic boom and later testing continued with XB @-@ 70A # 1 . 
 The second flight research program ( NASA <unk> @-@ 1174 ) investigated " control of structural dynamics " from 25 April 1967 through the XB @-@ 70 's last flight in 1969 . At high altitude and high speed , the XB @-@ 70A experienced unwanted changes in altitude . NASA testing from June 1968 included two small vanes on the nose of AV @-@ 1 for measuring the response of the aircraft 's stability augmentation system . AV @-@ 1 flew a total of 83 flights . 
 The XB @-@ 70 's last supersonic flight took place on 17 December 1968 . On 4 February 1969 , AV @-@ 1 took its final flight to Wright @-@ Patterson Air Force Base for museum display ( now the National Museum of the United States Air Force ) . Flight data was collected on this subsonic trip . North American Rockwell completed a four @-@ volume report on the B @-@ 70 that was published by NASA in April 1972 .

 On 8 June 1966 , XB @-@ 70A No. 2 was in close formation with four other aircraft ( an F @-@ 4 , F @-@ 5 , T @-@ 38 , and F @-@ 104 ) for a photoshoot at the behest of General Electric , manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft . After the completion of the photoshoot , the F @-@ 104 drifted into contact with the XB @-@ 70 's right wing , flipped over and rolled inverted over the top of the Valkyrie , striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber . The F @-@ 104 exploded , destroying the Valkyrie 's rudders and damaging its left wing . With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings , the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow , California . NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker ( F @-@ 104 pilot ) and Carl Cross ( XB @-@ 70 co @-@ pilot ) were killed . Al White ( XB @-@ 70 pilot ) ejected , sustaining serious injuries , including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell @-@ like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection . 
 The USAF summary report of the accident investigation stated that , given the position of the F @-@ 104 relative to the XB @-@ 70 , the F @-@ 104 pilot would not have been able to see the XB @-@ 70 's wing , except by uncomfortably looking back over his left shoulder . The report said that it was likely that Walker , piloting the F @-@ 104 , maintained his position by looking at the fuselage of the XB @-@ 70 , forward of his position . The F @-@ 104 was estimated to be 70 ft ( 21 m ) to the side of , and 10 ft ( 3 m ) below , the fuselage of the XB @-@ 70 . The report concluded that from that position , without appropriate sight cues , Walker was unable to properly perceive his motion relative to the Valkyrie , leading to his aircraft drifting into contact with the XB @-@ 70 's wing . The accident investigation also pointed to the wake vortex off the XB @-@ 70 's right wingtip as the reason for the F @-@ 104 's sudden roll over and into the bomber .

 Eurovision Song Contest 's Greatest Hits ( also known as Eurovision 's Greatest Hits ) was a live television concert programme organised by the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) and produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) to commemorate the Eurovision Song Contest 's 60th anniversary . The concert took place on 31 March 2015 at the Eventim Apollo , in Hammersmith , London . Guy Freeman was the executive producer and Geoff Posner the director , both of whom held the same positions as the last time the BBC hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in 1998 . Simon Proctor was the senior producer and David Arch was the musical director for the concert . Tickets for the event went on sale at 10am on 6 February 2015 . 
 Graham Norton and Petra Mede hosted the event , which saw fifteen acts from thirteen countries performing their Eurovision entries from yesteryear . During the televised show , video montages for some of the Eurovision Song Contest archives were shown in @-@ between each live performance . The United Kingdom entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 was performed at the concert , but never broadcast on the televised show . Riverdance performed a reprise of their 1994 Eurovision Song Contest interval act as part of the anniversary celebrations . 
 Several countries confirmed that they would air the delayed broadcast of the concert on various dates that suited the broadcasters scheduling , including Australia , who competed in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015 as a wildcard entry . The host broadcaster , BBC , and Raidió Teilifís Éireann ( RTÉ ) , simulcast the show on Good Friday , 3 April 2015 . The Dutch broadcaster , AVROTROS , were the first to announce their decision to not broadcast the event . Other countries also announced their decision to decline broadcasting the event , including Luxembourg , who had an act taking part in the event .

 = Broken World ( Millennium ) = 
 " ' Broken World " is the twentieth episode of the first season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on May 2 , 1997 . The episode was written by Robert Moresco and Patrick Harbinson , and directed by Winrich Kolbe . " Broken World " featured guest appearances by Ingrid <unk> , Donnelly Rhodes and Jo Anderson . 
 Millennium Group consultant Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) travels to North Dakota to track down a burgeoning serial killer who has progressed from mauling horses to attacking and killing people . 
 " Broken World " featured the last directorial effort for the series by Kolbe , and the last script written by Moresco ; however , Harbinson would return to write further episodes in later seasons . The episode has been compared to Peter Shaffer 's 1973 play Equus , and received a Genesis Award from the Humane Society of the United States in 1998 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Bowman , North Dakota , a stable @-@ hand named Sally Dumont ( Ingrid <unk> ) is attacked and left unconscious after she finds a horse has been murdered in its stall . Private investigation organization the Millennium Group send offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) to investigate , as twenty @-@ one horses have been killed in the same manner over the past two years in the area . Black believes the culprit is in the early stages of developing into a sexually motivated serial killer . Investigating the stables , the word " help " is found written in human blood , while semen is found near where the horse was killed . Black concludes the killer is struggling with the new feelings of having attacked a person and not an animal . 
 The killer — Willi Borgsen ( Van Quattro ) — is next seen attacking pigs in a trailer using a cattle prod . Borgsen is accosted by the pigs ' owner , and responds by turning the cattle prod on him . The victim 's body is later found in a nearby thicket . Black examines the scene , determining from the <unk> and evidence of the cattle prod being used that the killer works in a slaughterhouse . 
 Another human victim is later found on a farm , alongside another dead horse . The phrase " thank you " is daubed on a nearby wall . The North Dakota police set up an anonymous phone number to appeal for information , which Borgsen uses to taunt Black by describing the pleasure he derives from killing . Black consults with a veterinarian , Claudia Vaughan ( Jo Anderson ) , about the case , and learns that the area is home to a <unk> farm — estrogen for pharmaceutical use is derived from the urine of mares which are kept pregnant , their foals killed for meat to be exported . Black feels the killer may have been raised on one of these farms . 
 Borgsen contacts Black again , confessing that his latest killing has not satisfied him . Black warns that his urges will only grow , and will never be satisfied again . When Borgsen hangs up , Black deduces that Vaughan is to be the next victim . Black , fellow Group member Peter Watts ( Terry O 'Quinn ) and Sheriff Falkner ( John Dennis Johnston ) track the kidnapped Vaughan to an equine slaughterhouse . Falkner is attacked and incapacitated by Borgsen as Black locates a still @-@ living Vaughan , who has been hung by her jacket from a meat hook . Black is then confronted by Borgsen , who knocks him down with the cattle prod . Borgsen is about to kill Black with a captive bolt pistol , but is trampled to death by several escaped horses . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Broken World " was written by Robert Moresco and Patrick Harbinson . Moresco had previously written " Covenant " earlier in the first season , and also acted as a producer during the series ' run . Harbinson , making his first contribution to the series with this episode , would later pen a further four episodes in the third season — " Via Dolorosa " , " Darwin 's Eye " , " The Sound of Snow " and " Through a Glass Darkly " . " Broken World " also marked the final episode of Millennium helmed by director Winrich Kolbe , who had previously worked on " Lamentation " , " Force Majeure " and " Kingdom Come " . 
 During production , " Broken World " was instead set to be titled " Equus " , which is Latin for " horse " and was also the title of a 1973 play by Peter Shaffer concerning a young man with violent sexual urges towards horses . The episode opens with a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche 's 1883 – 1885 treatise Thus Spoke Zarathustra — " Man is the cruelest animal " . Guest star Donnelly Rhodes , who portrayed Peter Dumont , would later make an appearance in the third season episode " ... Thirteen Years Later " in an unrelated role .

 = Battle of Jajau = 
 The Battle of Jajau was fought between the two Mughal princes and brothers Bahadur Shah I and Muhammad Azam Shah on 20 June 1707 . In 1707 , their father Aurangzeb died without having declared a successor ; instead leaving a will in which he instructed his sons to divide the kingdom between themselves . Their failure to reach a satisfactory agreement led to a military conflict . After Azam Shah and his three sons were killed in the Battle of Jajau , Bahadur Shah was crowned as the Mughal emperor on 19 June 1707 at the age of 63 . 
 = = Background and preparations = = 
 After a 49 @-@ year reign , the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb died in 1707 without officially declaring a crown prince . He left a will advising his sons to divide the empire between themselves . 
 At the time of Aurangzeb 's death , his eldest son , Bahadur Shah I , was stationed at Jamrud , 12 miles west of Peshawar . His second son , Muhammad Azam Shah , was stationed at Ahmednagar , east of Bombay . With the distance between Jamrud and Agra being 715 miles and the distance between Ahmednagar and Agra being 700 miles , whoever reached the capital city of Agra first would capture the Mughal throne . 
 Even before Aurangzeb died , Bahadur Shah I had made preparations for a battle for the Mughal throne . With the help of Munim Khan , the <unk> subahdar of Lahore , he gathered troops from local rulers in Beas and <unk> . He had built bridges and improved the roads between Lahore and Peshawar . He was also successful in persuading Rao Budh Singh ( the king of Bundi ) and Bijai Singh of <unk> to send their soldiers to him . 
 With his children , <unk> Akhtar and Rafi @-@ ush @-@ Shan , Bahadur Shah reached Lahore and declared himself the Mughal ruler on 3 May 1707 . After taking 28 lakh rupees , he left the city on 5 May 1707 . By 1 June , he reached Delhi . Reaching the city , he visited the Nizamuddin Dargah and the shrine of <unk> <unk> Kaki . From the Red Fort , he took 30 lakh rupees , and on 3 June , he resumed his journey . By 12 June , he had reached Agra and camped in <unk> Ghat on the outskirts of the city . <unk> Khan <unk> , commandant of the Agra Fort , surrendered the fort to Munim Khan , who subsequently sealed the treasury . 
 Bahadur Shah sent a letter to Azam Shah asking him to be content with Southern India , the part of India which had been willed to him by their father Aurangzeb . He also wrote that , if he was not happy with his part , then he was ready to give him the territories of Gujarat and Ajmer . He added that , if Azam Shah was not satisfied with this offer , he would have to use the " sword to decide " the monarch of the kingdom . In his reply , Azam wrote : 
 My share is from the floor to the roof of the house . Yours is from the roof to the firmament . 
 = = Conflict = = 
 Realising that a battle could not be avoided , Bahadur Shah I marched towards Agra , having decided to fight a battle at Dholpur ( 34 miles from the city ) . Under his command , prince Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan was dispatched with 80 @,@ 000 horsemen , with 11 crore rupees that he had collected from Bengal , where he was the governor . He was ordered to capture the forts in Chambal ( one mile from Dholpur ) . 
 As soon as Azam Shah heard that Bahadur Shah I had started preparing for a march towards Agra , he left the fort of Gwalior in charge of the wazir , Asad Khan . He crossed the Chambal at the <unk> crossing and made for Dholpur . He made his son , Bidar Bakht , the commander of the vanguard of the troops . Leading 25 @,@ 000 horsemen , he was accompanied by his brother , Mirza Wala @-@ Jah , and other Rajput chiefs . When they neared Dholpur , Azam Shah made Bakht the commander of a further 65 @,@ 000 horsemen and 40 @,@ 000 infantry . The army was divided into four branches commanded by Bidar Bakht , Azam Shah himself , and his sons Ali Tabar and Wala Jah . Though the army did not have " large cannons " and " mortars " , it possessed camel @-@ guns and elephant @-@ guns . Azam Shah was of the opinion that " an artillery fight was a stripling 's pastime and the only real weapon was the sword " . 
 On 17 June , Azam Shah and his battalion reached Mania near Dholpur . After this intelligence reached him , Bahadur Shah I reached Jajau and camped four miles from the city on 18 June . Taking advice from astrologers , he decided to strike on 20 June . 
 To collect water , on 20 June , Bidar Bakht and his men headed towards Jajau without knowing that Bahadur Shah was camped there . He came across a village where he found a flowing stream of water . To inform Azam Shah , he sent his messenger , <unk> Khan , to him with the message . When he returned , he informed Bidar Bakht that he had seen Bahadur Shah 's advance tents . Khan Alam <unk> and Munavvar Khan , who were in charge of the central wing of the troops , were dispatched to attack the tents . Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan 's 500 elephants failed to mount a resistance against the invading forces . The attackers looted the tents and then set them on fire . 
 Unable to put up a strong fight , Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan wrote to Bahadur Shah for reinforcements . He responded by sending Munim Khan , Jahandar Shah . Meanwhile , Zulfiqar Khan , who was in charge of the left wing of Azam Shah 's army , advised him to wait until the next day to start a full @-@ fledged battle . However , Shah paid no heed . Seeing 50 @,@ 000 horsemen approaching , <unk> Khan informed Azam Shah about their advance . In reply , he said that he was " coming to his son " . 
 Bidar Bakht found it difficult to mobilise all of his men to fight since they were " scattered to plunder camp " . The attacking force started raining arrows on them and discharging rockets at them . Khan Alam Dakhini charged Bahadur Shah 's army with three hundred soldiers . He threw a spear towards Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan seated in the howdah of the elephant . It missed him and instead hit his attendant , Jalal Khan . Dakhini was killed by an arrow as he attempted to jump on the prince 's howdah . Jalal Khan boarded a separate elephant , and after he inflicted an injury on Munavvar Khan , Munavvar Khan 's soldiers fled . This exposed the wing of Prince Wala @-@ Jah . Seeing this , Amanullah Khan , who was in charge of a separate wing , hastened to render assistance . But his elephant was set on fire , and his troops fled , thinking that their leader was dead . This made Wala @-@ Jah retreat from the battle . 
 After this confrontation , Bahadur Shah 's Rajput chiefs attacked Zulfiqar Khan . Though Khan 's army was successful in repelling them , he was wounded in the leg . As Azim @-@ ush @-@ Shan 's entire army charged Khan , he fled the battle . Khan was followed by Jai Singh <unk> , who fled from Bidar Bakht 's left wing . Even after the death of most of his commanders and soldiers and his two sons , Bidar Bakht and Ali Tabar , Azam Shah himself charged the enemy on his elephant . Court historian <unk> , in <unk> , wrote that he was wounded " several times by arrows , but he paid no heed to the wounds " . He was ultimately killed by a musket ball which struck him on his forehead . 
 As soon as Bahadur Shah came to know about his brother 's death , he sent men to retrieve the corpse . They were attacked by Wala @-@ Jah , but Wala @-@ Jah fainted and died . Around 8 o 'clock in the evening , Bahadur Shah 's aide , Rustam Dil Khan , mounted the dead prince 's elephant , beheaded the prince , and made his way to Bahadur Shah . However , instead of praises , he received reproaches for his action . His elephant was followed by two other elephants ; the first one contained the dead body of Ali Tabar , the other one carried the dead princes ' women , who were assured protection by Bahadur Shah . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The <unk> estimates that 12 @,@ 000 horsemen of Azam Shah lay dead on the battlefield . It further estimates that at least 10 @,@ 000 infantry soldiers from both sides were dead . Khan Zaman and Khan Alam Dakhini 's bodies were sent to Gwalior for burial . Ram Singh Hada and Rao <unk> Bundela 's bodies were sent to <unk> for cremation . Azam Shah and his three dead sons were buried at Humayun 's Tomb in Delhi . 
 = Green Wing = 
 Green Wing is an award @-@ winning British sitcom set in the fictional East Hampton Hospital . It was created by the same team behind the sketch show Smack the Pony , led by Victoria Pile , and stars Tamsin Greig , Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind @-@ Tutt . 
 Although set in a hospital , it uses no medical storylines ; the action is produced by a series of soap opera @-@ style twists and turns in the personal lives of the characters . They proceed through a series of often absurd sketch @-@ like scenes , or by sequences where the film is slowed down or sped up , often emphasizing the body language of the characters . The show had eight writers . Two series were made by the <unk> Thames production company for Channel 4 . 
 The series ran between 3 September 2004 and 19 May 2006 . An episode was filmed with the second series , which was shown as a 90 minute long special on 4 January 2007 in the UK , but was shown in Australia and Belgium on 29 December 2006 . 
 Separate from the series , a sketch was made for Comic Relief and screened on 11 March 2005 . Another was performed live at The Secret Policeman 's Ball on 14 October 2006 . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Green Wing 's plot revolves around the lives of the staff of the East Hampton Hospital Trust , a fictional NHS hospital with staff ranging from the slightly unusual to the completely surreal . 
 The series begins with a new arrival , surgical registrar Caroline Todd ( Tamsin Greig ) . Caroline suffers from constant embarrassment and bad luck , stumbling from one crisis to the next due to a mixture of her own neurosis , impulsiveness , and general misfortune . Caroline works alongside two other doctors : Guy Secretan ( Stephen Mangan ) , an arrogant , half @-@ Swiss , womanizing anaesthetist , and " Mac " Macartney ( Julian Rhind @-@ Tutt ) , a suave , <unk> fashionable surgeon . It is not long before Caroline begins to develop feelings for both of them , though she is unsure as to which of the two she truly loves . Throughout the series , it becomes clear that Mac is her true love , but a range of misadventures prevent their relationship from flourishing . Other people Caroline meets include Martin Dear ( Karl Theobald ) , a friendly house officer who is constantly failing his exams . He is unloved by his mother and is often bullied by Guy . Martin soon develops feelings for Caroline , and begins to fall in love with her . There is also Angela Hunter ( Sarah Alexander ) , a seemingly @-@ perfect , but irritating , senior registrar in paediatrics . Whilst Angela appears to mean well , Caroline cannot stand her and despite her best efforts to avoid Angela , she ends up as Caroline 's lodger . 
 Caroline 's main rival for Mac 's affections is Sue White ( Michelle Gomez ) , the Scottish staff liaison officer employed to listen and respond to the problems of East Hampton 's staff . However , Sue is perhaps the least suited person for the job ; she is mean @-@ spirited , insensitive , unsympathetic , controlling and vain . Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen , and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture , so she can get back to doing nothing , or thinking about how to upset the next visitor . The only person she treats with any affection is Mac , whom she loves to the point of madness , but Mac , like almost everyone else , tries his best to avoid her . Anyone who attempts to get involved with Mac is treated with contempt and hatred by Sue , in particular Caroline , whom Sue attempts several times to murder . 
 Perhaps the most eccentric member of staff is Alan Statham ( Mark Heap ) , an overbearing , stuttering and eccentric consultant radiologist , whose everyday actions regularly border on insanity . He is desperately and hopelessly in love with Joanna Clore ( Pippa Haywood ) , the 48 @-@ year @-@ old head of human resources with an increasingly sardonic attitude . Their relationship is an open secret , with student doctor Boyce ( Oliver Chris ) , often using it as a weapon against them , bullying Alan constantly . Joanna 's human resources staff also use it against her , in particular Kim Alabaster ( Sally Bretton ) , who has a bad attitude towards most of the people she meets , and Naughty Rachel ( Katie Lyons ) , who earned her nickname due to her love of sex . The other HR staff include Harriet Schulenburg ( Olivia Colman ) , an overworked mother of four trapped in an unhappy marriage , and Karen Ball ( Lucinda Raikes ) , who divides her time between doing much of the office 's work , trying to attract Martin 's affections , and being bullied by Kim and Rachel . 
 = = Creation = = 
 = = = Writers and crew = = = 
 Green Wing was devised , created and produced by Victoria Pile . She was also the casting director , one of the writers and was involved in the editing , filming and post @-@ production . She described Green Wing as " a sketch @-@ meets @-@ comedy @-@ drama @-@ meets @-@ soap " , and a continuation of her previous show , Smack the Pony , where Green Wing 's crew also worked . Unusually for a British sitcom , which normally have only one or two writers , the show had eight writers : Pile , her husband Robert Harley , Gary Howe , Stuart Kenworthy , <unk> Messina , Richard <unk> , Fay <unk> and James Henry . 
 Pile and her co @-@ writers initially used battery packs to represent characters , moving them around on her desk to develop scenarios for the show . The decision to make the characters doctors came later . Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location , which settled the matter . Even later still , a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs . 
 The show was directed and edited ( along with Pile ) by Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke . Sketches were sped up or slowed down to create comic effect , often using body language to create humour . Editing was also used due to the amount of <unk> that occurred during the filming of the show . Tamsin Greig was said to corpse frequently , and episodes were written to minimize the contact between the characters of Caroline Todd and Alan Statham because Greig found it difficult not to laugh when acting alongside Mark Heap . The music , which plays prominently in the show , was written by Jonathan Whitehead ( under the name " Trellis " ) and won him an RTS Craft & Design Award . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Following her success with Smack the Pony , Channel 4 gave Pile a fairly free hand with her next project . Their only requirement was that it should have enough of a narrative thread to make it more of a sitcom than a sketch show . 
 The show had a half @-@ hour pilot made in 2002 that was never aired . Scenes from the pilot were used in the first episode , " Caroline 's First Day " , and can be spotted due to the characters ' appearance , most notably Rhind @-@ Tutt 's haircut . The pilot allowed the writers to experiment , such as using different filming techniques . In the pilot , Doon <unk> played Joanna Clore and was meant to play her in the original series , but left when she became pregnant . 
 Although each script is fully written , the actors are allowed to improvise their own jokes , frequently adding to what has already been written . Normally workshops are used to allow actors to improvise their own material . One example of improvised material was Stephen Mangan 's idea of Guy falling in love with Caroline . <unk> , Howe , Messina and Harley all have had speaking parts in the show , most notably Harley playing Charles Robertson , the hospital 's CEO . The show 's crew also make appearances in the show as extras . For example , Pile 's former assistant Phil Secretan ( whom Guy is named after ) appears at the end of a scene in the first episode . Henry appears in the background during Martin 's exam in the episode , " Tests " . 
 The filming was done at two hospitals , the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke . This presented a problem because the show had to work around the real @-@ life hospital , with its actual doctors , patients and emergency situations . In one scene in the final episode in series one , Guy ( Mangan ) was hitting squash balls behind him , and nearly hit a patient . However , some scenes , such as those in Sue 's and Alan 's offices , were filmed in a studio . 
 Green Wing 's title is said to have come from a small plastic green man with wings that was in executive producer Peter Fincham 's top pocket , and fell on Pile 's desk . Fincham claimed it was not his , so Pile kept it . This plastic man appears at the end of the credits on every show . 
 = = = Unused storylines = = = 
 Green Wing had some plot lines that were never used . Unused storylines included Alan having an eighty @-@ year @-@ old wife and step @-@ grandchildren as old as him , and Guy suffering from impotence . Pile originally wanted the show to cover the entire hospital , not just doctors , but also porters , car park attendants and kitchen staff . However , she eventually decided that they had enough material with the eight main doctors and human resources workers . 
 Two endings were created for the special . The alternative ending is included on the DVD release of Green Wing , along with deleted scenes from the episode . The alternative ending was planned to be used if a third series was going to be commissioned , as this ending was much more ambiguous . It is known that the actors wanted the alternative ending , but after some debate , it was not shown .

The episode concludes with Caroline being carried into the air by a mass of helium filled balloons at the wedding reception , although on the DVD boxset extras it shows an alternate ending where Guy and Mac grab onto Caroline 's ankles and are taken to the sky with her ; this alternative ending ends with Mac saying , " Caroline , there 's something I 've been meaning to tell you . " 
 = = Signature jokes = = 
 Green Wing contains running jokes . These include Guyball , a sport invented by Guy when he was at public school , with somewhat confusing rules . The basic object of the game is to throw a ball into a " <unk> " , a basket attached to a helmet . This game was even played at the Wingin ' It Green Wing Convention . 
 Another signature joke is the frequent visits by main characters to Sue White 's office , in which these characters expect Sue to act as some kind of psychiatric <unk> to them , only to be thwarted by Sue 's ever more peculiar behaviour . 
 Also , Guy often says things that are inappropriate and sexually inappropriate and after noticing the reaction from the person to whom he is speaking , follows his comment with " ... let me finish " and a clarification . After trying to teach Martin this method in the very first episode , Guy also regularly attempts to pick up women throughout the two series by talking on his phone and saying " I 'll see you in Zurich " , in an attempt to sound " jet @-@ <unk> " . 
 Another Green Wing series of running jokes is about hair . One of the more notable was various cracks about Mac 's untidy hair , with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview . Another was the character Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode . Mac was often referred to as a Ginger by the other characters . Guy 's hair becomes gradually <unk> as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series . Other recurring jokes include Boyce 's practical jokes , the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline , Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations .

 = = Critical reaction = = 
 The show has received generally very positive reviews . The Evening Standard said that it was " a comedy as physically adroit as it was verbally sharp " , and The Guardian said that " Channel 4 ’ s hospital sitcom is the most innovative comedy since , well , The Office . " In a review of television in 2006 , Kathryn Flett in The Observer voted it one of the top ten TV programmes of the year . In Broadcast magazine , the second series was voted joint @-@ second best comedy series in 2006 . In South Africa , where Green Wing is broadcast on BBC Prime , The Sunday Times of South Africa voted the show the best <unk> programme of 2007 . Composer Daniel Pemberton wrote that the soundtrack to Green Wing was , " One of the most innovative TV soundtracks in recent years . " Famous fans of Green Wing include novelist Ian Rankin and comedian Catherine Tate . 
 Criticisms of Green Wing include the <unk> methods of filming and the overall length of the episodes , claiming that hour @-@ long episodes are too long . The show won the 2005 and 2006 Comedy Tumbleweed Awards for " Worst Camerawork " . Some were also critical of what was seen as a decline in quality when the second series began . Cathy Pryor in The Independent on Sunday said that , " Sadly , though , since I 'm something of a fan , I have to report that the first episode of the second series is , disappointingly , rather flat . To be fair , there were a couple of laugh @-@ out @-@ loud moments - Dr Statham banging his head and falling down being one of them - but the whole [ thing ] didn 't quite gel . Or should that be coagulate ? I 'll stop making bad jokes now since I 'm still not as funny as anyone in the show . But I sincerely hope that the opener is a one- off and not a sign that Green Wing is going down the pan . " 
 Similar comments were made by A. A. Gill . When the first series was broadcast , he praised the cast and characters , but commented negatively on the filming style and dramatic qualities . He also said : 
 " ... it was one of the most freshly funny and crisply innovative comedies for years . The humour was all based in the character , not the situation . The story lines were negligible ; there were no catch phrases ; it was surreal in a way we hadn ’ t seen since Monty Python ; and the cast were actors being funny from inside a characterization , not stand @-@ up comics bolting a cartoon persona onto the back of gags . " 
 Subsequently , Gill attacked the first episode of series two , in particular the use of a dream sequence at the beginning of the episode . He wrote , 
 " Now , every 11 @-@ year @-@ old knows dream sequences are the lowest form of plotting solution , lower than unexplained superpowers such as the ability to stop time or become invisible ; even lower than a magic get @-@ better potion . Within two minutes , Green Wing had destroyed itself , lost its assured grip on the cliff of comedy and tumbled into the abyss of embarrassing overacting , formless <unk> and pointless repetition . What had once looked Dada @-@ <unk> brilliant now looked like stoned improv from a show @-@ off 's drama school . The lack of plot and coherent narrative that previously had been a blessed freedom was revealed to be a formless free @-@ for @-@ all , brilliant performances as silly mannerisms . Nothing I 've seen this year has disappointed me as sharply as the second series of Green Wing . As Tom Paine so poignantly pointed out , only a step separates the sublime from the ridiculous . " 
 The rest of the series received some praise and , in a 2009 article , Gill - writing about the current comedy output at the time - said : " Show me a funny indigenous comedy series ; show me one that has been made in the past five years , other than Green Wing . "

 = No. 457 Squadron RAAF = 
 No. 457 Squadron was a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) fighter squadron of World War II . Equipped with Supermarine Spitfire fighters , it was formed in England during June 1941 under Article XV of the Empire Air Training Scheme . The squadron was transferred to Australia in June 1942 and saw combat in the South West Pacific Area before being disbanded in November 1945 . 
 The squadron saw combat against both Nazi Germany and the Empire of Japan during the war . From March to May 1942 it was based in southern England and flew missions over German @-@ occupied France during which it shot down at least five Luftwaffe aircraft . After being deployed to Australia , No. 457 Squadron was based near Darwin as part of No. 1 Wing RAAF and intercepted several Japanese raids on Allied bases in northern Australia between March and November 1943 . The squadron remained at Darwin and saw almost no combat during 1944 , but moved to Morotai and later Labuan in 1945 from where it attacked Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies and Borneo as part of Allied offensives in these areas .

 No. 457 Squadron was formed at RAF <unk> in England on 16 June 1941 . It was equipped with Supermarine Spitfires and was the second RAAF fighter unit to be formed in England after No. 452 Squadron . The establishment of both these squadrons formed part of an expansion of RAF Fighter Command which sought to improve its ability to defend Britain from a renewed German air offensive and to conduct offensive operations over occupied Europe . At the time of its formation the squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader Peter Malam Brothers , both flight commanders and all members of the ground crew were British , but most pilots were Australian . The squadron 's ground crew component had been formed at RAAF Station Williamtown in Australia on 10 June , and departed for England on 7 August . On the same day No. 457 Squadron moved to RAF <unk> and thence to RAF Andreas , which were both situated on the Isle of Man to undertake training . While at the Isle of Man the squadron trained both its own pilots and pilots from other squadrons for operational duties , and for a time functioned as an operational training unit at RAF Andreas . It also escorted Allied convoys in the Irish Sea , but did not make contact with German aircraft . By October all the British pilots other than Brothers and the flight commanders had been replaced by Australians . The squadron 's ground crew arrived in Britain during October and November , making it an almost entirely Australian unit . 
 In March 1942 the squadron moved to RAF Redhill , Surrey where it assumed No. 452 Squadron 's front line duties as part of No. 11 Group RAF . These included shipping protection patrols , escorting bombers , conducting fighter sweeps over northern France and contributing to the air defence of southern England . Fighter Command had received authorisation to launch a full @-@ scale offensive campaign against German air units shortly before No. 457 Squadron arrived at Redhill , and it became part of this effort . The squadron first saw action on 26 March when Brothers shot down a Bf 109 during a multi @-@ squadron fighter sweep over France , though one of its Spitfires was lost in this action . By the end of its first week of operations No. 457 Squadron had shot down three German aircraft and inflicted damage on several others and it went on to conduct 32 operations over German territory by 26 April . These operations often encountered fierce opposition , and German Fw 190 fighters proved superior to the Spitfire Mark Vs that No. 457 Squadron was equipped with . The squadron scored its last victory over Europe on 29 April , though fighter sweeps over France continued until almost the end of May . 
 On 28 May 1942 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill agreed to an Australian Government request to dispatch three fully equipped Spitfire squadrons to Australia to reinforce the RAAF . The squadrons selected were the Australian No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons as well as the British No. 54 Squadron RAF . Accordingly , No. 457 Squadron was withdrawn from operations on 28 May to prepare to be redeployed to Australia . By this time its pilots had been credited with five confirmed " kills " and another four " probables " and damaging seven aircraft . On 20 June the squadron left England on board the MV Stirling Castle , which was also carrying the men of No. 452 and No. 54 Squadrons . 
 = = = Darwin = = = 
 The Stirling Castle arrived at Melbourne on 13 August . After being given 14 days leave the squadron 's personnel reassembled at Richmond , New South Wales on 6 September . On 7 October it became part of No. 1 Wing RAAF along with No. 54 and No. 452 Squadrons . Most of the Spitfires intended for the wing had been diverted to the Middle East during the voyage to Australia , however , and the squadron initially only had CAC Wirraway and Ryan ST aircraft for training purposes . No. 457 Squadron was fully equipped with Spitfires by November and moved to Camden on the 7th of the month where it continued an intensive training program . In December the squadron was informed that it would be deployed to Darwin in the Northern Territory to counter the Japanese air raids against the town . The squadron 's advance party departed on 31 December , and the main body followed by sea on 12 January 1943 . No. 457 Squadron commenced air operations from Batchelor Airfield on 20 January and moved to Livingstone Airfield on the last day of the month . 
 No. 457 Squadron first saw combat against the Japanese in March 1943 . Although the squadron was scrambled a number of times in February , it did not claim its first " kill " until 7 March when two Spitfires shot down a Mitsubishi Ki @-@ 46 " Dinah " reconnaissance aircraft near Darwin . On 15 March No. 1 Wing 's three squadrons intercepted a large raid on Darwin , and No. 457 Squadron shot down two A6M Zeros and damaged another of the fighters . The squadron was also credited with damaging a Mitsubishi G4M " Betty " bomber and claimed another three Zeros as " probables " . No further Japanese aircraft were encountered over northern Australia until May . During this period No. 457 Squadron practiced tactics and cooperation with RAAF and Australian Army units . Flying was normally limited to just one hour each day , however . 
 On 2 May No. 1 Wing responded to a major Japanese raid on Darwin . In the resulting air battle No. 457 Squadron shot down one fighter and claimed another two " probables " , but lost two Spitfires . Overall , the RAAF suffered 14 Spitfires destroyed or damaged while claiming only six " kills " , and the operation was not considered a success . Seven days later No. 457 Squadron deployed a detachment of six Spitfires to Milingimbi Island after the island 's airfield was attacked . This detachment intercepted Japanese raids on 10 and 28 May , shooting down two Zeros and two Bettys for the loss of three Spitfires . The squadron also continued to take part in operations over the Darwin region , seeing combat on a number of occasions . During the last major battle near the town on 6 July No. 457 Squadron shot down a Zero and damaged five Bettys , but lost three Spitfires . 
 Japanese air activity over northern Australia dropped away after 6 July , and No. 457 Squadron saw little further combat . As a result , the squadron 's personnel suffered greatly from boredom . No. 457 Squadron scored its next " kills " on 17 August , when its aircraft shot down three of the four Dinahs sent over Darwin that day ; the fourth was destroyed by No. 1 Wing 's acting commander , Wing Commander Clive Caldwell . The squadron shot down another two Dinahs on 20 August . On 7 September No. 1 Wing intercepted a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft escorted by 20 fighters . In the ensuing battle No. 457 Squadron shot down four Zeros without loss . On 4 November No. 457 Squadron deployed six Spitfires to Drysdale River Mission Airfield , and two days later they intercepted and damaged a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft . The squadron maintained a detachment at Drysdale River Mission until December , when No. 54 Squadron assumed this duty . During the early hours of 12 November three No. 457 Squadron Spitfires were part of a force which intercepted a raid on Darwin . No. 457 Squadron pilot Flying Officer John Smithson made the only interception and destroyed two Betty bombers . 
 The attack on 12 November was the final Japanese raid on the Darwin area . As a result , No. 1 Wing 's flying squadrons had little to do and the pilots became bored . No. 457 Squadron conducted little operational flying until 8 March 1944 , when it and No. 452 Squadron were ordered to Perth , Western Australia in response to fears that a Japanese naval force would raid the area . The squadrons departed Darwin on 9 March and arrived at RAAF Station Guildford ( modern Perth Airport ) three days later after flying through very difficult weather conditions . No attack eventuated , however , and the squadron returned to Livingstone Airfield between 23 and 28 March . The squadron next saw action on 18 April when two of its Spitfires took part in an attack on a Japanese radar station in the Babar Islands . In May 1944 , No. 1 Wing 's headquarters and No. 57 and 457 Squadrons were deployed to Exmouth Gulf , Western Australia to protect the facilities which had been established to refuel the British Eastern Fleet before Operation Transom , during which the fleet attacked Surabaya , Java . No. 457 Squadron departed for Exmouth Gulf on 10 May and returned to its new base at Sattler Airfield on the 24th of the month . The squadron again provided a detachment at Drysdale River Mission from 1 June 1944 and began to be reequipped with Mark VIII Spitfires on 2 July . 
 = = = Morotai and Labuan = = = 
 On 1 July 1944 No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No. 80 Wing RAAF . This wing had been established to support a planned offensive from Darwin into the Netherlands East Indies . The offensive was cancelled in June , but this was not communicated to the wing , which continued to train for the operation until August . After the operation was cancelled the wing and its squadrons had no purpose , but continued to conduct training exercises as a means of maintaining morale . In November the wing was informed that it was to move to Morotai island in the Netherlands East Indies to take part in Allied offensives in the region . 
 No. 457 Squadron 's movement to Morotai was delayed until early 1945 . The squadron 's ground crew departed Darwin by sea on 18 January and arrived on the island on 1 February . The Spitfires departed Sattler on 6 February and arrived at Morotai two days later . No. 457 Squadron flew its first operations from Morotai on 10 February . The squadron 's main roles in this period were to conduct ground attack missions against Japanese camps and shipping as well as escorting other aircraft engaged in attacking these targets . This involved a heavy workload , and the squadron flew over 293 operational sorties between February and the end of April . From May No. 457 Squadron 's Spitfires began using dive bombing tactics as well as strafing targets with their guns . 
 No. 457 Squadron participated in the Borneo Campaign during the final months of the war . On 27 May it was ordered to prepare for deployment , and on 5 June its personnel and equipment sailed for Labuan island off the north @-@ west coast of Borneo . During this operation the squadron was attached to No. 81 Wing . The Spitfires departed Morotai on 17 June and commenced operations from Labuan two days later alongside No. 76 Squadron RAAF with the primary roles of providing air support to Allied troops in the area and air defence for the island . On 20 June two No. 457 Squadron fighters shot down a Dinah ; this was the squadron 's first " kill " since 12 November 1943 . Operations against the Japanese continued until the end of the war on 15 August 1945 . During the war 25 of the squadron 's Australian personnel were killed . 
 Following the Japanese surrender No. 457 Squadron initially remained at Labuan . During this period it flew security patrols as well as training exercises and air tests . The squadron 's serviceable aircraft left Labuan on 9 October for Oakey , Queensland and arrived there on the last day of the month . No. 457 Squadron was officially disbanded at Labuan on 7 November 1945 . Following the war the squadron was awarded the battle honours " Fortress Europe , 1940 – 1944 " , " Pacific , 1941 – 1945 " , " Darwin , 1941 – 1944 " , " Morotai " , " Borneo , 1945 " and " Defence of Britain , 1940 – 1945 " .

 = Development of The Last of Us = 
 The development of The Last of Us , an action @-@ adventure survival horror video game , began after Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves ' release in October 2009 . Sony Computer Entertainment published The Last of Us on June 14 , 2013 for the PlayStation 3 . The three @-@ year development , led by studio Naughty Dog , was kept secret for the majority of development . In the game , players assume control of Joel , tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post @-@ apocalyptic United States , in an attempt to create a potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune . Creative director Neil Druckmann was inspired to include Infected as a main feature of the game after discovering the Cordyceps fungi . His story , set twenty years after the outbreak starts and much of civilization is destroyed , explored the possibility of the fungi infecting humans . 
 Though Ellie was initially intended to be Joel 's daughter , the team found this to be too limiting in terms of further character development . The team chose Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson to portray Joel and Ellie , respectively . Providing both the voice and motion capture of the characters , Baker and Johnson assisted the team to develop the characters and help refine the story . The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game , and all other elements were developed around it . Various other characters were influenced by the story progression , ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision . 
 The Last of Us features an original score , composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla . Known for his minimalist approach to composing , Santaolalla was contacted early in development . Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to other elements of the game , including the action , sound design and art design . The sound department began working early on the sound of the Infected , in order to achieve the best work possible . A similar direction was taken by the art department , whose designs influenced other elements of development . Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements of the game , particularly focusing on the lighting and animations . 
 The Last of Us was officially announced in 2011 ; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated . Naughty Dog missed the original release date , delaying the game in order for further polishing . Naughty Dog marketed the game through video trailers and press demonstrations , announcing specific details about the game as development continued . Various special edition versions were released , along with a comic book featuring characters from the game . 
 = = Production = = 
 Preliminary work on The Last of Us , under the codename " Project Thing " or " T1 " , began after the release of Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves in October 2009 . For the first time in the company 's history , developer Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently ; while one team developed Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception ( 2011 ) , the other began work on The Last of Us . In order to run the two teams smoothly , co @-@ presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose game director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann to lead development on The Last of Us . Straley , who was employed at Naughty Dog in March 1999 , was selected to lead the project based on his experience and his work on previous projects , while Druckmann , an employee since 2004 , was chosen for his determination and talent for design . 
 = = = Story and setting = = = 
 As a student at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004 , Druckmann was tasked with creating a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero , who would select a winner . Druckmann 's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico ( 2001 ) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse , like that of Romero 's Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 ) , with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City ( 1991 – 2000 ) . The lead character , a police officer , would be tasked with protecting a young girl ; however , due to the lead character 's heart condition , players would often assume control of the young girl , reversing the roles . Though the idea did not win , Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us . An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women , though this was later deemed misogynistic . 
 The Infected , a core concept of the game , were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth ( 2006 ) , which featured the Cordyceps fungi . Though the fungi mainly infect insects , taking control of their motor functions and forcing it to help cultivate the fungus , the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans , and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection . The game does not directly explain the cause of the virus ; Straley attributed this to the team 's focus on the characters , as opposed to the virus . They preferred to explain the events through subtext , rather than explicitly explaining the cause of the infection . Straley compared the subtext included in The Last of Us to that of BioShock Infinite ( 2013 ) . He felt that the latter had spawned various conversations within the industry , which he sees as a sign of a maturing industry . " I 've seen enough good stories in books and film . Now I want to see them in video games , " said Straley . The team used the concept of the Infected to force players to explore the limits of human perseverance . Throughout development , team assured that the Infected were strictly different from zombies . 
 In order to make the game as realistic as possible , the team conducted extensive research for the setting . Taking influences from Alan Weisman 's The World Without Us ( 2007 ) , Naughty Dog created a world that would force players to make decisions and utilize their limited supplies effectively . In his research , Druckmann found inspiration in real historical events ; the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic illustrated the depths of self @-@ protection and paranoia capable by humans under threat of extinction , while the polio epidemic of the 1880s demonstrated the influences of socioeconomic classes when assigning blame in a great disaster . Druckmann and Straley have also cited Amy Hennig 's " perfectionist mindset " and dedication to characters as an inspiration for the game 's story ; Hennig worked as head writer and creative director on the Uncharted series ( 2007 – present ) . The team also took inspiration from Gravity ( 2013 ) , in terms of the game 's simplicity and intensity . 
 When writing the script , Druckmann tried to exclude " fancy dialogue " , keeping everything " short and natural " . Community strategist Eric <unk> has stated that the narrative 's overarching themes are " love , loyalty and redemption " , assuring their importance in the game , and fellow community strategist Arne Meyer said that the game 's violence fit the narrative . Straley reiterated this , stating " you have to have the dark to have the light " . Game designer Anthony Newman stated that the game deals with how people would react under pressure in extreme situations , which is represented through the violence and combat . The team felt interested in the story 's dark themes juxtaposed against the " beautiful " settings . 
 A major motif present throughout the game is that " life goes on " . A scene near the end of the game , in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes , is referenced by many journalists as the realization point of this motif . Concept artist John Sweeney wrote that the scene was designed to " reignite [ Ellie 's ] lust for life " , triggering her curiosity and forgetting the surrounding struggle and death . He explained that the scene originally involved zebras , but were replaced by giraffes due to their gentleness and elegance , stating that they were " the most remarkable thing Ellie could possibly encounter " . Druckmann felt that the sequence " works because of all the horrible things " encountered beforehand . IGN 's Lucy O 'Brien wrote that the scene acts as a reminder of Ellie 's age , despite having been outwardly " stripped of any semblance of a childhood " , and Kotaku writer Kirk Hamilton found the scene to be a resemblance of hope for Ellie , having clearly suffered post @-@ traumatic stress following her encounter with David . 
 In regards to the ending , the team intended for it to be open to interpretation . Straley has stated that it 's " not your typical ending , but it ’ s still a nice resolution " . Both he and Druckmann stated their frustration when players told them they wanted a choice at the game 's ending ; Straley said that most of these players told him they would have chosen the same ending as the game anyway . Early in the game 's development , the team envisioned an ending in which Ellie was forced to kill someone in order to save the incapacitated Joel ; this ending was scrapped , as the team felt that it was not conforming to the character arcs . While the game 's focus testers hated the ending , suggesting alternative methods , Druckmann continued with it ; when the game 's music and gameplay became closer to completion , the focus testers began appreciating the ending more . When discussing the ending , VentureBeat writer Dean Takahashi referenced the quote " Whoever saves one life saves the world entire " , from Schindler 's List ( 1993 ) , highlighting its inaccuracy : " You save a life and doom the whole world , " he wrote . 
 = = = Character development = = = 
 Joel is voiced by veteran voice actor Troy Baker , while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson . Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology ; approximately 85 % of the game 's animations were recorded using motion capture , with remaining audio elements recorded later in a studio . Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie , they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel , as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game . After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other , the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel , despite the actor 's young age . Druckmann attributed Baker 's voice and movement to the team 's choice of casting him . Baker and Johnson contributed greatly to the development of the characters . For example , Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness , and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re @-@ write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner . Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors ; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary amount of lines during gameplay sections , and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary . The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game ; the development between the characters was established first , and the game 's other concepts followed . From the beginning of development , the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs . During the Winter segment of the game , players assume control of Ellie . The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game 's release , to surprise players ; they did the same with Ellie 's immunity , as well as with the game 's prologue , where players assume control of Joel 's daughter Sarah . The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector , echoing Druckmann 's previous ideas as a student . The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves , in turn inspired by the video game Ico . The game 's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game ; Joel represents the world before the outbreak , having spent most of his life during this period , while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak , as she was born in the post @-@ apocalyptic world . While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced , the latter maintains an optimistic view of life , having become familiar to the damaged world ; spending time with each other saw these qualities overlapping , with Joel become more lively , and Ellie learning more survival skills . 
 Though Druckmann initially wrote the character of Joel using inspiration from Josh Brolin 's portrayal of Llewelyn Moss in No Country for Old Men ( 2007 ) , which he saw as " very quiet , very cool under pressure " , Baker 's interpretation of Joel as a more emotional person evolved the character in a different way . Ultimately , the narrative became an exploration of how willing a father is to save a child ; initially , Joel is willing to sacrifice himself , before evolving where he is willing to sacrifice his friends , until finally feeling that he would sacrifice all of humanity in order to save Ellie . Druckmann felt that players , specifically parents , would be able to relate to Joel 's character and his bonding with Ellie . Baker believes that Joel discovers morality throughout the game 's narrative , working out the difference between loss and sacrifice , and his true personality begins to show . When auditioning for the role , Baker read a phrase on the character sheet that stated Joel had " few moral lines left to cross " , which became the " anchor point " to the character for him . Baker found great difficulty in filming the game 's prologue , which features scenes with Joel and his daughter Sarah , portrayed by Hana Hayes . Upon later viewing of the first day of footage from the scene , Druckmann felt that it could still be improved . When filming the scene again , Druckmann explained to Baker how to perform it , and felt that it was the best take upon doing so . Though Baker initially found the take too " mechanical " , he retroactively realised that he had been previously trying to impress audiences by his acting , and that it was " not what the scene needed " . 
 When portraying Ellie , Johnson faced challenges in performing scenes that made her feel uncomfortable . " There were some days when we would shoot things that even at my age made me feel a little uncomfortable , " Johnson described . Johnson feels that video games rarely feature strong female characters such as Ellie , and expressed her excitement to portray the role for this reason . When questioned about the inspiration for Ellie as a gameplay feature , Druckmann recalled when he and Straley were brainstorming ideas for Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves and created a mute character who would summon the player to follow them , creating a " beautiful " relationship through gameplay alone . Though this concept was never included in the final game , the idea was raised when the team were discussing a new project , ultimately inspiring Ellie . Druckmann also felt inspired by the wars that took place in Syria and Afghanistan when creating Ellie ; he felt that conflict was a familiarity to the children in those countries , which is similar to Ellie 's view . 
 The character of Tess was originally intended to be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us , pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie . However , the team found it difficult to believe that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year ; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story . Actress Annie Wersching was impressed by the script , and Druckmann 's ability to write unique female characters . When writing the game 's female characters , particularly Tess and Ellie , Druckmann avoided external influences , such as the media 's portrayal of women , as he wished to write his own story . The character of Bill , portrayed by W. Earl Brown , is revealed to be homosexual at one point in the game . Druckmann initially left this vague in the script , but was inspired at the script read @-@ through to alter a few lines to further reflect Bill 's sexuality . To make Bill interesting , Druckmann explored the concept of contradictory statements ; while Bill states that becoming attached to people will lower chances of survival , it is revealed that he had a partner that he really cared for . Bill 's role in the game was also to voice Joel 's concerns about escorting Ellie , as Joel does not voice them . " [ T ] he reason to have Bill there is that Bill can actually say that to Joel , and warn Joel about that stuff , " Druckmann said . Veteran voice actor Nolan North , who portrays protagonist Nathan Drake in Naughty Dog 's Uncharted series , was chosen to play the role of David in the game . When approached by Druckmann about the role , North immediately accepted the part , appreciating its diversity from his previous acting roles . To portray the character , North approached his personality from multiple perspectives , viewing David as a " survivor " . North empathized with David , stating that most of David 's actions were understandable when considering the apocalyptic situation . He felt that David was initially attempting to protect Ellie , who was viewed as a " glimmer of hope " . 
 The team felt that the post @-@ apocalyptic world and the survival horror genre gave them the opportunity to better develop the characters . Taking inspiration from their work on the Uncharted games , the team used their knowledge of paralleling characters with the conflict in both gameplay and stories when developing The Last of Us . They also took inspiration from the books The Road ( 2006 ) and City of Thieves ( 2008 ) , and the film No Country for Old Men , noting that they all include memorable characters and using this as a point of inspiration . " [ W ] e can make you as a player feel more of what it 's truly like to exist inside of a world where every bullet counts and each step you take is a conscious choice that 's going to make or break your existence , " said Straley . The team also felt that the " pressures of the world " allowed them to better develop their characters . They felt that the pressure forced the characters to make interesting decisions , allowing better development . 
 = = = Technical and gameplay development = = = 
 For The Last of Us , the team had to create new engines to satisfy their needs . The artificial intelligence ( AI ) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level , as opposed to the action elements from their previous projects ; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine . The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel , in order to avoid being conceived as a " burden " . Programmer Max <unk> stated that , when working on Ellie as AI , he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game 's events , in an attempt to achieve realism . The enemy AI , considered one of the most important features of the game , was developed to make random choices ; they study their surroundings , finding tactics to attack the player . This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies . The lighting engine was also re @-@ created to incorporate soft light , in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces . The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us , as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis . " You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it ' more fun ' and it gets super difficult to keep those out sometimes , " Druckmann said . In The Last of Us , the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs . In addition , the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation , to make players feel the same . 
 There are multiple features omitted from the game that the team considered typical of most video games , such as boss fights . A traditional cover system was excluded for the game as the team wanted players to constantly move around . The team also attempted to cause players to feel as though they are lacking , particularly in the supplies that they collect . " You 're not building yourself into a tank , " said Straley . This also motivated many of the design decisions of the gameplay , such as the weightlessness of the animations , and the melee combat mechanic . To further add to the realism , the team developed the game 's combat mechanic in a way that forces players to spend more time planning . They also wanted players to be forced to retreat from combat after alerting the Infected , despite their belief that retreating is the " anti @-@ video game play mechanic " . The combat mechanic was developed to feel intense , intentionally moving the camera closer to players , in order for them to " feel every strike " . The team felt that the game forces players to make difficult choices , in terms of combat , stealth and resource management , allowing them to understand the decisions made by the characters . 
 Many gameplay elements from the Uncharted games were excluded from The Last of Us due to the nature of the latter . The team made Joel more " grounded and less nimble " than Uncharted 's Nathan Drake . The camera angle and melee system were also altered to fit with the team 's intention of the game . Some gameplay features were inspired by the game 's post @-@ apocalyptic nature ; for example , a task involving spatial problem solving was inspired by the prior inclusion of a strong water current that obstructs players . The team also felt that No Country for Old Men inspired them in terms of the minimalism , wanting to " get more intimate " with the gameplay scenarios . The team decided to include various optional paths for players to use . While at one point they felt that the additional content was useless , the team eventually felt that it feels " natural and organic " . 
 The game 's online multiplayer mode features three game types ; the team opted to limit the amount of game types , as opposed to creating an abundance of them , in order to create a " deeper game experience " . The multiplayer mode was inspired by the combat encounters of the single @-@ player campaign ; the team aimed to recreate the slow pace of the encounters , and maintain a similar crafting system . This was achieved by making weapons lethal , and placing crafting items in strategic locations across the map , which was intended to result in stealthy gameplay and careful selection of ambushes . It also emphasized the stealth and teamwork elements of the mode . Lead multiplayer designer Erin Daly felt that the slower pace was difficult to achieve in a multiplayer environment , stating that " in most multiplayer shooters ... players sprint around at high speeds and spray bullets at anything that moves " . In addition , the multiplayer was designed to support different play styles ; while some players prefer to act as sniper , others opt to perform as support . Adding a revive system — when players take a significant amount of damage , they slowly crawl around while bleeding to death — created a large consequence to death ; losing team members is intended to be a significant loss to players . When designing the multiplayer , the team wanted players to have very little information regarding the location of the threats , while still giving a minor indication of the location . Daly attributed this to the importance of threat detection in a competitive experience , particularly when the lethality is high . The in @-@ game purchasing system was designed to be akin to a role @-@ playing game by allocating a set of <unk> points . 
 For the game 's character sculpting and rigging , the team introduced various new elements that were not used in their previous games . Lead character technical director Judd <unk> found that the creation of the faces was the most challenging , in terms of hardware . For the faces , the team used joint @-@ based facial rigs , with some blend @-@ shape <unk> . To retain the shape of the face and avoid awkward movement , the faces were rigged with the mouth open and eyes slightly closed . The faces were also based on the Facial Action Coding System , allowing for an anatomical @-@ based approach . The use of a higher mesh density also allowed more volumes and <unk> in the shape of the face , creating cleaner silhouettes and shapes and giving enough geometry to sculpt <unk> . In an attempt to add subtle features , pupil dilation was added to the character models . For the bodies , the team edited the character movements from Uncharted 2 , softening some joint alignment . The animation of carpal joints was also added for the game , allowing more dynamic hand shapes , and flexibility . Another subtle addition was the arm mover controls , allowing minor editing on the arms ; though this feature was previously available , it was opened up to the animators for The Last of Us . A muscle system was also added , adding muscle shells that bulge , based on attachment joint distance ; the muscle system , written in Maya within a few days , works in real time . To solve an issue in which body movement resulted in awkward movement of clothing , runtime helpers were implemented . A total of 326 joints were used in the full character model , with 98 of these in the face ; 85 of these are runtime driven , while 241 are locked into animation . 
 The user interface design ( UI ) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development . User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis originally intended to integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system , in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons . Upon further iterations , Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface . Ultimately , it was decided that the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches , occasionally found throughout the game 's world ; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed , in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option , as opposed to saving parts for the higher options . Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems , the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle . This design , eventually considered " clunky and slow " , was replaced in preference of a list system . Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat . This led to the final design , which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu . To integrate the UI into the game , Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format . User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates . All animated transitions were hard coded , which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions . " This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating , but it also meant that we all had to be pretty creative in how things were designed , " Neonakis said . The game 's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay , in order for players to feel involved . " We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that 's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds , or your failure to survive , " lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said . 
 = = = Art design = = = 
 When designing the game from an artistic viewpoint , the team took various pieces of work as inspiration . Robert Polidori 's photographs of Lower Ninth Ward following Hurricane Katrina were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh . " [ Polidori ] did these amazingly beautiful , horrific photos ... it 's not just decay and rot and post @-@ apocalyptic grey , it 's a human world that we 're playing with when we portray this destruction , " said Straley . The concept of post @-@ apocalyptic environments was considered a " starting point " for the artists . The art team also strived to achieve realism within every piece of art . Straley explained that the artists " would be like , I 'm going to make this the most awesome fucking wall ever , " in terms of creating attractive environments . The art department were forced to fight for things that they wished to include , due to the high demand during development . Ultimately , the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail ; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former , the art team preferred the latter . The artistic composition of the game 's locations was also a feature strongly focused on , in order to evoke varying emotions from players . In the final weeks of development , roles from the art department were undertaken by other members of the team ; for example , Straley hand @-@ arranged the texts on the game 's training screens , a task that lead artist Nate Wells found unusual . " I have never even heard of a game director doing that ! That 's like ... an intern task , " Wells said . 
 When creating the look of the Infected , the art team cycled through various iterations . Some early ideas included the Infected looking like aliens or zombies . The final design was chosen when lead character artist Michael Knowland incorporated images of diseases and fungal growth onto a human . He expressed the difficulty in changing the art from 2D to 3D , which would allow viewing from different angles . The process of sending completed concept art to the lighting and visual effects artists , who re @-@ create the art within the game 's engine . Due to the lack of artificial light sources in the game 's world , the team was forced to work with natural light . To achieve high quality lighting , they used lightmaps . The use of lightmaps led to various problems , such as the discontinuities in the lighting ; this was fixed by slightly modifying the <unk> intensities . When characters were added to scenes , they initially looked out of place ; the addition of a shadow generally fixed this . 
 The game 's opening credits were directed by Kevin <unk> and designed by Henry Hobson . Original concept development for the opening sequence began in late January 2013 , and full production began in March 2013 . Though the team initially intended for the game to omit opening credits , they were later added to " bridge the gap " between the game 's prologue and the following scene , a cut that was previously deemed " too sudden " without opening credits . Sony San Diego produced the opening credits , using time @-@ lapse photography to record the growth of fungus over multiple days ; only the spores at the end of the credits are computer @-@ generated . The sequence was inspired by Planet Earth , which featured similar concepts . 
 = = = Music and sound production = = = 
 Throughout development , Druckmann and Straley had been compiling various musical tracks that they found inspirational . When searching for a composer to work on the game 's music , they realised that many of the compiled tracks were composed by Gustavo Santaolalla . Straley described Santaolalla 's music as " organic instrumentation , minimalist , dissonance and resonance with the sounds " . As a result , Sony reached out to Santaolalla , who agreed to work on the game 's soundtrack . After hearing the game 's pitch , Santaolalla was excited to work on the game ; he previously wanted to work on video games , but refused to work on those without a focus on story and characters . 
 Due to Santaolalla 's stance on composing music — he lacks knowledge in reading and writing sheet music , preferring to simply record — he began working on The Last of Us early in development . To give Santaolalla a point to base his music , Druckmann simply told him about the story and themes , as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing ; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom , feeling it assisted in the composing . To compose , Santaolalla felt the need to " go into some more dark place , more textural and not necessarily melodic " . To challenge himself , Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with , giving a sense of danger and innocence . For The Last of Us , he used a detuned guitar , producing deep noise . To produce unique tunes , Santaolalla recorded in various rooms , including a bathroom and kitchen . The team wanted the game 's AI to affect the music . They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player , as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt . Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game 's action music was atypical of action music in other games , stating that it 's " relatively low @-@ key " , and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it . The game 's theme , " The Last of Us " , was the first piece of music that the team received , and they were very impressed . 
 The sound design team began working on the game early in development , in order to achieve the best results ; they immediately realised that it would be challenging . Early in development , Druckmann told the sound team to " make it subtle " , and underplay ideas . Audio lead Phillip Kovats was excited to completely create all sounds ; no sounds were carried across from previous games . The team looked at ways to create sounds from a naturalistic point @-@ of @-@ view , and how to introduce minimalism into a game . By doing so , they found that it added feelings of tension , loss and hope , and that the game appeared to be a typical " action game " without the minimalism approach . They used a high dynamic range , allowing them the opportunity to inform players on tactical information , and locations to explore . The game 's sound design was created to reflect a more " grounded " and subtle mood than Uncharted , particularly focusing on the lack of sound . Taking inspiration from No Country for Old Men , the team attempted to " do more with less " ; Kovats said that the team was trying to tell a story by " going for a reductive quality " . Straley stated that the audio is vital to some scenes in the game ; " It 's more about the psychology of what 's happening on the <unk> than what you 're seeing , " he stated . He felt that this decision allowed a more impactful and meaningful effect with sound occurred . The sound team also attempted to portray the game 's dark themes through sound . The team felt that it was important to let sounds play for as long as possible in the game , drawing tension . The team used a propagation technique to help players determine the exact locations of enemies , using this as a tactical advantage . This system , created by the team at Naughty Dog , is processed at random in the game engine . For the game 's audio , the engine throws out 1500 – 2500 ray casts per frame ; though most games avoid this , the game 's engine allowed it to work . The team spent a lot of time recording sounds for the game , namely doors , and rusty metal . Sound designer Neil <unk> traveled to Rio de Janeiro , discovering locations to record sounds ; he recorded chickens , which were used in the game as the voices of rats . The team continued to add and change the game 's sounds until the end of development . 
 To create the sound of the <unk> , the third stage of the Infected , the team found inspiration from a report on the journalism show 20 / 20 ( 1978 – present ) about blind children using clicking noises to communicate . " We liked the idea of taking this benign sound and attributing it to something really scary , " said Druckmann . In addition , the team wanted to reflect the creature 's feeling of pain and suffering , attempting to balance it with a sense of creepiness . The sound team created the sound of the Clicker first , realising early that it was the most challenging . To create the sound , they hired voice actors to perform their renditions . When voice actress Misty Lee provided her own rendition , a noise that Kovats described as originating in the " back of the throat " , Kovats and senior sound designer Derrick <unk> agreed that it was what they wanted . Kovats then emulated the sound to feature in the game .

 = = = Announcement = = = 
 In December 2011 , prior to the announcement of the game , an Easter egg was found in Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception referencing the concept of The Last of Us on an in @-@ game newspaper ; Naughty Dog retroactively stated that the reference was intended to be seen after the game 's reveal in June 2011 , but when the timing of the reveal itself was pushed forward , the team forgot to remove the reference . A few weeks before the game 's announcement , a billboard in Times Square teased the game , naming it a " PlayStation 3 exclusive you won 't believe " . Sony officially unveiled the game on December 10 , 2011 , at the Spike Video Game Awards . Shortly after the unveiling , Naughty Dog co @-@ president Evan Wells revealed details about the game : 
 The Last of Us is a genre @-@ defining experience that blends survival and action elements to tell a character @-@ driven tale about a modern plague decimating mankind . Nature encroaches upon civilization , forcing remaining survivors to kill for food , weapons and whatever they can find . Joel , a ruthless survivor , and Ellie , a brave young teenage girl who is wise beyond her years , must work together to survive their journey across what remains of the United States . 
 In February 2013 , Naughty Dog announced that The Last of Us would miss its intended release date of May 7 , 2013 , delaying it until June 14 , 2013 to allow for further polishing . " [ I ] nstead of cutting corners or compromising our vision , we came to the tough decision that the game deserved a few extra weeks to ensure every detail of The Last of Us was up to Naughty Dog ’ s internal high standards , " Naughty Dog stated in a press release . 
 = = = Release trailers = = = 
 The game was extensively marketed through video trailers . The game 's first trailer was released alongside the game 's full announcement , showcasing the game 's concept , characters and setting . For this trailer , the team held extended discussions concerning features of the gameplay to include . They initially planned to omit the Infected from the first trailer , in order to sharpen the focus on the characters ; they ultimately decided to include the Infected , as they felt that omitting them would arouse anticipation of their final reveal , trailing the focus away from the characters . For the final design of the trailer , the team attempted to incorporate as many gameplay features as possible , including human antagonism , melee implementation , stealth , and character relationships . The first game cinematic was released on May 15 , 2012 , depicting a scene in which Joel and Ellie are ambushed by hunters . This was followed by a second trailer titled " The Sky has Turned Grey " , released on May 16 . The trailer revealed a redesign of the character of Ellie ; Druckmann revealed that this was to make her look more similar to actress Ashley Johnson . A game cinematic , introducing the character of Bill , was shown during the game 's panel at San Diego Comic @-@ Con International , on July 13 . 
 A third trailer was released during Gamescom on August 14 , 2012 , showcasing more of the game 's environments and enemies . At the same event , a video was released , showcasing the process that cutscenes are developed , from the raw material to the final product . At PAX Prime 2012 , Naughty Dog showcased a video demonstration of the game , displaying gameplay . A story trailer for the game was later shown during the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards , on December 7 . A TV trailer for The Last of Us was broadcast following the third season finale of AMC 's The Walking Dead on March 31 , 2013 . A trailer for the game 's online multiplayer mode was released on June 4 , showcasing the factions elements to the mode . The final pre @-@ launch trailer was released on June 11 , during E3 2013 .

 A demo for The Last of Us was included with all copies of God of War : Ascension , and was available from May 31 , 2013 until the game 's launch . To encourage pre @-@ order sales , Naughty Dog collaborated with several retail outlets to provide special edition versions of the game . The " Post @-@ Pandemic Edition " includes a unique case packaging , a statue of Joel and Ellie and unlock codes for additional content in the single @-@ player and multiplayer modes . The " Joel Edition " and " Ellie Edition " include similar contents , but contain some features that are often differentiated by the characters . 
 A four @-@ issue comic book miniseries , titled The Last of Us : American Dreams , was published by Dark Horse Comics . Written by Druckmann and illustrated by Faith Erin Hicks , the comics serve as a prequel to the game , chronicling the journey of a younger Ellie and another young survivor Riley . The first issue was published on April 3 , 2013 , and a reprint became available on May 29 , 2013 ; the second issue was published on the same day , followed by the third issue on June 26 , and the fourth issue on July 31 . All four issues were republished as a single package on October 30 . The game 's cover art was unveiled on December 9 , 2012 , featuring Ellie and Joel ; the team fought to feature Ellie on the front cover , despite attempts from external influences to move the image to the back . " I 've been in discussions where we 've been asked to push Ellie to the back and everyone at Naughty Dog just flat @-@ out refused , " said Druckmann . 
 = Ma Chengyuan = 
 Ma Chengyuan ( 3 November 1927 – 25 September 2004 ) was a Chinese archaeologist , epigrapher , and president of the Shanghai Museum . He was credited with saving priceless artifacts from destruction during the Cultural Revolution , and was instrumental in raising funds and support for the rebuilding of the Shanghai Museum . He was a recipient of the John D. Rockefeller III Award , and was awarded the Legion of Honour by French President Jacques Chirac . 
 Ma was an authority on ancient Chinese bronzes and published more than 80 books and academic papers , including a 16 @-@ volume encyclopedia of the bronzes . He was responsible for recovering ancient relics including the Jin Hou Su bells and Warring States period bamboo strips , which are now considered China 's national treasures . 
 Ma suffered from depression in his final years , and committed suicide in September 2004 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Ma Chengyuan was born in 1927 in Shanghai . In 1946 , he joined an underground cell of the Communist Party of China , and graduated from the history department of Daxia University in Shanghai , a predecessor of East China Normal University , in 1951 . He worked for the education department of the Shanghai Municipal Government before joining the Shanghai Museum in 1954 . Ma was originally assigned to be a manager and Communist Party secretary of the museum , but he resigned from his political positions in 1956 to focus on academic work , and later became director of the bronze research department . 
 = = Cultural Revolution = = 
 As the Cultural Revolution erupted in 1966 , Chairman Mao Zedong called for the destruction of the Four Olds , and teenage Red Guards rampaged through people 's homes to destroy relics of pre @-@ Communist China . Desperate Shanghai collectors sought protection of their antiques at the Shanghai Museum , and Ma slept in his office to take phone calls and to dispatch museum employees around the clock . 
 Ma initially kept the Red Guards out of the museum by organizing his employees as fake Red Guards , and protected the relics by painting Maoist slogans over the display cases . However , some of his own staff were soon swept by the revolutionary fervour . The extremist faction of the museum workers seized Ma along with other senior officials , and imprisoned him in a storage room for nine months . Trying to coerce the officials into confessing that they were " traitors " , the extremists repeatedly lifted them up and dropped them onto the marble floor . Several of Ma 's colleagues died . Ma survived the torture , and was sent to a labour camp in Hubei province for five years . 
 In 1972 , after American President Richard Nixon 's historic visit to China , Ma was brought back to Shanghai to organize an exhibition of archaeological treasures to tour the United States . The Cultural Revolution ended after the death of Mao in 1976 . 
 = = Rebuilding the Shanghai Museum = = 
 In 1985 , Ma was appointed the Director of the Shanghai Museum . When the museum was omitted from Shanghai 's five @-@ year reconstruction plan in 1992 , Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding . After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the <unk> Building where the museum was then housed , Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People 's Square , but the museum had to raise its own building funds . Ma raised US $ 25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer . He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations , mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution , raising another US $ 10 million . The money still ran short , but he eventually persuaded the city government to allocate another 140 million yuan to complete the building . 
 The museum reopened on 12 October 1996 to wide acclaim , and Ma gained international fame . He won the John D. Rockefeller III Award from the Asian Cultural Council in that year . French President Jacques Chirac awarded Ma the Legion of Honour in 1998 , and invited Ma to accompany Chinese President Jiang Zemin to a private dinner with him in France . The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong commented that Ma seemed to have " willed [ the Shanghai Museum ] into existence . " 
 = = Recovering cultural relics = = 
 After the opening up of China from the 1980s , tomb robbery was rampant and many artifacts were looted and smuggled across the border to Hong Kong , then a British territory . Ma Chengyuan was active in recovering many of the items from the Hong Kong antique market . In 1992 , he purchased the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old Jin Hou Su bianzhong ( <unk> ) , which were listed by the Chinese government as one of the first 64 national treasures forbidden to be exhibited abroad in 2002 . 
 In 1994 , Ma recovered more than 1 @,@ 200 Warring States period bamboo slips from the Kingdom of Chu , now known as the Shanghai Museum bamboo slips . Several ancient texts were written on the strips , including the Kongzi Shi Lun , a previously unknown commentary on the Confucian Classic of Poetry attributed to Confucius himself . The discovery caused a sensation in academia , and the texts have been the subject of intense studies by numerous scholars , including Ma himself . 
 = = Academics = = 
 Ma was an authority on ancient Chinese bronzes and published more than 80 books and academic papers . His book Ancient Chinese Bronzes , translated into English and published by Oxford University Press ( ISBN <unk> ) , is highly influential and widely used as a university textbook . His 16 @-@ volume encyclopedia , Zhongguo Qingtongqi <unk> ( <unk> , " Complete Compilation of Chinese Bronzes " ) , is the most comprehensive book on Chinese bronzes ever published . He was also the chief editor of Shanghai <unk> <unk> <unk> Chu <unk> ( <unk> , " Warring States Chu Bamboo Books of the Shanghai Museum " ) , a groundbreaking research on the Warring States bamboo strips recovered by Ma himself . Other books he published include Zhongguo Qingtongqi <unk> ( <unk> , " Research on Chinese Bronzes " ) , a collection of 40 of his academic papers , Yangshao <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> , " Painted Ceramics of the Yangshao Culture " ) , and Shang Zhou Qingtongqi <unk> Xuan ( <unk> , " Selected Bronze Inscriptions of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties " ) . 
 In addition to his main position as Director of the Shanghai Museum , Ma also taught as a part @-@ time professor at Shanghai 's East China Normal University and Fudan University . He was also a council member of the Archaeological Society of China , and vice chairman of the China Museum Society . 
 = = Retirement and suicide = = 
 Ma retired in 1999 , but still served as an advisor to the Shanghai Museum . However , he had conflicts with the new management which became increasingly bitter . He was accused of misusing US $ 250 @,@ 000 donated by a Chinese @-@ American collector , but an investigation cleared him of wrongdoing .

 = Scotland under the Commonwealth = 
 Scotland under the Commonwealth is the history of Scotland between the declaration that the kingdom was part of the Commonwealth of England in February 1652 and the Restoration of the monarchy , and of Scotland 's position as an independent kingdom , in June 1660 . 
 After the execution of Charles I in 1649 , the Scottish Parliament declared his son Charles II to be King of Great Britain and Ireland . The English responded with an invasion led by Oliver Cromwell , resulting in defeats for the Scots at Dunbar and then at Worcester , opening the way for the English conquest of the country . Under the Tender of Union , Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland in 1652 , but despite repeated attempts , an act was not passed in Westminster to ratify the union until 1657 . Under the terms of the union , the Scots gained 30 members of parliament , but many posts were not filled , or fell to English agents of the government , and had very little say at Westminster . Initially the government was run by eight commissioners and adopted a policy of undermining the political power of the nobility in favour of the " meaner sort " . From 1655 it was replaced by a new Council of Scotland , headed by Irish peer Lord <unk> , and began attempts to win over the traditional landholders . The regime built a series of major citadels and minor forts at immense cost . The Scottish legal system was suspended , but some courts and institutions were gradually restored . Generally the regime was successful in enforcing law and order and suppressing banditry . There was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands in 1653 – 55 led by William Cunningham , Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton . After initial success , it suffered from internal divisions and petered out after defeat at the Battle of Dalnaspidal in 1654 . 
 The Commonwealth extended toleration to Protestants , including sectaries , but the only significant group were a small number of Quakers . The Kirk that had been established at the Reformation and had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638 , was divided into Resolutioners and more hard line Protesters by the issue of co @-@ operation with the crown . The regime tended to favour the Protestors giving them control over the universities . The country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . The era was remembered as one of prosperity , but not everywhere benefitted from economic expansion . There was an attempt to create national symbols with the revival of the union flag and unite coin . After the death of Oliver Cromwell and the fall of his son Richard 's regime , General Monck marched the army in Scotland south and facilitated the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Having supported Parliament in the First English Civil War ( 1642 – 46 ) under the Solemn League and Covenant , the Covenanter government in Scotland came under the control of the Engagers . As part of a Second English Civil War , they invaded England in support of royalist risings , and were defeated by the New Model Army under Oliver Cromwell at Battle of Preston ( 1648 ) . With many of its leaders captured , the Engagement regime fell in the Whiggamore Raid and the radical Presbyterian Kirk Party returned to power . After the execution of Charles I in January 1649 , England was declared a Commonwealth . As soon as news of Charles I 's execution reached Scotland , his son was proclaimed king as Charles II of Great Britain by the Scottish Parliament . After the failure of an attempted Highland rising led by James Graham , Marquis of Montrose , Charles accepted the offer of conditional support from the Covenanters , arriving in June 1650 and signing the Covenants . The English responded with an army of 16 @,@ 000 under Cromwell , which crossed the border in July 1650 , while an English fleet acted in support . On 3 September 1650 the English army defeated the Scots under David Leslie at the Battle of Dunbar , taking over 10 @,@ 000 prisoners and then occupying Edinburgh , taking control of the Lowlands . Charles could now more easily make an alliance with the moderate Covenanters . He was crowned at Scone on 1 January 1651 and a new army was assembled . In June 1651 Cromwell advanced against the Scots under Leslie at Stirling . The Scots army with the King set off for England , but there was no rising in their favour , and the army was caught at Worcester by forces under Cromwell . On 3 September it was decisively defeated , bringing the civil wars to an end . Charles escaped to the continent , an English army under George Monck mopped up the remaining garrisons in Scotland and Cromwell emerged as the most important figure in the Commonwealth . 
 = = Constitutional status = = 
 Six days after the victory at Worcester , a committee of the English Rump parliament was established with the aim of drafting a bill that would declare " the right of the Commonwealth to so much of Scotland as is now under [ its ] force " . By December this plan for simple annexation had softened , considering " the good of this island " , for one in which Scotland would be incorporated into the " free state and Commonwealth of England " . This " Tender of Union " was proclaimed at the mercat cross in Edinburgh by eight trumpeters on 4 February 1652 . Three days later , the King 's arms were taken down from the cross and ceremoniously hanged from the public gallows . Eventually 29 out of 31 shires and 44 of the 58 burghs assented to the Tender and subscribed to the oath that " Scotland be incorporated into and made one Commonwealth with England " . 
 On 3 April 1652 a bill for an Act for incorporating Scotland into one Commonwealth with England was given a first and a second reading in the Rump Parliament , but it failed to return from its committee stage before the Rump was dissolved . A similar act was introduced into the Barebones Parliament , but it too failed to be enacted before that parliament was dissolved . On 12 April 1654 , the Council of State issued and Ordinance for uniting Scotland into one Commonwealth with England , which would be the " Commonwealth of England , Scotland and Ireland " , under the authority of the Instrument of Government that made Cromwell Lord Protector . This remained the legal basis of the union until the Ordinance became an Act of Union under the Second Protectorate Parliament on 26 June 1657 . 
 Under the terms of the union Scotland received thirty seats in the enlarged Westminster parliament , ten from the burghs and twenty from the shires . There were only five Scottish members out of 140 in the Barebones parliament and only twenty @-@ one were sent to the Protector 's first parliament ( 1654 – 55 ) . It was not until the Protector 's second parliament ( 1656 – 57 ) that thirty were sent . For Richard Cromwell 's parliament in 1658 – 59 , of the thirty elected only eleven were Scots and of the remainder ten were army officers . The Scots in Westminster were treated with general xenophobia and when not ignored they faced repeated motions to exclude them . One Englishman described them as " a wooden leg tied to a natural body . 
 = = Administration = = 
 Under the Tender of Union , the Scottish Parliament was removed , along with the monarchy , and no institution could meet except with the sanction of the Westminster parliament . Initially the country was run by eight English commissioners : Oliver St John , Sir Henry Vane , Richard <unk> , George Fenwick , John Lambert , Richard Deane , Robert Tichborne , and George Monck . In its early stages the regime deliberately attempted to break the influence of the Scottish nobility who had organised invasions of England in 1648 and 1651 . Many were in exile , prison , deprived of office or heavily burdened with fines and debt . Instead the Commonwealth attempted to promote what Cromwell called the " meaner sort " , particularly urban elites and small landholders . In 1655 the Irish peer Lord <unk> arrived in Scotland to act as President of the new Council in Scotland . This was part of an attempt to recast the government along civilian lines and to begin to win over the major landholders to the regime . The council was made up of six Englishmen , Monck , Samuel <unk> , Charles Howard , Adrian Scrope , Thomas Cooper and Nathaniel <unk> , and two Scots , John Swinton and William Lockhart , they were later joined by Sir Edward Rhodes as a ninth member . 
 From late 1651 , passes were needed to move from one area of the country to another . The ownership of firearms was restricted , necessitating a license . In the Highlands the administration fell back on the ancient expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers . The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10 @,@ 000 men . <unk> were built at Ayr , Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway . Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness . These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower . The citadel at Inverness , begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from as far away as Aberdeen , had cost £ 50 @,@ 000 in 1655 , when it was still unfinished . Inverlocky had a garrison of 1 @,@ 000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber , made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires . 
 The Scottish legal system was effectively suspended after the English occupation . All courts that derived from " Charles Stuart " , including Sheriff 's Courts were suspended . Kirk sessions , however , continued to meet largely unhindered , neither sanctioned nor recognised by the Commonwealth . The legal functions of the Privy Council and Court of Session were taken over by seven commissioners , four Englishmen and three Scots . These proved more impartial than previous judges , probably because they were not tied to the major families and political factions by patronage and kinship . Local barony courts and heritable jurisdictions , in abeyance from 1651 , were officially abolished in 1657 . Sheriff 's courts were re @-@ established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656 . The result was a small flood of witchcraft cases , with 102 between 1657 – 59 , which compares with over 600 after the Scottish courts were fully re @-@ established after 1660 . Generally the regime has been seen as successful in enforcing law and order , suppressing the banditry of moss @-@ troopers . In 1655 it was claimed that " a man may ride all over Scotland with £ 100 in his pocket , which he could not have done these five hundred years " . 
 = = Resistance = = 
 In 1653 – 55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham , 9th Earl of Glencairn ( 1610 – 64 ) and former Covenanter soldier John Middleton ( 1608 – 74 ) . It was particularly threatening to the regime because it coincided with the First Dutch War ( 1652 – 54 ) . Glencairn was given command of the Royalist forces in Scotland by Charles II . He convened a meeting of Scottish notables at <unk> in August 1653 . Among those present were John Murray , 1st Marquess of Atholl , Archibald Campbell , eldest son of the Marquis of Argyll , Lord Loin , Donald MacDonell of Glengarry , Ewen Cameron of Lochiel , John Graham of <unk> and Colonel Blackadder of <unk> . These notables then mustered their vassals and supporters to form a small army of about 60 horse , and a force of foot , made up of 60 – 80 Lowlanders and 150 Highlanders . The governor of Stirling Castle , Colonel Kidd , sallied out to suppress this force , but was defeated at <unk> . This victory boosted morale and the rising gained some support from Lowland Scottish lords , forcing the Commonwealth government to adopt a more conciliatory attitude to these groups . 
 Although it gained recruits , the rising began to suffer from internal divisions , particularly between the Highlanders who made up the bulk of the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders . In early 1654 , nine months into the revolt , Middleton , a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester , arrived with a commission to command from Charles II . Despite objections from his followers , Glencairn surrendered control over his forces , which had now reached 3 @,@ 500 foot and 1 @,@ 500 horse . That evening Sir George Munro , Middleton 's aide insulted Glencairn 's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded . Glencairn was arrested . He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict . A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign for the remainder of the rising . 
 Middleton adopted a strategy of raid and harrying . Although successful in distracting the Commonwealth forces and causing disruption , it soon began to prove counter @-@ productive , as growing unpopularity led to a drying up of recruitment . With his return to Scotland after his brief naval command against the Dutch , Monck began a campaign against the rising , making forced marches of between 12 and 20 miles a day in difficult terrain . On 19 July 1654 a force from Monck 's command under Thomas Morgan caught Middleton 's army at Dalnaspidal . In the resulting battle the royalists were scattered and a wounded Middleton was forced to escape to the Highlands . The end of the Dutch War meant there was no possibility of foreign aid and government reinforcements were now available to combat the rising . As a result the Royalist military effort petered out . Eventually , Glencairn surrendered to Monck and Middleton escaped to the continent to join the court in exile . 
 The rising forced a change of policy by the regime , which instead of attempting to replace the landholding classes now looked for a reconciliation with former Royalists and Engagers . This resulted in the Act of Grace and Pardon , proclaimed in Edinburgh on 5 May 1654 . Instead of a blanket forfeiture among those implicated in resistance , it named 24 persons ( mainly from the nobility ) whose lands would be seized , and 73 other landholders who could retain their estates after paying a fine . Even then most of those names were treated with leniency and fines were remitted for confiscations , or were reduced , and some were abandoned . 
 = = Religion = = 
 The Kirk that had been established at the Reformation , had been largely united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638 . In the period after the defeat at Dunbar , it became divided , partly in the search for scapegoats for defeat . Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests , which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners , who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism , and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations . Subsequently the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable . After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London . 
 The terms of the union promised that the Gospel would be preached and promised freedom of religion . The regime accepted Presbyterianism as a valid system , but did not accept that it was the only legitimate form of church organisation . The result was that , although civil penalties no longer backed up its pronouncements , Kirk sessions and synods functioned much as before . The administration tended to favour the Protesters , largely because the Resolutioners were more inclined to desire a restoration of the monarchy and because the General Assembly , where they predominated , claimed independence from the state . The act of holding public prayers for the success of Glencairn 's insurrection led in 1653 , to the largely <unk> members of the Assembly being marched out of Edinburgh by an armed guard . There were no more assemblies in the period of the Commonwealth and the Resolutioners met in informal " consultations " of clergy . The universities , largely seen as a training school for clergy , were relatively well funded and came under the control of the Protestors , with Patrick Gillespie being made Principal at Glasgow . 
 Toleration did not extend to Episcopalians and Catholics , but if they did not call attention to themselves they were largely left alone . It did extend to sectaries , but the only independent group to establish itself in Scotland in this period were a small number of Quakers . In general the period of the Commonwealth was looked back on as one where Protestantism flourished . Ministers , now largely barred from politics , spent more time with their flocks and placed an emphasis on preaching that emulated the sectaries . One Presbyterian noted that " there were more souls converted to Christ in that short period of time than in any season since the Reformation " . 
 = = Economy and taxation = = 
 Under the Commonwealth , the country was relatively highly taxed , but gained access to English markets . Under Charles I Scotland had paid about £ 17 @,@ 000 sterling a year in taxes . In 1656 the civil list alone cost £ 25 @,@ 000 . The sum of £ 10 @,@ 000 a month from the county assessment was demanded by the Cromwellian regime , which Scotland failed to fully supply and it was reduced to 6 @,@ 000 a year in 1657 . The total was never less than £ 90 @,@ 000 a year . In addition the country contributed about £ 35 @,@ 000 in excise a year . Despite this , there was an annual deficit of £ 130 @,@ 000 , which was covered by English revenues . 
 Scotland had suffered considerable economic disruption during the period of the civil wars , caused by loss of manpower to a dozen armies , free quarter ( the billeting of troops on civilians without payment ) , plunder and heavy taxation . A number of merchants , particularly moneylenders , were ruined by the wars . The east @-@ coast towns had probably lost about one fifth of their population from the outbreak of bubonic plague that occurred in 1645 . This was slow to recover and in 1651 rents in Edinburgh had to be reduced by a third . The free trade that was the major economic incentive of the union was not all beneficial , as Scotland now had to compete with the more highly developed English merchant fleet . The economy began to revive after 1650 , but the prosperity was not spread evenly across the country . While Glasgow and Aberdeen prospered , Dundee and the Fife ports continued to decline . The financing of military building and the spending of wages by so many soldiers did benefit some . New industries included glass production at Leith and Cromwell 's troops are traditionally credited with bringing north both the knitting of socks and the planting of kale . The good order imposed by the armed presence encouraged trade and manufacture . Alexander Burnet , later Archbishop of St. Andrews , commented that , " we always reckoned those eight years of usurpation a time of great peace and prosperity " .

 The creation of the union led to revival of the union flag sponsored by James VI and I , which had fallen into disuse after his death in 1625 . From 1654 it was used in the form of quarters , with 1st and 4th England , 2nd Scotland and an Irish harp as 3rd . Perhaps because this too clearly suggested the incorporation at the heart of the union , in 1658 it was replaced by the 1606 version of the flag favoured by James IV , with the crosses of St George and St Andrews melded and the Irish harp placed inescutcheon in the centre . The unite coin , originally struck under James VI , revived in the reign of Charles I and used by both sides in the Civil War , was again revived and struck between 1649 and 1660 . It bore the English text " The Commonwealth of England " and displayed only the Cross of St George and an Irish harp . A twenty @-@ shilling piece and a fifty @-@ shilling piece were also issued , with the image of the Lord Protector on one side , and the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew and Irish harp quartered on the other , as in the union flag . Despite these attempts to produce an iconography of union , Michael Lynch argues that the commonwealth largely lacked the symbols through which consent to a nation state could be expressed . 
 = = Fall of the regime = = 
 After the death of Cromwell in 1658 , Monck remained aloof from the political manoeuvring in London that led to the brief establishment of a regime under the protector 's son Richard Cromwell and after its fall the subsequent contest for power between the army leaders . When this proved incapable of producing a stable government in 1659 Monk opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army . After reaching London he restored the English Long Parliament that had existed at the beginning of the civil wars . This body , having received some assurances from Charles II , voted for a restoration of the monarchy in England and then dissolved itself . This created a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland , but without any safeguards as to the constitutional position in the country . Scottish notables were in a weak position in negotiations with the crown as to what the settlement would be . 
 In the event Scotland regained its independent system of law , its parliament and its kirk , but also the Lords of the Articles ( through which the crown controlled parliamentary business ) and bishops . It also had a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament through a series of commissioners . These began with Middleton , now an earl , and ended with the king 's brother and heir , James , Duke of York ( known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany ) . Legislation was revoked back to 1633 , by the <unk> Act 1661 , removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops ' Wars , but the discipline of kirk sessions , presbyteries and synods were renewed . Only four Covenanters were excluded from the general pardon and were executed , the most prominent being the Marquis of Argyll , but also including the <unk> James Guthrie .

 Plymouth Argyle had finished the 1995 – 96 Football League season in fourth place in the Third Division , one place ahead of Darlington . Therefore , both missed out on the three automatic promotion places and instead took part in the play @-@ offs to determine who would join Preston North End , Gillingham , and Bury as the fourth promoted team . On the final day of the league season , Plymouth Argyle had the opportunity to finish third in the table and thereby clinch the final automatic promotion place but a 3 – 0 win at Home Park against Hartlepool United was not enough to overtake Bury , after they also won 3 – 0 at home to Cardiff City . 
 In the play @-@ off semi @-@ finals , Darlington were paired with sixth @-@ placed Hereford United and Plymouth Argyle with seventh @-@ place finishers Colchester United . Darlington won their first leg tie 2 – 1 at Edgar Street courtesy of goals from Robbie Blake and Sean Gregan . They also won the second leg by the same scoreline at Feethams with Matty Appleby and Robbie Painter on the scoresheet . 
 Plymouth Argyle lost the first leg of their semi @-@ final tie 1 – 0 at Layer Road after a goal from Mark Kinsella , but they responded in the second leg at Home Park . Goals from Michael Evans , Chris Leadbitter and Paul Williams were enough to secure a 3 – 1 win and a 3 – 2 victory on aggregate . The results set up a first visit to Wembley Stadium for the supporters of both clubs . 
 = = Match summary = = 
 The two teams were competing for promotion to the third tier of the English football league system , at the time called the Second Division , a familiar place for both sides . In its previous 68 seasons as a Football League club , Plymouth Argyle competed exclusively in the second and third tiers , exactly 34 seasons each . While Darlington had featured in the second tier just twice , competing in the third tier on 32 occasions and the fourth tier another 32 times . The official attendance of 43 @,@ 431 was a record for a play @-@ off final at that level , beating the previous record set in 1994 , until it was bettered a year later by 3 @,@ 373 spectators . There was also a significant disparity in the number of tickets sold to the supporters of the two clubs , with fewer than 10 @,@ 000 Darlington fans in attendance compared to 35 @,@ 000 fans representing Plymouth Argyle . 
 Plymouth Argyle manager Neil Warnock picked ten players who had started both of the club 's semi @-@ final matches , with Ronnie Mauge keeping his place in the team having replaced Chris Billy for the second leg . The match was to be goalkeeper Steve Cherry 's last for the club , having returned for a second stint with the club three months earlier . Darlington manager Jim Platt , who was taking charge of the team for the last time before the return of David Hodgson , made one change to the side that secured progress from the semi @-@ final stage with Tony <unk> coming in at the expense of Matt Carmichael . The final would prove to be Man of the Match Matty Appleby 's last for Darlington .

 Darlington were the first to settle with Gary Bannister a prominent player in midfield , but Plymouth Argyle eventually found their rhythm and had the first real goalscoring opportunity after ten minutes . Adrian Littlejohn found space after a one @-@ two with Michael Evans , but his first touch let him down and the opportunity was not taken . Darlington 's main threat was coming from attacking full back Appleby and he had their best chance of the match mid @-@ way through the first half . He carved out the initial chance , having carried the ball half the length of the pitch , but team @-@ mate Steven Gaughan was unable to convert . The hasty clearance from Argyle found its way back to Appleby but he sent his shot over the crossbar with goalkeeper Cherry completely exposed . 
 Plymouth Argyle came close to making their opponents pay for their profligacy in front of goal with Evans lifting a volley over the crossbar . Darlington 's captain Andy Crosby was proving to be a formidable figure at the heart of his team 's defence , but Argyle fashioned another chance to open the scoring just before half @-@ time . A flick on by Evans presented Adrian Littlejohn with the opportunity to redeem his earlier miss , but he dragged his shot wide .

 There were few clear @-@ cut chances at the start of the second half , but Plymouth Argyle were winning the midfield battle with Mauge and Chris Leadbitter leading by example with a number of forceful tackles . The pivotal moment arrived on 65 minutes after Martin Barlow had earnt a corner @-@ kick on the right @-@ hand side . Leadbitter played the ball short to full back Mark Patterson , whose well @-@ measured cross was met firmly by the unmarked Mauge to head into the back of the net . Darlington tried to force their way back into the match , but were being thwarted by Plymouth Argyle captain Michael Heathcote and his defensive colleagues which left strikers Robbie Blake and Robbie Painter , who both scored in the semi @-@ finals , with little to work on . As Darlington committed more players forward in search of an equaliser they left themselves exposed in defence which gave the leading side more space to launch counter @-@ attacks . Evans and Littlejohn threatened to score the decisive second goal , but in the end Mauge 's headed finish mid @-@ way through the second half proved to be enough to claim the final promotion place for the team from Devon . The match was by no means a classic , with serious goalscoring chances at a premium , but to the winners it didn 't matter .

 After the final whistle Plymouth Argyle 's captain Michael Heathcote received the winners ' trophy before parading it in front of the club 's supporters on the pitch . For the club 's manager , Neil Warnock , it was his fourth play @-@ off success at Wembley Stadium . He commented on his past experiences that " It can 't be a hindrance , having done it before , but it doesn 't make it any less tense . It makes it a very long season . I had booked a holiday starting today - I suppose I should have known better " . 
 Warnock was also full of praise for his counterpart , Jim Platt , commenting that " He should be made manager of the year for what he 's done at that club " . Citing Darlington 's financial worries " Everyone thought they would blow up , but they didn 't - they got within an ace . Unfortunately , someone has to lose " . Platt , a former Northern Ireland international , was equally optimistic . He said " My side is very young - nearly all of them in their early 20s . I think we will be here again next season or go up automatically - if we can keep the side together " . 
 As a result of their victory , Plymouth Argyle returned to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in its history . They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002 , and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004 , to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve @-@ year hiatus . For Darlington , there was to be more disappointment in the play @-@ offs four years later under David Hodgson , Platt 's successor . They reached the Third Division final in 2000 , the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium , and were defeated 1 – 0 again ; on this occasion to Peterborough United .

 = East Indies theatre of the French Revolutionary Wars = 
 The East Indies theatre of the French Revolutionary Wars was a series of campaigns related to the major European conflict known as the French Revolutionary Wars , fought between 1793 and 1801 between the new French Republic and its allies and a shifting alliance of rival powers . Although the Indian Ocean was separated by vast distance from the principal theatre of the conflict in Western Europe , it played a significant role due to the economic importance of the region to Great Britain , France 's most constant opponent , of its colonies in India and the Far Eastern trade . 
 Protection of British interests in the region fell primarily to the Royal Navy , supported by the military forces of the East India Company . Naval strategy sought to eliminate enemy forces in the region and provide convoy protection to the large East Indiamen merchant ships and smaller company ships which transported goods and wealth between Britain and its Asian colonies and trade partners . The French Navy maintained commerce raiding operations in the region throughout the war ; particularly light frigate squadrons and privateers deployed in an effort to disrupt British trade , supported as the conflict developed by the allies the French accrued in the course of the war , particularly the Batavian Republic and Spain . 
 At the declaration of war on Britain by the newly formed French Republic on 1 February 1793 , British forces in the Indian Ocean held a considerably stronger military position , which was immediately utilised to seize the French territories in India . The remaining French forces continued operating from their base on the remote island of Île de France , privateers in particular conducting a highly disruptive campaign against British commerce . Attempts by the Royal Navy , commanded by Rear @-@ Admiral Peter Rainier , to limit their effectiveness resulted in a number of inconsequential clashes and a partial blockade of the French islands . In 1795 the declaration of war on Britain by the newly formed Batavian Republic led to successful invasions of the Batavian colonies of Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and operations against the Dutch East Indies . 
 In 1796 British control of the region was challenged by a large and powerful French frigate squadron sent to the Indian Ocean under Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey . Sercey 's squadron operated against British trade for two years with little success ; attempts to raid the China trade and coordinate with a Spanish Navy squadron at Manila in the Philippines all ending in failure . Growing resentment on Île de France at the cost of maintaining the squadron eventually required most of the ships to return to France . The survivors , forced to operate independently , were subsequently defeated and captured by the Royal Navy in a series of individual engagements in 1799 . By 1800 British control of the Indian Ocean was again assured , Rainier deploying his ships in trade protection duties and in the Red Sea to support the invasion of Egypt in 1801 . At the end of the war in 1802 the Peace of Amiens reverted the situation in the region to its pre @-@ war state , Britain returning all seized colonies except for Ceylon . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 1 February 1793 , amid mounting tensions following the French Revolution of 1789 , the recently formed French Republic , already at war with the Austrian Empire and Prussia , declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic . This act spread the French Revolutionary Wars beyond Europe to encompass the British , French and Dutch colonies in the Americas and the East Indies . Britain and France were already rivals in the East Indies , having fought campaigns in the Indian Ocean during both the Seven Years ' War ( 1756 – 1763 ) and the American War of Independence ( 1775 – 1783 ) . More recently British and French naval forces had fought the Battle of Tellicherry in 1791 as part of the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War , a conflict between the East India Company ( EIC ) , which controlled British mercantile interests in the East Indies , and the French @-@ supported Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India . The battle was a French defeat , but it had little impact on either the war itself , which saw the EIC extract significant concessions from Tipu Sultan , the ruler of Mysore , or the worsening political climate in Europe . 
 Britain , through the EIC , controlled large stretches of the Indian coast , including the three significant ports of Calcutta , Bombay and Madras , when the war began . On the northern coast of the Bay of Bengal , Calcutta was a highly lucrative port but remote and lacking in naval facilities ; Madras on the Coromandel Coast was an open harbour with little in the way of defences ; while Bombay , on the western coast , was the point of communication with Europe and the strongest naval base in the region . To the east , British merchants operated from the small harbours of Penang and Bencoolen , which linked directly to the great mercantile centre at Canton in Qing Dynasty China . This linkage was the principal cause of British interest in the East Indies : the connection to and dominance of a lucrative network of intercontinental trade and exploration . 
 France controlled a number of trading harbours along the Indian coast including Mahé and Chandernagore , all governed from the larger port of Pondicherry . However , the strongest French position in the region was the isolated island of Île de France , later known as Mauritius , with its subordinate bases of Réunion and small settlements on Madagascar in the Seychelles and on Rodrigues . Île de France , centred on the capital Port Louis , had important commercial agricultural features and an economy dominated by African slave labour . The islands were only commercially viable when left ungarrisoned , and if any troops had to be supported or the islands came under blockade there were corresponding economic difficulties and food shortages . The island was most valuable as a naval base , situated in an ideal position for raiders to intercept British trade between Europe and the East Indies . The upheavals of the French Revolution had reached Île de France , with accusations against senior officials leading to arrests in 1792 . The arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery in August 1794 almost plunged the island into civil war , and only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented conflict . 
 The Dutch Empire held the Dutch Cape Colony , Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies . The latter , now Indonesia , was governed by the Dutch East India Company from the highly lucrative port of Batavia . Batavia was the centre of East Asian trade , reaching as far as Nagasaki in Edo period Japan , supported by other towns and ports including Sourabaya and Griessie . The Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa was far less significant , acting principally as a resupply harbour with little commercial activity or penetration into the surrounding countryside . The commercially significant harbours of Trincomalee and Colombo on the island of Ceylon were of strategic importance , but weakly garrisoned against attack . These colonies were defended by a Dutch naval squadron , sent to the region in 1782 in the aftermath of the American War of Independence . 
 The Spanish Philippines , somewhat distant to the other European colonies in the region , was a commercial backwater which survived through large subsidies from New Spain . The only significant towns were Manila and Cavite , the latter hosting a powerful Spanish naval squadron . A Portuguese mercantile presence existed in the Indian port of Goa , which was a source of concern to the British as it represented a weak point in the defenses of British India . Portugal also controlled the Chinese port of Macau and a number of trading posts on the East African coast in Portuguese Mozambique . Other European nations , including Denmark and Sweden traded in the East Indies , as increasingly did American merchant ships . 
 The East Indies were very important to the British war effort due to their pivotal position in maintaining British revenue through trade . The EIC controlled the shipment of large quantities of valuable commodities from India , China and other Asian markets to Europe with their fleet of large and well @-@ armed merchant ships , known as East Indiamen , supplemented by smaller local trading vessels known as " country ships " . The EIC maintained a standing army in India and their own small fleet , designed for the protection of commerce . The EIC navy was supplemented by Royal Navy forces , which had been depleted of forces shortly before the outbreak of war ; Rear @-@ Admiral William Cornwallis had only the ship of the line HMS Crown at Madras , and the frigate HMS Minerva at Calcutta . French forces in the region also comprised two frigates , Cybèle and Prudente under Commodore Saint @-@ Félix , supported by a squadron of smaller vessels and a large but disorganised force of privateers , with orders to operate against British commerce . 
 = = Outbreak of war = = 
 News of the French declaration of war arrived by ship in Calcutta , having traveled from George Baldwin , British ambassador in Alexandria , on 1 June 1793 . Cornwallis immediately sailed to Pondicherry , instituting a blockade and seizing an ammunition supply ship entering the port . Plans to eliminate the French presence in India had already been drawn up . The British and EIC forces , commanded on land by Colonel John Braithwaite , moved rapidly , seizing Chandernagore , Karaikal , Yanam and Mahé without resistance . Pondicherry proved stronger , and Braithwaite was forced to besiege the city for 22 days until the French commander , Colonel Prosper de Clermont , agreed to surrender . Cornwallis 's blockade was augmented by several large East Indiamen , proving sufficient as a deterrent to drive off the French frigate Cybèle and accompanying storeships which sought to resupply the garrison on 14 August . 
 With the French firmly driven from India , Cornwallis returned to European waters with Minerva . Protection of EIC shipping from French forces was left to a small number of light EIC warships . The trade route through the Sunda Strait proved particularly vulnerable ; on 27 September 1793 the East Indiaman Princess Royal was captured by a squadron of large privateers . In January 1794 a well armed squadron of East Indiamen under Commodore Charles Mitchell were sent to patrol the Sunda Strait by the EIC . During the ensuing Sunda Strait campaign , privateers attacked the East Indiaman Pigot on 17 January before Mitchell defeated the largest privateers , Vengeur and Résolu , on 22 January and fought an inconclusive engagement with Prudente and Cybèle under Captain Jean @-@ Marie Renaud on 24 January . Renaud subsequently captured the Pigot , while she was under repairs at Fort Marlborough . In late February both French and EIC squadrons returned to the Indian Ocean . The Dutch frigate Amazone subsequently captured two French corvettes at Sourabaya . 
 In the early spring of 1794 , during a major campaign in the Atlantic , a British force led by Captain Peter Rainier in the 74 @-@ gun ship of the line HMS Suffolk , also including HMS Swift , HMS Orpheus , HMS Centurion and HMS Resistance , was sent to the Indian Ocean . This force diverged en route , with Orpheus , Resistance and Centurion cruising off Île de France in May . On 5 May this force encountered the captured Princess Royal , now armed as a warship and renamed Duguay @-@ Trouin , and the brig Vulcain . Duguay @-@ Trouin sailed poorly and was intercepted and captured by Orpheus after a short battle . The blockade of Île de France was maintained during the year and on 22 October Renaud attempted to eliminate it , attacking Centurion and Diomede off Île Ronde . The ensuing battle was hard @-@ fought , with a particularly ferocious duel between Centurion and Cybèle , but ultimately the British squadron was forced to withdraw to India .

 " What was a feather in the hands of the Dutch will become a sword in the hands of France . " 
 Rainier decided not to renew the blockade of Île de France in 1794 , concerned by false rumours that a French battle squadron was sailing to the East Indies . In July 1795 news arrived in India which significantly changed the strategic situation : during the winter of 1794 – 1795 the French Army had overrun the Dutch Republic , reforming the country into an allied client state named the Batavian Republic . Control of the Dutch colonies , whose loyalty was uncertain , became Rainier 's main priority due principally to their strategic positions along intercontinental trade routes , and he immediately organised operations to seize them . The largest force , with Rainier in personal command , descended on Trincomalee , while a smaller force under Captain Edward Pakenham in Resistance sailed for Malacca . 
 Rainier hoped that the Dutch commanders would peacefully transfer control of their colonies to the British after provision of the Kew Letters from Stadtholder William of Orange . However at Trincomalee the governor resisted and an invasion of Ceylon went ahead . After a short bombardment , Trincomalee capitulated on 26 August , although Diomede was wrecked during the landing operation . With the principal fort taken , the remaining Batavian towns on Ceylon surrendered peaceably over the following month , as did the Batavian trading port of Cochin in India . Pakenham 's force was able to seize Malacca without resistance on 17 August 1795 .
