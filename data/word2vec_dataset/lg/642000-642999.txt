 In 1932 , Brown sent his stud manager Jack Humphrey to Egypt , where acting for Brown he bought two stallions and four mares from Prince Mohammed Ali . The Prince was known as a horseman and scholar , publishing a two @-@ volume treatise on the breeding of Arabian horses . Two of the mares purchased were daughters of <unk> , whom Brown described as " the most beautiful mare he ever saw " . The stallions were * Nasr , a successful race horse , and * <unk> . 
 = = = Endurance testing and remounts = = = 
 Brown was a remount agent , who served on the U.S. Remount Board , and his interest in improving the quality of horses used by the U.S. Cavalry may have been his motivation to breed Arabians . Spencer Borden shared Brown 's interest in Arabians as remount bloodstock . Seeking to prove the superior endurance and durability of Arabian horses to the U.S. Army Remount Service , Brown actively encouraged the participation of Arabians in endurance races . He had most of his horses trained to ride and drive . Many were used in endurance races , others shown , and at least one was a polo pony . 
 In 1918 , Brown set up a test ride in which he had two of his horses travel from Berlin to Bethel , Maine , a distance of 162 miles ( 261 km ) . They completed the ride in just over 31 hours including breaks ; each horse carried a rider and equipment weighing 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) in poor weather and on muddy roads . The horses were <unk> , a purebred seven @-@ year @-@ old mare who weighed 900 pounds ( 410 kg ) , and Rustem Bey , a half @-@ Arab by Khaled out of a Standardbred mare of the Clay Trotting Horses line . Rustem Bey was taller and heavier than <unk> . Both horses were examined by a veterinarian , assessed as being sound and fit to continue at the end of the ride , and showed no evidence of soreness 24 hours later . A third Arabian , Herbert Brown 's * Crabbet , was ridden by a military officer supervising the test , and that pair covered 95 miles ( 153 km ) in seventeen hours . The results of the test were reported in The New York Times . 
 Following the 1918 test , Brown helped organize the first U.S. Official Cavalry Endurance Ride in 1919 , which was won by his mare Ramla , who carried 200 pounds ( 91 kg ) . The race covered 306 miles ( 492 km ) in five days . The U.S. Remount Service requested the weight horses carried in 1920 be raised to 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) , and required horses to travel for about 60 miles ( 97 km ) a day for five days . Arabians won the highest average points of any breed , and although an Arabian horse did not win first place that year , Rustem Bey was second . In 1921 , with a weight requirement of 225 pounds ( 102 kg ) , again covering 300 miles ( 480 km ) in five days , Brown 's gelding * Crabbet won the race and Rustem Bey placed third , despite a donation of $ 50 @,@ 000 from The Jockey Club to the Army to buy the best Thoroughbreds possible in a failed attempt to beat the Arabians . Brown won again in 1923 with an Anglo @-@ Arabian named <unk> , thus retiring the U.S. Mounted Service Cup . 
 Brown used Arabian stallions owned by the remount service as breeding animals , and over time he also provided 32 of his own stallions to sire remounts . He advocated crossbreeding Arabians to improve other breeds . He concluded , however , that attempting to breed purebred Arabians for increased size resulted in a sacrifice in quality and Arabian type .

 Brown sold all his horses in 1933 in an attempt to raise funds to keep the Brown Company solvent . They were bought by the Kellogg Ranch , Roger Selby , William Randolph Hearst 's San Simeon Stud , and " General " J. M. Dickinson of Traveler 's Rest Stud , who acquired most of the horses from Brown 's 1932 importation from Egypt . Dickinson in turn sold * <unk> to Wayne Van Vleet of Colorado in 1939 , and <unk> , the last foal bred by Brown , to a ranch in Texas . There <unk> was left to fend for himself on the open range as a herd stallion , but , a testament to the hardiness of Brown 's Arabians , he survived and was returned to the Arabian breeding world by Henry Babson . Dickinson sold the mare * Aziza to Alice Payne , who later owned * Raffles .

 Brown believed it was important to preserve the scenic value of New Hampshire 's forests . Between 1903 and 1911 , he helped with efforts to establish White Mountain National Forest . Among his many civic activities , Brown promoted early legislative efforts to protect public riding trails . He also helped New Hampshire acquire Franconia Notch and Crawford Notch as public lands , and established a river conservation group in Quebec . 
 A scholar of the Arabian horse , he collected a significant library of works on the breed , one of the largest collections in the United States . His papers are now kept by the Arabian Horse Owners Foundation ( AHOF ) . Today , the term " CMK " , meaning " Crabbet / Maynesboro / Kellogg " , is a label for specific lines of " Domestic " or " American @-@ bred " Arabian horses . It describes the descendants of horses imported to America from the desert or from Crabbet Park Stud in the late 1800s and early 1900s and then bred on in the US by the Hamidie Society , Huntington , Borden , Davenport , Brown , W. K. Kellogg , Hearst , or Dickinson .

 Hans Charles Freeman AM FAA ( 26 May 1929 – 9 November 2008 ) was a German @-@ born Australian bioinorganic chemist , protein crystallographer , and Professor of Inorganic Chemistry who spent most of his career at the University of Sydney . His best known contributions to chemistry were his work explaining the unusual structural , electrochemical , and spectroscopic properties of blue copper proteins , particularly plastocyanin . He also introduced protein crystallography to Australia and was a strong advocate for programs to ensure Australian scientists have good access to " big science " facilities . Freeman has received numerous honours , including being elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science ( FAA ) and appointed a Member of the Order of Australia ( AM ) by the Australian Government . He was a charismatic lecturer who voluntarily continued teaching well into his formal retirement and imbued his students with a love of science .

 = = = Early years and education = = = 
 Hans Charles Freeman was born in Breslau in Germany in 1929 , the first and only son of Karl and Lotte Freeman . In 1938 , following a tip @-@ off from a Nazi party member , Karl decided to relocate his Jewish family to Australia . Karl brought his knowledge of detergents ( a novelty in Australia at the time ) to his new homeland , applying it to the problem of cleaning blood @-@ stained blankets that would otherwise be wasted . After the war , he founded K. H. Freeman Pty Ltd , a detergent and soap manufacturing company ; Hans spent many weekends working in the factory , gaining a practical insight into chemistry . 
 Hans adapted well to his new environment , quickly mastering his new language and demonstrating his outstanding scholastic ability . He was dux of his primary school , dux of Sydney Boys High in 1945 , and took his Bachelor 's degree with the university medal in chemistry in 1949 . He was one of the ten chemistry students in his class at Sydney Boys High to go on to become Professors of Chemistry . After receiving his MSc in 1952 under the supervision of Raymond Le Fevre FRS , Freeman attended Caltech on a Rotary Foundation Fellowship where , at the urging of Linus Pauling , he learned the fundamentals of crystallography . He received a PhD in 1957 for his work on the structure of <unk> hydrate , where he completed most of the calculations for the crystal structure by hand . 
 = = = Personal life = = = 
 Freeman came to Australia with his parents and his sister , Eva . Following the death of his father in 1958 , he became a Director of K. H. Freeman Pty Ltd , which continues to operate today . He met Edith <unk> in 1964 and they married in 1966 . They have two children , <unk> and Philip . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Freeman was appointed to the faculty of the University of Sydney in 1954 as a Lecturer , working his way up until he was made the inaugural Professor of Inorganic Chemistry in 1971 . Freeman pioneered the use of computers in crystallography in Australia , working on <unk> ( the Australian cousin of the University of Illinois ' ILLIAC machine and Australia 's second computer ) after its installation in 1956 . His research group extended its interests beyond purely organic compounds and on to metal complexes ( such as copper <unk> , one of the first bioinorganic substances to be structurally determined ) and went on to determine the structures of numerous metal complexes of amino acids and peptides . 
 In 1970 , the focus of Freeman 's research became protein crystallography and he turned his attention to the blue copper proteins ( <unk> ) and particularly the electron transport protein plastocyanin . The intensely blue colour of plastocyanin and its unusual redox properties had frustrated all attempts to synthesise a small molecule mimic . It was not until 1977 that his group finally determined the structure of plastocyanin crystallised from the poplar tree ( see diagram at right ) ; this was the first protein crystal structure determined in the southern hemisphere . Together with subsequent work in collaboration with Ed Solomon , this work led to understanding of the unusual geometry of the copper metal site ( see diagram at left ) as well as the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties characteristic of blue copper proteins . 
 Later in his career , Freeman developed an interest in the applications of EXAFS spectroscopy to <unk> structure , collaborating with both James Penner @-@ Hahn and Keith Hodgson . Working together , the Freeman and Hodgson groups were , in 1988 , the first to determine a new crystal structure of a protein using the multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion ( MAD ) method . 
 Throughout his career , Freeman was concerned about the influence of the tyranny of distance on the development of Australian science . For this reason , in 1972 Freeman and Alexander Boden AO , FAA , founded the Foundation for Inorganic Chemistry at the university to bring international scholars to the department to deliver a course for graduate students and give seminars for faculty . The inaugural Foundation scholar was <unk> laureate Linus Pauling and the Foundation has brought many other eminent research chemists to Australia . The Foundation has thus functioned to increase Australian awareness of state of the art international research , increased international recognition of Australian research , and allowed graduate students to interact with leading chemists based in institutions far from Australia . Many of the students have gone on to post @-@ graduate or post @-@ doctoral positions with a Foundation scholar . 
 Freeman also provided advice to the Australian Government on the problem of access to " big science " facilities . This included making major contributions to the report Small Country - Big Science in his work for the Australian Science and Technology Council . The report emphasised the need for Australian researchers to have access to facilities such as synchrotron X @-@ ray and high intensity neutron sources , and led directly to the formation of the Australian Synchrotron Research Programme ( ASRP ) to fund access to such facilities . Freeman served as a board member of the ASRP until its functions were subsumed under the newly commissioned Australian Synchrotron in 2008 . The Australian expertise developed as a consequence of ASRP @-@ supported research led to the Australian Synchrotron being built a decade sooner than would have otherwise been the case . 
 Freeman retired from his Chair in 1997 , and was succeeded by Len <unk> FAA . Nevertheless , he continued working in research and became Emeritus Professor of Chemistry and Emeritus Professor of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences . He also voluntarily continued teaching at first @-@ year level . His lecturing was described as " charismatic " and " teaching was a love and a privilege and never an obligation " for him . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Freeman was principally responsible for the establishment of structural biology as a discipline in Australia . He founded the first protein crystallography laboratory in Australia ; today , there are more than 15 active research groups carrying out protein crystallography in Australia and New Zealand . Many former members of the Freeman research group have moved on to join one of these other groups . The groups interact through the Society of <unk> of Australia and New Zealand ( <unk> ) ; Freeman was the Foundation President of then Society of <unk> of Australia , an organisation he was instrumental in forming in 1976 . Working as a crystallographer , Freeman 's major legacies are the understanding of plastocyanin and other blue copper proteins , and development of the MAD method as an extension of EXAFS spectroscopy . Freeman 's work in ensuring Australian scientists have access to " big science " facilities will continue to assist researchers into the future . His teaching also leaves a legacy of " generations of students imbued with a love of science " . 
 = = Honours and awards = = 
 Freeman was recognised for his professional achievements with Fellowships in the Royal Australian Chemical Institute ( RACI ) in 1968 , the Royal Society of Chemistry in 1984 , and the Australian Academy of Science in 1984 . Freeman 's contributions were also recognised by the Australian Government with a Centenary Medal in 2001 for " service to Australian society and science in chemistry " and with his appointment as a Member of the Order of Australia in June 2005 for " service to science and scientific research in the field of bio @-@ inorganic chemistry , particularly through the establishment and development of the discipline of crystallography in Australia " . 
 Freeman received numerous awards over his long career . In 1980 , Freeman received the Burrows Award , the premier award of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of the RACI . He was also awarded the 1999 Leighton Memorial Medal which is " the RACI 's most prestigious medal and is awarded in recognition of eminent services to chemistry in Australia in the broadest sense . " In 2007 , he received both the Australian Academy of Science 's Craig Medal and an RACI Distinguished Fellowship .

 The Russian submarine AG @-@ 22 was an AG @-@ class submarine , designed by the American Holland Torpedo Boat Company / Electric Boat Company , built for the Imperial Russian Navy during World War I. The submarine was fabricated in Canada , shipped to Russia and reassembled for service with the Black Sea Fleet . Her reassembly was completed in 1919 by the White Movement during the Russian Civil War , and she joined Wrangel 's fleet as it evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was interned in Bizerte , Tunisia in 1921 . AG @-@ 22 was abandoned there and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Description = = 
 AG @-@ 22 was a single @-@ hulled submarine , with a pressure hull divided into five watertight compartments . The submarine had a length of 150 feet 3 inches ( 45 @.@ 8 m ) overall , a beam of 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She displaced 355 long tons ( 361 t ) on the surface and 433 long tons ( 440 t ) submerged . The AG @-@ class submarines had a diving depth of 164 feet ( 50 @.@ 0 m ) and a crew of 30 officers and enlisted men . 
 The submarine had two three @-@ bladed propellers , each of which was driven by a 480 @-@ horsepower ( 360 kW ) diesel engine as well as a 640 @-@ horsepower ( 477 kW ) electric motors . This arrangement gave AG @-@ 22 a maximum speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) while surfaced and 10 @.@ 5 knots ( 19 @.@ 4 km / h ; 12 @.@ 1 mph ) submerged . She had a range of 1 @,@ 750 nmi ( 3 @,@ 240 km ; 2 @,@ 010 mi ) at 7 knots ( 13 km / h ; 8 @.@ 1 mph ) while on the surface and 25 nmi ( 46 km ; 29 mi ) at 3 knots ( 5 @.@ 6 km / h ; 3 @.@ 5 mph ) while submerged . Her fuel capacity was 16 @.@ 5 long tons ( 16 @.@ 8 t ) of fuel oil . 
 The AG @-@ class submarines were equipped with four 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedo tubes in the bow and carried eight torpedoes . For surface combat they had one 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) deck gun .

 The Holland 602 design was widely exported during World War I and the Imperial Russian Navy ordered a total of 17 , in three batches , of a version known as the American Holland @-@ class ( AG in Russian for <unk> <unk> ( American Holland ) ) . The submarines were to be built in Canada as knock @-@ down kits for assembly in Russia . 
 Steel for the first three submarines ( AG @-@ 21 , AG @-@ 22 , and AG @-@ 23 ) of the second batch ordered by the Russians was assembled in Saint John , New Brunswick by May 1916 . Five months later , they were sent to Vancouver by rail in sections where they were loaded into ships and shipped to Vladivostok . There they were loaded onto the Trans @-@ Siberian Railroad and transported to Nikolaev where they were assembled by the Russud Shipyard . Assembly was delayed by the unrest caused by the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War and was not completed until 1919 . By this time , Nikolaev was controlled by the Whites and they took AG @-@ 22 with them when they evacuated the Crimea in late 1920 as part of what came to be called Wrangel 's Fleet . They ultimately were granted asylum in Bizerte in February 1921 . AG @-@ 22 was abandoned there in November 1923 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = Comet Hale – Bopp = 
 Comet Hale – Bopp ( formally designated C / 1995 O1 ) is a comet that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century and one of the brightest seen for many decades . It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months , twice as long as the previous record holder , the Great Comet of 1811 . 
 Hale – Bopp was discovered on July 23 , 1995 , at a great distance from the Sun , raising expectations that the comet would brighten considerably by the time it passed close to Earth . Although predicting the brightness of comets with any degree of accuracy is very difficult , Hale – Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1 , 1997 . The comet was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997 . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 The comet was discovered independently on July 23 , 1995 by two observers , Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp , both in the United States . 
 Hale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success , and was tracking known comets from his driveway in New Mexico when he chanced upon Hale – Bopp just after midnight . The comet had an apparent magnitude of 10 @.@ 5 and lay near the globular cluster M70 in the constellation of Sagittarius . Hale first established that there was no other deep @-@ sky object near M70 , and then consulted a directory of known comets , finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky . Once he had established that the object was moving relative to the background stars , he emailed the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams , the clearing house for astronomical discoveries . 
 Bopp did not own a telescope . He was out with friends near Stanfield , Arizona observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friend 's telescope . He realized he might have spotted something new when , like Hale , he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep @-@ sky objects were known to be near M70 , and found that there were none . He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a Western Union telegram . Brian G. Marsden , who had run the bureau since 1968 , laughed , " Nobody sends telegrams anymore . I mean , by the time that telegram got here , Alan Hale had already e @-@ mailed us three times with updated coordinates . " 
 The following morning , it was confirmed that this was a new comet , and it was given the designation C / 1995 O1 . The discovery was announced in International Astronomical Union circular <unk> . 
 The comet may have been observed by ancient Egyptians during the reign of pharaoh Pepi I ( 2332 – <unk> BC ) . In Pepi 's pyramid in Saqqara is a text referring to an " <unk> @-@ star " as a companion of the pharaoh in the heavens , where " <unk> " is the hieroglyph for long hair . 
 = = Early observation = = 
 Hale – Bopp 's orbital position was calculated as 7 @.@ 2 astronomical units ( AU ) from the Sun , placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and by far the greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs . Most comets at this distance are extremely faint , and show no discernible activity , but Hale – Bopp already had an observable coma . An image taken at the Anglo @-@ Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then @-@ unnoticed comet some 13 AU from the Sun , a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable . ( Halley 's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun . ) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60 ± 20 kilometres in diameter , approximately six times the size of Halley . 
 Its great distance and surprising activity indicated that comet Hale – Bopp might become very bright indeed when it reached perihelion in 1997 . However , comet scientists were wary – comets can be extremely unpredictable , and many have large outbursts at great distance only to diminish in brightness later . Comet Kohoutek in 1973 had been touted as a ' comet of the century ' and turned out to be unspectacular . 
 = = Perihelion = = 
 Hale – Bopp became visible to the naked eye in May 1996 , and although its rate of brightening slowed considerably during the latter half of that year , scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright . It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996 , but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it , even from large cities with light @-@ polluted skies . 
 The Internet was a growing phenomenon at the time , and numerous websites that tracked the comet 's progress and provided daily images from around the world became extremely popular . The Internet played a large role in encouraging the unprecedented public interest in comet Hale – Bopp . 
 As the comet approached the Sun , it continued to brighten , shining at 2nd magnitude in February , and showing a growing pair of tails , the blue gas tail pointing straight away from the Sun and the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit . On March 9 , a solar eclipse in China , Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime . Hale – Bopp had its closest approach to Earth on March 22 , 1997 at a distance of 1 @.@ 315 AU . 
 As it passed perihelion on April 1 , 1997 the comet developed into a spectacular sight . It shone brighter than any star in the sky except Sirius , and its dust tail stretched 40 – 45 degrees across the sky . The comet was visible well before the sky got fully dark each night , and while many great comets are very close to the Sun as they pass perihelion , comet Hale – Bopp was visible all night to northern hemisphere observers . 
 = = After perihelion = = 
 After its perihelion passage , the comet moved into the southern celestial hemisphere . The comet was much less impressive to southern hemisphere observers than it had been in the northern hemisphere , but southerners were able to see the comet gradually fade from view during the second half of 1997 . The last naked @-@ eye observations were reported in December 1997 , which meant that the comet had remained visible without aid for 569 days , or about 18 and a half months . The previous record had been set by the Great Comet of 1811 , which was visible to the naked eye for about 9 months . 
 The comet continued to fade as it receded , but is still being tracked by astronomers . In October 2007 , 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25 @.@ 7 AU from Sun , the comet was still active as indicated by the detection of the CO @-@ driven coma . Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale – Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer . Hale – Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30 @.@ 7 AU away from the Sun , and on August 7 , 2012 at a 33 @.@ 2 AU distance from the Sun . Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020 , by which time it will be nearing 30th magnitude . By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness . 
 = = Orbital changes = = 
 The comet likely made its previous perihelion 4 @,@ 200 years ago . The comet 's orbit is almost perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic , which ensures that close approaches to planets are rare . However , in April 1996 the comet passed within 0 @.@ 77 AU of Jupiter , close enough for its orbit to be measurably affected by the planet 's gravity . The comet 's orbit was shortened considerably to a period of roughly 2 @,@ 533 years , and it will next return to the inner Solar System around the year <unk> . Its greatest distance from the Sun ( aphelion ) will be about 370 AU , reduced from about 525 AU . 
 Over many orbits , the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations on comets with high orbital inclinations and small perihelion distances is generally to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values . Hale – Bopp has about a 15 % chance of eventually becoming a sungrazing comet through this process . 
 It has been calculated that the previous visit by Hale – Bopp occurred in July 2215 BC . The comet may have presented a similar sight to people then , as the estimated closest approach to Earth was 1 @.@ 4 AU , but no records of it have survived . Hale – Bopp may have had a near collision with Jupiter in early June 2215 BC , which probably caused a dramatic change in its orbit , and 2215 BC may have been its first passage through the inner Solar System . 
 The estimated probability of Hale @-@ Bopp 's striking Earth in future passages through the inner Solar System is remote , about 2 @.@ 5 × 10 − 9 per orbit . However , given that the comet nucleus is around 60 km in diameter , the consequences of such an impact would be apocalyptic . Weissman conservatively estimates the diameter at 35 km ; an estimated density of 0 @.@ 6 g / cm3 then gives a cometary mass of 1 @.@ 3 × 1019 g . At a probable impact velocity of 52 @.@ 5 km / s , impact energy can be calculated as 1 @.@ 9 × 1032 ergs , or 4 @.@ 4 × 109 megatons , about 44 times the estimated energy of the K @-@ T impact event . 
 = = Scientific results = = 
 Comet Hale – Bopp was observed intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage , and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations . The dust production rate of the comet was very high ( up to 2 @.@ 0 × 106 kg / s ) , which may have made the inner coma optically thick . Based on the properties of the dust grains — high temperature , high albedo and strong 10 μm silicate emission feature — the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet . 
 Hale – Bopp showed the highest ever linear polarization detected for any comet . Such polarization is the result of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust particles in the coma of the comet and depends on the nature of the grains . It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale – Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet . 
 = = = Sodium tail = = = 
 One of the most remarkable discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail . In addition to the well @-@ known gas and dust tails , Hale – Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail , only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters . Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets , but had not been shown to come from a tail . Hale – Bopp 's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms ( not ions ) , and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length . 
 The source of the sodium appeared to be the inner coma , although not necessarily the nucleus . There are several possible mechanisms for generating a source of sodium atoms , including collisions between dust grains surrounding the nucleus , and ' sputtering ' of sodium from dust grains by ultraviolet light . It is not yet established which mechanism is primarily responsible for creating Hale – Bopp 's sodium tail , and the narrow and diffuse components of the tail may have different origins . 
 While the comet 's dust tail roughly followed the path of the comet 's orbit and the gas tail pointed almost directly away from the Sun , the sodium tail appeared to lie between the two . This implies that the sodium atoms are driven away from the comet 's head by radiation pressure . 
 = = = Deuterium abundance = = = 
 The abundance of deuterium in comet Hale – Bopp in the form of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth 's oceans . If Hale – Bopp 's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets , this implies that although cometary impacts are thought to be the source of a significant amount of the water on Earth , they cannot be the only source . 
 Deuterium was also detected in many other hydrogen compounds in the comet . The ratio of deuterium to normal hydrogen was found to vary from compound to compound , which astronomers believe suggests that cometary ices were formed in interstellar clouds , rather than in the solar nebula . Theoretical modelling of ice formation in interstellar clouds suggests that comet Hale – Bopp formed at temperatures of around 25 – 45 Kelvin . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Spectroscopic observations of Hale – Bopp revealed the presence of many organic chemicals , several of which had never been detected in comets before . These complex molecules may exist within the cometary nucleus , or might be synthesised by reactions in the comet . 
 = = = Detection of argon = = = 
 Hale – Bopp was the first comet where the noble gas argon was detected . Noble gases are chemically inert and highly volatile , and since different noble elements have different sublimation temperatures , they can be used for probing the temperature histories of the cometary ices . Krypton has a sublimation temperature of 16 – 20 K and was found to be depleted more than 25 times relative to the solar abundance , while argon with its higher sublimation temperature was enriched relative to the solar abundance . Together these observations indicate that the interior of Hale – Bopp has always been colder than 35 – 40 K , but has at some point been warmer than 20 K. Unless the solar nebula was much colder and richer in argon than generally believed , this suggests that the comet formed beyond Neptune in the Kuiper belt region and then migrated outward to the Oort cloud . 
 = = = Rotation = = = 
 Comet Hale – Bopp 's activity and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus , but instead came from several specific jets . Observations of the material streaming away from these jets allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet , which was found to be about 11 hours 46 minutes . 
 = = = Binary nucleus question = = = 
 In 1997 a paper was published that hypothesised the existence of a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale – Bopp 's dust emission observed in October 1995 . The paper was based on theoretical analysis , and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus , but estimated that it would have a diameter of about 30 km , with the main nucleus being about 70 km across , and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180 km . This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide @-@ Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite . 
 Although observations using adaptive optics in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double peak in the brightness of the nucleus , controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus . The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations . Also , while comets have been observed to break up before , no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus . Given the very small mass of this comet , the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets . 
 = = UFO claims = = 
 In November 1996 amateur astronomer Chuck Shramek of Houston , Texas took a CCD image of the comet , which showed a fuzzy , slightly elongated object nearby . When his computer sky @-@ viewing program did not identify the star , Shramek called the Art Bell radio program Coast to Coast AM to announce that he had discovered a " Saturn @-@ like object " following Hale – Bopp . UFO enthusiasts , such as remote viewing proponent Courtney Brown , soon concluded that there was an alien spacecraft following the comet . 
 Several astronomers , including Alan Hale , claimed the object was simply an 8 @.@ 5 @-@ magnitude star , <unk> , which did not appear on Shramek 's computer program because the user preferences were set incorrectly . Later , Art Bell even claimed to have obtained an image of the object from an anonymous astrophysicist who was about to confirm its discovery . However , astronomers Olivier Hainaut and David J. Tholen of the University of Hawaii stated that the alleged photo was an altered copy of one of their own comet images . 
 A few months later , in March 1997 , 39 members of the cult Heaven 's Gate committed mass suicide with the intention of teleporting to a spaceship they believed was flying behind the comet . 
 Nancy Lieder , a self @-@ proclaimed contactee who claims to receive messages from aliens through an implant in her brain , stated that Hale – Bopp was a fiction designed to distract the population from the coming arrival of " Nibiru " or " Planet X " , a giant planet whose close passage would disrupt the Earth 's rotation , causing global cataclysm . Although Lieder 's original date for the apocalypse , May 2003 , passed without incident , predictions of the imminent arrival of Nibiru continued by various conspiracy websites , most of whom tied it to the 2012 phenomenon . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Its lengthy period of visibility and extensive coverage in the media meant that Hale – Bopp was probably the most @-@ observed comet in history , making a far greater impact on the general public than the return of Halley 's Comet in 1986 , and certainly seen by a greater number of people than witnessed any of Halley 's previous appearances . For instance , 69 % of Americans had seen Hale – Bopp by April 9 , 1997 . 
 Hale – Bopp was a record @-@ breaking comet — the farthest comet from the Sun discovered by amateurs , with the largest well @-@ measured cometary nucleus known after <unk> / Chiron , and it was visible to the naked eye for twice as long as the previous record @-@ holder . It was also brighter than magnitude 0 for eight weeks , longer than any other recorded comet . 
 = Ben 's Chili Bowl = 
 Ben 's Chili Bowl is a landmark restaurant in Washington , D.C. , located at 1213 U Street , next to Lincoln Theatre , in the Shaw neighborhood of northwest D.C. It is known locally for its chili dogs , half @-@ smokes , and milkshakes , and has been an integral part of the neighborhood 's history since its founding in 1958 . It was frequented by both police and protesters during the 1968 Washington , D.C. riots , and is regularly visited by celebrities , such as Bill Cosby and Chris Tucker . 
 In January 2009 , Washington , D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty took then @-@ President @-@ elect Barack Obama to eat at Ben 's as part of his welcome to the city . 
 = = History = = 
 Ben 's Chili Bowl was founded on August 22 , 1958 by Ben Ali , a Trinidadian @-@ born immigrant who had studied dentistry at nearby Howard University , and his fiancee , Virginian @-@ born Virginia Rollins . The two were married seven weeks after opening the restaurant . The building they chose was that of Washington 's first silent movie house , the Minnehaha , which was established in 1911 . The building is a contributing property to the Greater U Street Historic District . Most of the furniture in the restaurant is original to the 1950s . At the time , Washington was officially segregated , and U Street was known as " Black Broadway " . Many jazz greats of the day , such as Duke Ellington , Miles Davis , and Nat King Cole , would stop by the restaurant when they performed at U Street clubs . 
 The U Street corridor was devastated by the 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr . During the riots , black activist Stokely Carmichael , leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , asked Ben to keep his restaurant open and the Alis obtained permission to stay open past curfew . The restaurant fed both the police officers and firemen working to impose order on the neighborhood , as well as the black activists . The violence and arson reached such an extent that Ben wrote " Soul Brother " in soap on the front window in the hopes that it would stop the angry mobs . 
 The destruction of so many businesses led to the flight of residents towards the suburbs and the economic decline of the neighborhood through the mid @-@ 1970s to mid @-@ 1980s . As the area became known for its drug addicts , Ben 's Chili Bowl reduced its staff to one employee . Ben and Virginia 's son Kamal recalled , " We stayed and had a following , because the Chili Bowl was like the neighborhood barbershop . People would sit here and chat . There was always a family presence and the locals protected us . " The restaurant stopped serving pies and cakes , which attracted addicts , while police conducted surveillance on drug dealers from an upstairs window of the building . 
 The extensive construction of the U Street Metro station across the street from the restaurant , completed in 1991 , forced still more U Street businesses to close , but Ben 's Chili Bowl stayed open to feed the construction workers . The Washington Post commented that Ben 's Chili Bowl is " probably the only business on this strip that survived both the 1968 riots and the construction phase of the Metro Green Line " . The Metro and lower crime rates helped the gradual revitalization and gentrification of the neighborhood . From the early 1990s , business revenues grew by 10 % annually , to $ 1 @.@ 5 million in 2005 , and the number of employees at the restaurant grew as well , to a staff of 20 . 
 In the summer of 2007 , the owners of Ben 's led a coalition of ten small local businesses to broker a deal with a local energy company to convert operations to 100 % wind energy . The New York Post quoted Nizam Ali as saying , “ We see this as part of being involved in what is good for the neighborhood , what ’ s good for the city .... It ’ s a good idea that helps the environment and , it turns out , makes economic sense for all of us . " 
 In 2008 , Ben 's Chili Bowl opened a second location in the newly built Nationals Park , though it has a more limited selection than the original restaurant . 
 On October 7 , 2009 , Ben died at the age of 82 . He and his wife , Virginia , had retired from the restaurant business , having passed daily operations of Ben 's Chili Bowl to their sons , Kamal and Nizam . Ali 's death was mourned in many ways throughout the city , including a written statement by Mayor Adrian Fenty , which read in part : " I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the founder and namesake of Ben ’ s Chili Bowl , one of the greatest treasures in the District of Columbia . Ben Ali was a man who invested his life in a small business that weathered many storms and became the soul of a neighborhood and the pride of our city . " 
 In 2009 , Ben 's sons , Nizam and Kamal , opened an upscale restaurant and bar , Ben 's Next Door , at 1211 U St , NW , adjacent to the original building . Featuring alcohol ( something not available in Ben 's ) , the restaurant 's goal is to " complement " Ben 's , according to Nizam , who says that the goal is to stay " true to ourselves " . The restaurant offers everything on the Ben 's Chili Bowl menu from 11am to closing , in addition to its own lunch , dinner , and late night menu . 
 = = Menu = = 
 Ben 's menu features the " original chili half @-@ smoke " as its " signature dish " . It is a one @-@ quarter pound half @-@ pork and half @-@ beef smoked sausage on " a warm steamed bun , " topped with mustard , onions and spicy homemade chili sauce . In addition to the pork @-@ beef half @-@ smokes and all pork or all beef hot dogs , the menu also features " healthy choice " items such as turkey burgers and turkey hot dogs ( " turkey dogs " ) , and vegetarian chili , burgers ( " veggie burgers " ) , and hot dogs ( " veggie dogs " ) . Chili ( both the beef variety and the all @-@ vegetarian variety ) is also available in various sizes . In addition to serving food for customers who eat inside or order for take @-@ out , the restaurant ships food nationwide . 
 Today , many of the restaurant 's sausages are produced in Baltimore , Maryland by the Manger Packing Corporation . 
 = = Customers and recognition = = 
 The Boston Globe described Ben 's diverse customers as " punk @-@ looking kids and fashionable business people and everyone in between " . In 2001 , Ben and Virginia 's son , Kamal , commented on the changes of what types of people were eating at the establishment : " You hear comments . Even the white customers . They want to think they 're the only whites who 'd been hip enough to go to the Chili Bowl . Now they look around and there are a lot of other whites and they are not so happy about it . " 
 The most famous regular customer is comedian Bill Cosby , who took his future wife to Ben 's when they were dating . He recalls that he first became a frequent visitor while serving in the Navy and stationed in Bethesda , Maryland in 1958 , and frequently visited the U Street jazz clubs . Cosby recalls that during some of his visits with Camille , who was then a student at the University of Maryland , he would " eat as many as six half @-@ smokes at a time . " Cosby returned to Ben 's in 1985 to hold a press conference in the restaurant to celebrate the success of his television series , The Cosby Show . He continues to stop by Ben 's while in town for servings of half @-@ smokes . A sign posted in the restaurant proclaimed that Bill Cosby is the only person who eats for free at Ben 's Chili Bowl . On November 3 , 2008 , a new sign was posted to add " the Obama family " . 
 Many other celebrities , including Chris Tucker and Bono , have visited over the years . When journalist Ted Koppel stopped hosting news program Nightline , he held his 2005 farewell party at the restaurant . Then @-@ President @-@ elect Barack Obama ate at Ben 's on January 10 , 2009 . 
 The Washington Post asserts , " By the late 1990s , no D.C. politician would dream of running for office without dropping into Ben 's . " Anthony A. Williams appeared at Ben 's immediately after his successful mayoral election . 
 However , celebrities at Ben 's are not limited to American citizens . In 1998 , former DC mayor Marion Barry described having traveled to Ghana and meeting the Mayor of Accra , an alumnus of Howard University , whose greeting was , " Glad to have you in Accra . Is Ben 's Chili Bowl still there ? " And when French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni @-@ Sarkozy visited Washington , D.C. in March 2010 , they reportedly each had two of Ben 's half smokes during their visit to the restaurant . 
 Scenes from films including The Pelican Brief and State of Play have been filmed in the restaurant , and it has been in " dozens of TV shows . " The short film , Breakfast At Ben 's was filmed almost entirely in the restaurant . Additionally , it has been used in novels as the setting for fictional meetings — especially meetings that involve individuals from " different sides of the law " — as it was in George Pelecanos 's King <unk> . 
 Ben and Virginia Ali were inducted into the D.C. Hall of Fame , and in 1999 , the alley adjacent to the restaurant was renamed " Ben Ali Way " . On the occasion of Ben Ali 's 2009 death , D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty released a statement calling the restaurant " one of the greatest treasures in the District of Columbia " .

 After his graduation from the National Tainan First Senior High School , Chai attended the National Taiwan University ( NTU ) studying political science . He later switched his major to law and graduated from the NTU College of Law in 1958 . He was then conscripted and served in the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) Army for sixteen months . 
 In 1960 , Chai went to the United States and studied at the University of Tennessee , where he earned his master 's degree in political science . As a result of participating in the independence movement of Taiwan , Chai was placed on the Kuomintang 's black list and was unable to return to Taiwan . He continued studying and attended the University of Southern California , earning his doctorate in 1969 . In 1986 , Chai became a professor of political science at the City University of New York .

 Chai was one of the three candidates who registered . He was endorsed by vice president Annette Lu and foreign minister Mark Chen . The election was held in January 2006 . Former Secretary @-@ General of the Presidential Office Yu <unk> @-@ kun won with over 54 % of the votes while Chai received 36 % . 
 In 2008 , after the defeat of Frank Hsieh in the presidential election , DPP candidate Hsieh resigned as chairman and announced the date for the chairmanship election . Chai declared his candidacy on April 14 . 
 Although the DPP passed a resolution to ban all factions within the party in 2006 , the dissent between former members of different factions was still present and was thought to be one of the factors that led to DPP 's loss in the presidential election . Chai , along with Koo Kwang @-@ ming emphasized the importance of consolidating the party 's policy on independence , while Tsai Ing @-@ wen focused on the cooperation of former factions and expansion of the party 's support base . 
 Chai was supported by Tainan City mayor Hsu Tain @-@ tsair , but decided to withdraw from the race in May and gave his support to another candidate Koo Kwang @-@ ming . However , it was too late to officially withdraw from the election , and Chai received 5 percent of the votes .

 Flytoget , the Airport Express Train ( Norwegian : Flytoget ) is a Norwegian high @-@ speed airport rail link connecting Oslo Airport , Gardermoen to Oslo Central Station in nineteen minutes . Run by Flytoget AS ( formerly NSB Gardermobanen AS ) , it operates on the high @-@ speed Gardermoen Line using sixteen GMB Class 71 electric trains . Normal service frequency is once every ten minutes , with four of the services each hour continuing westwards beyond Oslo Central . The extended services serve nine stops within Greater Oslo and take up to 60 minutes . 
 Flytoget transported 5 @.@ 4 million passengers in 2007 , a 34 @-@ percent market share of airport ground transport . The service , which has a top speed of 210 kilometres per hour ( 130 mph ) , is the only high @-@ speed rail service in Norway . Construction started in 1994 and high @-@ speed trains began serving Gardermoen Airport from the date of its opening on 8 October 1998 , although full operation using the 14 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 9 @.@ 0 mi ) Romerike Tunnel had to wait another ten and a half months after severe leaks caused by the tunnel 's construction led to the partial depletion of two lakes . 
 Formed in 1992 as a subsidiary of Norwegian State Railways , the company has been owned since 2001 by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry .

 When the Parliament of Norway on 8 October 1992 decided to build a new central airport for Eastern Norway , they also decided that the main mode of ground transport should be by rail . While the previous airport , Oslo Airport , Fornebu , was located just outside the city limits , the new airport , Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , would be located 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) north of the city , outside the reach of existing public transport . The principle of the airport construction was that it was not to be footed by the tax payers ; the entire airport would be built with borrowed money through Oslo Lufthavn AS , a subsidiary of the Norwegian Airport Administration . The same principle was chosen for the airport rail link — the Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) creating the limited company subsidiary NSB Gardermobanen AS , founded on 24 November 1992 , to perform the construction of the line . It would be able to charge train operators using the line , channeling the payments to cover down payments and interest of the debt used to build the railway . Profit margin was estimated to 7 @.@ 5 % . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , is not on the Trunk Line that runs north from Oslo . With heavy traffic and many small stops until Lillestrøm , and continuing north as single track , the Trunk Line would have to be supplemented by a parallel double track from Oslo , with a new route north of Kløfta to Eidsvoll ; the 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) north of the airport allowing trains operating on the Dovre Line to Lillehammer and Trondheim to access the airport . The 64 @-@ kilometre ( 40 mi ) line was named the Gardermo Line . 
 The Gardermo Line was the second attempt to build high @-@ speed rail in Norway , after the 35 @-@ kilometre ( 22 mi ) line from Ski to Moss on the Østfold Line . But no operation speeds exceeding 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) are achieved there due to short distances and limitations to rolling stock , making Gardermobanen the first real high @-@ speed railway line in Norway . Due to the domination of single track in Norway , the opening of the Gardermo Line increased the total length of double track in the kingdom by two @-@ thirds . 
 Construction started in 1994 . An agreement for purchase of sixteen three @-@ car electric multiple units was signed with Adtranz on 23 February 1995 . Parliament decided on 1 October 1996 that the construction company would also operate the new train service . The trains were delivered between 19 September 1997 and 30 January 1998 , costing NOK 1 @.@ 4 billion . 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 The greatest challenge was the need to build the 14 @,@ 580 @-@ metre ( 47 @,@ 830 ft ) Romerike railway tunnel – Norway 's longest – beneath the geologically highly unstable Østmarka area between Etterstad , close to Oslo Central Station , and Lillestrøm . During construction , in 1997 , the water level in some lakes above the tunnel , including Lutvann and Nordre Puttjern , sank dramatically . After the leaks were discovered on 3 February 1997 , sanctions were imposed by the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate requiring the elimination of all leakages . At its worst , the tunnel was leaking 3 @,@ 000 litres ( 660 imp gal ) of water per minute . 
 Rhoca @-@ Gil sealant was used in an attempt to fix the leaks , but failed to work properly . Not only did it not polymerize , and therefore failed to staunch the leaks , but it also poisoned its surroundings with acrylamide . Manual fixing with concrete became necessary ; the fixing and cleaning up of the toxin delayed the building of the tunnel by one year . Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company , Scandinavian Rock Group , with the latter at one instance stopping work for three weeks while the parties quarrelled in court . 
 Reports have shown a lack of inspection and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed – but were never taken seriously – in 1995 . Construction of the tunnel caused damage to around sixty houses and an evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK 500 million was spent on fixing the leaks and claimed that this was to a large extent an unnecessary expenditure which more efficient engineering procedures would have avoided . The report also criticized the administrative planning and organization of the overall construction of the railway . 
 Airport Express Trains began operating as soon as the new airport ( and the Lillestrøm to Gardermoen stretch of the new high @-@ speed line ) opened on 8 October 1998 ; however , for more than ten months they had to use the old <unk> ( Trunk Line ) between Oslo S and Lillestrøm , which restricted their frequency to just two trains per hour . Regular operations at full capacity , using the Romerike Tunnel , did not commence until 22 August 1999 . 
 = = = Reorganization = = = 
 Estimates for the project costs were NOK 4 @.@ 3 billion , ± 20 % , but by completion they had ended at NOK 7 @.@ 7 billion , of which NOK 1 @.@ 3 billion were related to the leakages . The rest of the line had a cost <unk> of NOK 0 @.@ 4 billion . The company had acquired financial costs of NOK 0 @.@ 9 billion , so the company owed NOK 10 @.@ 0 billion by 1999 , including money spent on the new trains . 
 The first steps of organizational restructure were taken 29 June 2000 , when the CEO of NSB , Osmund Ueland , was fired due to several incidents related to the operations of NSB — not just the Gardermo Line . Einar Enger took over as new CEO on 26 February 2001 . 
 The debt in NSB Gardermobanen had become unmanageable , and in April 2000 parliament accepted that it would not be possible to make the Gardermo Line — with the current structure — the profitable venture predicted in 1992 . From 1 January 2001 , the company changed name to Flytoget AS , retaining ownership of the trains and operations and kept as a subsidiary of NSB . The tracks and infrastructure were transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration ( <unk> ) , who owns the rest of the Norwegian railway network . All debt was restored and covered by the state , and a vehicle excise duty was implemented on the Gardermo Line to cover the management and maintenance of the line , to be paid by all users . 
 On 9 December 2002 , parliament decided that Flytoget AS would become a separate railway company from 1 January 2003 , owned directly by the Ministry of Transport and Communications . One year later the ownership was transferred to the Ministry of Trade and Industry as part of a cleanup of political overhaul between the departments . As part of the process , a new CEO , Thomas <unk> , was appointed in June 2002 , and in January 2003 the new Chair , Endre <unk> — who took over the position form NSB 's director Einar Enger . <unk> announced on 6 August 2008 that he would retire from his job before the end of the year . He was replaced by Linda <unk> <unk> on 10 November 2008 . On 30 August 2009 , two of three services to Asker were extended to Drammen . This followed upgrades to the Drammen Line , including the Lieråsen Tunnel , and a new parking lot at Drammen Station , in total costing NOK 20 million . 
 = = Operations = = 
 Departures operate every ten minutes from Oslo Central Station ( Oslo S ) to the airport - i.e. six trains pr. hour . Half of the trains originate in Drammen , making five intermediate stops before Oslo S , and again at Lillestrøm . Two start from Oslo S and go directly to Gardermoen without intermediate stops . One starts from Stabekk and calls at Lysaker , Skøyen , <unk> and Oslo S. On Saturdays , Sunday mornings and in most of July , Flytoget does not operate the direct trains from Oslo S or Stabekk — only the 20 @-@ minute headway all @-@ stop trains . While the services northeast from Oslo S to the airport use the high @-@ speed Gardermo Line , those westwards towards Asker use the Drammen Line built in 1870 – 72 and the Asker Line ; so while the 48 kilometres ( 30 mi ) from Oslo S to the airport can be done in 19 minutes , the 24 kilometres ( 15 mi ) from Asker to Oslo S takes 26 minutes . The latter does however include stops at five stations : Nationaltheatret , Skøyen , Lysaker , Sandvika and Asker . 
 Competition is offered from other means of ground transport and by NSB who operate trains from Oslo to the airport . This includes one hourly departure with line 450 of the Oslo Commuter Rail north to Eidsvoll and south to Oslo , Drammen and Kongsberg ; one regional train hourly north to Hamar and Lillehammer and south to Vestfold ; and four daily express trains to Trondheim calling Oslo Airport Station , including one night train ( although the express trains to Trondheim do not accept passengers only travelling between Oslo and Gardermoen ) . 
 The price of a ticket to Oslo is NOK 180 , though higher if departing from Sandvika , Asker and Drammen . Reduced fares with 50 % discount are offered to senior citizens , children , youth under 21 years , students , benefit recipients and military personnel . Flytoget tickets are not valid on NSB trains , and vice versa . NSB tickets are generally cheaper , though not for some groups with reduced fare ; for instance students are granted a greater discount with Flytoget than with NSB . Ticket can either be bought at vending machines or as e @-@ tickets ; there is no seat reservation . 
 Flytoget transported 5 @.@ 4 million passengers in 2007 , a 34 % market share of airport ground transport . Flytoget boasts a high service quality , with 96 % of departures arriving within 3 minutes of schedule and only 0 @.@ 4 % of departures canceled . Part of this is due to the airport express trains receiving priority over other trains in the limited capacity around Oslo . Flytoget was announced to have the most satisfied , and the fourth most loyal customers of all Norwegian companies in 2008 , by the customer satisfaction survey conducted by the Norwegian School of Management . The same year Flytoget was declared the best place of work in Norway by Great Place to Work . During the 2007 recruitment half of the newly educated train divers chose Flytoget over NSB , mostly due to higher wages .

 = = = Incidents = = = 
 Several deaths have taken place on the route , but only one due to an accident . In 1999 , an employee of the National Rail Administration was killed by a train because it was operating at 160 kilometres per hour ( 99 mph ) instead of the temporarily reduced limit of 80 kilometres per hour ( 50 mph ) ; Flytoget was fined for not informing the engineer of the speed limit reduction . Several other deaths on the line have been classified as suicides , and so are not in the accident statistics ; they do however cause delays on all services for hours after the incident takes place . 
 In 2000 – 01 , Flytoget experienced three derailments with empty trains at Gardermoen ; one caused by the engineer falling asleep and two by the train passing a red light . No more such accidents occurred after automatic Train Control was installed in 2001 . 
 Delays have been experienced many times by travelers due to technical problems on the infrastructure . In particular the old line west of Oslo causes much delay , and the National Rail Administration performed during 2008 a NOK 100 million upgrade to the Oslo Tunnel to ensure better performance . But problems also incur on the new sections , regularly delaying service or capacity , and forcing Flytoget to operate fewer departures .

 <unk> has been a problem since the start ; even the Chief of Police in Oslo has been picked on the train . The train has also been the target of sabotage , and embezzlement for NOK 1 million by an employed ticket salesman , who found a way to print two tickets with the system only charging for one , by turning off and on the ticket printer . 
 When Al Gore came to Oslo to receive his Nobel Peace Prize on 7 December 2007 , he used the Airport Express Train to make his journey as environmentally friendly as possible . The company has initiated a program to ensure better diet for the employees ; this had made several lose weight and has reduced the level of sick leave from 12 to 8 % . In 2005 – 07 , a program to reduce the energy use of the trains through smarter operation reduced energy consumption by 15 % .

 The company operates sixteen Class 71 three @-@ car electric multiple units delivered in 1997 – 98 , and built domestically by Adtranz at Strømmen based on carbodies built in Adtranz factory in Kalmar . They are based on the Swedish X2 operated by SJ in their X 2000 intercity service , and developed by Kalmar Verkstad during the 1980s . The Class 71 are nearly identical to the NSB Class 73 , save the 71 @-@ series lacking one car and tilting mechanism , and a different interior . Both have chosen to not use the original locomotive design , instead installing one powered bogie in each car . The 71 @-@ series is built for a maximum operating speed of 210 kilometres per hour ( 130 mph ) , but has achieved higher speeds in test runs . 
 Among the features are pressure @-@ tight cabins to allow comfortable travel through tunnels at high speeds , and step @-@ free access to the cars . Instead , steps are inside the trains ; this has been criticized to be in non @-@ conformance with public accessibility policy . The multiple units can only operate in fixed sets of three cars , but up to three sets can be run in multiple . Flytoget regularly uses double sets to create six @-@ car trains . In 2008 – 09 , all units will be refit with an additional middle car by Bombardier Transportation , increasing capacity by 40 % to 244 seats . 
 Unlike the Class 71 , the sister trains in service with NSB were prone to trouble , having to operate on hundred @-@ year @-@ old infrastructure on cross @-@ mountain services ; the Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure . The only incident to ground all the <unk> trains occurred on the 17 June 2000 at Nelaug when a Class 73 train operated by NSB derailed because of stress on the axle . Unlike the NSB trains , the airport express trains were back in service the next day , while the 73 @-@ series had to wait another month . On 24 January 2004 a unit had to be taken out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing — within days the bearings were replaced on all units .

 = Long @-@ billed thrasher = 
 The long @-@ billed thrasher ( Toxostoma longirostre ) is a medium @-@ sized resident songbird of South Texas and eastern Mexico . It bears a strong resemblance to its close relative the brown thrasher in appearance , calls , and various other behaviors ; however , the two species do not overlap in range except in the winter when the brown thrasher will temporarily reside in the northern range of the long @-@ billed . 
 The bird is a large sized mimid that is not especially wary , but it will take precautionary measures to prevent itself from being potential prey . Like other thrashers , it is named after its sweeping methods when searching for food , not for thrashing predators , although they are aggressive defenders of their territories . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The specific name longirostre is derived from the Latin words longus long and rostrum bill . 
 There are two subspecies of the long @-@ billed thrasher . T. longirostre longirostre was first described in scientific literature by Frédéric de <unk> in 1838 as Orpheus longirostris , while T. longirostre sennitti was described by Robert Ridgway a half @-@ century later . 
 T. c. sennitti ( Ridgway , 1888 ) Sennett 's thrasher . Range extends from southern ( particularly south central ) Texas to the Rio Grande Valley and the Mexican states of Tamaulipas and San Luis Potosi . 
 T. c. longirostre ( <unk> , 1838 ) . Range is in eastern Mexico , within the states of Querétaro , Tamaulipas and Veracruz southward to Puebla . 
 Along with the brown thrasher and Cozumel thrasher , the three are part of a superspecies rufum clade . Plumage patterns and bill shapes were originally used for grouping , and the birds also were shown as closely related with genetic studies . 
 = = Description = = 
 This bird is slender and long @-@ tailed , averaging 26 @.@ 5 – 29 cm ( 10 @.@ 5 – 11 @.@ 5 in ) in length and about 70 g ( 2 @.@ 5 oz ) in weight . It is also a large sized thrasher that is close in size to the American robin . 
 T. c. sennitti is described with a grayish @-@ brown crown with a rufous color appearing in the back , rump , rear , and shoulder . Broad white tips located on the greater and lesser primary coverts and <unk> @-@ brown with rufous brown edges on the primary and secondary coverts gives the closed wings an appearance wing with rufous colorings . The chin , throat , chest , and belly can appear to be white or a pale @-@ buffy white , although the chest and belly contain keenly blackish oval shapes . The underwing is buffy @-@ white . The iris is typically either orange or orange @-@ yellow , with a dull brown bill with its base of the lower mandible appear to be pinkish grey . T. c. curvirostre is similar with an exception to being smaller , darker , and have a red @-@ tinged appearance with buffy @-@ white underparts . 
 Juveniles have dusty streak marks on its rump , with buffy @-@ white undertail coverts . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 This thrasher shares a striking resemblance with the brown thrasher . However , there are a number of differences . Its face is more gray in contrast to the reddish appearance of the thrasher . The underparts are whiter , less buffy , and more robustly colored , an eye that appears more orange and beady , and generally a longer @-@ bill that is blacker and stands apart from the face . The long @-@ billed 's overall appearance has more contrasts in its pattern in comparison to the thrasher . 
 The sage thrasher , which shares some its distribution with the long @-@ billed , is smaller , grayer , and its rectrices are of a more distinguished white color . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 This species is a resident in southern Texas north to San Antonio and <unk> , south through north @-@ western Mexico to central Veracruz , east to eastern Coahuila , San Luis Potosi and Hildalgo . The breeding density is at the highest among the Rio Grande Valley . Although it was a resident in the lower Rio Grande Valley , a significant amount of the its habitat was destroyed for agricultural purposes , and its population decreased from the 1930s to the 1970s . Some human activity that has introduced former grassland areas is thought to some help the species , and still is a common resident in its range . Climate change has been suggested for some of its expansion In Texas as well , as there was some evidence of a northern and eastern migration of counties over a five decade span ( 1957 @-@ 2007 ) . With the exception of vagrants found in New Mexico and Colorado , the species is a permanent resident of its range . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Long @-@ billed thrashers usually stay hidden on or near the ground , though it may sing from conspicuous perches . Whenever it searches for insects on the ground , it will energetically turn over ( " thrashing " ) leaves and other litter . It also can be spotted singing on exposed perches above its thornbush fortresses . Males generally are spotted singing from March until the mid @-@ summer , excluding instances of singing song snatches periodically to balance the year . It is generally not wary , possibly because is not easily approached . The flights of the long @-@ billed are generally close to the ground , short , erratic with exaggerated fluctuations . Long @-@ billed thrashers are staunch defenders of their territories ; it will defend its nest ferociously , including against humans . 
 The longest recorded lifespan of the species was one individual recovered on 30 September 1965 , at age 7 years and 3 months , after being banded ( on 24 Aug 1959 ) in Alamo , TX . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The song is warbling and resembles other thrashers ' songs but is especially rich and musical , though occasionally scratchy . Phrases are often repeated two to four times . A distinctive call is a " loud , rich whistle <unk> " or " mellow , whistled <unk> or <unk> " ; other calls include " a loud sharp chak " and " a very rapid , sharp rattle <unk> " , and <unk> and <unk> sounds during territorial disputes that resemble calls of its close relative the brown thrasher . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The general nesting habitat of long @-@ billed thrashers is amongst dense vegetation with spiny shrubs and trees in order to make the nest inaccessible to potential predators . Nests have also been found in plants such as willows , mesquite , <unk> , cacti , or yucca . 
 The nest is a bulky cup placed in thick low or mid @-@ height vegetation and made of materials such as twigs , straws , and grasses . The female lays 2 to 5 eggs described as bluish @-@ white with dense reddish @-@ brown and gray speckles ; the appearance is indistinguishable from the brown thrasher . Most of the egg laying for the long @-@ billed in Texas occurs in April and May , and May and June in Mexico , though dates have been as late as June and July , respectively . The eggs hatch over a period of 24 days . Unlike most thrashers , however , the hatching process is synchronous . Both parents are responsible for incubation , which lasts 13 or 14 days as well as feeding the fledglings . They are rarely victims of brood parasitism by the brown @-@ headed cowbird or bronzed cowbird . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 In order to locate food , it forages on the ground by rapidly sweeping its bill from side to side tossing leaf @-@ litter upwards and behind itself , then goes to scratching the ground for food . Their diet consists of invertebrates such as grasshoppers , beetles , and other insects , crustaceans , gastropods , and an adequate amount of vegetable matter , especially berries . 
 = Ceredigion = 
 Ceredigion ( / <unk> / ; Welsh pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is a county in Mid Wales . The county was created as Cardiganshire ( Welsh : Sir <unk> ) in 1282 in the area of the former Kingdom of Ceredigion . The historic county was abolished in 1974 and reconstituted in 1996 as Ceredigion . The county had a population of 75 @,@ 900 at the 2011 UK census . Aberystwyth , which is the largest town , is one of the two administrative centres ; the other being Aberaeron . Aberystwyth houses Aberystwyth University , <unk> Hospital and the National Library of Wales . The inland town of Lampeter houses part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David . 
 The county is mainly rural with large parts being hilly or mountainous land . There is level , low @-@ lying land on the coastal strip that runs along the margins of Cardigan Bay . There are a number of sandy beaches popular with visitors here , linked by the long @-@ distance Ceredigion Coast Path . More than half the population speak the Welsh language and the county is considered a centre of Welsh culture . 
 At one time , Ceredigion had more industry than it does today . Lead , silver and zinc were mined here , and many of the sailing ships trading round the coast of Wales were built here . However these industries dwindled over time , and the economy became almost completely dependent on dairying and the rearing of livestock , which were sent to the English market . During the last century , livestock farming has become less profitable , and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people emigrated to more prosperous parts of Wales and to countries abroad . More recently , the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement , and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income . 
 = = History = = 
 Cardiganshire has been inhabited since prehistoric times ; 170 hill forts and enclosures have been identified across the county and there are many standing stones dating back to the Bronze Age . In pre @-@ Roman , and possibly Roman times , a part of southern Cardiganshire was in the territory of the Demetae and possibly part of that of the Ordovices . According to Nennius , a 10th @-@ century Welsh chronicler , <unk> , son of the Welsh invader Cunedda , settled in the area in the 5th century . It remained a kingdom ruled by his descendants until it expanded and changed its name , first to Seisyllwg in the late 7th century and , after the union of Seisyllwg with the Kingdom of Dyfed , it was incorporated into Deheubarth in the mid 10th century . 
 Many pilgrims passed through Cardiganshire on their way to St Davids . Some came by sea and made use of the churches at <unk> and <unk> , while others came by land seeking hospitality at such places as Strata Florida Abbey . Both the abbey and <unk> Fawr were important monastic sites of scholarship and education . Place names including <unk> denote their association with pilgrims . 
 In 1282 , Edward I of England conquered the principality of Wales and divided the area into counties . The name Cardiganshire was an Anglicisation of the name for the historic kingdom of Ceredigion . One of thirteen traditional counties in Wales , Cardiganshire was also a vice @-@ county . Cardiganshire was split into the five hundreds ( administrative area ) of <unk> 'r @-@ Glyn , <unk> , <unk> , Penarth and <unk> . In the 18th century there was an evangelical revival of Christianity , and non @-@ conformism became established in the county as charismatic preachers like Daniel Rowland of <unk> attracted large congregations . Every community built its own chapel or meeting house , and Cardiganshire became one of the centres of Methodism in Wales with the Aeron Valley being at the centre of the revival . 
 At this time Cardiganshire was largely cut off from the rest of Wales by poor communications , and the Industrial Revolution largely passed it by . In the uplands , wheeled vehicles were rare in the 18th century , and horses and sleds were still being used for transport . On the coast , trade in herrings and corn took place across the Irish Sea . In the 19th century , many of the rural poor emigrated to the New World from Cardigan , between five and six thousand leaving the town between 1790 and 1860 . Aberystwyth became the main centre for the export of lead and Aberaeron and Newquay did brisk coastal trade . The building of the railway from Shrewsbury in the 1860s encouraged visitors and hotels sprang up in the town to accommodate them . 
 This area of the county of Dyfed became a district of Wales under the name Ceredigion in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 , and since 1996 , has formed the county of Ceredigion . According to the 2001 census , Ceredigion has the fourth highest proportion of Welsh speakers in the population at 61 % ; only Gwynedd , the Isle of Anglesey and Carmarthenshire have a higher proportion . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Ceredigion is a coastal county , bordered by Cardigan Bay to the west , Gwynedd to the north , Powys to the east , Carmarthenshire to the south and Pembrokeshire to the south @-@ west . Its area is 1 @,@ 795 square kilometres ( 693 sq mi ) . In 2010 the population was 76 @,@ 938 , making it the second most sparsely populated county in Wales . 
 The main settlements are Aberaeron , Aberporth , Aberystwyth , Borth , Cardigan , Lampeter , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Llandysul , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , New Quay , and Tregaron . The largest of these are Aberystwyth and Cardigan . 
 The Cambrian Mountains cover much of the east of the county ; this large area forms part of the desert of Wales . In the south and west , the surface is less elevated . The highest point is Pumlumon at 2 @,@ 467 feet ( 752 m ) , other Marilyns include Pen y Garn and Llan Ddu Fawr . On the slopes of Pumlumon five rivers have their sources : the Severn , the Wye , the Dulas , the <unk> and the Rheidol , the last of which meets the Afon <unk> in a 300 feet ( 91 m ) plunge at the Devil 's Bridge chasm . The largest river is the River Teifi which forms the border with Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire for part of its length . The towns of Lampeter , Llandysul , Newcastle Emlyn and Cardigan are all in the Teifi Valley , and each has communities on each side of the river , in different counties . Other significant rivers include the River Aeron which has its estuary at Aberaeron , and the River Ystwyth and the River Rheidol both of which reach the sea in Aberystwyth harbour . 
 Ceredigion 's 50 miles ( 80 km ) of coastline has sandy beaches . In 2011 Ceredigion 's beaches were awarded five Blue Flag Awards , four Green Coast Awards , and fourteen Seaside Awards . Ceredigion is one of only two places in the United Kingdom with a permanent presence of bottlenose dolphins . Another member of the fauna is the red kite ; these may be seen in various localities in the county , but at the Red Kite Feeding Centre near Tregaron , they are fed each day , and large numbers congregate along with hungry crows and other birds . 
 Ceredigion had the largest population growth of any county in Wales , with a 19 @.@ 5 % increase from 1991 to 2003 . Tourism and agriculture , chiefly hill farming , are the most important industries . In addition , two universities are within the county boundaries : Aberystwyth University and the Lampeter campus of the University of Wales , Trinity Saint David . The Welsh Plant Breeding Station is near Aberystwyth and linked to the University . The National Library of Wales , founded in 1907 , is also in Aberystwyth . Ceredigion is an extremely rural county ; the largest town , Aberystwyth , has fewer than 15 @,@ 000 permanent residents and the remainder of the population of the county is scattered over 150 small towns , villages and hamlets . 
 The county has no large commercial areas . The nearest substantial settlements are located at least 1 hour 45 minutes drive away . Approximate road distances from Ceredigion 's largest town , Aberystwyth , are : Swansea , 75 miles ( 121 km ) to the south ; Shrewsbury , 76 miles ( 122 km ) to the east , in the English county of Shropshire ; and Wrexham , 82 miles ( 132 km ) to the northeast . The capital , Cardiff , is over 100 miles ( 160 km ) from most parts of the county . Although Ceredigion and Gwynedd share a boundary , it is not possible to travel directly between the two by land as all road and rail links avoid the Dyfi estuary and pass through Dyfi Junction or Machynlleth in Powys . 
 Dylan Thomas lived in New Quay and <unk> and frequented Aberaeron and Lampeter . The Dylan Thomas Trail runs through part of the county , linking the places associated with the poet . The Ceredigion Coast Path is a long @-@ distance footpath following the coastline from Cardigan to <unk> , a distance of about 60 miles ( 97 km ) . It can conveniently be divided into seven sections and has some spectacular scenery . 
 = = Local government = = 
 Between 1888 and 1974 , the county was governed by Cardiganshire County Council , which took over the functions of county administration from the Quarter Sessions court in 1889 . The county was abolished in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 — and it was succeeded by the district of Ceredigion in the new county of Dyfed . This district became a unitary authority on 1 April 1996 under the name of Cardiganshire ; to change its name back to Ceredigion the following day . It has , apart from minor realignments , identical borders to the former county . 
 A referendum was held on 20 May 2004 on whether to have a directly elected mayor for the county , the first in Wales . The <unk> Ceredigion political initiative had been formed with this aim but the proposal was rejected . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Farming has traditionally been the basis of Cardiganshire 's economy , with dairying and stock @-@ rearing being the main occupations . Before the first railway was built in 1866 , the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England , where Rugby , Northampton and London were important destinations . At one time there was a sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire , but the reserves of lead , silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by the early part of the twentieth century . Shipping was also important in the county , with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels , and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported . Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales ' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire . 
 Cardiganshire had a substantial population in the early modern period but this declined during the nineteenth century as wider social and economic developments affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life . Traditional industries were in decline , agriculture was in decline and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still @-@ rising population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities . By the first half of the twentieth century , falling livestock prices and greater world competition made farming unprofitable and many residents of Cardiganshire moved to other parts of South Wales , where there were better employment opportunities , and many more emigrated to the United States , Canada , Patagonia and Australia . Another factor was that the owners of the great landed estates , who had for so long dominated the politics of the county , were in many cases heavily in debt . This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the running of the county , a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the Cardiganshire County Council in 1889 . 
 By the second half of the twentieth century , the declining population trend had gone into reverse . Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings , and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s , the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis , and started to react . Through government initiatives and local actions , opportunities in tourism , rural crafts , specialist food shops , farmers ' markets and added @-@ value food products began to emerge . However , in 2011 , at 3 @.@ 1 % , Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture , forestry and fishing , close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland . Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy ; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil 's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58 @,@ 500 kW . 
 Farm incomes have been in decline over the years and , as well as being a European Objective I area , in 2001 Ceredigion was designated a regional " Tourist growth area " by the Wales Tourist Board . There is little industry other than farming , so tourism plays an important part in the county 's economy . Visitors stay in hotels , guest houses and homes offering bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast , self @-@ catering cottages , caravans and camp sites , spending money in local shops , dine in local establishments and visit the county 's many attractions . Ceredigion prides itself on offering an unspoilt natural landscape , and Aberystwyth lays claim to being the capital of Welsh culture . 
 = = Sport and leisure = = 
 The main football team in the county is Aberystwyth Town F.C. which plays in the Welsh Premier League , its home matches being at the Park Avenue ground in the town . It has yet to come higher than third in the League but won the Welsh Cup in 1899 / 1900 and the Welsh Amateur Cup in 1930 / 31 , 1932 / 33 and 1969 / 70 . Cardigan Town Football Club , also known as the " Magpies " , play in Division 1 of the Ceredigion League which they won in 1968 / 69 , 1995 / 96 , 1999 / 2000 , 2000 / 01 and 2002 / 03 . 
 Leisure activities available in the county include beach activities , rambling , cycling , sea fishing , canoeing , sailing and horse riding . Many of the towns and villages along the coast have small harbours and facilities for sailing , dolphin watching and other maritime activities . The River Teifi is a renowned salmon fishing river and also has a series of rapids near Llandysul where canoeing , kayaking and white water rafting take place . 
 The county is rich in archaeological remains such as forts , earthworks and standing stones . Historic sites that can be accessed include Aberystwyth Castle and Cardigan Castle , as well as Strata Florida Abbey . 
 Other visitor attractions include the <unk> Mines , Devil 's Bridge , the Bwlch Nant yr Arian Forest Visitor Centre , Elvis Rock , <unk> Caron ( Tregaron bog ) , the Vale of Rheidol Railway , Aberystwyth Cliff Railway . 
 The National Library of Wales is at Aberystwyth and there is information on local history at the Ceredigion Museum , also in Aberystwyth . There is also the technical museum Internal Fire – Museum of Power , which is at Tan @-@ y @-@ <unk> near the coast road . Stately homes in the county open to the public include the Hafod Estate and <unk> . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The Cambrian Line provides mainline railway services between Aberystwyth and Shrewsbury , where passengers can join services for London and elsewhere . Passengers can change at Dovey Junction railway station for trains to Pwllheli . There are no motorways in Ceredigion . The A487 coast road links Cardigan with Aberystwyth , passing close to Newquay and through Aberaeron , and the <unk> goes eastwards from Aberystwyth to Rhayader , Leominster and Worcester . There are local bus services between the main centres of population , and long distance services between Aberystwyth and Cardiff . A bus service known as " <unk> " operates in the south of the county offering customised transport for rural dwellers . 
 There are no commercial airports but the West Wales Airport near the village of Aberporth is licensed for the deployment of civil and military unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) s and is used for flying and testing these drones . There are no ports or ferry termini in the county but several of the coastal towns have facilities for yachts and small craft . 
 = Connotations ( Copland ) = 
 Connotations is a classical music composition for symphony orchestra written by American composer Aaron Copland . Commissioned by Leonard Bernstein in 1962 to commemorate the opening of Philharmonic Hall ( now David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts ) in New York City , United States , this piece marks a departure from Copland 's populist period , which began with El Salón México in 1936 and includes the works he is most famous for such as Appalachian Spring , Lincoln Portrait and Rodeo . It represents a return to a more dissonant style of composition in which Copland wrote from the end of his studies with French pedagogue Nadia Boulanger and return from Europe in 1924 until the Great Depression . It was also Copland 's first dodecaphonic work for orchestra , a style he had disparaged until he heard the music of French composer Pierre Boulez and adapted the method for himself in his Piano Quartet of 1950 . While the composer had produced other orchestral works contemporary to Connotations , it was his first purely symphonic work since his Third Symphony , written in 1947 . 
 Connotations was received negatively upon its premiere for its harmonic assertiveness and compositional style . The overall impression at the time was that , as critic Alex Ross later phrased it , " Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood . " The composer was accused by some critics of betraying his role as a tonal , populist composer to curry favor with younger composers and give the impression that his music still held contemporary relevance . Copland denied this accusation ; he asserted that he had written Connotations as a twelve @-@ tone work to give himself compositional options not available had he written it as a tonal one . 
 Part of the blame for Connotations ' initial failure has been ascribed by Copland biographer Howard Pollack , among others , to Bernstein 's " harsh and overblown " conducting . Bernstein , known in the classical music community as a long @-@ time champion of Copland 's music , had programmed the composer 's pieces more frequently with the New York Philharmonic than those of any other living composer . However , these performances were mainly of works from the composer 's populist period , with which the conductor was in full sympathy . He was less comfortable in pieces that were atonal or rhythmically disjunctive . While Bernstein might have performed the work purely out of service to an old friend , he was apparently unable to interpret this work persuasively . Subsequent performances with New York Philharmonic during its 1963 European tour and a 1999 all @-@ Copland concert showed that the situation had not changed . Bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work 's lack of success at its premiere . 
 More recent performances , led by conductors Pierre Boulez , Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling , have been acknowledged to show the music in a more positive light . Nevertheless , the overall reputation of the music remains mixed . Some critics , including composer John Adams , have remained critical of the work and considered Copland 's use of serial techniques detrimental to his later music . Others , which include critics Michael Andrews and Peter Davis , have seen Connotations as proof of Copland 's continued growth and inventiveness as a composer while not downplaying the work 's melodic and harmonic harshness and potential difficulty overall for listeners . 
 = = Background = = 
 Aaron Copland wrote Connotations to fulfill a commission from Leonard Bernstein for the opening concert of the New York Philharmonic 's new home in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts . Since this hall was slated as the first part of Lincoln Center for completion , its inauguration was considered especially momentous . Among the guest list of 2600 for the first concert and the white @-@ tie gala which would follow it were John D. Rockefeller III ( chairman of Lincoln Center ) , Secretary of State Dean Rusk , Governor and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller , United Nations Secretary General U Thant and prominent figures in the arts that included of Metropolitan Opera General Manager Rudolf Bing , violinist Isaac Stern and actress Merle Oberon . Noted composers would also attend included Samuel Barber , Henry Cowell , Roy Harris , Walter Piston , Richard Rodgers , William Schuman and Roger Sessions . United States President John F. Kennedy and his wife Jackie had also been invited . Their initial inability to attend caused some consternation , since they had voiced their support for American culture . At the last minute , Jackie Kennedy said she would be there . 
 Copland was one of ten internationally @-@ known composers who accepted invitations to contribute music for the opening . His would be the first new piece to be heard . Other compositions included the Eighth Symphony of American composer William Schuman , an Overture <unk> by French composer Darius Milhaud and " Andromache 's Farewell " for soprano and orchestra by American composer Samuel Barber . It would also be Copland 's first purely symphonic piece since his Third Symphony of 1947 , although he had penned orchestral works in a number of genres throughout the 1940s and 50s . According to Taruskin , Copland 's receipt of such a commission testified to both his status as a creative figure and his close relationship with the American public . This position was unique among " serious " American composers and derived from the populist works he had written in the 1930s and 40s . However , from the 1950s Copland 's public works — the ones for which he had developed his populist style — were increasingly written in what he called his " difficult " or " private " style . That style had become increasing non @-@ tonal . 
 Copland began sketching the work early in 1961 . To gain composing time , he cancelled his 1962 trip to Tanglewood and determined to stay at home the entire year . Even so , he accepted an invitation to revisit Japan early in 1962 for a United States State Department conference and combined the trip with conducting engagements in Seattle and Vancouver . By June 25 , Copland wrote to Mexican composer Cesar Chavez , " I am working day and night on my symphony for the Philharmonic commission . It is in three movements and I have just finished the last , the first being more than half done . " Copland then went to Mexico at Chavez 's invitation , partly to conduct but mainly to compose . From there , he wrote American composer Leo Smit on July 4 that he was not yet finished and was having trouble finding a title for the new work . He completed the piece in September 1962 , just in time for orchestra rehearsals . 
 When he considered the form the work would take , Copland wrote that he " concluded that the classical masters would undoubtedly provide the festive and dedicatory tone appropriate to such an occasion . " He therefore decided to offer " a contemporary note , " one that would reflect " the tensions , aspirations and drama inherent in the world today . " This tension , he explained in 1975 , " is inherent in the nature of the chordal structures , and in the general character of the piece . "

 A typical performance of this work lasts 20 minutes . 
 Connotations is twelve @-@ tone , a style of composition which is among the first introduced , and certainly most well known , forms of musical Serialism . Through this technique , Copland wrote that he felt he could express " something of the tensions , aspirations and drama " of that time . The overall structure " comes closest to a free treatment of the baroque form of the chaconne , " the composer wrote , with a succession of variations " based on the opening chords and their implied melodic intervals . " These variations alternate fast and slow sections much in the way Copland had done with his Piano Variations of 1930 , which creates a complex structure overall . This structure , based on a straightforward <unk> arch form , is reminiscent of Copland 's <unk> for strings , composed in 1960 . Copland biographer Howard Pollack calls the A sections " prophetic , tragic , " the B sections " jazzy , <unk> [ sic ] " and the C section " pastoral , reflective . " While these are all moods long familiar to listeners of Copland 's music , Pollack asserts , " a new darkness hangs over the whole . The outer sections are grave ; the jazzy sections rather cheerless ; the pastoral contrast more weary than peaceful . The music often seems lost , uncertain , trapped . " The piece ends in a series of strict 12 @-@ note chords that Copland called " aggregates . " 
 = = = Significance of title = = = 
 Both Chavez and American composer David Diamond were confused initially about what musical form Connotations would take . The work 's title seemed to give no clear indication , they said , and Chavez told Copland that he found Connotations too abstract . Copland explained to both men and later wrote that , in selecting the title , he took the dictionary meaning of the word " connote " to imply or signify meanings in addition to the primary one as an impetus for musical exploration . The entire composition was derived from the " three harsh chords " with which it begins . Each of these chords contained four notes of the twelve @-@ note row upon which the work was based . " When spelled out horizontally , " the composer later wrote , they supplied him " with various versions of a more lyrical discourse . " This " skeletal frame of the row , " he told Diamond and Chavez , was the " primary meaning " and as such denoted the area which would be explored in the course of the piece . " The subsequent treatment , " he explained , " seeks out other implications — connotations that come in a flash or connotations that the composer himself may gradually uncover . " From there , the listener was " free to discover his or her own connotative meanings , including perhaps some not suspected by the author . 
 = = = Resemblance to other Copland works = = = 
 In the second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians , Pollack labels Connotations as one of three orchestral works that Copland said was written in " the grand manner , " quoting the composer 's words about his Third Symphony . The other two works in this category were the Symphonic Ode and the Third Symphony . Pollack elaborates in his biography of the composer about the similarity of Connotations to the Ode in its overall length , single @-@ movement form , solemn tone and " hard @-@ edged " orchestration . Copland writes of the earlier two works of his intent to write " something different , " " grand and dramatic , " " a serious statement . " He also calls those works transitional pieces and anomalies that stand between different compositional styles of his oeuvre . All three works would prove , as musicologist William W. Austin notes and Pollack states about the symphony , " challenging to grasp . "

 The premiere , on September 23 , 1962 , " sent shock waves through the world of music , " according to Alexander J. Morin , with a reaction by the initial audience , according to Taruskin , of near @-@ silence and incomprehension . Copland noted that the general impression " was that the premiere was not a congenial circumstance , " with the music not considered important as the sound of the new concert hall . His effort to present something not bland or traditional for such an occasion and distinguished audience " was not appreciated at the time . " Also , Taruskin states , Copland had become an emblem of success in the eyes of the American public . The fact he had written a twelve @-@ tone composition for such an occasion seemed a repudiation of the audience he had won through years of hard effort . 
 = = = Public = = = 
 The overall impression , as critic Alex Ross writes in his book The Rest is Noise , was that " Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood ; some sudden rage welled up in him , some urge to confront the gala Lincoln Center audience with an old whiff of revolutionary mystique . " Copland himself remembers , " The <unk> harmonies of my score ... upset a good many people , especially those who were expecting another Appalachian Spring . " Jacqueline Kennedy was left unable to say anything other than " Oh , Mr. Copland " when taken backstage during intermission to meet with the composer . When Copland later asked Verna Fine , wife of American composer Irving Fine , what this meant , Fine answered , " Oh , Aaron , it 's obvious . She hated your piece ! " In Variety , Robert J. Landry called Connotations " an assault on [ the audience 's ] nervous systems " and added , " Seldom has this reviewer heard such outspoken comment in the lobbies after such dull response . It is strictly accurate to declare that an audience paying $ 100 a seat and in mood for self @-@ congratulation and schmaltz hated Copland 's reminder of the ugly realities of industrialization , inflation and cold war — which his music seems to be talking about . " 
 A minority of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations was the right music for its time and place . Composer Arthur Berger states , " I think [ Copland ] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write because he wanted to make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York — it wasn 't going to be a temple of easy listening , as it were , but a place for serious music @-@ making . " Minna Lederman Daniel , a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine , told Copland , " I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion — indeed the only one properly related to them . It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building — big , spacious , clear , long @-@ lined , and it sounds very like you ... To those familiar with your music , the characteristic , identifying moods are perfectly apparent . The special Copland eloquence is there . "

 A few critics were positive . Louis Biancolli wrote in The New York Telegram that the work was " a turning point in [ Copland 's ] career , a powerful score in 12 @-@ tone style that has liberated new stores of creative energy . " John <unk> write for the New York Herald Tribune that while the new piece was " a difficult work and like most music difficult to understand at one hearing ... this piece has flesh where others have only skin , and there was a good deal of arresting lyricism . " Others , however , dismissed Connotations : Everett Helm thought it " unnecessarily strident , " Harriet Johnson " too long for its content " and Richard Franko Johnson " completely without charm . "

 The concert was telecast live by the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) to an audience of 26 million viewers . As part of its program , NBC asked Copland to talk to the television audience about Connotations . While the cameras alternated between shots of the composer and the manuscript score , Copland said , " It seems to me that there are two things you can do when listening to any new work . The most important thing is to lend yourself — or to put it another way — try to be as sensitive as you can to the overall feeling the new piece gives off . The second way is to listen with some awareness of the general shape of the new piece , realizing that a composer works with his musical materials just as an architect works with his building materials in order to construct an edifice that makes sense . " He then discussed the work briefly but in some detail . 
 To Copland 's surprise , his lecture was taken as an apologia , not an explanation , by the majority of the television audience . Moreover , vehement letters poured into NBC after the broadcast from across the United States . One read , " If last night is any criterion of what can be expected in Lincoln Center , it should be called ' Center of Jungle Culture . ' " Another read , " Dear Mr. Copland , Shame Shame Shame ! " 
 = = = European tour and first recording = = = 
 Bernstein conducted Connotations again during the first week of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour that February . Despite the composer 's claim in Copland Since 1943 that " The European premiere was more successful than the New York reception , " reviews about Connotations remained mainly negative ; comments abounded about " mere din " and " dodecaphonic deserts . " When the London audience gave the work a lengthy ovation , Bernstein responded that he would conduct another Copland work as an encore . When cries of " Oh , oh " ensued , he added , " But this will be in a different style . " He then conducted " Hoe @-@ Down " from the ballet Rodeo . 
 A release of the New York performance by Columbia Records fared no better . Robert Marsh found the music " dreary " and " dull . " Irving Kolodin called it " rather relentlessly grim . " Everett Helm , who had been able to hear the work live before he sampled the recording , wrote , " Connotations for Orchestra sounded rather strident on September 23 ; on the disc it becomes ear @-@ piercing . " Bernstein rerecorded Connotations with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia in 1973 . This recording was released with Copland 's Inscape and Carter 's Concerto for Orchestra . 
 = = = Other factors in initial failure = = = 
 The composer admitted that Connotations possessed " a rather severe and somewhat intellectual tone . " However , while he did not expect it to be an immediate success , he had still hoped that the music 's intensity and drama might lend it some appeal . While Copland maintained that " It bothers me not at all to realize that my range as a composer includes both accessible and problematic works , " composer and musicologist Peter Dickinson notes " a tone of defensiveness " in this remark . Nevertheless , Connotations ' abrasiveness to many listeners might not have been the only factor in its initial failure . 
 = = = = Bernstein = = = = 
 The negative initial reaction to Connotations has also been claimed to have been due to Bernstein 's conducting . Bernstein was especially antipathetic toward works that were atonal or rhythmically disjunctive and " could not overcome a deep @-@ seated antipathy , an almost gut reaction " against <unk> the contemporary composers with whom he could relate , he had been " generous and enthusiastic " in his support of Copland . His frequent programming of Copland 's works during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic might , Adams suggests , have been partly in reaction against works of the twelve @-@ tone school . Now he was confronted with what American composer John Adams terms a " stridently dissonant , piss @-@ n @-@ vinegar " work " written in an idiom so alien to his own sensibilities , " the first performance of which he would not only conduct but would also be televised to a national audience . Pollack claims Bernstein might have found Connotations " boring " and kept it on the program solely out of duty to his old friend . 
 Despite Bernstein 's own musical antipathies , Adams claims the conductor generally remained open @-@ minded and curious enough " to try something at least once . " Among the world premieres of " difficult " works he led were Olivier Messiaen 's Turangalîla @-@ Symphonie in Boston in 1949 and Carter 's Concerto for Orchestra in New York in 1970 ; and despite his apparent lack of identification with Carter 's music , he described the composer in 1975 as " a brilliant mind and a supremely intelligent musician . " Bernstein conducted Connotations again during the first week of regular Philharmonic concerts in 1963 and included it among the pieces the orchestra played on its European tour in February 1963 . He would also commission a subsequent orchestral work from Copland , which became Inscape , and conduct Connotations again in an all @-@ Copland concert with the New York Philharmonic in 1989 . Even with this advocacy and the chance to familiarize himself at length , Connotations apparently remained a work that Bernstein did not conduct well . Critic Peter Davis , in his review of the 1989 performance , writes that while Connotations remained " admittedly not a very lovable piece , " in Bernstein 's hands it " sounded more fulsome than portentous . "

 While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 in an attempt to improve its sound , Harold C. Schonberg wrote , " For all we know , Connotations is a masterpiece . But one thing is certain — it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962 . " While admitting the work was " written in Copland 's austere , objective , abstract style , " he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work 's failure at the premiere . The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler 's Eighth Symphony , which pushed the orchestra forward , " out of its normal playing position ... The sound was bad , bad . The bass response was sorely deficient , the hall was plagued with echoes , the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear each other very well ( just great for ensemble ) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi @-@ fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit . 
 = = = Composer efforts = = = 
 Copland conducted Connotations in 1966 , 1967 and 1968 around the United States . This included an engagement at the Musica Viva series in San Francisco and concerts with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra , the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. and the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra . " I spoke to the audiences , " Copland writes , " with humorous accounts of the work 's adverse effect on droves of letter writers , who had heard the original performance , in person or on TV . Then I asked the brass section to illustrate the opening chords , and the strings how they sounded . Before they knew it , the audience was sympathetic . My purpose was not to sell the work but to demonstrate it . " 
 = = = Boulez revival = = = 
 A decade after Bernstein premiered the work , Pierre Boulez , who had succeeded Bernstein as music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1971 , conducted Connotations with the orchestra for the ten @-@ year anniversary of Philharmonic Hall ( subsequently renamed Avery Fisher Hall ; later David Geffen Hall ) . According to Copland , ten years had allowed enough time to change audience perceptions for the better . In his review for The New York Times Harold C. Schonberg wrote that this time , the audience " did not rise in revolt " as it had in 1962 . He added , " The composer 's cause was helped by , if memory serves , a better performance than had been given in 1962 . Mr. Boulez revels in this kind of music , and he brought drama to it as well as a synthesizing quality . " 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Connotations was the first orchestral work in which Copland used serial principles of composition . Serial or twelve @-@ tone music , Copland stated , carried " a built @-@ in tenseness ... a certain drama ... a sense of strain or tension " inherent in its extended use of chromaticism . " These are new tensions , " he continued , " different from what I would have dreamt up if I had been thinking tonally . " To composer John Adams , Copland 's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch " because ever since the 1920s , he 'd already a <unk> ' n @-@ vinegar penchant for sour intervals , like he did in the Piano Variations . " Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations ' premiere that Copland wrote a twelve @-@ tone work to impress younger composers , he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so . While Copland 's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics ( whom he did not name ) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930 , he claimed in his 1967 " conversation " with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were " the start of my interest in serial writing ... Although it doesn 't use all twelve tones , it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way . " Prior to that interview , few had related Copland 's early work to that of the founder of twelve @-@ tone composition , Arnold Schoenberg . 
 By the time he wrote Connotations , Copland had come to the view that serial composition was " like looking at a picture from a different point of view " and used it " with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [ compositional ] technique . " Part of that changed viewpoint , Copland said , " was that I began to hear chords that I wouldn 't have heard otherwise . Heretofore , I had been thinking tonally , but this was a new way of moving tones about . " Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non @-@ serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain . One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was " to construct an overall line that had continuity , dramatic force and an inherent unity . " He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations ( his orchestration of the Piano Variations ) . He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied " the building blocks " for Connotations , it was up to him to supply " the edifice " that these blocks would eventually form . 
 Critic Paul Henry Lang , among others , lamented Copland 's " yield to the conformism of 12 @-@ tone music . " As serial and serial @-@ inspired music was considered more academically viable than music utilizing common practice tonality ( especially in Europe ) , some contemporary critics felt that Copland was trying to retain his place at the apex of the American classical music scene by conforming to " academic standards . " Taruskin suggests that it might have appeared to these critics that Copland " had sacrificed his hard @-@ won , well @-@ nigh unique public appeal for what seemed ... an ' alienated ' modernist stance . " As the composer had been one of the first American composers to import the style from Europe — in the mid twenties — these critics may have overlooked the possibility that his " populist period " may have represented the more jarring deviation in his compositional style . 
 It had also been some time since a Copland piece had been appreciated widely by audiences . His opera The Tender Land had not fared well , either in its original or revised forms . Choreographer Jerome Robbins never produced Copland 's ballet Dance Panels , despite the fact that he had commissioned it . None of his major orchestral works from the 1960s — Connotations , Music for a Great City , Emblems and Inscape — made much of an impact with audiences . Nor do they fit in either the populist or modernist parts of Copland 's compositional output . Copland was aware that <unk> did not hold as high a place as it had previously and writes , " By the sixties , serialism had been around for over fifty years ; young composers were not so fascinated with it anymore . " Nonetheless , he did not want to be pigeonholed . He told American composer Walter Piston in 1963 , " People always want to shove me into the American idea more than I really want . Nobody wants to be an ' American ' composer now as they did . " He told another friend , " Young composers today wouldn 't be caught dead with a folk tune ! " He heard a considerable amount of new music through his association with Tanglewood and might not have wanted to be left behind . At the same time , he might not have become totally at home with serialism . He confided to Verna Fine , " I don 't feel comfortable with the twelve @-@ tone system , but I don 't want to keep repeating myself . "

 Choreographer John <unk> , noted for his ballets based on literary themes , received permission from Copland to use music from Connotations , the Piano Variations and Piano Fantasy for a ballet , The Fall Hamlet ( The Hamlet Affair ) . Staged by the American Ballet Theatre on January 6 , 1976 , the title role was danced by Mikhail <unk> , Ophelia by <unk> Kirkland , Gertrude by Marcia Haydée and Claudius by Erik <unk> . The ballet was received poorly , due to ineffective choreography . Critic Bob <unk> noted , however , that Copland 's " prickly , restless music " reflected the ballet 's story very well . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Despite its initial reception , Connotations was listed in 1979 by Billboard magazine among Copland works that continued to be programmed by orchestras , with subsequent performances by Pierre Boulez , Edo de Waart and Sixten Ehrling received positively . Reaction to the work itself remains mixed . Ross dismisses Connotations as a " barbaric yawp of a piece . " Morin calls it a " thorny , riveting patchwork " and listening to it " like the unrelenting pummeling of a prizefighter at times . " Adams calls its style " very simplistic ... strident " and " generally unpleasant sounding " and adds that " the rigor [ of twelve @-@ tone composition ] seemed more to cramp [ Copland 's ] natural spontaneity than to aid it . " Composer Kyle Gann calls Connotations " big , unwieldy ... and [ not ] that good ... Copland 's imagination seemed constrained by the technique . On a more positive note , Davis wrote after a performance of the work under Ehrling by The Juilliard Orchestra that while Connotations remains a " spiky " composition , Copland " adopts Schoenberg 's serial procedures to produce a sequence of typically pungent and exhilarating <unk> sonorities . " Desmond Shawe @-@ Taylor called the work " beautifully put together : full of energy , variety , thought " after he had heard Boulez conduct the piece . Michael Andrews wrote of Copland 's " mammoth , anxious and angry vision " and <unk> Naylor of " a majesty hidden in this dark piece " after both had heard de Waart 's performance .

 " La Isla Bonita " ( English : The Beautiful Island ) is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . It was released as the album 's final single on February 25 , 1987 by Sire Records . The instrumental version of the song was first offered to Michael Jackson before Madonna both accepted it and wrote the lyrics and melody . " La Isla Bonita " is noted for being the first Madonna song to have a Latino influence in it , with arrangements of Cuban drums and Spanish guitar , maracas , harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming . The lyrics of the song tell about a beautiful island and was a tribute to the beauty of the Latin people according to Madonna . 
 Following its release , " La Isla Bonita " received positive appreciation from critics . It also achieved worldwide popularity , topping the record charts in countries such as Austria , Canada , France , Germany and Switzerland . It became Madonna 's fourth number @-@ one single in the United Kingdom , giving her the record for most number @-@ one singles among female artists . In the United States , it reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . 
 In the accompanying music video , Madonna portrayed two opposite characters – a pious girl and a passionate Latina . The Latin style and the flamenco red dress she wore became a trend later . The song is one of the most performed live songs by Madonna , appearing in six of her world tours , the most recent being on the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) . Madonna has regularly performed the song in its Spanish form , sometimes with tribal or folk songs and remixes to accompany it . The song has been covered by a number of artists including Mexican recording artist <unk> ( 1988 ) and French recording artist Alizée for her album <unk> ( 2008 ) . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 " La Isla Bonita " was written by Madonna , Patrick Leonard and Bruce Gaitsch . The song was previously written as a lament for the town of San Pedro in the island of Ambergris Caye in Belize and was offered to Michael Jackson for his Bad album , who , according to Gaitsch , turned it down . While working with Leonard on the True Blue album , Madonna accepted it in Jackson 's place and wrote the song 's lyrics and melody , thus earning herself a co @-@ writing credit . 
 " La Isla Bonita " was the first Madonna song to employ Spanish motifs , going so far as to include Spanish lyrics . The Spanish theme would reoccur throughout her career , manifesting itself in lyrics for " Who 's That Girl " ( 1987 ) , " Spanish Eyes " ( 1989 ) , " I 'm Going Bananas " ( 1990 ) , the Spanish version of " You 'll See " ( 1995 ) called " Verás " , " Be Careful ( <unk> Con Mi Corazón ) " ( 1999 ) which was a duet with Ricky Martin , " Lo Que Siente La Mujer " – the Spanish version for " What It Feels Like for a Girl " ( 2001 ) , " Sorry " ( 2005 ) and " Spanish Lesson " from Hard Candy ( 2008 ) . Madonna described the song as her tribute to the " beauty and mystery of Latin American people " . According to her " Latin rhythms often dominate our uptempo compositions . It 's like we 're possessed . We both think that we were Latin in another life . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 " La Isla Bonita " is a Hispanic styled pop song . It is one of the characteristic works of the collaboration between Madonna and Patrick Leonard . The single mixes the sound of different instruments like Cuban drums and Spanish guitar , maracas and harmonicas and a mix of synthesized and real drumming . The song is written in the key of C ♯ minor and is set in the time signature of common time like most pop songs , moving at a moderate tempo of 95 beats per minute . The song starts with a musical introduction performed on a Cuban drum , before descending into synthesized beats and Spanish guitar fusion . Madonna sings the chorus in the same G ♯ 3 to C ♯ 5 range . After the second chorus there is a Spanish guitar interlude whence Madonna 's voice expands to F ♯ minor as she sings " I want to be where the sun warms the sky " and then comes down to a C ♯ minor when she sings " loves a girl " . There is another musical interlude with a harmonica and the song , after another chorus , ends with fading out and Madonna 's voice uttering the words " El dijo que te ama ( He said he loves you ) " . 
 The phrase " La Isla Bonita " translates to " The Beautiful Island " in English . The song has four lines sung in Spanish , a theme which Madonna later incorporated in her 1987 single " Who 's That Girl " . The lyrics begin by describing Madonna as a tourist who prays " that the days would last , they went so fast " simultaneously isolating the other Latin people as them ( " you can watch them go by " ) . In her book Women and popular music , author Sheila Whiteley said that the chorus of the song places its emphasis on the incantatory present participle ( " Tropical the island breeze , all of nature wild and free , this is where I long to be " ) . The song draws connotations from the supplicant before its explicit focus on the chorus . 
 The title and first line of the song refer to an island called San Pedro , held by some to be Ambergris Caye in Belize , referencing the town of San Pedro , which has since adopted the song 's title as the town 's principal nickname . However , Gaitsch has mentioned that at that time , Madonna was spending time in a U.S. town of the same name , and both Madonna and her then husband Sean Penn were good friends with a poet called San Pedro and novelist Charles Bukowski . Madonna herself has not clarified this in any interview . Instead , she referred the song as being a tribute to Latin America and its people , along with an island and to herself . In 2014 , while working on her thirteenth studio album Rebel Heart with producer Diplo , Madonna recorded a <unk> of " La Isla Bonita " with new lyrics for his Major Lazer project . Diplo premiered the full version of it in March 2015 during his show on BBC Radio 1 .

Firstly , the video shows a sparsely decorated room with an altar and pictures of Hispanic people on the wall . Madonna plays a pale @-@ looking pious girl wearing a white petticoat and her short hair brushed back . She cries in her room and reluctantly ignores the invitation of the Latinos in the street to join them . 
 The austerity and the passivity of the first character is however contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character . Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress , which shows off her décolletage , with a middle parting in the skirt , while wearing red carnations in her hair . Complementing this passionate look , the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra . While the spiritual and submissive Madonna watches the Latinos and prays in her room , the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets . 
 While both settings seem to suggest that Madonna 's characters live in the barrio and may be Latina themselves , the portrayal of Madonna in the dancing scenes ( lush , flashy , colorful ) contrasts with the Latinos in the street ( sparsely worn out dresses ) . She dances around and even flirts but does not get really involved with them as the last scene shows Madonna dancing off the screen . The video symbolizes the link between Latino culture and Catholicism . The two characters symbolize the restrained and passionate side of Catholicism , which author Rettenmund has described as Madonna 's take on the religion . 
 The Latinos in the video are portrayed as stereotypes as nonchalant people , unemployed adults , school deprived children and a crumbling barrio . However , the music video was critically appreciated for its utilization of Hispanic fashion as an icon of beauty and romanticism . Collen <unk> , in his book Material Christianity , noted Madonna 's use of Catholic objects in the video like the <unk> and home shrines , thereby giving them a new meaning according to her own . Author Douglas Kellner noted , " such ' multiculturalism ' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences " . Madonna 's Spanish look in the video became popular and appeared in the fashion trends at that time in the form of boleros and layered skirts accessorizing with rosary beads and crucifix like the video .

 Madonna has performed " La Isla Bonita " on most of her world tours including the 1987 Who 's That Girl World Tour , the 1993 Girlie Show World Tour , the 2001 Drowned World Tour , the 2006 Confessions Tour , the 2008 @-@ 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour and the 2015 – 16 Rebel Heart Tour . She also sang it at the 2007 Live Earth benefit concert in London . In the Who 's That Girl tour , " La Isla Bonita " was performed as a part of the encore . Madonna came out on the stage in a bright red flamenco dress like the video and performed the song , assisted by her backup singers Niki Haris , Donna De Lory and Debra Parson . A Latino dancing with Angel Ferreira was also included . Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos : Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and Ciao Italia : Live from Italy , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . In the 1993 Girlie Show tour Madonna performed the song on top of a rising platform , after " I 'm Going Bananas " . She was dressed in a blue and white striped shirt while Haris and De Lory wore a similar outfit , but in black and red . One of the musicians walked around bare chest playing the acoustic guitar . 
 During her 2001 Drowned World Tour , Madonna performed " La Isla Bonita " in the Latin segment of the show , wearing a revealing black <unk> 's dress and trousers , hair tied back and playing a Spanish guitar . She asked the crowd to join her while singing " <unk> ola " with the song . In the Confessions Tour , Madonna appeared on the stage in a purple white leotard with open hair and started singing the song . In the middle of the performance , she was joined by her backup dancers who , along with the singer , walked the length of the stage singing the chorus . The performance ends with Madonna lying down on the stage . The video backdrops showed a tropical paradise like the island San Pedro mentioned in the song . 
 Madonna performed " La Isla Bonita " during the 2007 Live Earth benefit concert at Wembley Stadium in London where she was joined by members of gypsy punk band Gogol Bordello for a crazed hoedown version of the song . Gogol Bordello had previously joined her on the 2006 Confessions Tour where the song was played as a dance / tribal remix with interventions from Eugene <unk> and Sergey <unk> from Gogol Bordello . The song was once again added to the set list of her 2008 – 09 Sticky & Sweet Tour , as part of the Gypsy segment of the show , featuring the Arkady <unk> band and the Romani @-@ Gypsy folk song " Lela Pala Tute . " The performance had Madonna wearing a short black skintight dress and knee @-@ high boots with pink fluorescent beads and necklaces . Along with " Lela Pala Tute " , there was a Mediterranean Street party with Greek dancing , another gypsy song called " Doli , Doli " and a flamenco solo performance . A flamenco version of the song was performed on the third section of the Rebel Heart Tour ( 2015 – 16 ) . For the wardrobe , Madonna enlisted a Spanish tailoring company from Zaragoza for creating two bullfighter <unk> de <unk> costume , along with a cape and matador related costumes for her backing dancers . Jordan Zivitz of Montreal Gazette praised the performance for being " one of the only hits to retain its original form " .

Indie psychedelic folk singer @-@ songwriter Jonathan Wilson recorded a cover for the 2007 Madonna tribute compilation Through the Wilderness . 
 In 1999 , female singer <unk> used elements of the song in her single " El Paraíso Rico " . The song was sampled by rapper Black Rob , in his 1999 song " Spanish Fly " ( included in his Life Story album ) featuring Jennifer Lopez . In the chorus of the song , Lopez sings the part which samples " La Isla Bonita " . Rapper Andre <unk> sampled the song in " Son of an Angel " , which is featured on his 2001 album Unreleased . In 2004 , rapper Mase sampled and interpolated it for his song " My Harlem Lullaby " . A cover has also been performed by Finnish power metal band Twilight Guardians on their record Sin Trade . 
 On the Family Guy episode " The Father , the Son , and the Holy Fonz " when discussing Madonna at the end , one of the characters , Peter Griffin , calls her a liar for singing about a nonexistent place ( La Isla Bonita ) stating that he could not find it in a map . American artist Britney Spears recorded a track titled " Love 2 Love U " , which heavily samples " La Isla Bonita " . The track leaked on December 2 , 2011 . The song was also covered in the Fox TV show , Glee in the episode " The Spanish Teacher " . It was sung by Naya Rivera who plays the character Santana Lopez and Ricky Martin who guest stars in the episode . It was filmed and recorded in January , then was broadcast in February 2012 .

 = Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld = 
 Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld : An Anthropology is an anthropological study of contemporary Pagan and ceremonial magic groups that practiced magic in London , England during the 1990s . It was written by English anthropologist Susan Greenwood based upon her doctoral research undertaken at Goldsmiths ' College , a part of the University of London , and first published in 2000 by Berg Publishers . 
 Greenwood became involved in the esoteric movement during the 1980s as a practitioner of a feminist @-@ orientated form of Wicca . <unk> her doctorate to the subject , her research led her to join Kabbalistic orders and two Wiccan covens , during which she emphasised that she was both an " insider " ( a practising occultist ) and an " outsider " ( an anthropological observer ) . Reacting against the work of Tanya Luhrmann , who had authored the primary anthropological study of the London occult scene , Persuasions of the Witch 's Craft ( 1989 ) , Greenwood argued against studying magical beliefs from a western rationalist perspective , instead adopting a theoretical approach informed by phenomenology and relativism . Greenwood 's research focused on Pagan and magical conceptions of the " otherworld " . The book 's first chapter summarises the Pagan magical conception of the otherworld , and subsequent chapters detail Greenwood 's experiences with Kabbalistic magic and Wicca . The work goes on to discuss issues of psychotherapy and healing , gender and sexuality , and morality and ethics within London 's esoteric community , and the manner in which the community 's members ' views on these issues are influenced by their beliefs regarding an otherworld . 
 Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld was reviewed by various figures involved in both academia and the Pagan community including Douglas Ezzy and Phil Hine . Greenwood herself would go on to author several other books on the relationship between magic and anthropology .

 Prior to Greenwood 's work , several academic researchers working in the field of Pagan studies had published investigations of the Pagan community in the United States and the United Kingdom . First among these was the practicing Wiccan , journalist and political activist Margot Adler in her Drawing Down the Moon : Witches , Druids , Goddess @-@ Worshippers , and Other Pagans in America Today , published by Viking Press in 1979 . A second study was produced by anthropologist Tanya M. Luhrmann in Persuasions of the Witch 's Craft : Ritual Magic in Contemporary England ( 1989 ) , in which she focused on a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders based in London . Sociologist Allen Scarboro , psychologist Nancy Campbell and Wiccan literary critic Shirley Stave undertook fieldwork in the Ravenwood coven of Atlanta , Georgia , over several months across 1990 and 1991 as the basis for Living Witchcraft : A Contemporary American Coven , published by Praeger in 1994 , while anthropologist and Wiccan Loretta Orion investigated the Pagan movement in the East Coast and Midwest of the U.S. for Never Again the Burning Times : Paganism Revisited , published by Waveland Press in 1995 . 1997 saw the publication of Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia , authored by anthropologist Lynne Hume . 
 = = = Greenwood and her research = = = 
 As a child , Greenwood had found a greater spiritual connection with the natural world than with organised religion . During the late 1970s , she embraced second @-@ wave feminism and came across feminist forms of Pagan Witchcraft through Starhawk 's Dreaming the Dark ( 1982 ) . Attracted to this new religious movement , she undertook an undergraduate degree in anthropology and sociology at Goldsmiths ' College , where her final year research project focused on women 's spirituality . Exploring the topic in further depth , she devoted a PhD to the subject , thereby conducting the research underpinning Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld . 
 Although initially planning to gather data through formal taped interviews with participants , she rejected this method , believing it solidified her " outsider " status among the subculture she was studying . Instead , her data was collected through informal conversations with practitioners , during which she tried to make clear that she was an anthropologist and would use their comments in her work . Over the course of her research , Greenwood gained many friends within the city 's Pagan community , and became sexually and emotionally attached to one magician . Greenwood 's research was funded using grants from the University of London Central Research Fund and from the Economic and Social Research Council . She devoted the published work to her children , Adrian and Lauren . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Chapter one describes contemporary Paganism and defines " the otherworld " . It discusses London 's magical and Pagan subculture in the 1990s , and Greenwood 's relationship with it . Admitting to being an " insider " , she explores her mixed feelings at being both a practicing Pagan and an anthropological observer . The second chapter examines the community 's conceptions of the otherworld , explaining how they approach it through acts of visualisation and altered states of consciousness and their understandings of it as a realm of spiritual energy connected to dreams and the imagination . Discussing the relationship between anthropology and magic , Greenwood argues that it is impossible for anthropologists to truly understand beliefs regarding magic and the otherworld if they only view it through a western rationalist lens , instead arguing for a phenomenological or relativist perspective that accepts alternative views of the world . 
 In her third chapter , Greenwood examines her experiences among London 's ceremonial magicians , focusing on her training in the Hermetic Qabalah , a " magical language " for exploring the otherworld . Adopting Luhrmann 's concept of " interpretative drift " , she relates how she shifted her understanding of events to make sense of her magical experiences . However , in contrast to Luhrmann 's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism , Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn " the language of another mode of reality " through their experiences . Chapter four details Greenwood 's early involvement in Wicca , through three separate covens . Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations , she then discusses the faith 's approach to sexual polarity , pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the Great Rite and the Gnostic Mass as evidence . The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic . 
 Chapter five examines the attraction of magic for its practitioners , and its uses for psychotherapy and healing . Greenwood explores the ways in which occultists use magic as a rebellion against Christianity , and their construction of a " magical identity " , believing this to be " organized around a deep internal exploration of the self through an interaction with the otherworld " . She also looks at magic and the acquisition of power , and the sense of empowerment discovered by magicians who were former abuse victims . The sixth chapter focuses on notions of gender and sexuality , highlighting the widespread belief that sexual energy provides the power behind magic and discussing the contrasting views of Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley on this issue ; the former emphasised harmony and balance between " masculine " and " feminine " magical forces , while the latter advocated " magical anarchy " or spiritual autonomy for each individual , irrespective of gender . Greenwood looks at contrasting views on these issues in High Magic ( ceremonial magic ) , Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft . Drawing upon the typologies advocated by sociologist of religion Susan J. Palmer , she argues that High Magic emphasises " sex polarity " , a situation in which men and women are seen as unequal and different , whereas Wicca holds to a position of " sex complementarity " , in which men and women are seen as different yet equal , and Feminist Witchcraft advocates " sex unity " , in which there is a tolerance of sexual ambiguity . 
 Chapter seven deals with conceptions of morality and ethics , arguing that whereas High Magic typically envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil , Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence are seen as intrinsic parts of the whole . Disagreeing with Luhrmann 's view that morality 's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo @-@ scientific nature of magic , Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe as a part of moral discourse . She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic , explaining concepts such as that of the <unk> , before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft . 
 = = Central arguments = = 
 Greenwood states that western esotericists have a holistic , animistic view of cosmology , considering the universe to be alive and interconnected with spiritual energies . According to such beliefs , many of these energies operate in " a time and space distinct from , but also very closely connected to , everyday reality " , and it is this area that is termed the " otherworld " in Pagan discourse . She relates that western esotericists believe in forces who inhabit this otherworld , and who are personalized as deities , animal guides , or spirit beings . She furthermore states that these individuals see themselves as <unk> of the universal macrocosm . 
 Greenwood highlights the practitioners ' belief that they can interact with this otherworld and the entities which inhabit it through rituals that facilitate their own altered states of consciousness . She notes that western magicians make use of mythology as a form of " cognitive map " to " structure their <unk> experience " . She also notes that this otherworld is closely linked to dreams and the imagination in western magical belief . 
 Greenwood argues that the academic discipline of anthropology , being a product of the western rationalism developed during the Age of Enlightenment , is innately skeptical of claims for the existence of magic or an otherworld , either among non @-@ western cultures or western subcultures . In contrast to this attitude , she notes that anthropology is the discipline which first pointed out that " reality is culturally constructed " and that there are " multiple ways of experiencing the world " , including those which conceive of an otherworld existing alongside our own reality . For this reason , she argues that anthropologists wishing to understand a society that believes in and practices magic must first tentatively accept the existence of an otherworld , claiming that " it is inappropriate to use methods developed for the study of everyday reality to analyse the magical otherworld . "

 Greenwood 's text was reviewed by Patric V. Giesler of Gustavus Adolphus College for peer @-@ reviewed academic journal American Ethnologist . Giesler describes Greenwood 's work as " provocative " , noting that it represents a " native 's account " of Paganism , with Greenwood being " a native gone anthropologist . " He characterises Greenwood 's experiences as religious or spiritual rather than magical , because none of the practices that she described involved manipulating beings or forces for an instrumental end ; the classic definition of magic . Unconvinced by her argument that practitioner 's notions of identity , gender and morality derived from their encounter with the otherworld , he considers other sources for such notions , but otherwise recommended the book . 
 The book was also reviewed by religious studies scholar Michael York of Bath Spa University for the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion . Labelling it an " enormously engaging , provocative , and rich book " , he notes that readers may wish that Greenwood had more explicitly presented " the <unk> assumptions and their shortcomings " of Feminist Witchcraft . Comparing it with Luhrmann 's Persuasions of the Witch 's Craft , York comments that it is a " <unk> astute , <unk> , thoroughly enjoyable , and highly recommended work . " 
 Sarah M. Pike of the California State University , Chico reviewed the book for Culture and Religion : An Interdisciplinary Journal , describing it as an " accessible and personal account " . Believing that it made an " important contribution " to Pagan studies and the anthropological study of magic , she nevertheless thought that Greenwood 's subjective attitude was the book 's shortcoming as well as its strength . Pike finds problems in Greenwood 's insider @-@ outsider status , believing that it has not been sufficiently theorised , and that Greenwood was unaware of her own bias in favour of Feminist Witchcraft , which in turn affects her interpretation of other forms of Wicca and ceremonial magic . She also critiques the book 's lack of commentary or detailed analysis , complaining that many subsections lack conclusions . 
 Anthropologist Galina Lindquist of the University of Stockholm published a review in The Australian Journal of Anthropology , referring to Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld as " a welcome contribution " containing " valuable " ethnographic material . Noting that it joins the work of anthropologists like Jeanne Favret @-@ <unk> , Paul Stoller , and E. Turner , Lindquist praises the manner in which Greenwood put contemporary practices into historical perspective , and how she illuminates the " strains and contradictions " within the magical milieu . She believes that Greenwood 's arguments would have been strengthened had she made use of a more in @-@ depth ethnographic study of magical morality , and considers it unfortunate that Greenwood had not touched on ritual studies . 
 = = = Pagan and esoteric community = = = 
 Greenwood 's work was independently reviewed by two separate individuals in The Pomegranate : A New Journal of Neopagan Thought – then a scholarly but not yet academic publication . The first reviewer , Daniel Cohen of Wood and Water magazine , praises Greenwood 's theoretical approach , claiming that she had been " braver " than Luhrmann in maintaining a " creative tension " as both an insider and outsider . Asserting that Greenwood 's use of anthropological terminology made for " hard reading " , he suspects that her use of the word " magician " would jar with many Pagans who would disagree with the manner in which she used it . In conclusion , he recommends it as a " valuable but inexpensive book " . 
 The Pomegranate 's second review came from Pagan studies scholar Douglas Ezzy of the University of Tasmania , who praises Greenwood 's research , theoretical approach and style of writing . He notes that her " truly ground breaking " approach in taking spiritual experiences seriously had " fascinated and thrilled " him , asserting that her work builds on the pioneering edited collection Being Changed by Jean @-@ Guy Goulet and David E. Young . Noting that Magic , Witchcraft and the Otherworld was " sometimes provocative " , he disagrees with some of Greenwood 's conclusions , but highlights that her arguments had made him think about these issues " in much sharper focus . " 
 Reviewing it for his own website , prominent chaos magician Phil Hine described Greenwood 's work as " fascinating " , arguing that it should interest students of anthropology as well as practising occultists . He praises the author 's descriptions of her own experiences within esoteric groups , and the manner in which she highlighted the power struggles that take place within them , before recommending it as " an engaging and thought @-@ provoking read " . 
 = Italian cruiser Calabria = 
 Calabria was a small protected cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1890s , intended for service in Italy 's overseas empire . She was laid down in 1892 , launched in 1894 , and completed in 1897 , and was armed with a main battery of four 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and four 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns . Calabria spent significant periods abroad , ranging from deployments to Chinese , North American , and Australian waters , in addition to periods in Italy 's East African empire . She saw action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1912 in the Red Sea , primarily bombarding Turkish ports in the area . Calabria was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 , reduced to a training ship in 1924 , and sold for scrap at the end of the year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Calabria was designed by the Chief Engineer , Edoardo Masdea , and was intended for overseas service . She had a steel hull sheathed with wood and zinc to protect it from fouling during lengthy deployments abroad . The hull was 76 meters ( 249 ft ) long between perpendiculars and 81 m ( 266 ft ) long overall . It had a beam of 12 @.@ 71 m ( 41 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 05 m ( 16 @.@ 6 ft ) . Her normal displacement was 2 @,@ 453 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 414 long tons ; 2 @,@ 704 short tons ) but increased to 2 @,@ 660 t ( 2 @,@ 620 long tons ; 2 @,@ 930 short tons ) at full load . Calabria had a crew of between 214 and 254 officers and enlisted crew . 
 The cruiser was powered by two @-@ shaft vertical triple @-@ expansion engines with steam supplied by four coal @-@ fired , cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers that were trunked into a single funnel amidships . The engines had an output of 4 @,@ 260 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 180 kW ) and produced a top speed of 16 @.@ 4 knots ( 30 @.@ 4 km / h ; 18 @.@ 9 mph ) . Calabria had a cruising radius of about 2 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 4 @,@ 600 km ; 2 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Calabria was armed with a main battery of four 15 @-@ centimeter ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 40 guns and four 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns , all mounted individually . Light armaments included eight 5 @.@ 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) L / 40 guns , eight 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 20 guns , and a pair of machine guns . She was also equipped with a pair of 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . Armor protection consisted of a 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick deck ; her conning tower also received 50 mm of steel plating .

 Calabria was built at the La Spezia dockyard , with her keel being laid down in February 1892 . She was launched on 20 September 1894 , and fitting @-@ out work was completed by mid @-@ 1897 ; the new cruiser was commissioned into the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) on 12 July . Calabria spent long periods abroad in her first decade of service . She was operating in Chinese waters in 1899 when the Boxer Rebellion broke out . She joined an international fleet that included representatives from the fleets of the Eight Nation Alliance in the mouth of the Hai River while a contingent of 475 soldiers traveled to Beijing to reinforce the Legation Quarter . 
 The ship was present on 20 May 1902 when the United States formally granted independence to the Republic of Cuba , following the Spanish – American War three years earlier . Calabria and the British cruiser HMS Psyche fired salutes to the United States cruiser USS Brooklyn . In March 1905 Calabria went on another cruise to American waters , this time to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic . The visit represented an attempt at gunboat diplomacy , aimed at securing payments for debts to Italian nationals . Later in the year , Calabria visited Australia on a trip to show the flag . In October 1909 , Calabria took part in the Portola Festival in San Francisco , marking the 140th anniversary of the Portolà expedition , the first recorded European exploration of what became California . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , Calabria was stationed in the Far East , but she was immediately recalled to reinforce the Italian colony of Eritrea . After arriving in East African waters , she joined the cruiser Puglia in bombarding the Turkish port of Aqaba on 19 November to disperse a contingent of Ottoman soldiers there . Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King George V passed through the Red Sea following his coronation ceremony in India — the ceasefire lasted until 26 November . Four days later , Calabria and the gunboat Volturno attacked a quarantine station near Perim . 
 In early 1912 , the Italian Red Sea Fleet searched for a group of seven Ottoman gunboats thought to be planning an attack on Eritrea , though they were in fact immobilized due to a lack of coal . Calabria and the Puglia carried out diversionary bombardments against Jebl Tahr , and Al Luḩayyah , while the cruiser Piemonte and the destroyers Artigliere and Garibaldino searched for the gunboats . On 7 January , they found the gunboats and quickly sank four in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay ; the other three were forced to beach to avoid sinking as well . The next day , the Italian warships sent a shore party to destroy the grounded gunboats . Calabria and the rest of the Italian ships returned to bombarding the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January . Calabria returned to Italy by April for refitting . The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October , ending the war .

 In 1914 , her armament was reduced ; the 15 cm guns were removed and two additional 12 cm guns were installed in their place . Two of the 5 @.@ 7 cm guns and six of the 3 @.@ 7 cm guns were also removed . The ship took a diplomatic mission from Massawa across the Red Sea to visit Hussein bin Ali , the recently @-@ proclaimed King of Hejaz , in Mecca in July 1917 . Calabria returned to East African waters in January 1918 on another mission to show the flag , particularly off the coast of Somalia . Stops included Aden and Djibouti . Calabria was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 , and she saw her armament modified again ; a 15 cm gun was reinstalled , as were two of the 5 @.@ 7 cm guns . A 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) L / 39 autocannon was also added at this time . She served in this role for only a short time , and was reduced to a training ship for naval gunners in early 1924 . This duty ended quickly , and she was sold for scrap on 13 November 1924 . 
 = A Simple Plan ( film ) = 
 A Simple Plan is a 1998 American neo @-@ noir crime thriller film adapted by Scott B. Smith from his 1993 novel of the same name . Directed by Sam Raimi , the film stars Bill Paxton , Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda . Set in rural Minnesota , A Simple Plan follows Hank Mitchell ( Paxton ) and his brother Jacob ( Thornton ) , who , along with Jacob 's friend Lou ( Brent Briscoe ) , discover a crashed plane containing $ 4 @.@ 4 million in cash . The three men go to great lengths to keep the money a secret but begin to doubt each other 's trust , resulting in lies , deceit and murder . 
 Development of the film began in 1993 before the novel was published . Mike Nichols purchased the film rights , and the project was picked up by an independent film studio , Savoy Pictures . After Nichols stepped down , the film adaptation became mired in development hell ; during the troubled pre @-@ production , Ben Stiller and John Dahl turned down opportunities to direct the film . After Savoy closed in November 1995 , the project was sold to Paramount Pictures . John Boorman was hired to direct , but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi . Principal photography began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days ; filming took place in Wisconsin and Minnesota . The score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman . 
 A Simple Plan premiered at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival , where it was met with critical acclaim . The film 's appearance at the festival preceded a limited release in the United States on December 11 , 1998 , followed by a general release in North America on January 22 , 1999 . It underperformed at the North American box office , grossing $ 16 @.@ 3 million on a $ 17 million production budget . Reviewers praised various aspects of the film 's production , including the storytelling , performances and Raimi 's direction . A Simple Plan earned multiple awards and nominations , among them two Academy Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor ( Thornton ) and Best Adapted Screenplay ( Smith ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Hank Mitchell and his wife Sarah live in rural Minnesota . One of the town 's few college graduates , Hank works in a feed mill , while his wife is a librarian . When Hank , his older , socially challenged brother Jacob and Jacob 's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods , they stumble upon a crashed airplane . Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $ 4 @.@ 4 million in $ 100 bills . He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou . Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house until the end of winter . Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob 's pick @-@ up truck . Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion . After Carl leaves , the three men decide to keep the money a secret , but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah . 
 Sarah suggests that Hank and Jacob return a paltry sum of the money to the plane to avoid suspicion from local authorities . While travelling on foot to the woods , the brothers come across an old man on a snowmobile . Jacob , thinking that their cover is blown , bludgeons him . When the man regains consciousness , Hank suffocates him , then uses the snowmobile to drive his body off a bridge , making the murder look like an accidental death . The following night , Lou drunkenly demands some of the money from Hank , because he has spent recklessly since the discovery . When Hank refuses , Lou threatens to go to the authorities , having learned from Jacob about the old man 's murder . 
 Sarah advises that Hank and Jacob team up to plot against Lou . Much to Jacob 's dismay , the two brothers visit Lou at his home where Jacob has him drunkenly confess to the old man 's murder . Hank records the false confession with a tape recorder . Lou grows enraged when he realizes that the two have conspired against him and pulls a gun on them . Jacob grabs a rifle from his truck and kills Lou to save his brother . Hank then kills Lou 's wife with Lou 's shotgun when she appears with another gun . The two brothers avoid arrest after Hank concocts a rehearsed speech for himself and Jacob to tell the police . 
 Because Jacob mentioned hearing a plane in the woods , Carl asks the brothers to assist an FBI agent , Neil Baxter , in a search for the missing aircraft . Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station . Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter , whom she later discovers to be an impostor ; she contacts and warns Hank , who steals a handgun from Carl 's office . The four men head into the woods and split up . When he finds the plane , Baxter kills Carl , and engages in a gunfight with Hank . Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen . Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities . Jacob however announces that he does not want to live with these bad memories ; he threatens to shoot himself to end it . He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime . After grappling with the decision , Hank kills Jacob . 
 At the police station , Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents . As Sarah predicted , the agents do not believe that Hank , an upstanding member of the community , would be capable of such wrongdoing . Although he is ruled out as a suspect , Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills ' serial numbers were written down to track the cash . Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught ; he goes home and burns it all . In a closing narration , Hank reflects on his losses ; as he tries to move on with his life , the murderous events constantly haunt him .

 After Scott B. Smith had published a short story for The New Yorker , the magazine 's fiction editor learned of his then @-@ unpublished novel A Simple Plan before reading it and forwarding it to an agent . Shortly thereafter , Smith learned that Mike Nichols was interested in purchasing the film rights to his novel . Nichols spent a weekend reading the book , before contacting Smith 's agent , and finalizing a deal the following Monday morning . Nichols purchased the rights for his production company Icarus Productions for $ 250 @,@ 000 , with an additional $ 750 @,@ 000 to come later from a studio interested in pursuing the project . Smith ’ s manuscript of A Simple Plan was optioned for development at an independent film studio , Savoy Pictures . However , due to scheduling conflicts with a planned film adaptation of All the Pretty Horses , Nichols stepped down from the project . 
 After learning of the film adaptation from Nichols , Ben Stiller joined the project and signed a two @-@ picture directing deal with Savoy . He spent nine months working on the script with Smith . During preproduction , however , Stiller had a falling out with Savoy over budget disputes — among them was how Savoy ’ s reported $ 4 million offer to Nicolas Cage would affect the film ’ s budget . Stiller explained , ” The problem was Savoy . I don ’ t think they had a good understanding of how to make films happen . ” Unable to secure financing from another studio , Stiller left the production . 
 In January 1995 , John Dahl was announced to helm the film , with Cage set to appear in a starring role , and filming likely to start during the following summer in the southern hemisphere or in Canada during the following winter . In November 1995 , following a series of box office failures , Savoy announced that it was retreating from the film industry . The studio was later acquired by IAC / Interactive Corporation , whose chairman , Barry Diller , put A Simple Plan up for sale . This resulted in both Dahl and Cage leaving the project . 
 The project was purchased by Paramount Pictures , where producer Scott Rudin hired John Boorman to direct the film . Boorman cast Bill Paxton and Billy Bob Thornton in the lead roles of Hank and Jacob Mitchell , respectively . A Simple Plan marked the second on @-@ screen collaboration between Paxton and Thornton after One False Move ( 1992 ) . Thornton recalled , " I got a call from one of my agents who said , ' John Boorman wants you to do a script that I sent you a year ago and you never read , ' I said , ' Send it to me again , and this time I 'll really read it . ' Within the first two pages , I knew I wanted to do it . " Paxton learned of the novel A Simple Plan from his father five years before securing the role of Hank : " He said , ' You 'll love it . It 's got a lot of hair on it . You were born to play this part . ' I said , ' Dad , I 'll never get to do this . ' And for five years , there was a whole list of actors and directors who kind of marched through it . Billy Bob and I were set to do these roles in 1997 , and then it fell apart . That was the cruelest twist for an actor , to get a part you dreamed you 'd get and then they decide to scrap the whole thing . " Rudin considered casting Anne Heche as Hank 's wife Sarah Mitchell . 
 Boorman took part in location scouting , and filming was set to begin during the first week of January 1998 . When a second investor left the project , Paramount refused to fully finance the $ 17 million production itself . Although Boorman was able to secure financing , the studio feared that filming would not be finished before the end of winter . Boorman ran into scheduling conflicts , which resulted in him leaving the production . Paramount then hired Sam Raimi to direct the film . Smith said of Raimi , " I wasn 't familiar with Sam 's other work , but I met with him , and in talking to him I was very pleased . I felt like he understood the story . He understood the people . We grew up in the same area of the country . He knew what I was writing about and he knew how to tell the story in the right way . " Raimi did not have time to scout locations due to studio constraints ; he relied on the previous locations visited during Boorman 's involvement . In December 1997 , Bridget Fonda , who had previously collaborated with Raimi on Army of Darkness ( 1992 ) , was cast as Sarah Mitchell . 
 A Simple Plan was a co @-@ production between Paramount and Mutual Film Company . The film was co @-@ financed by Mutual and Newmarket Capital Group as part of a joint venture that was formed by the two companies . Mutual 's international partners — the United Kingdom 's BBC , Germany 's Tele @-@ München , Japan 's Toho @-@ Towa / Marubeni and France ’ s UGC @-@ PH — also co @-@ financed the film in exchange for distribution rights in their respective territories and equity stakes on the film on a worldwide basis . Paramount acquired the North American distribution rights . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 The original script that Smith had written for Mike Nichols was 256 pages long — the equivalent of a four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour film . Smith said of the experience , " I wrote a horrible , amateurish draft ... which I think scared [ Nichols ] away from the project . " Smith kept Nichols 's suggested story setting : Because snow plays a crucial role , the film adaptation would take place in Minnesota , rather than in Ohio , where the book is set . After Nichols suggested that the story be set in the state , the Minnesota Film Board joined the project and remained with it throughout principal photography . 
 Following publication of A Simple Plan , Nichols eventually turned down the project during the script 's early draft stages . When Ben Stiller became involved , he and Smith spent nine months rewriting the script . Smith explained , " Ben was the one that showed me how to write a script . He worked with me and gave me the cue to visualize the movie and write down what I was picturing in my head . " 
 For the film adaptation , certain visual changes were made from the novel . Smith explained that one change involved the discovery of the crashed plane ; his script had the character Lou Chambers " throwing [ a ] snowball to uncover the plane ... In the book , they 're just walking and they find it . " Scott Rudin wanted to change the focus of the story to Hank and Jacob , and ordered Smith to shorten the screenplay to 120 pages . Smith explained , " I had to work to make Hank a more rational character , less evil . " The shortening of the script also resulted in the character of Sarah having a smaller role , and Jacob getting to live longer ( in the book , Jacob dies in a shootout at Lou 's house ) . After the role was secured by Billy Bob Thornton , Smith omitted the character 's overweight appearance from the novel . Smith described the film adaptation as being less violent than the book : " The book is much more violent than the movie , more graphic in its violence . It was [ Raimi ] ' s choice to be more restrained , to bring out the characters . "

 = = = = Principal photography = = = = 
 Principal photography for A Simple Plan began on January 5 , 1998 , and concluded on March 13 , 1998 after 55 days . Filming was scheduled to begin in Delano , Minnesota , but due to climatic changes as the result of El Niño , the production was forced to temporarily relocate to northern Wisconsin to find the snow levels described in the script . The production began shooting in Ashland , Wisconsin , where most of the film 's exterior shots , and the road and woods near where the characters find the plane , were filmed . An actual plane , with one side cut open , was one of two planes used to depict the crashed aircraft . Patrizia Von Brandenstein was the film 's production designer , marking her second collaboration with Raimi , after The Quick and the Dead ( 1995 ) . Brandenstein found the weather conditions difficult during production , as she had to await good weather to complete the necessary exterior work . Describing the overall look of the film , she said , " We created a muted black @-@ and @-@ white color scheme to suggest a morality tale , the choices given between right and wrong . " 
 The production team returned to Minnesota , where it was plagued by a lack of snow . To solve this problem , the production put together an effects team whose sole responsibility was dealing with snow . This snow effects team created a combination of real snow and fake synthetic snow that was made from shaved ice . The home of Lou Chambers and his wife Nancy was filmed in an abandoned house in Delano , which cinematographer <unk> Kivilo described as " a very difficult [ filming ] location with very low ceilings and no heating " . Brandenstein and the art department were tasked with designing the set inside the home . 
 The interior of the crashed plane , in which Hank discovers a dead pilot and the $ 4 @.@ 4 million in cash , was filmed on a soundstage . A second plane , designed to have frosted windows , was attached to a gimbal , about five feet off the ground . Kivilo explained , “ As [ Paxton ] crawls to the front of the plane , it tilts down . When he moves toward the back , it tilts in that direction . Since we were using an actual plane there was a limit to how much of the plane ’ s walls could be removed before it became structurally unsound . " Kivilo described the interior of the plane as " a very small , cramped shooting space . " To match the interior with footage shot in Wisconsin , the art department built a set with real trees and a painted backdrop . To depict Hank being attacked by a flock of crows inside the plane , puppets were used to attack Paxton as he appeared on screen , while two live crows were used to attack an animatronic replica of the actor . A separate soundstage was used to create two sets depicting the interiors of the Mitchell home , where Hank and his wife Sarah ( Fonda ) reside . The first set was the main floor an exterior entrance way , and the second was created for the upstairs bedrooms . 
 = = = = Cinematography = = = = 
 Upon reading the script , director of photography <unk> Kivilo said that his first approach to making the film " was to make the look simple , allowing the characters to tell the story . Outwardly , the film is a thriller , but at the heart of it , this is a dark psychological drama of one man ’ s descent into hell . I knew the camera would have to take a back seat . ” Prior to his first meeting with Raimi , Kivilo 's inspiration for the look of the film came from the visual imagery in the 1967 film In Cold Blood and the work of photographer Robert Frank . 
 Kivilo contacted his agent to arrange a meeting with Raimi ; their first meeting occurred only three weeks prior to filming , during which Kivilo was also inspired by photographs taken during location scouting in Delano , Minnesota . He described the photographs as being " very stark , with white snow and black trees . They were very hard @-@ contrast , and reminded me of Japanese wood @-@ cut prints , with very simple and graphic images . " Raimi saw A Simple Plan as an opportunity to direct a character @-@ driven story that differed from his earlier works , which were highly stylized or dependent on intricate camera movements . 
 Kivilo originally wanted to shoot the film in widescreen , using the anamorphic format . " Sam and I had talked briefly in the beginning about going anamorphic , " he explained , " but because of the lack of prep time , a restricted budget and lack of lenses available , we decided against it . " Kivilo used Panavision Platinum cameras with the company 's Primo series of prime lenses to shoot the film . He used Eastman Kodak <unk> <unk> Vision film stock for all of the daylight scenes and tungsten @-@ balanced <unk> Vision 500T film stock for the night scenes . 
 Despite the intense weather conditions , Kivilo believed that the overcast skies created a " gray , somber , stark look . " He said , " This allowed me to eliminate the need to bring in heavy movie lights for the exteriors , complicating the logistics even more . Because the light would bounce off the snow , I would use big solids for negative fill to shape the light , adding just a bit of shiny card for the actors ’ eyes . I wanted to keep the snow very hot and retain a <unk> and stark look . " Kivilo also chose not to use any lighting for daytime exterior scenes . For exterior scenes shot during sunnier filming days , computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) was used to re @-@ create the overcast skies . Kivilo added that " CGI also helped to even out inconsistencies caused by the amount of snow falling from shot to shot . " 
 Kivilo explained that he and Raimi intended to use the camera to enhance the story with simplicity : “ Our opening sequence starts with quiet , poetic landscapes . White snow . Black trees . A black crow flying off . Symbolically , these are very fitting images . The crow is a symbol of greed and becomes a strong reoccurring visual theme later in the film . The choice of black and white foreshadows the battle between the conscious and the unconscious , which is such an important element in our story . We then show evocative images of an abandoned farm , [ Hank and Jacob ] Mitchell ’ s family home . A red tractor is parked in falling snow . A torn curtain flapping in the wind . These are innocent shots , before their world falls apart . ” Kivilo noted that “ the film ends with some of the exact frames of the abandoned farm that we saw in the title sequence . Because of what the characters have gone through , a totally new value is assigned to those shots . They feel different , evoking new emotions and yet physically they haven ’ t changed from when we first saw them ! " 
 Regarding scenes that take place in Lou 's home , Kivilo said , " Because the performances were so intense , Sam wanted to shoot the scene with at least two cameras , and sometimes three . Lighting for three cameras is a significant compromise , but it was one I was willing to make to lessen the emotional load on the actors . " In filming a confrontation involving Hank , Jacob and Lou , Kivilo said , “ Most of the lighting came from shallow soft boxes mounted into the low ceilings . We used two cameras throughout . The scene was such an odd mixture of dealing with dark human moments and very detailed technical considerations . Very draining for everybody . ” In depicting the resulting shootout , Kivilo 's intent was to " keep things quite sketchy in the lighting and not be clear about exactly what was happening . " The camera department lit a China ball from the ceiling to depict a dimly lit kitchen light that would reveal Nancy holding a shotgun . Flash photography guns were used to depict the muzzle flashes during the shootouts . Kivilo said , " Those flash guns are great because they have a long burn time and you don 't run the danger of having the flash occur between exposures . The flashes were daylight @-@ balanced , but we put double CTO on them to give them a slightly warmer feel . This was something that we had determined through testing in preproduction . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 A Simple Plan 's film score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman , who was drawn to the project after learning that Raimi would be directing the film ; the film marked his third collaboration with Raimi . The instruments included alto and bass flutes , re @-@ tuned pianos and banjos , zithers , and hand drums . 
 Regarding the tonal quality of the score , Elfman explained , " ... there are 2 thematic areas , one of them was a flute ensemble . It was a fun orchestra for me to work with because there was really no brass , no percussion . It was just strings and flutes , lots of flutes , 9 of them , mostly alto and bass . That was kind of a fun different thing , very , very simple , sparse ensemble led by alto and bass flutes . The other part of it [ were ] these specially tuned pianos that I prepared before I started and specially tuned banjos so I worked the music around the sounds of these micro @-@ tuned piano chords and special banjo samples that I did myself . I tried to make the heart of it . Starting with these two odd tonal groups , I started composing the score . " The soundtrack album , titled A Simple Plan : Music from the Motion Picture Soundtrack , was released on January 26 , 1999 .

 A Simple Plan received critical acclaim from mainstream film critics . Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes sampled 67 reviews , and gave the film a " Certified Fresh " score of 90 % , with an average score of 8 @.@ 2 out of 10 . The website 's consensus calls the film " A riveting crime thriller full of emotional tension . " Another review aggregator , Metacritic , assigned the film a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 , based on 28 reviews from mainstream critics , indicating " universal acclaim " . 
 Reviewing the film during the Toronto International Film Festival , Glen Lovell of Variety , compared A Simple Plan to Joel and Ethan Coen 's earlier film Fargo ( 1996 ) : " Both [ films ] are slices of life about outlandish crimes and Average Joe felons in over their heads , and both blend Grand Guignol and beautiful but foreboding snowscapes ... The key differences are in emphasis and tone : Fargo is deadpan noir ; A Simple Plan ... is a more robust Midwestern Gothic that owes as much to Poe as Chandler . " 
 In an " early review " of the film prior to its limited release , Roger Ebert and his colleague , Gene Siskel , gave the film a " Two Thumbs Up " rating on their syndicated television program Siskel and Ebert and the Movies . In a later episode , Ebert ranked A Simple Plan at number four on his list of the " Best Films of 1998 " . Online film critic James Berardinelli praised Billy Bob Thornton 's performance as being " the most striking that A Simple Plan has to offer . " He also praised the other performers , writing " Paxton 's part is deceptively complex in the way he shows how paranoia , greed , and deception can erode the conscience of even the best @-@ intentioned of men . Brent Briscoe plays Lou as the most untrustworthy and avaricious of souls . And Bridget Fonda offers solid support as a woman who stands by her man – when she 's not taking control of his life , that is . " 
 Sam Raimi was repeatedly praised for his direction . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the film was " lean , elegant , and emotionally complex – a marvel of backwoods classicism " and that it was " proof that Raimi , after the <unk> Evil Dead series and the lushly operatic Darkman , has now grown into a filmmaker of ravishing maturity and skill . " Siskel , writing for the Chicago Tribune , said that the film was " an exceedingly well @-@ directed genre picture by [ Raimi ] ... [ who ] does an excellent job of presaging the lethal violence that follows . From his very first images we know that bodies are going to start to pile up . " Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film a " quietly devastating thriller directed by [ Raimi ] ... who makes a flawless segue into mainstream storytelling . " Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote , " ... for Raimi , whose mastery of visual effects has driven all of his previous films , A Simple Plan marks a tremendously successful break from the past . He 's drawn lovely , complex performances from Paxton and Thornton and proven that he can work effectively – and movingly – in a minor emotional key . " 
 While reviews of the film were mostly positive , A Simple Plan was not without its detractors . Regarding the plot and characters , Richard Schickel of Time wrote , " There 's neither intricacy nor surprise in the narrative , and these dopes are tedious , witless company . " Schlomo Schwartzberg of Boxoffice wrote , " Instead of unfolding as a subtle , powerful delineation of quiet desperation warping and destroying people 's lives through greed , A Simple Plan <unk> up the story with unnecessary acts of violence and murder , and mainly stays on the surface , offering little more than cheap jolts of melodrama .

 = Joseph 's Tomb = 
 Joseph 's Tomb ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> , <unk> Yosef , Arabic : <unk> <unk> , Qabr Yūsuf ) is a funerary monument located at the eastern entrance to the valley that separates Mounts Gerizim and Ebal , 300 metres northwest of Jacob 's Well , on the outskirts of the West Bank city of Nablus , near Tell Balata , the site of <unk> in the Late Bronze Age and later biblical Shechem . One biblical tradition identifies the general area of Shechem as the resting @-@ place of the biblical patriarch Joseph , and his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh . 
 Joseph 's tomb has been venerated throughout the ages by Jews , Samaritans , Christians and Muslims . Post @-@ biblical records regarding the location of Joseph 's Tomb at this site date from the beginning of the 4th @-@ century AD . The present structure , a small rectangular room with a cenotaph , dates from 1868 , and is devoid of any trace of ancient building materials . While some scholars , such as Kenneth Kitchen and James K. <unk> still affirm the essential historicity of the biblical account of Joseph , many others , such as Donald B. Redford , argue that the story itself has ‘ no basis in fact ’ . 
 Modern scholarship has yet to determine whether or not the present cenotaph is to be identified with the ancient biblical gravesite . No Jewish or Christian sources prior to the 5th century mention the tomb , and the structure originally erected over it appears to have been built by the Samaritans , for whom it was probably a sacred site . There is no archaeological evidence establishing the tomb to Joseph and for this reason the site is regarded as a ' relic tomb ' , established by later religious figures to reinforce a faith . 
 At key points in its long history , Joseph 's Tomb has witnessed intense sectarian conflict . Samaritans and Christians disputing access and title to the site in the early Byzantine period often engaged in violent clashes . After Israel captured the West Bank in 1967 , Muslims were prohibited from worship at the shrine and it was gradually turned into a Jewish prayer room . Interreligious friction and conflict from competing Jewish and Muslim claims over the tomb became frequent . Falling under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority ( PNA ) following the signing of the Oslo Accords , it remained under IDF guard with Muslims prohibited from praying there . At the beginning of the Al @-@ Aqsa Intifada in 2000 , just after being handed over to the PNA , it was looted and razed by a Palestinian mob . Following the reoccupation of Nablus during Israel 's Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 , Jewish groups returned there intermittently . Between 2009 and 2010 the structure was refurbished , with a new cupola installed , and visits by Jewish worshippers have resumed .

 The Torah provides four details regarding the traditions surrounding Joseph ’ s remains . The account in Genesis relates that , before his death , he had his brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan . He is then said to have been embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt . In Exodus , we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph 's bones with him when he left Egypt . In Joshua , Joseph ’ s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by the Children of Israel and interred in Shechem . 
 The bones of Joseph , which the Children of Israel brought up out of Egypt , were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of <unk> , father of Shechem , for a hundred pieces of silver ( <unk> ) <unk> 24 : 32 . 
 The Bible does not identify a specific site in Shechem where his bones were laid to rest . The Genesis <unk> , a Jewish text written c . 400 – 450 CE , states that a burial site in Shechem is one of three for which the nations of the world cannot ridicule Israel and say " you have stolen them , " it having been purchased by Jacob . The rabbis also suggest that Joseph instructed his brothers to bury him in Shechem since it was from there he was taken and sold into slavery . Other Jewish sources have him buried either in Safed , or , according to an <unk> tradition , have him interred at Hebron according to his own wishes . The ambiguity is reflected in Islamic tradition which points to Nablus as being the authentic site , though some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb . The Qur 'an itself does not mention details of Joseph 's burial . Ali of Herat ( 1119 ) , Yaqut ( 1229 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1369 ) all conserve both the Nablus and Hebron traditions . Later Muslim chroniclers also mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb , near Beit <unk> . The Hebron tradition is also reflected in some medieval Christian sources , such as the account by <unk> ( CE 1102 ) who says that ' the bones of Joseph were buried more humbly than the rest , as it were at the extremity of the <unk> 
 = = = Modern scholarship on the narrative of Joseph ’ s bones = = = 
 Though the traditional biblical date for the narrative of Joseph ’ s life and death places him in Egypt in the middle of the Twelfth Dynasty , roughly comparable to the Hyksos invasion of Egypt , contemporary scholarship no longer accepts such a remote dating . The figure of Joseph itself is often taken to be a ‘ personification of a tribe ’ , rather than an historic person . 
 According to the Bible , Joseph was embalmed and buried in a coffin in Egypt , after having his people swear to carry his bones away . Later midrash identify his first entombment in a royal mausoleum , or as cast into the Nile . Moses is said to have gathered the bones and taken them with him during the Exodus from Egypt , using magic to raise the coffin , a tradition repeated by Josephus , who specifies that they were buried in Canaan at that time . Regarding his burial in Canaan , from Joshua it is evident that the portion Joseph received was an allotment near Shechem , not the town itself . 
 The majority of contemporary scholars believe the historicity of the events in the Joseph story cannot be demonstrated . In the wake of scholars like Hermann <unk> , Hugo <unk> and Gerhard von Rad , who identified the story of Joseph as primarily a literary composition , it is now widely considered to belong to the genre of romance , or the novella . As a novella it is read as reworking legends and myths , many of them , especially the motifs of his reburial in Canaan , associated with the Egyptian god Osiris , though some compare the burial of his bones at Shechem with the disposal of Dionysus ’ s bones at Delphi . The reworked legends and folklore were probably inserted into the developing textual tradition of the Bible between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE . Most scholars place its composition in a genre that flourished in the Persian period of the Exile . 
 For Schenke , the tradition of Joseph 's burial at Shechem can only be understood as a secondary , <unk> historical interpretation woven around a more ancient Canaanite shrine in that area . Wright has indeed argued that , ' the patriarch Joseph was not an Israelite hero who became <unk> , but an Egyptian divinity who was <unk> 
 = = = Schenke 's hypothesis = = = 
 Hans @-@ Martin Schenke , starting from an analysis of John 4 : 4 – 6 , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town <unk> , made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources , together with an examination of the site . The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field , and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph 's Tomb , despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted to Joseph , and Jacob 's well . In Schenke 's view , from the beginning of the Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE , when the author of John 's gospel was presumably writing , the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob 's Well . This grave was shifted , together with the sacred tree and Jacob 's field , sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE . , which locates it elsewhere , by Shechem / Tel <unk> .

 The Itinerarium <unk> ( 333 CE ) notes : ‘ At the foot of the mountain itself , is a place called <unk> . Here is a tomb in which Joseph is laid , in the parcel of ground which Jacob his father gave to him . " Eusebius of Caesarea in the 4th @-@ century records in his Onomasticon : " <unk> , city of Jacob now deserted . The place is pointed out in the suburb of Neapolis . There the tomb of Joseph is pointed out nearby . " Jerome , writing of Saint Paula 's sojourn in Palestine writes that ' turning off the way ( from Jacob 's well ) , she saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs ' Jerome himself , together with the Byzantine monk George Syncellus , who had lived many years in Palestine , wrote that all twelve patriarchs , Joseph included , were buried at <unk> . 
 Both Theodosius I and Theodosius II ordered a search for Joseph ’ s bones , much to the utter dismay of the Samaritan community . An imperial commission was dispatched to retrieve the bones of the Patriarchs around 415 CE , and on failing to obtain them at Hebron , sought to at least secure Joseph ’ s bones from Shechem . No gravestone marked the exact site , possibly because the Samaritans had removed one to avoid Christian interference . The officials had to excavate the general area where graves abound and , on finding an intact marble sepulchre beneath an empty coffin , concluded that it must contain Joseph ’ s bones , and sent the sarcophagus to Byzantium , where it was incorporated into Hagia Sophia . Jerome reports that apparently the Christians had intended to remove Joseph 's bones to their city , but a column of fire rose skyward from the tomb scaring them away . The Samaritans subsequently covered the tomb with earth rendering it inaccessible . 
 Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius ( 518 – 520 ) in his De situ terrae <unk> mentions that ' close to Jacob 's Well are the remains of Joseph the Holy ' . The Madaba Mosaic Map ( 6th century ) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – ' Joseph 's ' ( τὸ τοῦ <unk> ) – where the usual adjective ' holy ' ( <unk> ) accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines is lacking . 
 Crusader and medieval sources generally are , according to Hans @-@ Martin Schenke , highly misleading regarding exactly where the tomb was situated . He concluded that in the Middle Ages , as earlier , various groups ( Jews , Samaritans , Christians and Moslems ) at different periods identified different things in different places all as Joseph ’ s tomb Sometimes Balata , with its spring , seems indicated , as in the following two examples , which identify the tomb not as a structure , but as something by a spring and under a tree . It was evidently a site for Muslim pilgrimage at that time . 
 In 1173 the Persian traveller al @-@ Harawi paid homage at the tomb , and wrote : 
 There is also near <unk> the spring of Al Khudr ( Elias ) , and the field of <unk> as Sadik ( Joseph ) ; further , Joseph is buried at the foot of the tree at this place . ’ 
 Around the year 1225 , Yaqut al @-@ Hamawi wrote : 
 There is here a spring called ‘ Ain al Khudr . <unk> ( Joseph ) as Sadik – peace be on him ! - was buried here , and his tomb is well known , lying under the tree . 
 as did Benjamin of Tudela — who wrote that the Samaritans in Nablus were in possession of it . William of Malmesbury describes it as overlaid with white marble , next to the mausolea of his brothers . Menachem ben Peretz of Hebron ( 1215 ) writes that in Shechem he saw the tomb of Joseph son of Jacob with two marble pillars next to it — one at its head and another at its foot — and a low stone wall surrounding it . <unk> <unk> ( 1322 ) places the tombstone of Joseph 450 meters north of <unk> , while Alexander de <unk> ( 1463 ) and Francesco <unk> ( 1485 ) associate it with the church over Jacob ’ s well . Samuel bar Simson ( 1210 ) , Jacob of Paris ( 1258 ) , and Johannes <unk> ( 1422 ) locate it by Nablus . Gabriel <unk> of Nuremberg discerns a tomb to Joseph in a monument to the west of Nablus , halfway between that city and Sebaste . Mandeville ( 1322 ) and Maundrell ( 1697 ) , among others , also mention its existence , although it is debatable as to whether any of these reports refer to the currently recognised location . Samuel ben Samson ( 1210 ) appears to place the tomb at Shiloh . Mandeville ( 1322 ) locates it ' nigh beside ' Nablus as does Maundrell ( 1697 ) , but the indications are vague . Maundrell describes his sepulchre as located in a small mosque just by Nablus , which does not fit the present location . 
 Although the Koran does not mention details of Joseph 's burial , Islamic tradition points to Nablus as being the authentic site . However , some early Islamic geographers identified the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron as housing his tomb . While Ali of Herat ( 1119 ) , Yaqut ( 1229 ) and Ibn Battuta ( 1369 ) all report the Hebron traditions , they also mention the existence of a tomb of Joseph at Nablus . Later Muslim chroniclers even mention a third site purporting to be the authentic tomb , near Beit <unk> .

 William Cooke Taylor ( 1838 ) describes the biblical parcel of ground Jacob gave to Joseph as situated on plain of <unk> , and identifies the tomb as an oriental <unk> structure at the entrance to the valley of Nablus , to the right near the base of Mt Ebal . The sarcophagus , he suggests , lies underneath or somewhere else in the vicinity of this plain , and comments : 
 'The present monument ... is a place of resort , not only for Jews and Christians , but Mohammedans and Samaritans ; all of whom concur in the belief that it stands on the <unk> spot where the patriarch was <unk> 
 In 1839 , the Jewish traveller Loewe based his identification of the tomb as near Jacob 's Well by a topographical argument . Scripture , he argued , calls the place neither an <unk> ( valley ) nor a <unk> ( plain ) , but a ' portion of field ' ( <unk> <unk> ) , and concluded : ' in the whole of Palestine there is not such another plot to be found , a dead level , without the least hollow or swelling in a circuit of two hours . ' In 1839 , it was recorded that Jews frequently visited the tomb and that many inscriptions in Hebrew were visible on the walls . The site was " kept very neat and in good repair by the bounty of Jews who visited it . " 
 John Wilson ( 1847 ) writes that the tomb lies about two or three hundred yards to the north of Jacob 's Well , across the valley . He describes it as ' a small solid erection in the form of a wagon roof , over what is supposed to be the patriarch ’ s grave , with a small pillar or altar at each of its extremities , sometimes called the tombs of Ephraim and Manasseh , and the middle of an enclosure without a covering . Many visitors names , in the Hebrew and Samaritan characters , are written on the walls of this enclosure . ' One of the inscriptions is said to intimate the tomb 's repair by a Jew from Egypt , Elijah son of Meir , around 1749 . Wilson adds that ' The Jews of Nablus take upon themselves the duty of keeping the tomb in order . They applied to us for a subscription to aid in making some repairs and we complied with their request ' . These Hebrew and Samaritan inscriptions were still visible on the white plastered walls as late as 1980 , as were small lamps in an internal recess , probably donated by Jews during the 18th and 19th centuries . 
 Rabbi Joseph Schwarz ( 1850 ) who had lived in Palestine for 16 years , identified the village of <unk> , ' about 2 English miles east of Shechem ' , as the site ' where Joseph lies buried ' . Western travellers to Palestine in the 19th century described their impressions of the site in travelogues . John Ross Browne ( 1853 ) writes : ' We also visited the reputed site of Joseph 's Tomb . A rude stone building covers the pretended sepulcher ; but the best authorities deny that there was any evidence that Joseph was buried here . ' Howard Crosby also visited the site during 1851 . He designated it , ' the so @-@ called tomb of Joseph , ' describing it as ' a plain white Santon 's tomb , or Wely , such as is everywhere seen in Mohammedan countries , excepting that this one is roofless , and consequently lacks the usual white dome . In the interior , a vine grows from a corner , and spreads upon a trellis over the tomb , forming a pleasant bower . ' Louis Félicien Joseph <unk> de <unk> and Edouard de Warren ( 1853 ) describe it as ' a small <unk> <unk> ( <unk> , i.e. chapel ) [ ... ] said to be the tomb of Joseph , ' noting it was just to the east of what the Arabs called Bir @-@ Yakub , Jacob 's Well . Hackett noted in 1857 that the tomb is placed diagonally to the walls , instead of parallel , and found ' the walls of the interior covered with the names of pilgrims , representing almost every land and language ; though the Hebrew character was the most prominent one . ' Thomson noted in 1883 that ' the entire building is fast crumbling to ruin , presenting a most melancholy spectacle . ' Being exposed to the weather , ' it has no pall or votive offering of any kind , nor any marks of respect such as are seen at the sepulchres of the most insignificant Muslim saints . ' During the late 19th century , sources report the Jewish custom of burning small articles such as gold lace , shawls or handkerchiefs , in the two low pillars at either end of the tomb . This was done in " memory of the patriarch who sleeps beneath " .

 Claude R. Conder provides a detailed description of the site in his works Tent Work in Palestine ( 1878 ) , Survey of Western Palestine ( 1881 ) and Palestine ( 1889 ) . 
 The enclosure 
 It is located on the road @-@ side from Balata to ‘ Askar , at the end of a row of fine fig trees . The open courtyard surrounding the tomb measures about 18 foot ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) square . The plastered , whitewashed walls , about 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) thick , are in good repair and stand 10 foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . Entrance to the courtyard is from the north through the ruin of a little square domed building . There are two Hebrew inscriptions on the south wall . An additional English inscription notes that the structure was entirely rebuilt at the expense of the English consul at Damascus by early 1868 . 
 The tomb itself measures 6 foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) long and stands 4 foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) high . It consisted of a long narrow plastered block with an arched roof , having a pointed cross section . The tomb is not in line with the walls of the courtyard , which have a bearing of 202 ° , nor is it in the middle of the enclosure , being nearest to the west wall . Two short plastered pedestals with shallow cup @-@ shaped hollows at their tops stand at the head and foot of the tomb . The hollows are blackened by fire due to the Jewish custom of burning offerings of shawls , silks or gold lace on the pillar altars . Both Jews and Samaritans burn oil lamps and incense in the pillar cavity . 
 Conder also questions the fact that the tomb points north to south , inconsistent with Muslim tombs north of Mecca . This fact did not however diminish Muslim veneration of the shrine : 
 " The tomb points approximately north and south , thus being at right angles to the direction of Moslem tombs north of Mecca . How the Mohammedans explain this disregard of orientation in so respected a Prophet as " our Lord Joseph , " I have never heard ; perhaps the rule is held to be only established since the time of Mohammed . The veneration in which the shrine is held by the Moslem peasantry is , at all events , not diminished by this fact . "

 In the course of pin @-@ pointing the location of the tomb , the Reverend H.B. Hackett in Sir William Smith 's A dictionary of the Bible ( 1863 ) mentions the existence of two tombs bearing an association to Joseph in Nablus . In addition to the one close to the well , ( location of Conder 's survey ) , he describes another exclusively Muslim tomb in the vicinity , about a quarter of a mile up the valley on the slope of Mt . Gerizim . He is not able to conclude which of the tombs is that of the biblical Joseph , but cites Arthur Penrhyn Stanley ( 1856 ) that at the Muslim tomb " a later Joseph is also commemorated at the sanctuary . " Stanley himself writes that the little mosque on Gerizim 's north @-@ eastern slopes is known by various names including Allon Moreh ( Oak of Allon ) , Aharon Moreh ( Ark of Moreh ) and Sheykh al @-@ Amad ( Saint of the Pillar ) which he suggests commemorate <unk> traditions . Stanley also quotes Buckingham , who mentions that the Samaritans maintain that the alternative tomb belongs to a certain Rabbi Joseph of Nablus . John Mills ( 1864 ) writes that claims of the tomb belonging to Rabbi Joseph of Nablus are unfounded , the structure being called by the Samaritans " The Pillar " in commemoration of the pillar set up by Joshua . Mills rather identifies the supposed rabbi 's tomb with a mosque named after a Muslim saint , Sheikh el @-@ <unk> ( " Saint of the Pillar " ) , but further claims that the association is ' only a modern invention of the Mohammedans ' . A book published in 1894 , also questions the existence of a tomb to Rabbi Joseph of Nablus , calling it ' a Mohammedan legend , imposed upon inquisitive travellers by unscrupulous guides ' since ' the present Samaritans known of no Joseph 's tomb but the generally accepted one ' . 
 By the 1860s , many Jews and Muslims had come to see the limestone structure as housing the tomb of the biblical Joseph , and it was referred to in Arabic as " Qabr en @-@ Nabi Yūsuf " ( " Tomb of the Prophet Joseph " ) . A decorative cloth photographed in 1917 , draped over the tomb itself , asserted this perception . Palestinians are also said to regard the site as the burial place of Yūsuf <unk> , an Islamic sheikh . It has been claimed that this tradition is an innovation in response to Israeli control of the site since the 1970s . 
 = = = After 1967 = = = 
 Before 1967 , the tomb was still located in a field in the village of Balata on the outskirts of Nablus . Local residents apparently believed the structure entombed a 19th @-@ century cleric who was reputed to have healed the sick by reciting Koranic verses . Although the building did not function as a mosque , it was used by childless couples who would pray there for children , and young boys would take their first ritual haircut inside . After the capture of Nablus and the rest of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 war , Jewish settlers began to frequent the site , and by 1975 , Muslims were prohibited from visiting the site . After a settler was stabbed in Nablus in 1983 , other settlers demonstrated by taking over Joseph 's tomb for three days in a bid to force the government 's hand into using an iron fist . In the mid @-@ 1980s a yeshiva named Od Yosef Chai , ( Joseph Still Lives ) , affiliated with some of the more militant Jewish settlements , and headed by Yitzhak Ginsburg , was built at the site beside an Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) military outpost , apparently on the model of settler success in establishing a presence at the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron . All Muslims including those living nearby were forcefully denied access . An initial attempt in 1994 to transform the site into a Jewish religious centre failed . <unk> <unk> , minister for culture and education in the Rabin government , outraged religious activists at the time by asserting , on the basis of archeological evidence , that the site was only 200 years old , and the tomb that of Sheikh Yūsuf ( <unk> ) , a Sufi holy man who died in the 18th century . Her views were challenged by Benny <unk> who replied that she had been misled by archeologists , and he had experts to back the traditional ascription . In 1997 Torah scrolls were brought in , the prayer niche facing Mecca was covered , and the site was declared a synagogue and yeshiva . Attaching the religious tradition surrounding the story of Joseph to the site , the settlers received protection from the IDF to transform this place of Muslim worship into one of their own . A curfew lasting 24 hours was once imposed by the IDF on Nablus 's 120 @,@ 000 inhabitants to allow a group of settlers and 2 Likud Knesset members to pray at the site . On the traditional anniversary of Joseph 's death on the 27th of Tammuz , hundreds of Jews would arrive at the site . 
 On December 12 , 1995 , in accordance with the Oslo Accords , jurisdiction of Nablus was handed over to the Palestinian National Authority , though Israel retained control of several religious sites , one of which was Joseph ’ s Tomb , thus sanctioning the fraught situation . Settler apprehensions that the area might be returned to Palestinians worked to enhance the status of Joseph 's tomb as a centre of pilgrimage . The Interim Agreement stipulated that : ' Both sides shall respect and protect the religious rights of Jews , Christians , Muslims and Samaritans concerning the protection and free access to the holy sites as well as freedom of worship and practice . ' The tomb , resembling a fortified military post with a small functioning yeshiva , became a frequent flash point . On September 24 , 1996 ( Also called <unk> 1996 events part of the Western wall riots ( 1996 ) ) , after the opening of an exit for the Hasmonean Tunnel under the <unk> madrasah , which Palestinians interpreted as a signal Benjamin Netanyahu was sending that Israel was to be the sole sovereign of Jerusalem , the PNA called for a general strike and a wave of protests broke out throughout the West Bank . In clashes , 7 Palestinians were killed and 253 wounded in the West Bank while six Israeli soldiers were killed at the tomb , and parts of the adjacent yeshiva were ransacked . Jews continued to worship at the site under limited protection of the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) , often dressed as civilians easily mistaken for settlers . During , The site had been attacked by gun fire , and hundreds of Palestinian stormed the compound , Israeli border control took control over the compound but Palestinian security services requested to take control over the positions and the control was passed to Palestinian security <unk> in the following hours the mob put cars outside the compound ablaze entered the tomb and removed the Morus tree , the last known image of the Morus tree [ 1 ] was taken during 2006 . 
 Over the year and a half between 1999 and 2000 , the IDF , seconded by the Shin Bet and the Israeli Border Police , had asked the government to evacuate the tomb . In September 2000 , in the wake of Ariel Sharon ’ s controversial visit to the Temple Mount , the Al @-@ Aqsa Intifada broke out , and Nablus turned into conflict zone , in part after its governor ’ s son was shot dead during a clash with Israeli soldiers . The Palestinians targeted the site , reportedly on the grounds that it was better for the shrine to belong to no one than to be appropriated by just one religion , burning the yeshiva to the ground , incinerating its books and painting the dome green , an act which led to retaliation with Jewish vandalism of three mosques in Tiberias and Jaffa . After the death of an Israeli border policeman the head of the IDF ’ s southern command , Brigadier @-@ General Yom @-@ Tov Samia , threatened to resign if the government kept control of the tomb , since retaining control of it was ‘ patently illegal . ’ Prime Minister Ehud Barak eventually complied with the request and the site was handed over to the Palestinian police on October 7 , 2000 . Israeli newspapers framed the return of the site as a humiliating defeat for the nation . The tomb was pillaged and torched by Palestinian protesters hours after its evacuation . The next morning , the bullet @-@ riddled body of rabbi Hillel Lieberman of Elon Moreh , a cousin of Senator Joseph Lieberman , was found on the outskirts of Nablus , where he had gone to check damage to the tomb . Joseph ’ s Tomb embodied a key Zionist theme : the return from exile to one ’ s homeland , and the Palestinian assault has been interpreted as challenging the credibility of claims to the site . The PA began to repair it the next day . Palestinian spokesperson Hanan Ashrawi claimed that Judaism 's connection with the tomb was ' fabricated ' . The mayor of Nablus Ghassan Shakaa was reported as saying Jewish worshippers would not be permitted to pray there until an international organization or third party determines whether the site is holy to Moslems or Jews . 
 Israeli military officials said the Palestinians intended to build a mosque on the ruins of the site . The statement came after workers repairing the tomb painted the site 's dome green , the colour of Islam . A Palestinian Authority spokesman denied the allegations and said that Arafat had ordered the renovations and for the synagogue to be rebuilt . Ghassan Shakaa , the mayor , claimed that city officials simply wanted to return the building to the way it looked before it came into Israeli hands in the 1967 Mideast war . Under intense U.S. and international pressure the dome was repainted white .

 After the events of October 2000 , the IDF prohibited Israeli access to the tomb . As a result of Operation Defensive Shield , Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002 , with severe damage to the historic core of the city , where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed . Some Breslov hasidim and others began to take advantage of the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness , evading army and police checkpoints . Eventually Joseph ’ s tomb was once more open to visits . In May 2002 , Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb . Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone . As a result of Operation Defensive Shield , the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards , in response to numerous requests , they renewed guarded tours of the tomb . One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite . These visits were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits , mainly by <unk> <unk> . However , in October , citing security reasons , Israel re @-@ imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb . 
 In February 2003 it was reported in the Jerusalem Post that the grave had been pounded with hammers and that the tree at its entrance had been broken ; car parts and trash littered the tomb which had a " huge hole in its dome . " <unk> leader Aaron Klieger notified and lobbied government ministers about the desecration , but the IDF said it had no plans to secure or guard the site , claiming such action would be too costly . 
 In February 2007 , thirty five Knesset members ( <unk> ) wrote to the army asking them to open Joseph 's Tomb to Jewish visitors for prayer . In May 2007 , Breslov hasidim visited the site for the first time in two years and later on that year , a group of hasidim found that the gravesite had been cleaned up by the Palestinians . In the past few years the site had suffered from neglect and its appearance had deteriorated , with garbage being dumped and tires being burned there . 
 In early 2008 , a group of <unk> wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking that the tomb be renovated : " The tombstone is completely shattered , and the holy site is desecrated in an appalling manner , the likes of which we have not seen in Israel or anywhere else in the world . " In February , it was reported that Israel would officially ask the Palestinian Authority to carry out repairs at the tomb , but in response , vandals set tires on fire inside the tomb . In December 2008 , Jewish workers funded by anonymous donors painted the blackened walls and re @-@ built the shattered stone marker covering the grave . 
 As of 2009 , monthly visits to the tomb in bullet @-@ proof vehicles under heavy IDF protection are organised by the <unk> based organization Shechem <unk> . In late April 2009 , a group of Jewish worshipers found the headstone smashed and swastikas painted on the walls , as well as boot prints on the grave itself . 
 In August 2010 , it was reported that the IDF and the Palestinian Authority reached an agreement on renovating the site . Israel 's chief rabbis , Yona Metzger and Shlomo Amar , visited and prayed at the tomb along with 500 other worshippers , the first such visit by a high @-@ ranking Israeli delegation in 10 years . 
 On 24 April 2011 , Palestinian Authority police officers opened fire on three cars of Israeli worshipers after they finished praying at Joseph 's tomb . An Israeli citizen was killed and three others were wounded . The fatality was identified as Ben @-@ Joseph <unk> , 25 , the nephew of Culture Minister <unk> <unk> . Both the Israel Defense Forces and Palestinian Authority ordered investigations into the incident . According to an initial investigation , three cars full of Israelis entered the compound of Joseph 's tomb without coordination with the Israeli military or Palestinian security forces and then tried to break through a Palestinian Authority police checkpoint . The IDF investigation concluded that the Palestinian police officers had acted " maliciously " and with the intent to harm the Jewish worshipers . IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz added that they fired " without justification and with no immediate threat to their lives . " 
 On 7 July 2014 , Palestinians tried to burn down Joseph 's tomb while protesting . Palestinian Authority security forces were able to stop the protesters before they were able to burn it down . On December 22 , 2014 , Jews who were visiting the tomb to light candles for the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah discovered that the site had been vandalized . Lights were broken and electrical wiring had been cut . It was the first time Jews were allowed to visit the tomb in over a month . 
 On 16 October 2015 , amid a wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis , dozens of Palestinians overran the tomb and a group of them set it on fire with petrol bombs . Palestinian security forces dispersed them and extinguished the flames ; and although the tomb itself was not apparently damaged , the women 's section was reported to be heavily damaged . Israeli security forces later arrived at the scene . According to a Palestinian official , the Palestinians had attempted to set up barricades in the area to prevent home demolitions by the Israeli Army , but a group of them proceeded to attack the tomb . 
 At 2 a.m. on the night of 18 October 2015 , a group of 30 Jews , on instruction from Rabbi Eliezer Berland , went to the tomb without permits , in contravention of a standing IDF order , to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before . As they were attacked by local Palestinians , six of them were bruised by beatings , and one of their vehicles was burnt . They claimed that the Palestinian police , who had detained them , had also beaten them , before they were handed over to the Israeli army , which had been called to extract the others . 
 = 26th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 26th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army . Originally raised in April 1915 for service in World War I as part of the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) , it was assigned to the 7th Brigade and consisted of personnel recruited from the states of Queensland and Tasmania . The battalion fought at Gallipoli in the latter stages of that campaign before being withdrawn to Egypt in late 1915 . In mid @-@ 1916 , it was sent to Europe where it served in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Belgium for the rest of the war , fighting in most of the battles that the Australians took part in between 1916 and 1918 . At the end of the war it was disbanded in May 1919 as part of the demobilisation of the AIF . 
 During the inter @-@ war years , the 26th Battalion was re @-@ raised as a part @-@ time unit of the Citizens Forces , known as the 26th Battalion ( Logan and Albert Regiment ) , based in Queensland . In 1934 , the 26th was merged with another Queensland @-@ based infantry battalion , the 15th Battalion , to become the 15th / 26th Battalion . The two units were subsequently delinked in 1939 when the new 26th Australian Infantry Battalion was raised in Queensland as Australia mobilised for war . 
 The battalion was assigned to the 11th Brigade at this time and used in various garrison roles in the early part of World War II before a detachment was sent to the Dutch East Indies as part of Merauke Force in 1943 . Later in the war , the entire 26th Battalion , along with the rest of the 11th Brigade , was committed to the Bougainville campaign where they saw action against the Japanese from late 1944 until the end of hostilities in August 1945 . After the war , the 26th Battalion was used to guard Japanese prisoners on Rabaul , remaining there until March 1946 , before returning to Australia for demobilisation . It was subsequently disbanded in August 1946 .

 The 26th Battalion was originally raised in April 1915 as part of the all volunteer Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . Drawing recruits from Tasmania and Queensland , the battalion concentrated at Enoggera , Queensland , where it formed part of the 7th Brigade , which was attached to the 2nd Division . The battalion 's first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel George Ferguson . With an authorised strength of 1 @,@ 023 men , after a short period of basic training , the battalion 's first draft – consisting of two companies of Queenslanders – embarked for overseas in May . They were followed by the two Tasmanian companies in late June . Further training was undertaken in Egypt , after which the battalion was sent to Gallipoli when the 2nd Division was despatched to the peninsula to reinforce the troops that had been fighting there since April . The 26th Battalion landed on 12 September . By that time , the campaign had become a costly stalemate and shortly after their arrival , as winter came and conditions worsened , the decision was made to evacuate the peninsula . As a result , the battalion did not take part in any major actions , and fulfilled only a defensive role , defending positions such as " Courtney 's Post " , " Steel 's Post " and " Russell 's Top " , before it was withdrawn from the peninsula on 12 December . Casualties during this first campaign amounted to 26 killed and 96 wounded . In addition , over 500 personnel were evacuated as sick with about half returning to duty . 
 After the evacuation , the 26th Battalion returned to Egypt where the AIF was reorganised and expanded before being sent to Europe . The 26th arrived in France in March 1916 , taking its place in the trenches along the Western Front the following month . In early June , alongside the 28th Battalion , they took part in the first raid undertaken by Australians in France , attacking German trenches around Bois Grenier . Their first major battle came around Pozières between July and August , after which the battalion was sent along with the entire 2nd Division to a quieter sector in Belgium having suffered over 650 casualties . After this , in November they were moved south to the Somme Valley and throughout the month the 26th participated in two attacks around a position known as " The Maze " , a salient to the east of Flers . Both of these attacks ultimately proved fruitless , grinding to a halt in the muddy conditions , and resulting in over 300 casualties . At the end of November , Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Travers took command of the battalion . 
 The harsh winter of 1916 – 17 was spent occupying defensive positions along the front and training behind the lines . Christmas was spent in the trenches around Amiens , but in early January 1917 , the 26th Battalion was transferred to the Ancre Valley and then to Le Sars later in the month . As the German Army withdrew towards the Hindenburg Line , the 26th was involved in a number of actions at Warlencourt and Lagnicourt in March . During the fighting around Lagnicourt , Captain Percy Cherry led his company into the village , capturing several positions before helping to hold off several German counterattacks ; he was later awarded the Victoria Cross posthumously . Later , in May they joined the Second Battle of Bullecourt , where they were used mainly in a support role during the initial attack , being held back as part of the 2nd Division 's reserve . During the attack , a company from the 26th was detached to help bolster the 5th Brigade , and later it was thrust into the line to help defend the gains after a German counterattack fell on the 6th Brigade 's left flank . After Bullecourt , the battalion was moved to Belgium again , where they joined the battles at Menin Road and <unk> Ridge in September and October . During the first attack , the 26th was in support of the 28th Battalion , but later it led the 7th Brigade 's follow up attack on the second line of defences around Broodseinde . Combined casualties for the two battles were over 400 killed or wounded . 
 In early 1918 , after the fighting on the Eastern Front ended following the collapse of Tsarist Russia , the Germans transferred a large number of divisions to the Western Front and subsequently launched a major offensive that became known as the Spring Offensive . In April 1918 , after the Allies had been pushed steadily back , the 26th Battalion was transferred from the Messines sector south to the Somme and committed to the fighting along with other Australian units . The 26th undertook defensive tasks throughout April and May in various locations including <unk> , <unk> and Ribemont , during which time over a 100 casualties were suffered before the German offensive was eventually halted . After this , throughout June and July the battalion launched a number of " peaceful penetration " operations to take small amounts of the German front line during the lull that followed prior to the final Allied offensive of the war . The first came around Morlancourt on 10 June , while another was undertaken around Monument Wood , near Villers @-@ Bretonneux , on 17 July 1918 . It was during this raid that Lieutenant Albert <unk> earned the battalion 's second Victoria Cross of the war . The battalion was also credited with capturing the first German tank taken by Allied forces – " Mephisto " – during a similar operation a few days earlier . A few months later , in August , the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive , which ultimately brought an end to the war . On the opening day of the offensive , the 26th led the 7th Brigade 's attack around Villers @-@ Bretonneux . After a period in reserve , in late August they advanced on the brigade 's left during an attack at Biaches which saw the Allies push towards the Somme River . The following month they took part in the attack on Mont St Quentin , during which they experienced heavy machine @-@ gun fire . 
 After the Somme was crossed , the 26th joined an attack around <unk> and <unk> on 3 October 1918 , part of the " Beaurevoir Line " , which was the third and final line of the Hindenburg Line defences . During the attack , the 26th followed up the initial gains made in the 7th Brigade 's sector by the 25th Battalion , and attacked the second line of German defences around <unk> , suffering 123 casualties , including 21 killed . Shortly after this , the 26th received a batch of reinforcements from the 25th Battalion , which was subsequently disbanded . Nevertheless , the fighting along the Beaurevoir Line was the 26th Battalion 's last contribution to the war and they were withdrawn to <unk> for a rest shortly afterwards . They did not return to the front line before the armistice was declared in November and were subsequently disbanded on 31 May 1919 . The battalion 's last commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel William Davis , who took command of the battalion in mid @-@ October 1918 and remained in command until it was disbanded . 
 During the course of the 26th Battalion 's involvement in the war it lost 877 men killed and 2 @,@ 745 men wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : two Victoria Crosses ( VCs ) , one Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) , four Distinguished Service Orders ( DSOs ) including one Bar , 25 Distinguished Conduct Medals ( DCMs ) , 26 Military Crosses ( MCs ) including three Bars , 96 Military Medals ( MMs ) including four Bars , four Meritorious Service Medals ( MSMs ) , and 37 Mentions in Despatches ( MIDs ) .

 In 1921 , following the completion of the demobilisation process , the AIF was disbanded and the Citizens Forces , Australia 's part @-@ time military force which was responsible for the defence of Australia , was reorganised to perpetuate the battle honours and traditions of the AIF by renumbering the units of the Citizens Force to adopt the numerical designations of their related AIF units . This process had partially commenced in late 1918 , with the introduction of a regimental system within the Citizen Forces , but was adjusted in 1921 when the Citizens Force was reorganised to replicate the AIF 's divisional structure resulting in the formation of single battalions from each regiment . Upon formation during the war , the units of the AIF had been raised from men drawn from the recruitment territory of already established Citizens Force units and as a consequence many AIF units retained links to Citizens Force units from where they drew the majority of the initial intake of personnel . As a result of the reorganisation in 1921 , the 26th Battalion was re @-@ raised as a part @-@ time unit of the Citizens Force , drawing personnel from several battalions of the 26th Infantry Regiment , which traced its history back through the 9th ( Logan and Albert ) Infantry , which had been formed in 1912 . In 1927 , territorial titles were adopted by the units of the Citizens Force , and the battalion adopted the title of the " Logan and Albert Regiment " . It also adopted the motto , <unk> non <unk> , meaning " Never Unprepared " . 
 Initially , the Citizens Forces was maintained using a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , the compulsory training scheme was abolished and replaced with an all volunteer force known as the " Militia " . The decision to suspend compulsory training , coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units . The 26th Battalion was not initially affected , but in 1934 it was merged with the 15th Battalion to form the 15th / 26th Battalion . These two battalions remained linked until just prior to World War II , when on 16 June 1939 , they were split and a new 26th Battalion was raised in Queensland , near Hughenden , within the 1st Military District . Upon re @-@ forming , the battalion was placed under the command of one of the Australian Army 's most decorated soldiers , Lieutenant Colonel Harry Murray , a World War I Victoria Cross recipient . The battalion 's second @-@ in @-@ command was another Victoria Cross recipient , Major Edgar Towner .

 Following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , the 26th Battalion undertook a series of training camps around northern Queensland as it began to re @-@ establish its numbers . Between September and November , it was based around Kissing Point , Queensland , before moving to Townsville in February 1940 , and then south of Bowen the following month . At this time , it was placed under the command of the 11th Brigade , along with the 31st and 51st Battalions , both of which were Queensland @-@ based Militia battalions . In mid @-@ 1940 , the battalion 's strength fluctuated as compulsory service was reintroduced and drafts of national servicemen marched in for short periods of training , while volunteers were released to join the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) and other services . Many of the initial recruits came from Italian @-@ Australian families from north Queensland , but as the battalion grew , reinforcements from other Australian states arrived during 1942 and early 1943 . 
 Throughout 1941 and 1942 , the battalion undertook defensive duties in various locations around Queensland , including Charters Towers , Bohle River , and Alligator Falls . On 17 August 1942 , Murray relinquished command and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel John Abbott . In October , the 26th moved to <unk> , near Barron Falls , and as reinforcements arrived , began training to prepare for deployment overseas . In May 1943 , the battalion moved to Cairns where they embarked on the transport Katoomba and sailed to Horn Island . ' A ' Company was detached at this time to Merauke Force in the Dutch East Indies , becoming the first Militia unit to serve outside of Australian territory . Several other platoons were dispatched to other islands around the Torres Strait . Between August 1943 and November , defensive duties were undertaken on the mainland around the Cape York Peninsula , before the battalion returned to Horn Island . 
 In July 1944 , the 26th Battalion was withdrawn to Australia on board the transport <unk> , and after leave reconstituted at Strathpine , Queensland , and began training for further operations . Gazetted as an AIF unit , which meant it could be deployed outside Australian territory , during December 1944 the battalion deployed to Bougainville as Australian troops from the 3rd Division relieved American forces around Torokina . The Australians subsequently launched three drives on the island in the northern , southern and central areas . Initially , the 26th Battalion was committed to the fighting in the central sector of the island conducting patrolling operations around Numa Numa before being withdrawn to Torokina at the end of January 1945 . In February that year , Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Callinan assumed command , taking over from Abbott . 
 The 26th was then deployed to the Soraken Plantation area , using a series of amphibious landings to clear the area before a brief rest after which they began clearing north towards Ratsua and Ruri Bay , taking over from the 55th / 53rd Battalion . Determined Japanese resistance along the Ratsua front resulted in an amphibious landing by a company from the 31st / 51st Battalion around Porton Plantation , in an effort to outflank Ratsua . Following a series of mishaps , the company that landed around Porton became heavily engaged , and while efforts were made to evacuate them , the 26th Battalion and the rest of the 31st / 51st Battalion attempted to break through from Ratsua . They were unable to penetrate the Japanese lines , however , as they came up against Japanese defenders that were determined to resist because they were unable to withdraw any further along the peninsula . In late June , the 26th Battalion was relieved by the 27th Battalion and sent back to Torokina for rest . Hostilities ceased in August , and the following month the 26th Battalion was sent to Rabaul for garrison duty . In December , Lieutenant Colonel Allan Cameron took command of the battalion . 
 In March 1946 , the 26th Battalion returned to Australia . After this , the battalion experienced a high turn @-@ over of personnel , with over 2 @,@ 500 men passing through the battalion at this time , as men were discharged or transferred to other units . Command of the battalion also changed a couple of times , with Lieutenant Colonel Peter Webster taking over on 22 March , before he handed over to Lieutenant Colonel Eric Barnes . The battalion was finally disbanded on 28 August 1946 , but ' A ' Company remained in existence as a holding company until 25 September 1946 when the last member marched out . 
 During the course of the battalion 's involvement in the war , it lost 40 men killed in action or died on active service and 110 wounded . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : one DSO , two MBEs , one George Medal , one British Empire Medal , five MCs , eight MMs , and 14 MIDs .

 = Yellowstone fires of 1988 = 
 The Yellowstone fires of 1988 together formed the largest wildfire in the recorded history of Yellowstone National Park in the United States . Starting as many smaller individual fires , the flames quickly spread out of control with increasing winds and drought and combined into one large conflagration , which burned for several months . The fires almost destroyed two major visitor destinations and , on September 8 , 1988 , the entire park was closed to all non @-@ emergency personnel for the first time in its history . Only the arrival of cool and moist weather in the late autumn brought the fires to an end . A total of 793 @,@ 880 acres ( 3 @,@ 213 km2 ) , or 36 percent of the park was affected by the wildfires . 
 Thousands of firefighters fought the fires , assisted by dozens of helicopters and fixed @-@ wing aircraft which were used for water and fire retardant drops . At the peak of the effort , over 9 @,@ 000 firefighters were assigned to the park . With fires raging throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and other areas in the western United States , the staffing levels of the National Park Service and other land management agencies were inadequate for the situation ; over 4 @,@ 000 U.S. military personnel were soon brought in to assist in fire suppression efforts . The firefighting effort cost $ 120 million ( $ 240 million in 2016 ) . No firefighters died while fighting Yellowstone fires , though there were two fire @-@ related deaths outside the park . 
 Before the late 1960s , fires were generally believed to be detrimental for parks and forests , and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as quickly as possible . However , as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988 , a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions , which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires . 
 In contrast , in 1988 , Yellowstone was overdue for a large fire , and , in the exceptionally dry summer , the many smaller " controlled " fires combined . The fires burned discontinuously , leaping from one patch to another , leaving intervening areas untouched . Large firestorms swept through some regions , burning everything in their paths . Tens of millions of trees and countless plants were killed by the wildfires , and some regions were left looking blackened and dead . However , more than half of the affected areas were burned by ground fires , which did less damage to hardier tree species . Not long after the fires ended , plant and tree species quickly reestablished themselves , and natural plant regeneration has been highly successful . 
 The Yellowstone fires of 1988 were unprecedented in the history of the National Park Service , and many questioned existing fire management policies . Media accounts of mismanagement were often sensational and inaccurate , sometimes wrongly reporting or implying that most of the park was being destroyed . While there were temporary declines in air quality during the fires , no adverse long @-@ term health effects have been recorded in the ecosystem and contrary to initial reports , few large mammals were killed by the fires , though there has been a reduction in the number of moose which has yet to rebound . Losses to structures were minimized by concentrating firefighting efforts near major visitor areas , keeping property damage down to $ 3 million ( $ 6 million as of 2016 ) . 
 = = Fire management policy development in the United States = = 
 In the eastern United States , with its significant rainfall , wildfires are relatively small and have rarely posed great risk to life and property . As white settlements moved further west into drier areas , the first large scale fires were encountered . Range fires on the Great Plains and forest fires in the Rocky Mountains were far larger and more destructive than what had ever been seen in the east . A number of catastrophic fire events over the years greatly influenced fire management policies . 
 The worst loss of life in United States history due to a wildfire occurred in 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin , killing more than 1500 people . The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger that needed to be suppressed . The Great Fire of 1910 had burned 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people , and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression . U.S. Government land agencies , including the National Park Service , generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service , which oversees the majority of the nation 's forestlands . 
 Before the middle of the 20th century , most forest managers believed that fires should be suppressed at all times . By 1935 , the U.S. Forest Service 's fire management policy stipulated that all wildfires were to be suppressed by 10 A.M. the morning after they were first spotted . Firefighting crews were established throughout public lands , and generally staffed by young men during fire seasons . By 1940 , firefighters known as smokejumpers would parachute out of airplanes to extinguish flames in remote locations . By the beginning of World War II , over 8 @,@ 000 fire lookout towers had been constructed in the United States . Though many have been torn down due to increased use of airplanes for fire spotting , three are still used each year in Yellowstone . Firefighting efforts were highly successful , with the area burned by wildfires reduced from an annual average of 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 120 @,@ 000 km2 ) during the 1930s , to between 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 8 @,@ 100 km2 ) and 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 20 @,@ 000 km2 ) by the 1960s . The need for lumber during World War II was high and fires that destroyed timberland were deemed unacceptable . In 1944 , the U.S. Forest Service developed an ad campaign to help educate the public that all fires were detrimental , using a cartoon black bear named Smokey Bear . This iconic firefighting bear can still be seen on posters with the catchphrase " Only you can prevent forest fires " . Early posters of Smokey Bear misled the public into believing that western wildfires were predominantly human @-@ caused . In Yellowstone , human @-@ caused fires average between 6 and 10 annually , while 35 wildfires are ignited by lightning . 
 Some researchers , as well as some timber companies and private citizens , understood that fire was a natural state of affairs in many ecosystems . Fire would help clean out the understory and dead plant matter , allowing economically important tree species to grow with less competition for nutrients . Native Americans would often burn woodlands to reduce overgrowth and increase grasslands for large prey animals such as bison and elk . As early as 1924 , environmentalist Aldo Leopold argued that wildfires were beneficial to ecosystems , and were necessary for the natural propagation of numerous tree and plant species . Over the next 40 years , increasing numbers of foresters and ecologists concurred about the benefits of wildfire to ecosystems . In 1963 , a group of ecologists consulted by the National Park Service released a report recommending that wildfires should be allowed to periodically burn to restore the environmental balance in parks . The Wilderness Act of 1964 helped to address the role of fire as a natural part of ecosystems . By 1968 , the National Park Service had adjusted its fire management policies to reflect changing attitudes . The service determined that fires that started naturally ( by lightning ) would be permitted to burn if they posed little risk to human life and property . The service also decreed that under prescribed conditions , controlled burns would be deliberately set to restore balance to ecosystems . Fire ecology became better understood after many forests had aged to maturity and were overdue for a large scale burn . 
 From 1972 , the National Park Service began allowing natural fires in Yellowstone to burn under controlled conditions . Fires of this type were referred to as prescribed natural fires . Between 1972 and 1987 , a total of 235 prescribed natural fires burned a relatively small 33 @,@ 759 acres ( 137 km2 ) under the directives of the new policy . Of these , only 15 spread to more than 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 4 km2 ) . The five years prior to 1988 were much wetter than normal and this may have reduced the area of the fires during that period . The prescribed natural fire policy appeared to be an effective way to manage fires , especially in the Yellowstone region . 
 = = Contributing factors to the fires = = 
 Formal fire recordkeeping in Yellowstone began in 1931 , when the Heart Lake Fire burned 18 @,@ 000 acres ( 73 km2 ) . Despite its small extent , it was the largest fire in the period from when the park was created until 1988 . Research indicates that only two or three large fires occur on the Yellowstone Plateau every 1 @,@ 000 years . The previous major Yellowstone fire was in the early to mid @-@ 18th century , well before the arrival of white explorers . 
 Yellowstone forests are dominated by the lodgepole pine and are eventually replaced by other tree species after 80 to 100 years as a forest matures . In Yellowstone , a very short growing season due to high altitude and relatively poor soils allows the lodgepole pine to reach ages approaching three hundred years before other trees such as Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir become established . The lodgepole pines found throughout the Yellowstone Plateau high country grow in uninterrupted dense stands averaging similar ages in various groupings . Though trees normally found in more mature forests do occur , they are not found in large stands as in other forests in the Rocky Mountains . By the 1980s much of the lodgepole pine forests in Yellowstone were between 200 and 250 years old and approaching the end of their lifecycle . 
 The mountain pine beetle killed a number of trees in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem from the late 1960s through the mid @-@ 1980s . This created a heterogeneous forest in which old surviving trees were mixed with younger trees of various ages . This mixed stand structure may have provided ladder fuels that contributed to the fires . In addition , the winter season of 1987 – 1988 was drier than usual , with the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem receiving only 31 % of the normal snowpack . However , April and May 1988 were very wet and the abundant moisture greatly aided grass and understory development . By June , the rainfall stopped and little was recorded in the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for the next four months . By July , the worst drought in the history of Yellowstone National Park began . Grasses and plants which grew well in the early summer soon turned to dry tinder . Relative humidity levels fell further , desiccating the forest . Fuel moisture content in dead and fallen timber was recorded as low as 5 % . By mid @-@ August , humidity levels were averaging below 20 % and were recorded as low as 6 % on one occasion . To compound the lack of rainfall , the majority of Yellowstone 's soils are rhyolitic volcanic rocks and soils which have poor moisture retention . A series of strong but dry storm fronts also led to the rapid spread of a number of the largest fires . 
 Accumulated fuel , old forests , and unabated and exceptionally dry conditions spelled trouble for Yellowstone . However , foresters and fire ecologists predicted a normal fire season for the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and anticipated normal rainfall for July . History provided little evidence to suggest that 1988 would be any different from the previous 100 plus years the park had existed . But , as major fires started to break out throughout the Rocky Mountain region , the media began to take notice . Twenty small fires started in Yellowstone by July and of those , eleven went out on their own . The remainder were closely monitored in accordance with the prescribed natural fire policies . By July 15 fires throughout the entire Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem had burned 8 @,@ 500 acres ( 34 km2 ) and though this was not out of the ordinary , media focus on fires raging throughout the American west influenced the decision by the park officials to initiate fire suppression efforts on July 15 . Within a week after suppression efforts commenced , the fires had spread to include almost 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 km2 ) on the parkland alone . 
 = = Major fires in Yellowstone in 1988 = = 
 Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August . Seven of them were responsible for 95 % of the total burned area . At the end of July , the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel , and yet the fires continued to expand . Smaller fires burned into each other , propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain . On August 20 , the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed " Black Saturday " , more than 150 @,@ 000 acres ( 610 km2 ) were consumed during one of many firestorms . Ash from the firestorms throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings , Montana , 60 miles ( 97 km ) to the northeast . The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines , and burning embers started new fires a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) or more ahead of the main fires . Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet ( 61 m ) high . On that single day , more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park . Throughout the summer , fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 to 16 @.@ 1 km ) a day , and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) in one hour were recorded . 
 One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex . These fires were in the southern section of the park , in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers . The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23 . The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect , and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire . It smoldered with little movement for several weeks , then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20 . 
 The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1 and like the Shoshone fire , advanced little for several weeks . The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and combined with the Shoshone fire in August . As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area , evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection . In the midst of a large lodgepole pine forest , the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season . A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed . After the Red and Shoshone fires combined , they were referred to as the Shoshone fire , since it was much larger . 
 The Mink fire started in Bridger @-@ Teton National Forest from lightning on July 11 , and burned north following the Yellowstone River valley , after firefighters forced the fire away from private lands . The Mink fire eventually burned sections inside the park after July 23 , but was deemed to be a low risk since it was in a very remote section of the park . 
 The third largest fire was the Huck fire , which started after a tree fell on a power line on August 20 near Flagg Ranch . This fire burned primarily in the John D. Rockefeller , Jr . Memorial Parkway , crossing Yellowstone 's southern border on August 30 . The Snake River Complex of fires burned more than 140 @,@ 000 acres ( 567 km2 ) before they were extinguished by wet weather in the fall . One of the most striking events of this fire complex occurred on August 23 when firestorms swept across the Lewis River Canyon , propelled by winds of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) and gusting to 80 miles per hour ( 130 km / h ) . 
 The Mist fire started on July 9 in the eastern section of the park in the Absaroka Mountains . Two days later , the Clover fire started in the same region and both fires combined and were renamed as the Clover Mist fire on July 20 . Burning in rugged terrain , this fire was very difficult to fight and on August 20 , the fire advanced from the south towards the small town of Cooke City , Montana and continued to threaten the town for several more weeks . The Clover Mist fire eventually consumed more than 140 @,@ 000 acres ( 567 km2 ) . 
 The Storm Creek fire started on June 14 well north of the park in the Absaroka @-@ Beartooth Wilderness , and for almost two months seemed to pose little threat to Yellowstone . Then , on August 20 , the fire moved rapidly to the south also threatening the town of Cooke City , this time from the north . An effort to bulldoze a wide fire break and set backfires to try to starve the fires of combustibles almost led to disaster when an unexpected change in wind direction brought the fires to within a hundred yards of parts of the town , forcing evacuations on September 6 . 
 The other major fire located in the northern section of the park was the Hellroaring fire . Started in Gallatin National Forest on August 15 from embers from an unattended campfire , the fire initially moved north , but then turned around a few days later and moved south , threatening the area near Tower Junction . 
 In the northwest , the Fan fire started on June 25 and was originally considered a threat to the town of Gardiner , Montana , just outside the park 's north entrance . It was the most successfully fought of all the 1988 fires . Though the fire was not contained for a couple of months , by mid @-@ August it was no longer considered a threat to lives and property . 
 The largest fire in the park was the North Fork fire , both in terms of damage to structures and of area burned . The fire started on July 22 when a man cutting timber dropped his cigarette in Caribou @-@ Targhee National Forest just outside the park 's western border . The North Fork fire was the only major fire that was fought from the beginning since it started after the prescribed fire policy was halted on July 15 . The fire spread towards the northeast and by the end of the first week of August was threatening Madison Junction and nearby campground facilities . The fire then raced towards Norris Junction on August 20 . Firefighters there used water and foam to keep the structures from being consumed by the blaze . The fire continued its westward advance along the Yellowstone Plateau and on August 25 reached visitor facilities at Canyon , where land management agencies and the U.S. military put forth enormous efforts to protect structures . The eastern flank of the fire calmed down for several days , then down @-@ sloping winds off the Yellowstone Plateau forced flames along the west side of the fire towards the town of West Yellowstone , Montana . There , private citizens assisted assigned personnel in soaking hundreds of acres of forestland to protect both the town and an electrical power substation . The fire burned a substantial section of forest along the Madison River valley . 
 Between September 5 and 7 , a dry front pushed flames along the southern section of the North Fork fire towards the large Old Faithful visitor complex adjacent to the Upper Geyser Basin . All non @-@ emergency personnel were ordered to be evacuated ; however , political issues influenced National Park Service management directives and the complex was not completely closed to incoming tourists , with some visitors still arriving at Old Faithful not long before the main firestorm hit by mid afternoon . An all out aerial bombardment with air tankers dropping fire retardant failed . Firefighters concentrated on structure protection , especially those of historical significance such as the Old Faithful Inn , using fire engines and portable water pumping systems to keep the roofs and other surfaces of the structures wet . 1 @,@ 200 firefighters including 120 military personnel dug fire lines and cleared away brush near structures . Winds crested up to 80 miles per hour ( 130 km / h ) as the fire approached from the west . 
 The fires spread to forested sections near to , but generally away from major structures , but 19 small structures were destroyed and there was also extensive damage to an old dormitory . The fire was so intense that vehicles left near the fire had their wheels melted , windshields shattered and paint scorched . Though most of the Old Faithful complex had been spared , the park service decided that for the first time , the entire park would be closed to non @-@ emergency personnel on September 8 . The night of the 9th and the morning of the 10th of September , the North Fork fire jumped a fireline along its northeastern flank and approached Mammoth Hot Springs where a large concentration of historical structures as well as the Park Headquarters is located . Rain and snow arrived in time to slow the fires before they threatened the complex . By the time the North Fork fire finally died down , it was responsible for 60 % of the burned area within the park ; more than 400 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 600 km2 ) . 
 Colder weather , bringing with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem . Though the fires continued to burn well into the middle of November , they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property . Many fire crews were sent home , but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts . Hundreds of miles of firelines , helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state , and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings . Finally , on November 18 , all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out .

 1988 was a big year for wildfires in the western United States , with more than 72 @,@ 000 fires reported during the year , including 300 rated as major . Firefighting employees and equipment were stretched to the limit , and consequently , over 6 @,@ 000 U.S. Military personnel assisted in the fire fighting efforts nationwide , with more than 600 assigned to Yellowstone . At the height of the fires , over 9 @,@ 000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time , and by the time the fires finally went out , more than 25 @,@ 000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts . Crews would normally work for 2 to 3 weeks , be sent home , and then return for one or two more tours of duty . The normal workday was as long as 14 hours . Assignments included digging firelines , watering down buildings , clearing undergrowth near structures , and installing water pumps . Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews , as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures . No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires , but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park . A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue , headaches , and smoke inhalation . A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area . 
 Firefighters created 655 miles ( 1 @,@ 054 km ) of fireline by hand and 137 miles ( 220 km ) with mechanized equipment such as bulldozers . Most of the bulldozer work was done on the North Fork fire . Some other fires were too remote or in too steep terrain for the safe operation of heavy equipment , and bulldozers were prohibited from many areas because of the impact they have on surface features . Additionally , the thin , unstable ground near the park 's geothermal features could not be trusted to support the weight of heavy equipment . Bulldozers are rarely used on fires in U.S. National Parks . 
 Some 120 helicopters and fixed @-@ wing aircraft were used to combat the inferno . Aircraft logged over 18 @,@ 000 hours of flight time and dropped 1 @.@ 4 million U.S. gallons ( 5 @.@ 3 ML ) of fire retardant and 10 million U.S. gallons ( 38 ML ) of water on the fires . 
 More than 100 fire engines were assigned to the fire . Structural fire engines were used in building complexes , where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings . Smaller wildland fire engines suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout the park . 
 $ 120 million was spent fighting the fires , while structure loss was estimated at $ 3 million . Later analysis has shown that , aside from concentrated fire suppression efforts near major tourist facilities , the firefighting work failed to stop what was likely an unstoppable force .

 = = = Vegetation and wildlife = = = 
 The fires in Yellowstone left a mosaic of areas greatly affected and others less so . Inside fire perimeters , large expanses of forest were completely untouched . There were three major types of burning . From an aesthetic viewpoint , the most destructive fires were the canopy crown fires that in many places obliterated entire forests . Crown fires accounted for about 41 percent of all the area that burned . Mixed fires burned both the canopy and vegetation on the ground , or burned one or the other as they spread through the forest . Ground fires spread slowly along the ground , consuming smaller plants and dead plant material ; some ground fires burned for longer duration and intensity , contributing to the loss of many trees whose canopies were never directly burned . 
 The recovery from the fires began almost immediately , with plants such as fireweed appearing in a matter of days after a fire had passed . While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed grass seed by airplane , the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted . Though some small plants did not immediately <unk> their pre @-@ fire habitats , most did , and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires . There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas , especially between two and five years after the fires . 
 Seeds had little distance to travel , even in severely burned areas . Much of the most badly burned forest was within 160 to 650 feet ( 49 to 198 m ) of less affected areas . Still , most regeneration of the plants and trees came from immediate sources , either above or below ground . Lodgepole pines generally do not disperse their seeds more than 200 feet ( 61 m ) , so seed dispersal from less burned parts apparently had little effect on more severely burned areas . In regions that did experience complete <unk> , the average depth of charred soil was only about half an inch ( 14 mm ) , so few roots , even of grasses , were killed by the fire . This allowed rapid regeneration throughout the ecosystem . 
 The predominant tree in Yellowstone , the lodgepole pine , fared poorly from the fires , except in areas where the heat and flames were very mild . The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire . Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires , and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns . Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5 years . However , the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform , with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less . Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades , rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife . 
 Aspen became more widespread after the fires , occupying areas that had been dominated by conifers . It had long been believed that aspen regenerated by sprouting from existing roots rather than by seed dispersal . However , aspen sprouts appeared two years after the fires as far as 9 miles ( 14 km ) from the nearest known aspen trees . Aspen is a preferred grazing food for elk and many of the newer aspen are consequently small , except in areas that are harder for elk to get to . The resurgence of aspen after the fires was a contrast to pre @-@ fire events , as aspen had been increasingly scarce in the park . This might be a temporary event as conifers continue to grow and eventually crowd out other tree species . 
 Contrary to media reports and speculation at the time , the fires killed very few park animals — surveys indicated that only about 345 elk ( of an estimated 40 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 ) , 36 mule deer , 12 moose , 6 black bears , and 9 bison had perished . Of 21 grizzlies that were radio @-@ collared and had home ranges where the fires happened , only one was believed to have been lost . Grizzlies were observed in burned areas more often than unburned areas the following year , feeding on the proliferation of roots and foliage as well as on ants which thrived due to all the dead wood . Moose had been declining in the northern sections of the park since the 1960s , but the decline became more obvious after the fires . Unlike elk , which are primarily grazers and tend to eat grasses , moose are more likely to be browsers , consuming primarily woody food sources , particularly willow and subalpine fir , which were temporarily reduced by the fires . All ungulates experienced a high initial mortality the winter after the fires , but this has been attributed to a severe winter more than the fires themselves . However , moose populations , unlike other ungulates , have not rebounded in subsequent years . Rodents likely experienced the highest mortality of all mammals due not only to heat and smoke they could not easily escape , but also because of the reduction in forest cover , allowing would @-@ be predators less difficulty in spotting them . 
 Approximately 100 dead fish were reported in two streams after fire retardant was accidentally dropped on them . Aside from a temporary decrease in a few species of aquatic insects , no long @-@ term impact has been observed on aquatic life in any of Yellowstone 's rivers or lakes .

 The smoke and airborne particulates from the fires posed a threat to local communities on several occasions . Smoke and particulates were especially high in Gardiner , Montana . There , monitoring stations maintained by the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences and the park recorded 19 days where recommended allowable particulate concentrations were exceeded . This was also the case near fires , and on 7 occasions at Mammoth , Montana , the location of the park headquarters . In no other surrounding communities were particulates found to be above acceptable levels . Smoke and haze made driving difficult and sometimes even dangerous . A number of fire fighters were treated at clinics for smoke and dust inhalation and a few for inadvertently inhaling fumes from a sulfur ignition near one of the geothermal areas . 
 In the aftermath of the fires , erosion was a particular concern , especially as the rains were heavy the following year . Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires , and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily . Stream flow was also affected by water @-@ pumping operations . The more than a million gallons of ammonium phosphate based fire @-@ retardant material polluted some streams , but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality . Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires . They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989 . 
 = = = Structure damage = = = 
 The park service gave priority to life and property in their efforts to suppress the fires . Of the more than 1 @,@ 000 structures located in the park , only 67 were destroyed . There were 400 structures in the Old Faithful complex and only 19 of these were destroyed , 12 of which were concessionaire housing units and relatively inexpensive to replace . Major tourist locations in the park such as the one at Old Faithful were heavily staffed by fire fighting crews and equipment , especially at times of immediate danger . Fire fighters used a variety of methods to establish safe zones in and near these complexes , yet every single visitor complex was evacuated by non @-@ critical personnel at least once during the fires . 
 Of the 38 backcountry patrol cabins used by park rangers and park staff , the only one lost to the fires was at Sportsman Lake , and it was rebuilt the following summer . However , fires did a lot of damage to numerous campgrounds , backcountry bridges , and 10 miles ( 16 km ) of power lines and 300 utility poles . Some of the boardwalks used to keep tourists elevated above geothermal areas were also destroyed , but were quickly replaced . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Since Yellowstone is one of the most famous national parks in the world , news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational . Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media . The National Park Service received some 3 @,@ 000 media requests , not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant , even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees . 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons with the media where fire fighting manpower was concentrated . By the time the fires were under control in mid @-@ November , the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily . Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received , and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency . 
 Lack of understanding of wildfire management by the media led to some sensationalist reporting and inaccuracies . Some news agencies gave the impression that most of the park was being destroyed . On August 30 , an ABC News interview with Stanley Mott , apparently a tourist , incorrectly identified him as the Director of the National Park Service ( William Mott ) . In another story , The New York Times stated that the Park Service policy was to allow natural fires to burn themselves out , whereas that of the U.S. Forest Service was to suppress all such fires — a <unk> of the policies of both agencies . The media also had some difficulty distinguishing between these two completely separate agencies . Sources quoted by The Washington Post , USA Today , and the Chicago Tribune later stated that comments attributed to them were fabricated , and one source commented that a September 8 , 1988 report by the Chicago Tribune had more errors than facts . On the same day , The Washington Post associated the smoke and presence of military vehicles and helicopters overhead with the 1968 events in Da Nang , Vietnam , giving the impression of catastrophe . The fires had been very active in late July . In early August , fire managers reached a conclusion that the fires would not likely expand much further , due to a lack of fuel , and the Director of the National Park Service declared on August 11 that the fires were contained . When this optimistic announcement was followed by Black Saturday on August 20 , and the firestorm that threatened the Old Faithful complex in early September , the media were again highly critical of the park service and their policies . 
 = = Fire management since 1988 = = 
 As a result of research conducted after the fires , a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992 . The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires , increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations , and allocated greater funding for fire management . By 2004 , further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added . According to the 2004 plan , natural wildfires are allowed to burn , so long as parameters regarding fire size , weather , and potential danger are not exceeded . Those fires that do exceed the standards , as well as all human @-@ caused fires , are to be suppressed . These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem , but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance . 
 Increased fire monitoring through ground based and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed . Fire monitors first determine whether a fire is human @-@ caused or natural . All human @-@ caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural , while natural fires are monitored . Fire monitors map the fire perimeter , record local weather , and examine the types of fuels burning and the amount of fuel available . Additionally , they investigate the rate of spread , flame lengths , fuel moisture content , and other characteristics of each fire . Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions . 
 Land management employees remove dead and hazardous fuels from areas as prioritized by the Hazard Fuels Reduction Plan . This is to ensure fires have less opportunity to threaten lives , historical structures , and visitor facilities . As of 2007 , fuel is reduced within 400 feet ( 120 m ) of structures and other high @-@ priority locations . 
 Foresters and ecologists argue that large controlled burns in Yellowstone prior to the fires would not have greatly reduced the area that was consumed in 1988 . Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if they were allowed to burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration . Consequently , natural fires , rather than controlled burns , are the park 's primary maintenance tool . Since the late 1970s , some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out . In rare circumstances , natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed . 
 Greater cooperation between federal and state agencies on a national level has been coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center . Though primarily a collaborative effort between federal agencies to develop a national level fire policy , the center also aids local and state governments in addressing their fire management issues . Universally accepted priorities include management directives which allow natural fires to burn unhindered under prescribed conditions . As in the 1988 fires , protection of lives and property continue to take precedence in all fire fighting efforts . 
 The most important lesson learned is that a number of ecosystems , including the one that contains Yellowstone , are specially adapted to large and intense wildfires . This was widely thought to be the case well before 1988 , and the wildfires of that year drove the conclusion home . While large destructive fires are unacceptable in regions with extensive encroachment by communities , they are mandatory in a region such as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem , if it is to be maintained in a natural manner .

 State Route 230 ( SR 230 ) is a legislated , but unconstructed , state highway to be located in Adams and Whitman counties in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway would begin at a junction with concurrent highways Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) and U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) in Ritzville and travel east to an intersection with SR 23 in Ewan . Plans for the first highway first emerged in 1945 , to be studied after the conclusion of World War II , however no action has been taken on construction of the highway .

 The highway is legislated to begin in Ritzville at a junction with concurrent highways I @-@ 90 and US 395 and travel east through a mixture of farm and desert landscapes , crossing over the Adams – Whitman county line in the process . A junction with SR 23 near Ewan is to be the eastern terminus of the highway . Currently travelers wishing to travel between the two communities take the freeway to Sprague , then head southeast along SR 23 .

 The highway was first proposed in 1945 , with the support of the Ritzville Chamber of Commerce and senator Elmer C. Huntley of Colfax . An earmark of just over $ 1 @.@ 5 million ( equivalent to $ 51 @.@ 3 million in 2015 ) was set aside for the project to be used after the war . The proposed highway 's designation was changed to the current designator , SR 230 , after the 1964 state highway renumbering . The legal definition of SR 23 , the highway 's proposed eastern terminus , was changed during the 1987 legislative session to remove a reference of a junction with SR 230 .

 = Koala = 
 The koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus , or , inaccurately , koala bear ) is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia . It is the only extant representative of the family <unk> and its closest living relatives are the wombats . The koala is found in coastal areas of the mainland 's eastern and southern regions , inhabiting Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , and South Australia . It is easily recognisable by its stout , tailless body and large head with round , fluffy ears and large , spoon @-@ shaped nose . The koala has a body length of 60 – 85 cm ( 24 – 33 in ) and weighs 4 – 15 kg ( 9 – 33 lb ) . <unk> colour ranges from silver grey to chocolate brown . Koalas from the northern populations are typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts further south . These populations possibly are separate subspecies , but this is disputed . 
 Koalas typically inhabit open eucalypt woodlands , and the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet . Because this eucalypt diet has limited nutritional and caloric content , koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day . They are asocial animals , and bonding exists only between mothers and dependent offspring . Adult males communicate with loud bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates . Males mark their presence with secretions from scent glands located on their chests . Being marsupials , koalas give birth to underdeveloped young that crawl into their mothers ' pouches , where they stay for the first six to seven months of their lives . These young koalas , known as joeys , are fully weaned around a year old . Koalas have few natural predators and parasites , but are threatened by various pathogens , such as <unk> bacteria and the koala retrovirus , as well as by bushfires and droughts . 
 Koalas were hunted by indigenous Australians and depicted in myths and cave art for millennia . The first recorded encounter between a European and a koala was in 1798 , and an image of the animal was published in 1810 by naturalist George Perry . Botanist Robert Brown wrote the first detailed scientific description of the koala in 1814 , although his work remained unpublished for 180 years . Popular artist John Gould illustrated and described the koala , introducing the species to the general British public . Further details about the animal 's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several English scientists . Because of its distinctive appearance , the koala is recognised worldwide as a symbol of Australia . Koalas are listed as of Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . The Australian government lists populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable . The animal was hunted heavily in the early 20th century for its fur , and large @-@ scale cullings in Queensland resulted in a public outcry that initiated a movement to protect the species . Sanctuaries were established , and translocation efforts moved to new regions koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced . The biggest threat to their existence is habitat destruction caused by agriculture and urbanisation . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word koala comes from the Dharug gula . Although the vowel ' u ' was originally written in the English orthography as " oo " ( in spellings such as <unk> or <unk> ) , it was changed to " oa " , possibly in error . The word is mistakenly said to mean " doesn 't drink " . Because of the koala 's resemblance to a bear , it was often miscalled the koala bear , particularly by early settlers . Other names like monkey bear , native bear , and tree @-@ bear have also been used . Indigenous names include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; many of these mean " no drink " . The generic name , Phascolarctos , is derived from the Greek words <unk> " pouch " and <unk> " bear " . The specific name , cinereus , is Latin for " ash coloured " . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The koala was given its generic name Phascolarctos in 1816 by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville , who would not give it a specific name until further review . In 1819 , German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss gave it the binomial <unk> cinereus . Because Phascolarctos was published first , according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature , it has priority as the official name of the genus . French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest proposed the name <unk> fuscus in 1820 , suggesting that the brown @-@ coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones . Other names suggested by European authors included <unk> cinereus by Goldfuss in 1820 , P. <unk> by René Primevère Lesson in 1827 , and P. koala by John Edward Gray in 1827 . 
 The koala is classified with wombats ( family <unk> ) and several extinct families ( including marsupial tapirs , marsupial lions and giant wombats ) in the suborder <unk> within the order <unk> . The <unk> are a sister group to a clade that includes macropods ( kangaroos and wallabies ) and possums . The ancestors of <unk> were likely arboreal , and the koala 's lineage was possibly the first to branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene . 
 The modern koala is the only extant member of <unk> , a family that once included several genera and species . During the Oligocene and Miocene , koalas lived in rainforests and had less specialised diets . Some species , such as the Riversleigh rainforest koala ( <unk> <unk> ) and some species of <unk> , were around the same size as the modern koala , while others , such as species of <unk> , were one @-@ half to two @-@ thirds its size . Like the modern species , prehistoric koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long @-@ distance vocalising and <unk> developed early . During the Miocene , the Australian continent began drying out , leading to the decline of rainforests and the spread of open Eucalyptus woodlands . The genus Phascolarctos split from <unk> in the late Miocene and had several adaptations that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet : a shifting of the palate towards the front of the skull ; larger molars and premolars ; smaller pterygoid fossa ; and a larger gap between the molar and the incisor teeth . 
 During the Pliocene and Pleistocene , when Australia experienced changes in climate and vegetation , koala species grew larger . P. cinereus may have emerged as a dwarf form of the giant koala ( P. stirtoni ) . The reduction in the size of large mammals has been seen as a common phenomenon worldwide during the late Pleistocene , and several Australian mammals , such as the agile wallaby , are traditionally believed to have resulted from this dwarfing . A 2008 study questions this hypothesis , noting that P. cinereus and P. stirtoni were sympatric during the middle to late Pleistocene , and possibly as early as the Pliocene . The fossil record of the modern koala extends back at least to the middle Pleistocene .
