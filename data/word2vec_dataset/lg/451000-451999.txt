 What is now MS 172 was originally designated as a part of the Lee Highway , an auto trail that connected Washington , D.C. with San Diego , in 1920 . With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , this route was initially designated as part of US 72 , a U.S. route that was to run from Memphis , Tennessee east to Chattanooga , Tennessee . However , the route was instead designated as part of US 78 by 1928 , at which time it was a gravel road . 
 By 1932 , US 72 and US 78 switched routes in Mississippi , with the present @-@ day alignment of MS 172 again becoming part of US 72 as initially planned in 1926 . In 1935 , the road was paved to the east of Iuka . The paved portion was extended slightly west of Iuka in 1936 and further west by 1938 . By 1939 , the section of US 72 that would be redesignated as MS 172 was fully paved . In 1986 , US 72 was moved to a new divided highway alignment to the south through Tishomingo County . By 1998 , MS 172 was marked on the former two @-@ lane alignment of US 72 in Tishomingo County .

 = = Plot = = 
 Angel Beats ! takes place at a high school acting as a limbo for those who have died , where students learn to give up any lingering attachments they still have from life before passing on . Those in the afterlife school can still feel pain as they did when they were alive , as well as dying again , only to awaken later with no injuries . The story follows the main protagonist Otonashi , a boy who has lost his memories of his life after dying . He meets Yuri , a girl who invites him to join the Afterlife Battlefront ( <unk> , Shinda Sekai Sensen , ( SSS ) ) , an organization she founded and leads which fights against God for the negative experiences the SSS members went through in life . In the SSS , there is a four @-@ girl band named Girls Dead Monster that acts as a diversion during missions , and an organization called the Guild that mass @-@ produces weapons out of dirt and supplies them to the SSS . Their only enemy is Angel , a girl who uses her supernatural powers to fight against the SSS . Angel creates her powers with the aid of a computer program called Angel Player . The rest of the afterlife school is populated by a large number of " normal " students and teachers Yuri deems " non @-@ player characters " ( NPCs ) , which are not human but look and act the part . 
 The first of the characters to fulfill her dream and pass on is Iwasawa , the leader of Girls Dead Monster . Angel , whose real name is Kanade Tachibana , loses her position as student council president and the vice president Naoi succeeds her . Naoi uses powers of hypnosis to control NPCs to fight for his own interests against the SSS , but Otonashi stops him after acknowledging Naoi 's existence and he subsequently joins the SSS . Otonashi regains his memories with the aid of Naoi 's hypnosis and agrees to continue with the SSS . Otonashi befriends Kanade and invites her to join in on SSS activities . After Otonashi fully remembers the details of his life and death , he starts cooperating with Kanade to help the other SSS members move on , and Kanade is reinstated as student council president in accordance with their plan . Yui , the girl who replaced Iwasawa after she passed on , is the second of the characters who passes on . 
 When mysterious shadow monsters begin attacking the SSS , Takamatsu gets devoured by one , only to reappear as an NPC . Otonashi reasons with the other SSS members and many of them agree to pass on in lieu of becoming an NPC , including the rest of Girls Dead Monster , Chaa of the Guild , and several unnamed members . Yuri destroys the computers responsible for the shadow program , which was programmed to activate when love was detected in the world , to prevent it from becoming a true paradise and maintain its limbo state . Those who are left — Otonashi , Yuri , Kanade , Hinata and Naoi — hold a graduation ceremony where they thank each other for their support . After Naoi , Yuri and Hinata pass on , Otonashi learns that Kanade 's regret was not being able to thank him for the heart she received from Otonashi after his death . Otonashi is heartbroken after she thanks him and passes on , as he has fallen in love with her . In the epilogue , two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade meet each other on the street in the real world . In an alternative epilogue , Otonashi is shown to have stayed behind in the afterlife to help people pass on .

The SSS initially calls her " Angel " since they do not know her real name , but they still refer to her by it even after finding out her real name to be Kanade Tachibana . It is difficult to understand what she is thinking due to her rarely showing any outward emotions and her way of talking bluntly .

 The original creators of Angel Beats ! , Jun Maeda and Na @-@ Ga of Key , were interviewed in the July 2009 issue of ASCII Media Works ' Dengeki G 's Magazine . Around the time Key completed the first release of their sixth visual novel Little Busters ! , Hironori Toba of Aniplex ( himself a fan of Key 's works ) approached Maeda around October 2007 about collaborating to produce an original anime series . Maeda began meeting with Toba and Aniplex on a monthly basis and the story started to gradually progress . Aniplex wanted Maeda to write a screenplay that would be very " Key @-@ like , with touching moments of laughter and tears , " but initially Maeda found himself at a loss to write a story more amusing than Little Busters ! , because he thought that he had reached a limit with Little Busters ! in regards to a " Key @-@ like story " . However , one day Maeda was struck by inspiration , where he thought up the initial idea of a story set in the afterlife . Furthermore , with everyone already dead , Maeda conceived of flashy battles where the combatants go all out without fear of death . According to Maeda , the theme of the series is " life " , which in Angel Beats ! is depicted as a precious and wonderful thing , despite the characters in Angel Beats ! who fight against their fate . 
 Maeda nominated Na @-@ Ga to begin work on the character designs near the beginning of 2008 . Na @-@ Ga was worried that other computer graphics ( CG ) work for Key would get delayed , but he took the position because of his accumulated experience in CG . Maeda nominated Na @-@ Ga because of the popular characters he designed in Little Busters ! , and because of his frankness . Na @-@ Ga designed Yuri based on her personality as a leader , though it was per Maeda 's request that he added the black headband , taken from the character Yukiko Amagi from Persona 4 , who was Maeda 's favorite heroine from that game . The length of Yuri 's hair and the addition of a green ribbon were decided from production committee meetings . Angel 's original concept began with the idea of a brave , fighting girl . Maeda cited that Angel 's image had changed considerably over the development process and that originally she was similar to Shiki <unk> from Kara no Kyōkai . Eventually , Angel 's concept changed to being a " silent and mysterious girl " . Before Na @-@ Ga decided on Otonashi 's design , Maeda told him that anything would be fine and to just draw something , and eventually drew up a prototype for Otonashi and Hinata , among others . Some of the characters had vague initial conditions given by Maeda , such as asking Na @-@ Ga to draw an " all female band bass guitarist " in the case of Girls Dead Monster member Sekine and particularly the cryptic " character who speaks in puzzling English phrases " for TK .

 The Aniplex producer of Angel Beats ! , Hironori Toba , was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G 's Magazine , where he commented that a 13 @-@ episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode was not enough to tell the whole story of Angel Beats ! Maeda had envisioned . Therefore , the various additional media , such as the illustrated short stories and manga , contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints . Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types . Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings when he was in the process of writing the script , and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself , since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key . It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music , which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it . Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song . He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose , including the lyrics . Due to this , Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats ! , which Maeda also composed , sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs . 
 In regards to bringing in P.A.Works as the animation studio , Toba had taken notice of the company from back when they provided in @-@ between animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist ( 2003 – 4 ) and Darker than Black ( 2007 ) , respectively ; Aniplex helped produce both series . After watching just the first three episodes of P.A.Works ' True Tears ( 2008 ) , however , he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works ' studio in Toyama Prefecture to meet with the production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together . The following week , Maeda brought up the subject of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats ! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in <unk> Shortly after that , Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project . 
 Maeda focused on making jokes an important part of Angel Beats ! , leading Toba to seek out Seiji Kishi to be the director , because of his experience in directing and his pulling power influence on the staff of P.A.Works , where there are many that are still young . Kishi was ultimately approached by P.A.Works representative director Kenji Horikawa about working on a " school comedy written by a game scenario writer " and was shocked after taking the director 's position to discover Maeda was the screenwriter . Kishi commented how , far from just being a comedy , the series contains many different aspects , including flashy action scenes , live musical performances , and drama . Kishi stated that normally he would be hard pressed to cover this range of aspects , but was motivated by Maeda 's uncompromising attitude in regards to the script . The decision to add in the all female band Girls Dead Monster was due to Maeda 's intent to add in many different and interesting elements into the series . 
 Kishi specifically requested that sound and music director Satoki Iida work on the project , who also helped with the proofreading of the script due to Maeda 's fixation on the music production . Iida was interviewed in the April 2010 issue of Dengeki G 's Magazine , where it was stated that Maeda and the group Anant @-@ Garde Eyes received Iida 's approval to employ a minimalist approach to the background music ( BGM ) used throughout the anime . Iida admitted that it was <unk> to use this music genre in anime and that he had to go through various trials and errors with Maeda and Anant @-@ Garde Eyes to get the music right . Maeda and Anant @-@ Garde Eyes strove to create individual quality music tracks , while Iida pursued the goal of having music that would be useful as BGM tracks , which caused problems during the creation process . Iida realized that it was important for the music and the visuals to combine together to create a synchronization between the two . Toba first took notice of Angel Beats ! character designer and chief animator <unk> Hirata during the production of <unk> <unk> ( 2007 ) with his skill as an artist and ability to finish work quickly , but thoroughly . It was after Toba saw Hirata 's work as chief animator of Strike Witches ( 2008 ) , however , that he pursued Hirata to join the Angel Beats ! staff ; Maeda also gave his seal of approval for Hirata .

 Angel Beats ! received generally positive reviews . In a review by Anime News Network , reviewer Theron Martin praised the series for integrating individual elements together , including the Girls Dead Monster musical performance scenes , scenes where humor dominates , and action scenes . A common theme in supernatural anime , according to Martin , are souls discontent with their former lives , but the concept of Angel Beats ! is described as " quite unusual " because it features all the main characters as such souls and gathers them in one place . In the series , " maintaining distinctiveness is essential for survival as an individual , " which Martin calls a " sly condemnation of the rigorous conformity impressed upon students by Japanese schooling . " Overall , Angel Beats ! was lauded for " <unk> [ ing ] no great familiarity with anime to enjoy . " 
 On the DVD Talk website , reviewer John Sinnott praised the plot for advancing and changing in unexpected ways : " The plot evolves quickly and by the end of the series it 's quite a different show than what it was at the beginning . " Both Martin and Sinnott agree that a major flaw in the anime is that it is too short , and does not go into detail for a large number of characters . Stig Høgset at THEM Anime Reviews , however , panned the series in part because it " overloads the story with too many elements in an attempt to please as many people as possible . " Høgset went on to describe Angel Beats as not having " any compelling characters " and the series ' humor is largely thought to be annoying . However , Høgset praised P.A.Works for the animation of the action sequences , as did Martin , who added that there is " great detail work on the weapons and instruments used . " 
 The sixth episode of Angel Beats ! , which aired on May 8 , 2010 on Osaka 's MBS station in Japan , achieved a record 4 @.@ 9 % rating for an anime series broadcast during the late @-@ night " Anime Shower " timeslot in the past three years .

 = 1740 Batavia massacre = 
 The 1740 Batavia massacre ( Dutch : <unk> , literally " Murder of the Chinese " ; Indonesian : <unk> <unk> , meaning " Chinatown Tumult " ) was a pogrom of ethnic Chinese in the port city of Batavia ( present @-@ day Jakarta ) in the Dutch East Indies . The violence inside the city lasted from 9 October 1740 until 22 October , with minor skirmishes outside the walls continuing late into November that year . Historians have estimated that at least 10 @,@ 000 ethnic Chinese were massacred ; just 600 to 3 @,@ 000 are believed to have survived . 
 In September 1740 , as unrest rose among the Chinese population , spurred by government repression and declining sugar prices , Governor @-@ General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would be met with deadly force . On 7 October , hundreds of ethnic Chinese , many of them sugar mill workers , killed 50 Dutch soldiers , leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew . Two days later , rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes . The violence soon spread throughout Batavia , killing more Chinese . Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11 October , gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22 October , when the governor @-@ general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities . Outside the city walls , clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers . After several weeks of minor skirmishes , Dutch @-@ led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area . 
 The following year , attacks on ethnic Chinese throughout Java sparked the two @-@ year Java War that pitted ethnic Chinese and Javanese forces against Dutch troops . Valckenier was later recalled to the Netherlands and charged with crimes related to the massacre . The massacre figures heavily in Dutch literature , and is also cited as a possible etymology for the names of several areas in Jakarta . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the early years of the Dutch colonisation of the East Indies ( modern @-@ day Indonesia ) , many people of Chinese descent were contracted as skilled artisans in the construction of Batavia on the northwestern coast of Java ; they also served as traders , sugar mill workers , and shopkeepers . The economic boom , precipitated by trade between the East Indies and China via the port of Batavia , increased Chinese immigration to Java . The number of ethnic Chinese in Batavia grew rapidly , reaching a total of 10 @,@ 000 by 1740 . Thousands more lived outside the city walls . The Dutch colonials required them to carry registration papers , and deported those who did not comply to China . 
 The deportation policy was tightened during the 1730s , after an outbreak of malaria killed thousands , including the Governor @-@ General of the Dutch East Indies , Dirck van <unk> . According to Indonesian historian Benny G. <unk> , the outbreak was followed by increased suspicion and resentment in native Indonesians and the Dutch toward the ethnic Chinese , who were growing in number and whose wealth was increasingly visible . As a result , Commissioner of Native Affairs Roy Ferdinand , under orders of Governor @-@ General Adriaan Valckenier , decreed on 25 July 1740 that Chinese considered suspicious would be deported to Ceylon ( modern day Sri Lanka ) and forced to harvest cinnamon . Wealthy Chinese were extorted by corrupt Dutch officials who threatened them with deportation ; Stamford Raffles , a British explorer and historian of Java , noted in 1830 that in some Javanese accounts , the Dutch were told by the Chinese captain ( the Dutch @-@ appointed leader of the ethnic Chinese ) for Batavia , Ni Hoe Kong , to deport all Chinese wearing black or blue because these were thought to be poor . There were also rumours that deportees were not taken to their destinations but were thrown overboard once out of sight of Java , and in some accounts , they died when rioting on the ships . The deportation of ethnic Chinese caused unrest among the remaining Chinese , leading many Chinese workers to desert their jobs . 
 At the same time native occupants of Batavia , including the ethnic Betawi servants , became increasingly distrustful of the Chinese . Economic factors played a role : most natives were poor , and perceived the Chinese as occupying some of the most prosperous neighbourhoods in the city . Although the Dutch historian A.N. <unk> notes that at the time the Chinese were the " Jews of Asia " , the actual situation was more complicated . Many poor Chinese living in the area around Batavia were sugar mill workers who felt exploited by the Dutch and Chinese elites equally . Rich Chinese owned the mills and were involved in revenue farming and shipping ; they drew income from milling and the distillation of arak , a molasses and rice @-@ based alcoholic beverage . However , the Dutch overlords set the price for sugar , which itself caused unrest . Because of the decline of worldwide sugar prices that began in the 1720s caused by an increase in exports to Europe and competition from the West Indies , the sugar industry in the East Indies had suffered considerably . By 1740 , worldwide sugar prices had dropped to half the price in 1720 . As sugar was a major export , this caused considerable financial difficulties for the colony . 
 Initially some members of the Council of the Indies ( Raad van Indië ) believed that the Chinese would never attack Batavia , and stronger measures to control the Chinese were blocked by a faction led by Valckenier 's political opponent , the former governor of <unk> <unk> Willem van Imhoff , who returned to Batavia in 1738 . Large numbers of Chinese arrived outside Batavia from nearby settlements , however , and on 26 September Valckenier called an emergency meeting of the council , during which he gave orders to respond to any ethnic Chinese uprisings with deadly force . This policy continued to be opposed by van Imhoff 's faction ; Vermeulen ( 1938 ) suggested that the tension between the two colonial factions played a role in the ensuing massacre . 
 On the evening of 1 October Valckenier received reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate , angered by his statements at the emergency meeting five days earlier . This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council . However , after the murder of a Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls , the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard . Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city , and a plan of attack was formulated .

 After groups of Chinese sugar mill workers revolted using custom @-@ made weapons to loot and burn mills , hundreds of ethnic Chinese , suspected to have been led by Chinese Captain Ni Hoe Kong , killed 50 Dutch soldiers in Meester Cornelis ( now Jatinegara ) and Tanah Abang on 7 October . In response , the Dutch sent 1 @,@ 800 regular troops , accompanied by <unk> ( militia ) and eleven battalions of conscripts to stop the revolt ; they established a curfew and cancelled plans for a Chinese festival . Fearing that the Chinese would conspire against the colonials by candlelight , those inside the city walls were forbidden to light candles and were forced to surrender everything " down to the smallest kitchen knife " . The following day the Dutch repelled an attack by up to 10 @,@ 000 ethnic Chinese , led by groups from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi , at the city 's outer walls ; Raffles wrote that 1 @,@ 789 Chinese died in this attack . In response , Valckenier called another meeting of the council on 9 October . 
 Meanwhile , rumours spread among the other ethnic groups in Batavia , including slaves from Bali and Sulawesi , Bugis , and Balinese troops , that the Chinese were plotting to kill , rape , or enslave them . These groups pre @-@ emptively burned houses belonging to ethnic Chinese along Besar Stream . The Dutch followed this with an assault on Chinese settlements elsewhere in Batavia in which they burned houses and killed people . The Dutch politician and critic of colonialism W. R. van Hoëvell wrote that " pregnant and nursing women , children , and trembling old men fell on the sword . Defenseless prisoners were slaughtered like sheep " . 
 Troops under Lieutenant Hermanus van <unk> and Captain Jan van Oosten , a survivor from Tanah Abang , took station in the Chinese district : <unk> and his men positioned themselves at the poultry market , while van Oosten 's men held a post along the nearby canal . At around 5 : 00 p.m. , the Dutch opened fire on Chinese @-@ occupied houses with cannon , causing them to catch fire . Some Chinese died in the burning houses , while others were shot upon leaving their homes or committed suicide in desperation . Those who reached the canal near the housing district were killed by Dutch troops waiting in small boats , while other troops searched in between the rows of burning houses , killing any survivors they found . These actions later spread throughout the city . Vermeulen notes that many of the perpetrators were sailors and other " irregular and bad elements " of society . During this period there was heavy <unk> seizures of property . 
 The following day the violence continued to spread , and Chinese patients in a hospital were taken outside and killed . Attempts to extinguish fires in areas devastated the preceding day failed , and the flames increased in vigour , and continued until 12 October . Meanwhile , a group of 800 Dutch soldiers and 2 @,@ 000 natives assaulted Kampung Gading Melati , where a group of Chinese survivors were holding up under the leadership of Khe <unk> . Although the Chinese evacuated to nearby <unk> , they were later driven out of the area by Dutch forces . There were approximately 450 Dutch and 800 Chinese casualties in the two attacks .

 On 11 October Valckenier unsuccessfully requested that officers control their troops and stop the looting . Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an incentive for the other ethnic groups to assist in the purge . As a result , ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars , who killed those Chinese they found for the reward . The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia ; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14 October . On 22 October Valckenier called for all killings to cease . In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels , Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese , except for the leaders of the unrest , on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 <unk> . 
 Outside the walls skirmishes between the Chinese rebels and the Dutch continued . On 25 October , after almost two weeks of minor skirmishes , 500 armed Chinese approached <unk> ( now <unk> ) , but were repelled by cavalry under the command of <unk> Christoffel Moll and <unk> Daniel <unk> and Pieter <unk> . The following day the cavalry , which consisted of 1 @,@ 594 Dutch and native forces , marched on the rebel stronghold at the <unk> sugar mill , first gathered in the nearby woods and then set the mill on fire while the rebels were inside ; another mill at <unk> <unk> was taken in the same manner by another group . Fearful of the oncoming Dutch , the Chinese retreated to a sugar mill in Kampung Melayu , four hours from <unk> ; this stronghold fell to troops under Captain Jan George <unk> . After defeating the Chinese and retaking Qual , the Dutch returned to Batavia . Meanwhile , the fleeing Chinese , who were blocked to the west by 3 @,@ 000 troops from the Sultanate of Banten , headed east along the north coast of Java ; by 30 October it was reported that the Chinese had reached Tangerang . 
 A ceasefire order reached <unk> on 2 November , upon which he and his men returned to Batavia after stationing a contingent of 50 men at <unk> . When he arrived at noon there were no more Chinese stationed at the walls . On 8 November the Sultanate of Cirebon sent between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 native troops to reinforce the city guard . Looting continued until at least 28 November , and the last native troops stood down at the end of that month . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Most accounts of the massacre estimate that 10 @,@ 000 Chinese were killed within Batavia 's city walls , while at least another 500 were seriously wounded . Between 600 and 700 Chinese @-@ owned houses were raided and burned . Vermeulen gives a figure of 600 survivors , while the Indonesian scholar <unk> <unk> estimates that 3 @,@ 000 Chinese survived . The Indonesian historian Benny G. <unk> notes that 500 prisoners and hospital patients were killed , and a total of 3 @,@ 431 people survived . The massacre was followed by an " open season " against the ethnic Chinese throughout Java , causing another massacre in 1741 in Semarang , and others later in Surabaya and Gresik . 
 As part of conditions for the cessation of violence , all of Batavia 's ethnic Chinese were moved to a <unk> , or Chinatown , outside of the city walls , now known as <unk> . This allowed the Dutch to monitor the Chinese more easily . To leave the <unk> , ethnic Chinese required special passes . By 1743 , however , ethnic Chinese had already returned to inner Batavia ; several hundred merchants operated there . Other ethnic Chinese led by Khe <unk> fled to Central Java where they attacked Dutch trading posts , and were later joined by troops under the command of the Javanese sultan of Mataram , Pakubuwono II . Though this further uprising was quashed in 1743 , conflicts in Java continued almost without interruption for the next 17 years . 
 On 6 December 1740 van Imhoff and two fellow councillors were arrested on the orders of Valckenier for insubordination , and on 13 January 1741 , they were sent to the Netherlands on separate ships ; they arrived on 19 September 1741 . In the Netherlands , van Imhoff convinced the council that Valckenier was to blame for the massacre and delivered an extensive speech entitled " <unk> over den <unk> <unk> van de Ned . <unk> Comp . " ( " Considerations on the Current Condition of the Dutch East Indies Company " ) on 24 November . As a result of the speech , the charges against him and the other councillors were dismissed . On 27 October 1742 van Imhoff was sent back to Batavia on the <unk> as the new governor @-@ general of the East Indies , with high expectations from the Lords XVII , the leadership of the Dutch East India Company . He arrived in the Indies on 26 May 1743 . 
 Valckenier had asked to be replaced late in 1740 , and in February 1741 had received a reply instructing him to appoint van Imhoff as his successor ; an alternative account indicates that the Lords XVII informed him that he was to be replaced by van Imhoff as punishment for exporting too much sugar and too little coffee in 1739 and thus causing large financial losses . By the time Valckenier received the reply , van Imhoff was already on his way back to the Netherlands . Valckenier left the Indies on 6 November 1741 , after appointing a temporary successor , Johannes <unk> . Taking command of a fleet , Valckenier headed for the Netherlands . On 25 January 1742 he arrived in Cape Town but was detained , and investigated by governor Hendrik <unk> by order of the Lords XVII . In August 1742 Valckenier was sent back to Batavia , where he was imprisoned in Fort Batavia and , three months later , tried on several charges , including his involvement in the massacre . In March 1744 he was convicted and condemned to death , and all his belongings were confiscated . In December 1744 the trial was reopened when Valckenier gave a lengthy statement to defend himself . Valckenier asked for more evidence from the Netherlands , but died in his prison cell on 20 June 1751 , before the investigation was completed . The death penalty was rescinded posthumously in 1755 . Vermeulen characterises the investigation as unfair and fuelled by popular outrage in the Netherlands , and arguably this was officially recognised because in 1760 Valckenier 's son , Adriaan <unk> Valckenier , received reparations totalling 725 @,@ 000 gulden . 
 Sugar production in the area suffered greatly after the massacre , as many of the Chinese who had run the industry had been killed or were missing . It began to recover after the new governor @-@ general , van Imhoff , " colonised " Tangerang . He initially intended for men to come from the Netherlands and work the land ; he considered those already settled in the Indies to be lazy . However , he was unable to attract new settlers because of high taxes and thus sold the land to those already in Batavia . As he had expected , the new land @-@ owners were unwilling to " soil their hands " , and quickly rented out the land to ethnic Chinese . Production rose steadily after this , but took until the 1760s to reach pre @-@ 1740 levels , after which it again diminished . The number of mills also declined . In 1710 there had been 131 , but by 1750 the number had fallen to 66 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Vermeulen described the massacre as " one of the most striking events in 18th @-@ century [ Dutch ] colonialism " . In his doctoral dissertation , W. W. <unk> notes that the attack has figured heavily in Dutch literature , early examples of which include a poem by Willem van Haren that condemned the massacre ( dating from 1742 ) and an anonymous poem , from the same period , critical of the Chinese . Raffles wrote in 1830 that Dutch historical records are " far from complete or satisfactory " . 
 Dutch historian Leonard <unk> writes that the massacre indirectly led to the rapid expansion of Batavia , and institutionalised a modus vivendi that led to a dichotomy between the ethnic Chinese and other groups which could still be felt in the late 20th century . The massacre may also have been a factor in the naming of numerous areas in Jakarta . One possible etymology for the name of the Tanah Abang district ( meaning " red earth " ) is that it was named for the Chinese blood spilled there ; van Hoëvell suggests that the naming was a compromise to make the Chinese survivors accept amnesty more quickly . The name Rawa <unk> , for a subdistrict of East Jakarta , may be derived from the vulgar Indonesian word for corpse , <unk> , due to the great number of ethnic Chinese killed there ; a similar etymology has been suggested for <unk> in Tambora .

 The Million Dollar Homepage is a website conceived in 2005 by Alex Tew , a student from Wiltshire , England , to raise money for his university education . The home page consists of a million pixels arranged in a 1000 × 1000 pixel grid ; the image @-@ based links on it were sold for $ 1 per pixel in 10 × 10 blocks . The purchasers of these pixel blocks provided tiny images to be displayed on them , a URL to which the images were linked , and a slogan to be displayed when hovering a cursor over the link . The aim of the website was to sell all of the pixels in the image , thus generating a million dollars of income for the creator . The Wall Street Journal has commented that the site inspired other websites that sell pixels . 
 Launched on 26 August 2005 , the website became an Internet phenomenon . The Alexa ranking of web traffic peaked at around 127 ; as of 9 May 2009 , it is 40 @,@ 044 . On 1 January 2006 , the final 1 @,@ 000 pixels were put up for auction on eBay . The auction closed on 11 January with a winning bid of $ 38 @,@ 100 that brought the final tally to $ 1 @,@ 037 @,@ 100 in gross income . 
 During the January 2006 auction , the website was subject to a distributed denial @-@ of @-@ service attack and ransom demand , which left it inaccessible to visitors for a week while its security system was upgraded . The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Wiltshire Constabulary investigated the attack and extortion attempt . 
 = = Development = = 
 Alex Tew , a student from Cricklade in Wiltshire , England , conceived The Million Dollar Homepage in August 2005 when he was 21 years old . He was about to begin a three @-@ year Business Management course at the University of Nottingham , and was concerned that he would be left with a student loan that could take years to repay . As a money @-@ raising idea , Tew decided to sell a million pixels on a website for $ 1 each ; purchasers would add their own image , logo or advertisement , and have the option of including a hyperlink to their website . Pixels were sold for US dollars rather than UK pounds ; the US has a larger online population than the UK , and Tew believed more people would relate to the concept if the pixels were sold in US currency . In 2005 , the pound was strong against the dollar : £ 1 was worth approximately $ 1 @.@ 80 , and that cost per pixel may have been too expensive for many potential buyers . Tew 's setup costs were € 50 , which paid for the registration of the domain name and a basic web @-@ hosting package . The website went live on 26 August 2005 . 
 The homepage featured a Web banner with the site 's name and a pixel counter displaying the number of pixels sold , a navigation bar containing nine small links to the site 's internal web pages , and an empty square grid of 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pixels divided into 10 @,@ 000 100 @-@ pixel blocks . Tew promised customers that the site would remain online for at least five years – that is , until at least 26 August 2010 . 
 = = Pixel sales = = 
 Because individual pixels are too small to be seen easily , Pixels were sold in 100 @-@ pixel " blocks " measuring 10 × 10 pixels ; the minimum price was thus $ 100 . The first sale , three days after the site began operating , was to an online music website operated by a friend of Tew 's . He bought 400 pixels in a 20 × 20 block . After two weeks , Tew 's friends and family members had purchased a total of 4 @,@ 700 pixels . The site was initially marketed only through word of mouth ; however , after the site had made $ 1 @,@ 000 , a press release was sent out that was picked up by the BBC . The technology news website The Register featured two articles on The Million Dollar Homepage in September . By the end of the month , The Million Dollar Homepage had received $ 250 @,@ 000 and was ranked Number 3 on Alexa Internet 's list of " Movers and Shakers " behind the websites for Britney Spears and Photo District News . On 6 October , Tew reported the site received 65 @,@ 000 unique visitors ; it received 1465 Diggs , becoming one of the most <unk> links that week . Eleven days later , the number had increased to 100 @,@ 000 unique visitors . On 26 October , two months after the Million Dollar Homepage was launched , more than 500 @,@ 900 pixels had been sold to 1 @,@ 400 customers . By New Year 's Eve , Tew reported that the site was receiving hits from 25 @,@ 000 unique visitors every hour and had an Alexa Rank of 127 , and that 999 @,@ 000 of the 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 pixels had been sold . 
 On 1 January 2006 , Tew announced that because the demand was so great for the last 1 @,@ 000 pixels , " the most fair and logical thing " to do was auction them on eBay rather than lose " the integrity and degree of exclusivity intrinsic to the million @-@ pixel concept " by launching a second Million Dollar Homepage . The auction lasted ten days and received 99 legitimate bids . Although bids were received for amounts as high as $ 160 @,@ 109 @.@ 99 , many were either retracted by the bidders or cancelled as hoaxes . " I actually contacted the people by phone and turns out they weren 't serious , which is fairly frustrating , so I removed those bidders at the last minute " , said Tew . The winning bid was $ 38 @,@ 100 , placed by <unk> , an online store selling diet @-@ related products . Tew remarked that he had expected the final bid amount to be higher due to the media attention . The Million Dollar Homepage made a gross total of $ 1 @,@ 037 @,@ 100 in five months . After costs , taxes and a donation to The Prince 's Trust , a charity for young people , Tew expected his net income to be $ 650 @,@ 000 – $ 700 @,@ 000 . 
 Pixel purchasers included Bonanza Gift Shop , Panda Software , the producers of Wal @-@ Mart : The High Cost of Low Price , British Schools Karting Championship , Book of Cool , Orange , The Times , <unk> , Schiffer Publishing , Rhapsody , Tenacious D , <unk> , <unk> and other online casinos , Independiente Records , Yahoo ! , small privately owned businesses , and companies offering get @-@ rich @-@ quick schemes , online dating services , personal loans , free samples , website designs and holidays .

 Following the September press release that first brought attention to the site , The Million Dollar Homepage was featured in articles on BBC Online , The Register , The Daily Telegraph , and PC Pro . Tew also appeared on the national breakfast television programmes Sky News Sunrise and BBC Breakfast to discuss the website . 
 By November the website was becoming popular around the world , receiving attention from Financial Times Deutschland in Germany , TVNZ in New Zealand , Terra Networks in Latin America , the China Daily , and especially in the United States where it was covered in Adweek , Florida Today , and Wall Street Journal . Tew hired a US @-@ based publicist to help with the attention from the American media and made a week @-@ long trip to the US , where he was interviewed on ABC News Radio , the Fox News Channel , Attack of the Show ! , and local news programmes . 
 The concept was described as " simple and brilliant " , " clever " , " ingenious " , and " a unique platform [ for advertising ] which is also a bit of fun " . Professor Martin Binks , director of the Nottingham University Institute for Entrepreneurial Innovation , said , " It is brilliant in its simplicity ... advertisers have been attracted to it by its novelty ... the site has become a phenomenon . " Popular Mechanics said , " There 's no content . No cool graphics , giveaways or steamy Paris Hilton videos for viewers to salivate over . Imagine a TV channel that shows nothing but commercials , a magazine with nothing but ads . That 's The Million Dollar Homepage . An astonishing example of the power of viral marketing " . Don Oldenburg of the Washington Post was one of the few without praise for the site , calling it a " cheap , mind @-@ bogglingly lucrative marketing monstrosity , an advertising badlands of spam , banner ads and pop @-@ ups . " Oldenburg continues , " it looks like a bulletin board on designer steroids , an advertising train wreck you can 't not look at . It 's like getting every pop @-@ up ad you ever got in your life , at once . It 's the Internet equivalent of suddenly feeling like you want to take a shower . " 
 As the final pixels were being auctioned , Tew was interviewed on Richard & Judy , and profiled in the online BBC News Magazine . The Wall Street Journal wrote about The Million Dollar Homepage and its impact on the Internet community . " Mr. Tew himself has taken on celebrity status in the Internet community ... the creative juice ... paints an interesting picture of online entrepreneurship " . 
 Tew dropped out of the business degree the site was set up to fund after one term . In 2008 , Tew founded <unk> , an Internet aggregation and social networking business .

 On 7 January 2006 , three days before the auction of the final 1 @,@ 000 pixels was due to end , Tew received an e @-@ mail from an organisation called " The Dark Group " , and was told The Million Dollar Homepage would become the victim of a distributed denial @-@ of @-@ service attack ( DDoS ) if a ransom of $ 5 @,@ 000 was not paid by 10 January . Believing the threat to be a hoax , he ignored it , but a week later received a second e @-@ mail threat : " Hello u website is under us <unk> to stop the DDoS send us 50000 $ . " Again , he ignored the threat , and the website was flooded with extra traffic and e @-@ mails , causing it to crash . " I haven 't replied to any of them as I don 't want to give them the satisfaction and I certainly don 't intend to pay them any money . What is happening to my website is like terrorism . If you pay them , new attacks will start , " Tew said . 
 The website was inaccessible to visitors for a week until the host server upgraded the security system , and filtered traffic through anti @-@ DDoS software . Wiltshire Constabulary 's Hi @-@ Tech Crime Unit and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called to investigate the extortion and attack ; they believed it originated in Russia .

 Many other sites sell advertising by pixels . Tew said of the sites , " [ they ] popped up almost immediately ; now there are hundreds of Web sites selling pixels .

 Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs is an American animated comedy television series produced by Amblin Television label in collaboration with Warner Bros. Animation . It is the second animated series created by Tom Ruegger , developed during the animation renaissance of the late 1980s and early 1990s . Animaniacs first aired on Fox Kids from 1993 to 1995 and new episodes later appeared on The WB from 1995 to 1998 as part of its Kids ' WB afternoon programming block . The series had a total of 99 episodes and one film , titled Wakko 's Wish . 
 Animaniacs is a variety show , with short skits featuring a large cast of characters . While the show had no set format , the majority of episodes were composed of three short mini @-@ episodes , each starring a different set of characters , and bridging segments . Hallmarks of the series included its music , character catchphrases , and humor directed at an adult audience . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Premise = = = 
 The Warner siblings and the other characters lived in Burbank , California . However , characters from the series had episodes in various places and periods of time . The Animaniacs characters interacted with famous persons and creators of the past and present as well as mythological characters and characters from modern television . Andrea Romano , the casting and recording director of Animaniacs , said that the Warner siblings functioned to " tie the show together , " by appearing in and introducing other characters ' segments . Each Animaniacs episode usually consisted of two or three cartoon shorts . Animaniacs segments ranged in time , from bridging segments less than a minute long to episodes spanning the entire show length ; writer Peter Hastings said that the varying episode lengths gave the show a " sketch comedy " atmosphere . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Animaniacs had a large cast of characters , separated into individual segments , with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot . The Warners , Yakko , Wakko , and Dot , were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s , when they escaped . After their escape , they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers , including Ralph , the security guard ; Dr. Otto <unk> , the studio psychiatrist , and his assistant Hello Nurse . Pinky and the Brain are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt to take over the world . Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew , Skippy Squirrel , about cartoon techniques . Additional principal characters included Rita and Runt , Buttons and Mindy , Chicken Boo , Flavio and Marita ( The Hip Hippos ) , Katie Ka @-@ Boom , a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers , and Minerva Mink . 
 = = = Creation and inspiration = = = 
 The Animaniacs cast of characters had a variety of inspiration , from celebrities to writers ' family members to other writers . Executive Producer Steven Spielberg said that the irreverence in Looney Tunes cartoons inspired the Animaniacs cast . The general premise of Animaniacs and the Warner siblings were created by Tom Ruegger , who also came up with the concept and characters for Pinky and the Brain . Ruegger was also the senior producer and creative leader of the show . Writer Deanna Oliver contributed The Goodfeathers scripts and the character Chicken Boo . Producer and writer Sherri Stoner contributed heavily to Slappy Squirrel and Pinky and the Brain . Nicholas Hollander based Katie Kaboom on his teenage daughter . 
 Senior Producer Tom Ruegger modeled the Warners ' personalities heavily after those of his three sons . Because the Warners were portrayed as cartoon stars from the early 1930s , Ruegger and other artists for Animaniacs made the images of the Warners similar to cartoon characters of the early 1930s . Simple black and white drawings were very common in cartoons of the 1920s and 1930s , such as Buddy , Felix the Cat , Oswald the Lucky Rabbit , and the early versions of Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse . 
 Tom Ruegger created Pinky and the Brain after being inspired by the personalities of two of his Tiny Toon Adventures colleagues , Eddie Fitzgerald and Tom Minton . Ruegger thought of the premise of Pinky and the Brain when he wondered what would happen if Minton and Fitzgerald tried to take over the world . 
 Sherri Stoner created Slappy the Squirrel when another writer and friend of Stoner , John McCann , made fun of Stoner 's career in TV movies playing troubled teenagers . When McCann joked that Sherri would be playing troubled teenagers when she was fifty years old , Sherri developed the idea of Slappy 's characteristics as an older person acting like a teenager . Sherri Stoner liked the idea of an aged cartoon character because an aged cartoon star would know the secrets of other cartoons and " have the dirt on [ them ] " .

 Steven Spielberg was the executive producer during the entire run , Tom Ruegger was the senior producer , Jean MacCurdy was the executive in charge of production , and Rich <unk> , Sherri Stoner , Peter Hastings , Rusty Mills , and Liz Holzman were producers of the show . The producers of the show usually had other jobs on the series ; Tom Ruegger , Rich <unk> , and Sherri Stoner all served as writers , and Spielberg was very involved in the show 's writing , checking every script for the series . Voice director Andrea Romano said that Spielberg also came up with story ideas , read storyboards , and came to recording sessions . 
 = = = Writers = = = 
 The Animaniacs writers and animators , led by senior producer Tom Ruegger , used the experience gained from the previous series to create new animated characters that were cast in the mold of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery 's creations . Writers for Animaniacs included writers Tom Ruegger , Sherri Stoner and Paul Rugg , Deanna Oliver , John McCann , Nicholas Hollander , Peter Hastings , Charlie Howell , Gordon <unk> , Jeff <unk> , Earl Kress , Tom Minton , and Randy Rogel . Writers Hastings , Rugg , Stoner , McCann , Howell , and <unk> were involved in sketch comedy . Other writers for the series came from cartoon backgrounds , including Kress , Minton , and Randy Rogel . 
 Made @-@ up stories did not exclusively comprise Animaniacs writing , as writer Peter Hastings said : " We weren 't really there to tell compelling stories ... [ As a writer ] you could do a real story , you could recite the Star @-@ Spangled Banner , or you could parody a commercial ... you could do all these kinds of things , and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up . " Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them ; the episodes " Ups and Downs , " " Survey Ladies , " and " I Got Yer Can " were episodes based on true stories that happened to Paul Rugg , Deanna Oliver , and Sherri Stoner , respectively . Another episode , " <unk> 's Mom , " both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner 's childhood reaction to the film . 
 In an interview , writers for the series said that Animaniacs allowed for non @-@ restrictive and open writing . Writer Peter Hastings said that the format of the series had the atmosphere of a sketch comedy show because Animaniacs segments could widely vary in both time and subject . Writer Sherri Stoner said that the Animaniacs writing staff worked well as a team in that writers could consult other writers on how to write or finish a story , as was the case in the episode " The Three Muska @-@ Warners " . Writers Rugg , Hastings and Stoner said that the Animaniacs writing was free in that the writers were allowed to write about and parody subjects that would not be touched on other series .

 Animaniacs featured Rob Paulsen as Yakko , Pinky and Dr. Otto von <unk> , Tress MacNeille as Dot , Jess Harnell as Wakko , Sherri Stoner as Slappy the Squirrel , Maurice LaMarche as the Brain , <unk> and the belching segments " The Great <unk> " ( Harnell said that he himself is commonly mistaken for the role ) , and veteran voice actor Frank Welker as Ralph the Security Guard , Thaddeus Plotz and Runt . Andrea Romano said that the casters wanted Paulsen to play the role of Yakko : " We had worked with Rob Paulsen before on a couple of other series and we wanted him to play Yakko . " Romano said that the casters had " no trouble " choosing the role of Dot , referring to MacNeille as " just hilarious ... And yet [ she had ] that edge . " Before Animaniacs , Harnell had little experience in voice acting other than minor roles for Disney which he " fell into " . Harnell revealed that at the audition for the show , he did a John Lennon impression and the audition " went great " . Stoner commented that when she gave an impression of what the voice would be to Spielberg , he said she should play Slappy . According to Romano , she personally chose Bernadette Peters to play Rita . Other voices were provided by Jim Cummings , Paul Rugg , Vernee Watson @-@ Johnson , Jeff Bennett and Gail <unk> ( from Tiny Toon Adventures ) . Tom Ruegger 's three sons also played roles on the series . Nathan Ruegger voiced Skippy Squirrel , nephew to Slappy , throughout the duration of the series ; Luke Ruegger voiced The Flame in historical segments on Animaniacs ; and Cody Ruegger voiced Birdie from Wild Blue Yonder .

 Animation work on Animaniacs was farmed out to several different studios , both American and international , over the course of the show 's production . The animation companies included Tokyo Movie Shinsha ( now known as TMS Entertainment ) , <unk> , Wang Film Productions , Freelance Animators New Zealand , and AKOM , and most Animaniacs episodes frequently had animation from different companies in each episode 's respective segments . 
 Animaniacs was made with a higher production value than standard television animation ; the show had a higher cel count than most TV cartoons . The Animaniacs characters often move fluidly , and do not regularly stand still and speak , as in other television cartoons . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Animaniacs utilized a heavy musical score for an animated program , with every episode featuring at least one original score . The idea for an original musical score in every episode came from Steven Spielberg . Animaniacs used a 35 @-@ piece orchestra , and was scored by a team of six composers , led by supervising composer Richard Stone . The composing team included Steve and Julie Bernstein , Carl Johnson , J. Eric Schmidt , Gordon Goodwin and Tim Kelly . The use of the large orchestra in modern Warner Bros. animation began with Animaniacs predecessor , Tiny Toon Adventures , but Spielberg pushed for its use even more in Animaniacs . Although the outcome was a very expensive show to produce , " the sound sets us apart from everyone else in animation , " said Jean MacCurdy , the executive in charge of production for the series . According to Steve and Julie Bernstein , not only was the Animaniacs music written in the same style as that of Looney Tunes composer Carl Stalling , but that the music used the same studio and piano that Stalling used . Senior producer Tom Ruegger said that writers Randy Rogel , Nicholas Hollander , and Deanna Oliver wrote " a lot of music " for the series . 
 = = Hallmarks and humor = = 
 The humor of Animaniacs varied in type , ranging from parody to cartoon violence . The series made parodies of television shows and films . In an interview , Spielberg defended the " irreverence " of Animaniacs , saying that the Animaniacs crew has " a point of view " and does not " sit back passively and play both sides equally " . Spielberg also said that Animaniacs ' humor of social commentary and irreverence were inspired by the Marx Brothers and Looney Tunes cartoons . Animaniacs , among other Spielberg @-@ produced shows , had a large amount of cartoon violence . Spielberg defended the violence in Animaniacs by saying that the series had a balance of both violent humor and educational segments , so the series would never become either too violent or " benign " . Animaniacs also made use of catchphrases , recurring jokes and segments , and " adult " humor . 
 = = = Recurring jokes and catchphrases = = = 
 Characters on Animaniacs had catchphrases , with some characters having more than one . Notable catchphrases include Yakko 's " Goodnight , everybody ! " often said following adult humor , Wakko 's " <unk> ! " and Dot 's frequent assertions of her cuteness . The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was " Hello @-@ o @-@ o , nurse ! " Tom Ruegger said that the " Hello @-@ o @-@ o , Nurse ! " line was intended to be a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny 's line , " What 's up , doc ? " Before the theme song for each " Pinky and the Brain " segment , Pinky asks , " Gee , Brain , what do you want to do tonight ? " Brain replies , " The same thing we do every night , Pinky : try to take over the world ! " During these episodes , Brain often asks Pinky , " Are you pondering what I 'm pondering ? " and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur . Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode " Win Big , " and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes . 
 Running gags and recurring segments were very common in the show . The end of every episode was closed with a water tower gag similar to the The Simpsons couch gag . Director Rusty Mills and senior producer Tom Ruegger said that recurring segments like the water tower gag and another segment titled " The Wheel of Morality " eased the production of episodes because the same animated scenes could be used more than once ( and , in the case of the Wheel segments , enabled the producers to add a segment in where there was not room for anything else in the episode ) . 
 = = = Humor and content intended for adults = = = 
 A great deal of Animaniacs ' humor and content was aimed at an adult audience . Animaniacs parodied the film A Hard Day 's Night and the Three Tenors , references that The New York Times wrote were " appealing to older audiences " . The comic operas of Gilbert and Sullivan Pirates of Penzance and H.M.S. Pinafore were parodied in episode 3 , " HMS Yakko " . The Warners ' personalities were made similar to those of the Marx Brothers and Jerry Lewis , in that they , according to writer Peter Hastings , " wreak havoc , " in " serious situations " . In addition , the show 's recurring Goodfeathers segment was populated with characters based on characters from The Godfather and Goodfellas , R @-@ rated crime dramas neither marketed nor intended for children . Some content of Animaniacs was not only aimed at an adult audience but was suggestive in nature ; One character , Minerva Mink had episodes that network censors considered too sexually suggestive for the show 's intended audience , for which she was soon de @-@ emphasized as a featured character . 
 = = = Parodies = = = 
 Animaniacs parodied popular TV shows and movies and caricatured celebrities . Animaniacs made fun of celebrities , major motion pictures , television shows for adults ( Seinfeld and Friends , among others ) , television shows for children , and trends in the US . One episode even made fun of competing show Power Rangers , and another episode caricatured Animaniacs ' own Internet fans . Animaniacs also made potshots of Disney films , creating parodies of such films as The Lion King , Beauty and the Beast , Pocahontas , Bambi , and others . Animaniacs director Russell <unk> said that not only did it become a compliment to be parodied on Animaniacs but also that being parodied on the series would be taken as a " badge of honor " . 
 = = = Songs = = = 
 Animaniacs had a variety of music types . Many Animaniacs songs were parodies of classical or folk music with educational lyrics . Notable ones include " Yakko 's World " , in which Yakko sings the names of all 200 @-@ some nations of the world to the tune of the Mexican Hat Dance . " Wakko 's America " listed all the United States and their capitals to the tune of Turkey in the Straw . Another song , titled " The Presidents " , named every US president ( up to Bill Clinton , due to production date ) to the tune of the William Tell Overture ( with a very brief usage of the tune Dixie ) . Non @-@ educational songs included parodies , such as the segment " Slippin ' on the Ice " , a parody of " Singin ' in the Rain " . Most of the groups of characters even had their own theme songs for their segment on the show . 
 The Animaniacs series theme song , performed by the Warners , was a very important part of the show . In the series ' first season , the theme won an Emmy Award for best song . Stone composed the music for the title sequence and Ruegger wrote the lyrics . Several Animaniacs albums and Sing @-@ along VHS tapes were released , including the CDs Animaniacs , Yakko 's World , and Variety Pack , and the tape Animaniacs Sing @-@ Along : Yakko 's World . 
 Shorts featuring Rita and Runt would also incorporate songs for Bernadette Peters to sing .

 During its run , Animaniacs became the second @-@ most popular children 's show in both demographics of children ages 2 – 11 and children ages 6 – 11 ( behind Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ) . Animaniacs , along with other animated series , helped to bring " Fox Kids " ratings much larger than those of the channel 's competitors . In November 1993 , Animaniacs and Tiny Toon Adventures almost doubled the ratings of their rival shows , Darkwing Duck and Goof Troop , in both the 2 – 11 and 6 – 11 demographics that are very important to children 's networks . On Kids ' WB , Animaniacs gathered about one @-@ million children viewers every week . 
 While Animaniacs was popular among younger viewers ( the target demographic for Warner Bros.

The large adult fanbase even led to one of the first Internet @-@ based fandom cultures . During the show 's prime , the Internet newsgroup <unk> was an active gathering place for fans of the show ( most of whom were adults ) to post reference guides , fan fiction , and fan @-@ made artwork about Animaniacs .

 Before Animaniacs was put into production , various collaboration and brainstorming efforts were thought up to create both the characters and premise of the series . For instance , ideas that were thrown out were Rita and Runt being the hosts of the show and the Warners being duck characters that senior producer Tom Ruegger drew in his college years . After the characters from the series were created , they were all shown to executive producer Steven Spielberg , who would decide which characters would make it into Animaniacs ( the characters Buttons and Mindy were chosen by Spielberg 's daughter ) . The characters ' designs came from various sources , including caricatures of other writers , designs based on early cartoon characters , and characters that simply had a more modern design .

 Animaniacs premiered on September 13 , 1993 , on the Fox Kids programming block of the Fox network , and ran there until September 8 , 1995 ; new episodes aired from the 1993 through 1994 seasons . Animaniacs aired with a 65 @-@ episode first season because these episodes were ordered by Fox all at once . While on Fox Kids , Animaniacs gained fame for its name and became the second @-@ most popular show among children ages 2 – 11 and children ages 6 – 11 , second to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ( which began that same year ) . On March 30 , 1994 , Yakko , Wakko , and Dot first theatrically appeared in the animated short , " I 'm Mad " , which opened nationwide alongside the full @-@ length animated feature , Thumbelina . The musical short featured Yakko , Wakko , and Dot bickering during a car trip . Producers Steven Spielberg , Tom Ruegger , and Jean MacCurdy wanted " I 'm Mad " to be the first of a series of shorts to bring Animaniacs to a wider audience . However , " I 'm Mad " was the only Animaniacs theatrical short produced . The short was later incorporated into Animaniacs episode 69 . Following the 65th episode of the series , Animaniacs continued to air in reruns on Fox Kids . The only new episodes during this time included a short , four @-@ episode long second season that was quickly put together from unused scripts . After Fox Kids aired Animaniacs reruns for a year , the series switched to the new Warner Bros. children 's programming block , Kids ' WB .

 The series was popular enough for Warner Bros. Animation to invest in additional episodes of Animaniacs past the traditional 65 @-@ episode marker for syndication . Animaniacs premiered on the new Kids ' WB line @-@ up on September 9 , 1995 , with a new season of 13 episodes . At this time , the show 's popular cartoon characters , Pinky and the Brain , were spun off from Animaniacs into their own TV series . Warner Bros. stated in a press release that Animaniacs gathered over one million children viewers every week . 
 Despite the series ' success on Fox Kids , Animaniacs on Kids ' WB was only successful in an unintended way , bringing in adult viewers and viewers outside the Kids ' WB target demographic of young children . This unintended result of adult viewers and not enough young viewers put pressure on the WB network from advertisers and caused dissatisfaction from the WB network towards Animaniacs . Slowly , orders from the WB for more Animaniacs episodes dwindled and Animaniacs had a couple more short seasons , relying on leftover scripts and storyboards . The fourth season had eight episodes , which was reduced from 18 because of Warner Bros. ' dissatisfaction with Animaniacs . The 99th and final Animaniacs episode was aired on November 14 , 1998 . 
 The Chicago Tribune reported in 1999 that the production of new Animaniacs episodes ceased and the direct @-@ to @-@ video film Wakko 's Wish was a closer to the series . Animation World Network Reported that Warner Bros. laid off over 100 artists , contributing to the reduced production of original series . Producer Tom Ruegger explained that rather produce new episodes , Warner Bros. instead decided to use the back @-@ catalog of Animaniacs episodes until " someone <unk> for more " . Animaniacs segments were shown along with segments from other cartoons as part of The Cat & Birdy <unk> <unk> Big <unk> Show . Ruegger said at the time the hiatus was " temporary " . Following the end of the series , the Animaniacs team developed Wakko 's Wish . On December 21 , 1999 , Warner Bros. released Wakko 's Wish . In 2016 , Ruegger said on his Reddit AMA that the decline of Animaniacs and other series was the result of Warner Bros. ' investment in the much cheaper anime series Pokémon . Following Warner Bros. right to distribute the cheaper and successful anime , the network chose to invest less in original programming like Animaniacs .

 After Animaniacs , Spielberg collaborated with Warner Bros.

Warner Bros. also produced two other comedy animated series in the later half of the decade titled Histeria ! and Detention , which were short @-@ lived and unsuccessful compared to the earlier series . Later , Warner Bros. cut back the size of its animation studio because the show Histeria ! went over its budget , and most production on further Warner Bros. animated comedy series ceased . 
 Animaniacs , along with Tiny Toon Adventures , continued to rerun in syndication through the 1990s into the early 2000s after production of new episodes ceased . In the US , Animaniacs aired on Cartoon Network , originally as a one @-@ off airing on January 31 , 1997 , and then on the regular schedule from August 31 , 1998 until the spring of 2001 , when Nickelodeon bought the rights to air the series beginning on September 1 , 2001 .

 = Russian battleship Sevastopol ( 1895 ) = 
 Sevastopol ( Russian : Севастополь ) was the last of three ships in the Petropavlovsk class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1890s . 
 Named for the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War , the ship was commissioned into the First Pacific Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet and was stationed at Port Arthur ( today <unk> District , Dalian , Liaoning , China ) , a Russian naval base acquired from China in 1898 as part of the Kwantung Leased Territory . One of the first ships to use Harvey nickel @-@ steel armor and Popov radios , she displaced 11 @,@ 854 long tons ( 12 @,@ 044 t ) at full load and was 369 feet ( 112 @.@ 5 m ) long overall , and mounted a main battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in two twin turrets . She was laid down in May 1892 , launched on 1 June 1895 and completed in 1899 . Her sea trials lasted until 1900 . 
 Sevastopol saw service in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . Slightly damaged during a surprise attack on Port Arthur in early February , the ship later participated in several attempts to break out from the besieged port . The most notable of these was the Battle of the Yellow Sea , where she was damaged by several shells but managed to make it back to port with the remnants of the Russian Fleet , leaving one crewman dead and 62 wounded . Immediately after the surrender of Port Arthur , Sevastopol was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Imperial Japanese Navy . The Japanese never raised her . The remains of the ship still lie outside the entrance to the port . 
 = = Design = = 
 The first design for Sevastopol and her sister ships of the Petropavlovsk class was approved in January 1891 . She was to be an improved version of the battleship Imperator Nikolai I , but with most of her armament in barbettes , including four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns . The class was designed with a displacement of 10 @,@ 960 long tons ( 11 @,@ 136 t ) at full load . She had a full waterline belt , and the upper hull featured a tumblehome . Imperator Nikolai I was chosen as a starting point for the design because of her good seakeeping and seaworthiness . Some characteristics were also copied from the French battleship Brennus and the American Indiana @-@ class battleships , such as the flush @-@ deck hull and Brennus ' high freeboard . 
 Following a redesign of the class , Sevastopol ceased to resemble Imperator Nikolai I. The armor plating was changed before construction , and plans for the armament were modified while the ship was being built . The barbettes were replaced with turrets , including wing turrets for some of the secondary 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns modeled after those on Brennus , with electric hoists . The propulsion was based on the machinery on Georgii Pobedonosets . Sevastopol had Harvey nickel @-@ steel armor imported from the United States . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Sevastopol displaced 11 @,@ 842 long tons ( 12 @,@ 032 t ) and was 376 feet ( 114 @.@ 6 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 70 feet ( 21 @.@ 3 m ) and a maximum draft of 28 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 6 m ) . She was powered by 16 cylindrical coal @-@ burning boilers , and could carry 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) of coal . This gave her a range of 3 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 940 km ; 4 @,@ 320 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a crew of 662 . 
 The ship 's main armament consisted of a battery of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in two twin turrets . This was supplemented by a secondary battery of twelve 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . Sevastopol 's armament was rounded out with ten 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns , twenty @-@ eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ torpedo boat guns , and six 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged .

 Sevastopol , named for the siege of Sevastopol during the Crimean War , was laid down at the Galernii Island shipyard in Saint Petersburg on 7 March 1892 . Construction was led by two engineers , E. P. <unk> and N. I. Afanasyev , and began on 7 May 1892 , about the same time as the battleship Sissoi Veliky was laid down . The ceremony was attended by Alexander III of Russia and then @-@ Tsesarevich Nicholas II . Sevastopol was launched on 1 June 1895 and , after the completion of her hull and decks in 1898 , was transferred to Kronstadt where her armor and guns were installed . Sevastopol was finished in 1899 and Nikolai <unk> became her captain , a post which he would retain until 17 March 1904 , when Nikolai Essen assumed command . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Sevastopol began her sea trials on 16 October 1899 , and was commissioned after their conclusion into the Imperial Russian Navy . She and her sister ships were transferred to Port Arthur , which was then the port of the First Squadron of the Russian Pacific Fleet . In September 1900 , Popov radios were installed on Sevastopol and her sister Poltava , the first Russian battleships to have them . They were also painted white , the same color as the other ships in the First Pacific Squadron . She then left for Port Arthur and arrived at on 13 April 1901 . As Russia was not at war with any Far East countries at that time , Sevastopol stayed in port , inactive . 
 = = = Wartime service = = = 
 In early February 1904 , the Japanese Navy launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . Sevastopol was hit by one shell , either 6 inches ( 152 mm ) or 8 inches ( 203 mm ) in diameter , that wounded two men on her bridge . She soon turned in pursuit along with other ships of the Russian fleet , all firing their forward guns , but she failed to score any hits . On 26 March 1904 , Sevastopol was accidentally rammed by Peresvet , damaging a propeller . After the attack on Port Arthur , the First Pacific Squadron tried to break out several times . During one attempt on 23 June , Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft , commanding the Pacific Fleet , retreated after encountering the Japanese fleet . Approaching the harbor , Sevastopol moved slightly out of formation and hit a mine that killed 11 and caused severe flooding , but managed to get inside the harbor and drop anchor . She was under repair for six weeks , during which time a fire broke out on deck , killing two and wounding 28 . The Russian battleships were too big to fit into the dry dock at Port Arthur , so large caissons were built to provide access to the ships ' hulls . On 9 August , with the Japanese Third Army assaulting the outer defenses of Port Arthur , the First Pacific Squadron sortied from its base . Even though Sevastopol was not fully repaired , she sailed with the rest of the fleet with one gun in her aft turret remaining inoperable . They later engaged the Japanese fleet in what would become the Battle of the Yellow Sea . 
 Although in the center of the Russian line during the battle , Sevastopol was only slightly damaged during the day . In the evening , the Russians massed their fire on the Japanese flagship Mikasa , at that time 11 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 8 mi ) away . The Japanese battleships returned fire and Sevastopol suffered several shell hits to her superstructure , which killed one man and wounded 62 others . A few minutes later , Mikasa was hit by two 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) shells and one 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) shell from Retvizan and Sevastopol , which caused 40 casualties . Soon after that , when it seemed that the Russians would be able to escape to Vladivostok , two 12 @-@ inch shells from Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship Tsesarevich , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman , severely wounding the captain , and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn . Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft , the Russian line started to execute the same turn , causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich , including Sevastopol , to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship . Prince Pavel <unk> , second in command of the squadron , who was on the Peresvet , proceeded to signal the other Russian ships via semaphore to steam back to Port Arthur , although the signals were only gradually recognized by Pobeda , Poltava , Pallada and Sevastopol . Sevastopol had one 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) and two 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns knocked out during the battle . 
 Returning to Port Arthur on 10 August , the squadron found that the city was already under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke . On 23 August , Sevastopol bombarded a Japanese battery in an effort to escape along with nine smaller ships , but after she neutralized the battery , she returned to port after a Japanese lookout spotted the approaching ships . As she was maneuvering back into Port Arthur , she struck another mine and required repairs . On 5 December the Third Army captured 203 Meter Hill , a crucial position that overlooked the harbor . From there , the Japanese were able to fire on Sevastopol and other ships of the First Pacific Squadron that had survived the Yellow Sea battle . The ships at that time were about 5 @.@ 7 kilometers ( 3 @.@ 5 mi ) away from the hill , placing them within range of Japanese shore artillery . By 9 December four battleships and two cruisers had been sunk by the Japanese . Sevastopol , although hit five times by 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) shells , managed to move away from the western harbor and out of range of the guns to the minor harbor of White Wolf , where she could be defended by torpedo nets and booms . Within the defensive surroundings of White Wolf , Essen started to plan a sortie through the blockade to Vladivostok or a rendezvous with the Second Pacific Squadron , at that time coaling at Madagascar . At the same time , the commanding admiral of the Imperial Japanese Navy , Togo Heihachiro , as instructed by Emperor Meiji in Tokyo , ordered the destruction of the battleship by six waves of destroyers , along with some torpedo boats that were launched from the Fuji and Mikasa . 
 The torpedo boat and destroyer attacks lasted three weeks , during which 80 torpedoes were launched at Sevastopol . Of these , four hit . The four successful torpedoes were launched on 18 December . Three of them hit the torpedo nets that had been placed around the ship , while the other hit one of the ship 's propellers . Although severely damaged , Sevastopol remained afloat and sank two destroyers and damaged six others , killing 35 sailors and five officers . A Japanese cruiser attempting to attack Sevastopol was sunk by a mine in the harbor . When he received news of the surrender of the land fortifications on 2 January 1905 , Essen decided to surrender , but scuttled the ship in 55 meters ( 180 ft ) of water by opening the seacocks on one side so that the ship could not be salvaged by the Japanese . His other option , a run to Vladivostok , had already been eliminated due to the damage to his propellers by the torpedo . For the act of scuttling Sevastopol , Essen was awarded the Order of St. George . Nevertheless , a dispatch from Tokyo reported that it sank as a result of a Japanese torpedo attack . 
 Due to the depth of water in which she had sunk , and her position , Sevastopol was the only battleship that was not salvaged by the Japanese at Port Arthur . What remains of her is still outside the entrance to Port Arthur . Poltava , one of her sister ships , was also scuttled at Port Arthur and re @-@ floated as the Japanese Tango .

Other cast members also struggled with food issues . Benanti spent three years fighting anorexia while she danced on Broadway . Pentecost , who weighed 310 pounds at the time of filming , contributed stories from his own life to the series , including a scene in which his character weighs himself on a postal scale because he is too heavy for a conventional bathroom scale . Brown was heavy as a child and describes himself as being " haunted by the ' heavyset kid mentality ' . " Producers only discovered that each of the principal cast members had food issues after the casting process was completed . 
 Starved and It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia were developed for FX under the auspices of FX president John Landgraf , who sought to expand the network 's viewership by providing a wider variety of programming . The shows were the network 's first attempts at sitcoms following the short @-@ lived 2003 series Lucky . FX at the time was known primarily for its edgy dramatic series . Bruce Lefkowitz , then executive vice president of Fox Cable Entertainment , outlined the strategy : " We kind of staked out a unique space in dramas that are very different from everybody else ’ s , so the next natural evolution is to do something in the comedy space . " The network ordered seven episodes of each series . 
 Starved was shot in the spring of 2005 in New York City using a single @-@ camera setup and without a laugh track . It and Sunny were the first shows that FX produced inhouse .

 Starved generated controversy even before its premiere . A number of specialists in the treatment of eating disorders expressed concern that the program would either make light of or glamorize eating disorders . Others , however , felt that Starved might focus attention on eating disorders as a serious medical condition . The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo ( makers of Tanqueray ) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising . Schaeffer responded to the controversy , saying " there is some difficult stuff to watch . But I know my spirit and intention are good . " 
 Starved premiered to an audience of 1 @.@ 54 million viewers , scoring a Neilsen rating of 0 @.@ 8 and a 2 share among adults 18 @-@ 49 , the network 's target demographic . Reviews were unfavorable . Variety echoed the slogan of Belt Tighteners in dismissing the series as " not OK . " Noting the series ' edgy content , Variety allows that " Pushing the envelope in terms of standards is all well and good , assuming that series earn the right to do so . " Starved , it says , did not earn that right . The series ' " stabs at poignancy feel unconvincing and forced " and " from an emotional standpoint there 's seldom a truthful note . " 
 The Washington Post concurred in this assessment , describing the premise of the show as " Hey , what happens if you take the characters from Seinfeld and give them eating disorders ? " While crediting Starved for " a few inventive laughs , " the language and sexuality of the show are described as " exceptionally coarse " and " outrageous for cable television , even later at night . " Worse than these issues , the Post felt that Schaeffer neglected to develop the characters in favor of coming up with contrived situations for them . " [ T ] his failure to build understanding into the show dooms it to emptiness , with a sour aftertaste . As if you had just , you know , hurled . " 
 The New York Times credited the series for its bold premise and noted that the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering " a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire . " Ultimately , however , the Times found that " Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross @-@ out farce . " The Los Angeles Times found the show " vexing " for being " at once assured and shallow , accomplished and unconvincing , well @-@ acted and empty . " The review singles out Schaeffer 's character Sam as " especially unappealing " and points to Schaeffer 's roles as creator , producer , writer and director as " an object lesson in the wisdom of a system of checks and balances . " Perhaps most <unk> , in noting Schaeffer 's experiences with addiction , the reviewer writes that " just because you ’ ve had an experience doesn ’ t mean you have anything interesting to say about it or are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say . " 
 New York Magazine called it the Best Show You Probably Never Watched . NBC used a clip from the second episode in " The Most Outrageous TV Moments " . 
 FX canceled Starved in October 2005 . FX president John Landgraf told Variety , " The show had a lot of fans , so it was tough to choose [ between it and It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia ] . Ultimately , we felt that we 're just not in a position to spread our resources . We launched our dramas one at a time , and launching two [ comedies ] like we did this summer just didn 't work out as well . " 
 = Battle of Arnhem = 
 The Battle of Arnhem was a famous battle of the Second World War fought in and around the Dutch towns of Arnhem , Oosterbeek , Wolfheze , Driel and the surrounding countryside from 17 – 26 September 1944 . 
 After sweeping through France and Belgium in the summer of 1944 , the Allies were poised to enter the Netherlands . British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery favoured a single thrust north over the branches of the Lower Rhine River , allowing the British Second Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and attack the Ruhr . To this end , the Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September . Airborne troops were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance . Farthest north , the British 1st Airborne Division , supported by men of the Glider Pilot Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade , landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn . Initially expecting a walkover , British XXX Corps planned to reach the British airborne forces within two to three days . 
 The British forces landed some distance from their objectives and were quickly hampered by unexpected resistance – especially from elements of the 9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions . Only a small force was able to reach the Arnhem road bridge while the main body of the division was halted on the outskirts of the city . Meanwhile , XXX Corps was unable to advance north as quickly as anticipated due to the destruction of the bridge at Son , and failed to relieve the airborne troops according to schedule . After four days , the small British force at the bridge was overwhelmed and the rest of the division became trapped in a small pocket north of the river – where they could not be sufficiently reinforced by the Poles or XXX Corps when they arrived on the southern bank , nor by the RAF 's resupply flights . After nine days of fighting , the shattered remains of the airborne forces were withdrawn in Operation Berlin . 
 With no secure bridges over the Nederrijn , the Allies were unable to advance further and the front line stabilised south of Arnhem . The 1st Airborne Division had lost nearly three @-@ quarters of its strength and did not see combat again . 
 = = Background = = 
 By September 1944 , Allied forces had successfully broken out of their Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium . Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands , Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to head north through the Dutch Gelderland , bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr . Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet , the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army and a set piece ground advance into the Netherlands , codenamed Market Garden . 
 Montgomery 's plan involved dropping the US 101st Airborne Division to capture key bridges around Eindhoven , the US 82nd Airborne Division to secure key crossings around Nijmegen , and the British 1st Airborne Division , with the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade attached , to capture three bridges across the Rhine at Arnhem . Although Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton commanded the First Allied Airborne Army , his second in command Lieutenant @-@ General Frederick Browning took command of the airborne role . The British Second Army , led by XXX Corps would advance up the " Airborne corridor " , securing the airborne division 's positions and crossing the Rhine within two days . If successful the plan would open the door to Germany and hopefully force an end to the war in Europe by the end of the year . 
 = = = British plan = = = 
 With the British 6th Airborne Division still refitting after Operation Tonga , and the subsequent fighting in Normandy , the task of securing the Rhine Bridgehead fell to the 1st Airborne Division under the command of Major @-@ General Roy Urquhart . The division was made up of three brigades of infantry ( two parachute , one glider borne ) , supporting artillery and anti @-@ tank batteries and substantial Royal Engineer units , as well as supporting elements such as Royal Army Service Corps and Royal Army Medical Corps units . Most of the division had seen action in North Africa and Sicily , particularly the 1st Parachute Brigade and 1st Airlanding Brigade . However , this was the first time the division had fought together as a complete formation . 
 The division was also substantially reinforced by the addition of 1 @,@ 200 men of the Glider Pilot Regiment , providing Urquhart with the equivalent of two battalions of infantry for the operation . Smaller additions included a Dutch commando team and American communications teams . Urquhart also had the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade under his command , who would also be joining the British in the operation to seize the bridges . 
 The division was required to secure the road , rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and hold them for two to three days until relieved by XXX Corps . From the beginning , however , Urquhart was severely restricted in how he could prepare and deploy his troops for the upcoming battle . The U.S. IX Troop Carrier Command were limited in their availability ; with two more major drops taking place at the same time , there were insufficient carrier aircraft available to fly the entire division to the Netherlands in one lift . Additionally , Major General Williams — commander of IX Troop Carrier Command — decided that it would only be possible for one air lift per day , meaning it would take three days to deliver the entire Division and Polish Brigade to the area . A limited number of areas suitable for glider landings and a reluctance from troop command to fly too near to Arnhem , exposing them to flak from Deelen airfield after the drop , meant that Urquhart was forced to pick drop zones ( DZ ) and landing zones ( LZ ) up to 8 mi ( 13 km ) from Arnhem itself , on the north side of the river . With the need to secure the bridges , towns and drop zones for subsequent supply drops , the 1st Airborne would need to defend a perimeter of some 18 mi ( 29 km ) whilst waiting for XXX Corps . 
 Urquhart decided to land Brigadier Gerald Lathbury 's 1st Parachute Brigade and Brigadier " Pip " Hicks ' 1st Airlanding Brigade on the first day of the operation . The Airlanding Brigade plus 1st Airlanding Light Regiment , Royal Artillery , Royal Engineer and medical units and Divisional HQ would land on LZs ' S ' and ' Z ' and move to secure the drop zones and landing zones for the following days drops , whilst the three battalions of the parachute brigade would arrive at DZ ' X ' and follow three separate routes into Arnhem to secure the bridges . The 2nd Battalion — under the command of Lt. Col. John Frost — would follow the riverside roads to the centre of Arnhem ( codenamed the Lion route ) and secure the main road and railway bridges , as well as a pontoon bridge between the two . The 3rd Battalion of Lt. Col. Fitch would head through Oosterbeek to Arnhem ( Tiger route ) , assist in the capture of the road bridge and take up positions in the east of the town . Lt. Col. Dobie 's 1st Battalion would follow Leopard route north of the railway line to occupy high ground north and north west of Arnhem . The whole advance would be led by a troop of Reconnaissance jeeps from the 1st Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron , under Major Frederick Gough on Leopard who would attempt a coup de main on the road bridge . On the second day , Brigadier " Shan " Hackett 's 4th Parachute Brigade would arrive at DZ ' Y ' , accompanied by extra artillery units and remaining elements of the Airlanding Brigade on LZ ' X ' . Hackett 's three battalions would then reinforce the positions north and north west of Arnhem . On the third day , the 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade would be dropped south of the river at DZ ' K ' . Using the road bridge , they would reinforce the perimeter east of Arnhem , linking up with their own artillery who would be flown in by glider to LZ ' L ' . 1st Airlanding Brigade would fall back to cover Oosterbeek on the western side of the perimeter and 1st Parachute Brigade would fall back to cover the southern side of the bridges . Once XXX Corps had arrived and advanced beyond the bridgehead , the 52nd ( Lowland ) Infantry Division would be flown into Deelen airfield to support the ground forces north of the Rhine . The remaining units of the division would follow XXX Corps on land in what was known as the sea tail . The whole operation would be re @-@ supplied by daily flights by No 's . 38 and 46 Group RAF who would make the first drop on LZ ' L ' on day 2 , and subsequent drops on DZ ' V ' . 
 = = = Intelligence = = = 
 Due to poor intelligence , the British were told to expect only limited resistance from German reserve forces . A serious challenge to their operation was not expected and many men believed that their work would lead to the ending of the war . Some — anticipating a period of occupation in Germany — packed leisure equipment in their kit or in the sea tail . The optimistic mood prior to the operation would have tragic consequences however . Frederick Browning 's intelligence officer — Major Brian Urquhart — obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch resistance that German armour was present around Arnhem . This was backed up with aerial reconnaissance that he ordered to be flown . Browning however was dismissive and ordered his chief medical officer to have Urquhart sent on sick leave . In fact , SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them . Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves . 
 = = = German forces = = = 
 The Allied liberation of Antwerp on 4 September had caused a rout of German reserve troops in the Netherlands , nicknamed " Mad Tuesday " . However , the Allied pause at the Dutch border gave the Germans time to regroup and reorganise , although it would make subsequent attempts to clarify the exact German forces opposing the Allies extremely difficult . 
 Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model — commander of Army Group B — had moved his headquarters to Arnhem and was re @-@ establishing defences in the area and co @-@ ordinating the reorganisation of the scattered units so that by the time the Allies launched Market Garden there would be several units opposing them . To the west of Arnhem was Kampfgruppe Von Tettau , a force equivalent to seven battalions made up of all manner of German units ( including Das Heer , Luftwaffe , Kriegsmarine , rear echelon and Waffen @-@ SS troops ) under the command of General Hans von Tettau at Grebbeberg . This included the SS Non @-@ commissioned officer school SS <unk> Arnheim and the 16th SS Training Battalion under the command of SS Sturmbannführer Sepp Krafft whose unit would play a crucial role in the opening phases of the battle . Within Arnhem itself , the town garrison was under the command of Major @-@ General Friedrich Kussin . 
 Additionally , Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich 's II SS Panzer Corps — comprising the remains of Walter Harzer 's 9th SS and Heinz Harmel 's 10th SS Panzer Divisions — had moved into the area north of Arnhem to refit and reorganise . Although badly mauled after escaping the Falaise pocket , the Korps was made up of seasoned veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the allies had been led to expect . The divisions were also specially trained in anti @-@ airborne operations ; during their formation both divisions had undergone month @-@ long anti airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment , and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack in classroom and field exercises . The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade , a reconnaissance battalion , an artillery battalion , two batteries of self @-@ propelled guns and a company of tanks . Exactly how many men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear . Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6 @,@ 000 men , others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 men . 
 There were also Dutch units allied to the Germans present at Arnhem . These formations recruited from Dutch nationals ( mainly criminals , men wishing to avoid national service or men affiliated with the Nationaal @-@ <unk> Beweging ) and were incorporated into the German Army . At Arnhem , the partly Dutch SS <unk> 3 was attached to Kampfgruppe Von Tettau and the 3rd Battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland training at nearby <unk> was quickly attached to Harzer ’ s 9th SS Panzer Division when they arrived at the battle on 20 September . 
 As the battle progressed , more and more forces would become available to the Germans . Adolf Hitler , stunned by the attack , agreed that the defence of the Netherlands should receive absolute priority and over the course of the battle reinforcements would stream in ; from Wehrkreis VI , the Wesel area and General Friedrich Christiansen 's Armed Forces Command Netherlands . Model arranged for units to be sent straight to the units in action in order to avoid long @-@ winded logistics , and rushed in specialist street fighting and machine gun battalions . Each day of the battle , the German military strength increased whilst the British supplies diminished . By 21 September , the fifth day of the battle , German forces outnumbered the British by 3 : 1 and continued to increase . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Day 1 – Sunday 17 September = = = 
 The first lift was preceded by intense bombing and strafing raids made by the British Second Tactical Air Force and the American 8th and 9th Air Forces . These targeted the known flak guns and German garrisons and barracks across the area . Meanwhile , the first lift suffered only light losses as the aircraft and gliders flew from British bases to the target area . The first arrivals were the 21st Independent Parachute Company at 12 : 40 , who marked the landing zones for the gliders and parachutists in advance of the main landings . The landings were largely unopposed and the battalions formed up in good order ready to carry out their tasks by 14 : 45 . While the 1st Airlanding Brigade moved into defensive positions around the landing zones , the 1st Parachute Brigade prepared to head east toward the bridges , with Lathbury and his HQ Company following Frost on Lion route . Although some jeeps of the reconnaissance squadron were lost on the flight over , the company formed up in good strength and moved off along Leopard route . 
 The Germans were unprepared for the landings and initially thrown into confusion . Model — erroneously assuming that the paratroopers had come to capture him — fled his headquarters at the Hartenstein hotel in Oosterbeek and went to Bittrich 's headquarters east of Arnhem at <unk> where he took personal control of the battle . The 10th SS Division was sent south to respond to the American landings at Nijmegen and to defend the " island " ( the polder between the Lower Rhine and Waal rivers ) , while the 9th would defend Arnhem . The 9th SS was at that point making preparations to return to Germany and Harmel was in Berlin trying to secure more men and supplies for his unit . He was instantly ordered to return to Arnhem whilst his division began to prepare its forces for battle . Obersturmbannführer Ludwig Spindler — commander of the 9th SS Armoured Artillery Regiment — quickly organised a small battlegroup ( Kampfgruppe Spindler was initially only 120 men but would incorporate 16 separate units over the course of the battle ) . In the late afternoon , he was ordered to advance west to Oosterbeek and establish a blocking line to prevent the British from reaching Arnhem centre . Meanwhile , the Division 's Reconnaissance Battalion under the command of Hauptsturmführer Viktor Gräbner was ordered south to Nijmegen , crossing the Arnhem bridge at dusk . Initially , however , no units were ordered to secure the bridge itself . Arnhem Garrison commander Major @-@ General Friedrich Kussin was killed by men of the 3rd Parachute Battalion as he sped towards his headquarters , and his death led to a breakdown in command and responsibilities . It was not until late in the afternoon that the Reconnaissance Battalion of 10th SS Division were ordered to secure the bridge . At the time of the landings , only one organised unit was in place to oppose the allied advance toward the bridges ( the 16 SS Training Battalion camped in Wolfheze ) and their commander — Sepp Krafft — acted quickly to establish a blocking screen west of Oosterbeek . 
 The Allied advance quickly ran into trouble . The reconnaissance squadron was ambushed by the northern flank of Krafft 's blocking line and withdrew . The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions were also stalled by Krafft 's defences and spent the rest of the day skirting his line . The 3rd Parachute Battalion went south and halted in Oosterbeek for most of the night while 1st Parachute Battalion went further north but hit Spindler 's forces and was unable to reach the Arnhem @-@ Ede road of Leopard route . Instead Dobie decided to abandon his plan and help Frost at the bridge and the battalion headed south into Oosterbeek overnight . Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion was largely unopposed , bypassing the defences that did not as yet reach down as far as the river . They were slowed by cheering Dutch civilians and did not reach the bridges until late in the day . The railway bridge was blown by German engineers as the Allies approached it and the pontoon bridge was missing its central section . At dusk , the men of A Company under Major Digby Tatham @-@ <unk> observed Gräbner 's force cross the bridge . Most of the battalion and various other supporting units — including two jeeps of Gough 's squadron , four 6 @-@ pounder anti @-@ tank guns , Brigade HQ ( but without Lathbury ) , and Royal Engineers ( in total numbering about 740 men ) — moved into Arnhem centre as night fell and owing to the oversight in German orders were able to secure the undefended northern end of the road bridge . Brigade HQ was being led by Brigade Major Tony Hibbert . 
 Lieutenant Jack Grayburn led an attempt to secure the southern end of the bridge but was unsuccessful , and a later attempt using a flame thrower only succeeded in setting the freshly painted girders of the bridge alight . However , the British were able to make good their position and quickly repulsed the 10th SS Reconnaissance Battalion and other German units when they arrived to secure the bridge . 
 Meanwhile , the Airlanding Brigade moved quickly to secure the landing zones . The 2nd Battalion , South Staffordshire Regiment moved into Wolfheze , the 1st Battalion , Border Regiment secured DZ ' X ' , deploying its companies around the DZ and in Renkum , and the 7th Battalion , King 's Own Scottish Borderers moved to secure DZ ' Y ' . Here , they ambushed the Dutch SS Wach Battalion as it headed toward Arnhem from Ede . Units of the Airlanding Artillery and Divisional HQ headed into Wolfheze and Oosterbeek where medical officers set up a Regimental Aid Post at the home of Kate ter Horst . 
 The Allied advance was severely hampered by poor communications in these crucial initial phases . The paratroopers ' radio sets range was instantly limited by the wooded terrain and as the battalions advanced they lost contact with Divisional HQ at the landing zones . Over the coming nine days , radio communication within the division , with Browning 's HQ at Nijmegen , with XXX Corps and with the United Kingdom would be intermittent and unreliable , severely hampering the British units . Carrier pigeons were even used to make contact with Britain . Partly as a consequence of this limitation , Urquhart decided to follow the 1st Parachute Brigade and make contact with Lathbury . When he found the Brigade HQ on Lion route , he was informed by Major Hibbert , who , at that time , was still en route to the bridge , that Lathbury himself was visiting the 3rd Battalion . Urquhart followed Lathbury there but subsequently would not be able to return to Divisional HQ for two days . 
 = = = Day 2 – Monday 18 September = = = 
 As the second day dawned , the 9th SS Panzer Division continued to reinforce the German blocking line . Krafft 's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler 's line , coming under his command . Spindler 's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front , that he was forced to split it into two battle groups : Kampfgruppes <unk> and Harder . The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and had closed the gap exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening . 
 Overnight , the 1st and 3rd Parachute battalions had skirted as far south as 2nd Parachute Battalion 's original route into the city , hoping to follow them into Arnhem centre . They approached the German line before light and for several hours attempted to fight through the German positions . Spindler 's force — being continually reinforced — was too strong to penetrate , and by 10 : 00 the British advance was stopped . A more coordinated attack followed in the afternoon , but it too was repulsed . Urquhart attempted to return to his Divisional Headquarters at Oosterbeek but became cut off and was forced to take shelter in a Dutch family 's loft with two fellow officers . Lathbury was injured and also forced into hiding . 
 At the road bridge , German forces of the 9th SS had quickly surrounded Frost 's battalion , cutting them off from the rest of the division . At around 09 : 00 , the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river , having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen . Though aware of the British troops at the bridge , it attempted to cross by force . In the resultant two @-@ hour battle , it was beaten back with heavy losses ; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer , Viktor Gräbner , was killed in action during the assault . German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day , but the British continued to hold . 
 At the landing zones , Brigadier Hicks was informed that in Urquhart 's and Lathbury 's absence , he was acting divisional commander . He was also told to send one of his units — the South Staffordshires ( which was not complete and was awaiting its full complement of men in the second lift ) — to Arnhem to help with the advance to the bridge . The South Staffords departed in the morning and linked up with the 1st Parachute Battalion in the late afternoon . 
 German forces began to probe the 1st Airlanding Brigade defences throughout the morning . Units of Kampfgruppe Von Tettau attacked the Border 's positions ; men of the SS NCO school overran Renkum and Kriegsmarine troops engaged the British all day as they withdrew . Small amounts of fighting broke out around LZ ' X ' but not enough to seriously hamper the glider landing there . At DZ ' Y ' , the Dutch SS Wach Battalion became heavily engaged with the King 's Own Scottish Borderers , threatening to hamper the arrival of the second lift . The communications breakdown meant that it was impossible to warn the aircraft . Equally , there was no way for the division to know that the 2nd lift had been delayed by ground fog in England . Thus , the arrival of the 4th Parachute Brigade under Brigadier Hackett and several more troops of artillery at the drop zones was several hours overdue . When the parachutists did arrive after 15 : 00 , they dropped under fire . Several were killed as aircraft and parachutists were shot down and the heath @-@ land they were landing on caught fire . Nevertheless , the arrival of a full brigade overwhelmed the Dutch who were routed and surrendered in droves . 
 Despite the setbacks , the units assembled with only slight casualties but the changing circumstances at Arnhem meant that their roles were quickly changed . The 11th Parachute Battalion and the rest of the South Staffords were immediately despatched to Arnhem to assist in the attempt to break through to the bridge , where they linked up with the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions after dark . Hicks ' decision to send the 11th Parachute Battalion to Arnhem ( thus weakening the 4th Parachute Brigade ) dismayed Hackett , who remonstrated with Hicks to no avail . However , he was given command of the King 's Own Scottish Borderers who were moving toward LZ ' L ' to secure it for Tuesday 's landing . The 10th and 156th Parachute Battalions moved north of the railway line to take up their planned defensive positions north west of Arnhem but the leading elements of 156th Parachute Battalion made contact with the main 9th SS blocking line after dark and withdrew for the night . 
 Shortly after the second lift arrived , the first supply drop was made onto LZ ' L ' . Although most supplies arrived , only a small amount could be collected as the area was not under full British control . The poor radio communication meant that it was not possible to alert the RAF and unsecured drop zones would be a major problem in the days to come . 
 = = = Day 3 – Tuesday 19 September = = = 
 With the arrival of the South Staffords and 11th Parachute battalion at the 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalion 's positions west of Arnhem , the British hoped to have sufficient troops to break through to Frost 's position at the bridge . Lieutenant Colonel Dobie of 1st Parachute Battalion planned to attack before first light but an erroneous report suggesting that the bridge had fallen led to the attack being cancelled . By the time the report was corrected , first light was not long away but with reinforcement at the bridge the priority , the attack had to proceed . The advance began on a narrow front with the 1st Parachute Battalion leading , supported by remnants of the 3rd Parachute Battalion , with the 2nd South Staffordshires on the left flank and the 11th Parachute Battalion following behind . As soon as it became light , the 1st Parachute Battalion was spotted and halted by fire from the main German defensive line . Trapped in open ground and under heavy fire from three sides , the 1st Parachute Battalion disintegrated and what remained of the 3rd Parachute Battalion fell back . The 2nd South Staffordshires were similarly cut off and save for about 150 men , overcome by midday . The 11th Parachute Battalion — which had thus far not been heavily involved — was now overwhelmed in exposed positions while attempting to capture high ground to the north . The South Staffords similarly attempted to secure high ground but were driven off . With no hope of breaking through , the 500 remaining men of these four battalions retreated westwards in the direction of the main force , 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) away in Oosterbeek . As they approached Oosterbeek they were met by Lieutenant Colonel Sheriff Thompson , of the 1st Airlanding Light Artillery Regiment , who formed most of the men into a defensive screen under Major Robert Cain .5 mi ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) forward of his artillery positions . The battle gave Urquhart the opportunity to escape his position and he was able to return to Division HQ at the Hotel Hartenstein in Oosterbeek , where for the first time he was able to learn the extent of the German forces facing them . 
 In Britain , ground fog again frustrated reinforcement . Thirty @-@ five gliders of the 3rd lift carrying the Polish glider borne elements were delayed in taking off and the whole parachute brigade failed to take off at all . This would have serious consequences on the ground when the delayed gliders arrived . 
 North of the railway line , the 156th and 10th Parachute Battalions became engaged with the German defensive line as they attempted to seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek . Both battalions ' advances were blunted against the well @-@ defended German positions and by early afternoon they had not advanced any further than their original positions . Urquhart — realising the need to assume a more defensive stance and prevent the two battalions being cut off north of the railway — ordered them to fall back to Wolfheze and Oosterbeek . Making a fighting withdrawal with the Germans of Kampfgruppe Krafft closely pursuing them , the units fell back across LZ ' L ' , defended by the King 's Own Scottish Borderers who were awaiting the arrival of the Glider borne elements of the Polish Parachute Brigade . Heavy fighting ensued as the gliders arrived in the middle of the retreat and Polish losses were heavy . All four Allied units streamed south and west toward the road crossings over the steep railway cutting at Oosterbeek and Wolfheze and gathered in ad hoc units in the woods on the south side , where most of them spent the night . Some German units followed them across the railway and an SS battalion reached Wolfheze where it was strafed by its own air force . 
 In the afternoon , the RAF flew its first major resupply mission , using 164 aircraft to fly in 390 short tons ( 350 t ) of supplies to the British . The Germans — who had been expecting resupply efforts — had moved five flak batteries into the area specifically to attack these flights and as the RAF came into view they succeeded in shooting down 10 aircraft . Despite the bravery of the pilots ( Flight Lieutenant David Lord received the Victoria Cross posthumously ) , the Airborne forces only recovered 31 short tons ( 28 t ) of supplies . The <unk> — Supply DZ ' V ' — was still in German hands ( the British would never reach this <unk> during the battle ) and no message had reached Britain to explain this . 
 At the bridge , Frost 's forces continued to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker . The Germans — realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders — began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks , artillery and mortars . In the absence of any Allied air cover , the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well . 
 = = = Day 4 – Wednesday 20 September = = = 
 By now , the division was too weak to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge . Of the nine infantry battalions , only one ( 1st Battalion , The Border Regiment ) still existed as a unit , the rest were badly mauled or scattered . Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek , abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion . By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing , Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms . 
 The eastern side of <unk> was fairly stabilised after the retreat of the previous day , with numerous ad hoc units under company commanders defending the approaches to the town . Major Richard Lonsdale had taken command of the outlying units that had retreated from Arnhem the previous day , and their positions weathered heavy German attacks before falling back to the main divisional perimeter at Oosterbeek . This sector was later designated Lonsdale Force and would remain the main line of defence on the south eastern perimeter . The Border Regiment held most of the western edge of the town , with scattered units filling the gaps to the north . As more units fell back to the new defensive area , they were re @-@ organised to establish a thumb shaped perimeter using the Rhine as its southern base . 
 The mixed units at Wolfheze began to fall back in the morning but several were surrounded and captured , including one party of 130 men . 150 men of 156th Parachute battalion — led by Hackett himself — became pinned down and took cover in a hollow some 400 m ( 440 yd ) west of the Oosterbeek perimeter . The men broke out in the late afternoon , with 90 men making it to the Border Regiment 's positions . 
 The afternoon 's supply drop was little better than the previous day 's . Although a message had reached Britain to arrange a new dropping zone near the Hotel Hartenstein , some aircraft flew to LZ ' Z ' where all their supplies fell into German hands . At Oosterbeek , the Germans had used British marker panels and flares to attract the aircraft to their positions and the aircraft were unable to distinguish the exact dropping zones . Ten of the 164 aircraft involved were shot down around Arnhem for only 13 % of supplies reaching British hands . 
 At the bridge , Frost was finally able to make radio contact with his divisional commander and given the difficult news that reinforcement was doubtful . Shortly afterwards at about 13 : 30 , Frost was injured in the legs by a mortar bomb . Command passed to Major Gough but by late afternoon the position was becoming untenable . As fire took hold of many of the buildings in which the wounded were being treated , a two @-@ hour truce was organised in the late afternoon . The wounded ( including Frost ) were taken into captivity . Overnight , a few units managed to hold out for a little longer and several groups tried to break out toward the Oosterbeek perimeter . While Major Hibbert was leading a group toward Oosterbeek , he was captured . 
 By 05 : 00 on Thursday morning all resistance at the bridge had ceased . In the final hours of the struggle , a radio message was sent from the bridge . It was not picked up by the British but was heard by the German forces , who recalled that it ended with the sentences : " Out of ammunition . God Save the King . " 
 = = = Day 5 – Thursday 21 September = = = 
 Throughout the morning , the Germans mopped up British survivors and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge . It took several hours to clear the bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen . Crucially , the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge to be captured by the 82nd Airborne and Guards ' Armoured Division working together . With the resistance at the bridge crushed , the Germans had more troops available to commit to the Oosterbeek engagement , although this changed suddenly in the afternoon . 
 Two days late , the parachute infantry battalions of Stanisław Sosabowski 's 1st ( Polish ) Parachute Brigade were able to take off in England . 114 C @-@ 47s took off but 41 aircraft turned back after Troop Carrier Command decided it would be too dangerous to land if the aircraft were up too long . The remainder pressed on ; they did not have the correct transmission codes and did not understand the messages . One of the few messages to get out of Arnhem warned the Poles that DZ ' K ' was not secure and to land instead on the polder east of Driel where they should secure the <unk> ferry on the south bank of the Rhine . The Poles dropped under fire at 17 : 00 and sustained casualties but assembled in good order . Advancing to the river bank , they discovered that the ferry was gone ; the ferryman had sunk it to deny its use to the Germans . 
 The arrival of the Poles relieved the pressure on the British as the Germans were forced to send more forces south of the Rhine . Fearing an attack on the southern end of the road bridge or the Nijmegen road , a battalion of the 34th SS Volunteer Grenadier Division Landstorm Nederland , Machine Gun Battalion 47 and other Kampfgruppes headed across the river overnight . 
 At Oosterbeek , the defensive positions were consolidated and organised into two zones . Hicks would command the western and northern sides of the perimeter and Hackett , after some rest , the eastern front . The perimeter was not a complete defensive line but a collection of defensive pockets in houses and foxholes surrounding the centre of Oosterbeek , with the divisional Headquarters at the Hotel Hartenstein at its centre . The perimeter was roughly 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) around and was defended by approximately 3 @,@ 600 men . Despite the Germans ' best efforts , the line would remain roughly unchanged for the next five days , although Germans of the Hermann Göring NCO School attacked the Border positions on the west side near the Rhine , forcing them to abandon strategically important high ground overlooking Oosterbeek . The biggest boost to the besieged British was being able to make contact with forward artillery units of XXX Corps . Radio contact was made with 64th Medium Regiment , Royal Artillery who were able to drop heavy and accurate shellfire on German positions around the perimeter . The radio link to the battery 's Headquarters was also used as the main line of communication to XXX Corps . So important was the shellfire provided by 64 Medium Regiment that afterward Urquhart lobbied for the Regiment to be able to wear the airborne Pegasus badge on their uniforms . Members of 201 ( Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire ) Yeomanry Battery Royal Artillery ( Volunteers ) , the modern @-@ day descendants of 52 Heavy Regiment Royal Artillery which supported 64 Medium Regiment at Arnhem , still wear this flash on their Jersey sleeves to this day . 
 The British had witnessed the Polish drop but were unable to make contact by radio so a swimmer was sent south of the Rhine . The British planned to supply rafts for a river crossing that night as the Poles were desperately needed on the northern bank . The Poles waited on the southern bank , but by 03 : 00 no rafts were evident and they withdrew to Driel to take up defensive positions . 
 = = = Day 6 – Friday 22 September = = = 
 Overnight , the Germans south of the river formed a blocking line along the railway , linking up with 10th SS to the south and screening the road bridge from the Poles . The Polish were well dug in at Driel , however , and German armour was unable to manoeuvre off of the main roads to attack them . Hopes were raised when three armoured cars of XXX Corps ' Household Cavalry managed to skirt the German defences on the island and link up with Sosabowski 's force . These were followed after dark by tanks of the 4th / 7th Royal Dragoon Guards and infantry of the 5th Battalion Duke of Cornwall 's Light Infantry . Behind them , the rest of the 43rd Wessex Division was making its way up a narrow corridor . 
 In Oosterbeek , heavy fighting continued around the perimeter . Intense shelling and snipers increased the number of casualties at the aid posts in the hotels and houses of the town . Bittrich ordered that the attacks be stepped up and the British bridgehead north of the Rhine destroyed , and at 09 : 00 the major attacks began with the various Kampfgruppes of 9th SS attacking from the east and Kampfgruppe von Tettau 's units from the west . There were only small gains but these attacks were followed by simultaneous attacks in the afternoon when the Germans made determined moves on the northern and eastern ends . To the north , they succeeded in briefly forcing back the King 's Own Scottish Borderers before the latter counterattacked and retook their positions . Urquhart realised the futility of holding the tactically unimportant tip however and ordered the units in the north to fall back and defend a shorter line . To the east , the remains of 10th Parachute Battalion were nearly annihilated in their small position on the main Arnhem road , but the Germans failed to gain any significant ground . 
 Two of Urquhart 's staff officers swam the Rhine during the day and made contact with Sosabowski 's HQ . It was arranged that six rubber boats should be supplied on the northern bank to enable the Poles to cross the river and come into the Oosterbeek perimeter . That night , the plan was put into operation , but the cable designed to run the boats across broke and the small oars weren 't enough to paddle across the fast flowing river . Only 55 Poles made it over before light and only 35 of these made it into the perimeter 
 = = = Day 7 – Saturday 23 September = = = 
 Spindler was ordered to switch his attacks further south to try to force the British away from the river , isolating the British from any hope of reinforcement and allowing them to be destroyed . Despite their best efforts , however , they were unsuccessful , although the constant artillery and assaults continued to wear the British defences down further . 
 A break in the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat missions against the German forces surrounding Urquhart 's men . Hawker Typhoons and Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield . The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon , but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops . Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe over the next two days but to little effect . 
 South of the river , the Poles prepared for another crossing . That night , they awaited the arrival of assault boats from XXX Corps , but these did not arrive until after midnight , and many were without oars . The crossings started at 03 : 00 , with fire support from the 43rd Wessex Division . Through the remaining hours of darkness , only 153 men were able to cross – less than ¼ of the hoped for reinforcement . 
 = = = Day 8 – Sunday 24 September = = = 
 In the morning , Horrocks visited the Polish positions at Driel to see the front for himself . Later , he hosted a conference attended by Browning , Major @-@ General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd ( Wessex ) Division and Sosabowski at <unk> . In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred , it was decided that another crossing would be attempted that night . When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though , it seems Horrocks realised the futility of the situation and plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Division . 
 In Oosterbeek , the situation was becoming more desperate . Hackett was wounded in the morning and had to give up the eastern command . The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held , but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour . The aid stations were home to some 2 @,@ 000 men , both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties . Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle , the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards . Without evacuation , the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over . 
 Throughout the fighting around Oosterbeek , there had been short localised truces around the aid posts to allow the wounded to reach them , but by Sunday the situation needed a more serious arrangement . Colonel Graeme Warrack — the senior medical officer — asked permission to arrange a truce ; it was a request that Urquhart agreed to . Warrack was taken to see Bittrich who similarly agreed and offered Warrack as many supplies as he could carry . Between 15 : 00 and 17 : 00 , a general ceasefire went into effect around the perimeter and about 450 stretcher cases and walking wounded were evacuated from the perimeter , the Germans using jeeps and ambulances to take serious cases straight to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Arnhem where British , German and Dutch medical staff worked side by side . 
 That night , the Allies on the south side of the river attempted another crossing . The plan called for 4th Battalion The Dorset Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Battalion to cross at 22 : 00 using boats and DUKWs . Sosabowski was furious at having to give up control of one of his battalions and thought the plan dangerous , but was silenced . The boats failed to arrive until 1 am and several had been destroyed or lost en route , so a last minute change of plan mean that only the Dorsets would cross . The small boats without skilled crews , the strong current and poor choice of landing site on the north bank meant that of the 315 men who embarked , only a handful reached the British lines on the other side . The DUKWs and most boats landed too far downstream and at least 200 men were captured . 
 = = = Day 9 – Monday 25 September = = = 
 Overnight , a copy of the withdrawal plan was sent across the river for Urquhart 's consideration . Despite the obviously frustrating content , Urquhart knew there was little other choice and radioed Thomas at 08 : 00 to agree to the plan on the condition it went ahead that night . Meanwhile , the Airborne forces would need to endure another day in their perimeter . More men were evacuated from the aid posts throughout the day , but there was no official truce and this was sometimes done under fire . 
 At 10 : 00 , the Germans began their most successful assault on the perimeter , attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks . This assault pushed through the defenders ' outer lines and threatened to isolate the bulk of the division from the river . Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders and concentrated shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled the Germans . 
 Urquhart formulated his withdrawal plan on the successful method used in the evacuation of Gallipoli during the First World War . The northernmost units would fall back first , moving through the more southerly groups who would then follow behind . The Glider Pilots would organise the routes to the river and the whole operation would be covered by an intense artillery barrage from XXX Corps . South of the river the evacuation was organised and staffed by men of the Royal Engineers of 43rd Division and Royal Canadian Engineers , using rafts and storm boats . In order to prevent the Germans from learning about the operation , the plan was not announced until the afternoon and some men ( mainly wounded ) would remain to lay covering fire through the night . Men were ordered to muffle their boots and weapons to help them bypass known German incursions into the perimeter . Some men took the opportunity to shave before withdrawing , providing quite a morale boost . 
 By 21 : 00 , heavy rain was falling which helped disguise the withdrawal . The heavy bombardment commenced and the units began to fall back to the river . Half of the engineers ' boats were too far west to be used ( 43rd Division mistakenly believing the crossing points used by the Dorsets the previous night were in British hands ) , slowing the evacuation process . The Germans shelled the withdrawal , believing it to be a resupply attempt . At 05 : 00 , the operation was ceased lest the coming light enable the Germans to fire onto the boats more accurately . 
 2 @,@ 163 Airborne men , 160 Poles , 75 Dorsets and several dozen mixed other men were evacuated but about 300 were left on the northern bank when the operation was ceased and 95 men were killed overnight . 
 Throughout the morning of 26 September , the Germans pressed home their attacks and finally linked up from both sides at the river . It was not until about noon that they realised the British had actually withdrawn . Later in the day , they rounded up about 600 men , mostly the men in the aid stations and those left on the north bank , as well as some pockets of resistance that had been out of radio contact with division Headquarters and did not know about the withdrawal . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Arnhem was a victory for the Germans ( albeit tempered by their losses further south ) and a major defeat for the British army . The Allies withdrew from the southern bank of the Rhine and the front stabilised on " the island " between the Rhine and Waal rivers . Although the Germans counterattacked in October they were repulsed and subsequently the front line in the Netherlands would not move until after the winter . However , the bridgeheads across the Maas and Waal served as an important base for subsequent operations against the Germans on the Rhine and the strike into Germany . 
 Many military commentators and historians believe that the failure to secure Arnhem was not the fault of the airborne forces ( who had held out for far longer than planned ) , but of the operation as a whole . John Frost noted that " by far the worst mistake was the lack of priority given to the capture of Nijmegen Bridge " and was unable to understand why Browning had ordered U.S. Army Brigadier General James M. Gavin of the 82nd Airborne Division to secure the Groesbeek Heights before Nijmegen Bridge . In his analysis of the battle , Martin Middlebrook believed the " failure of Browning to give the 82nd US Airborne Division a greater priority in capturing the bridge at Nijmegen " was only just behind the weakness of the air plan in importance . 
 Likewise , in his assessment of the German perspective at Arnhem , Robert Kershaw concluded that " the battle on the Waal at Nijmegen proved to be the decisive event " and that Arnhem became a simple matter of containment after the British had retreated into the Oosterbeek perimeter . After that , it was merely " a side @-@ show to the crisis being enacted on the Waal " . Heinz Harmel asserted that " The Allies were stopped in the south just north of Nijmegen – that is why Arnhem turned out as it did . " Gavin himself commented that " there was no failure at Arnhem . If , historically , there remains an implication of failure it was the failure of the ground forces to arrive in time to exploit the initial gains of the [ 1st ] Airborne Division " . 
 The air plan was a major weakness in the events at Arnhem itself . Middlebrook believes that the refusal to consider night drops , two lifts on day 1 , or a coup @-@ de @-@ main assault on Arnhem bridge were " cardinal fundamental errors " ; and that the failure to land nearer the bridge threw away the airborne force 's most valuable asset – that of surprise . Similarly , Frost believed that the distance from the Drop zones to the bridge and the long approach on foot was a " glaring snag " and was highly critical of the " unwillingness of the air forces to fly more than one sortie in the day [ which ] was one of the chief factors that mitigated against success . " 
 The Allies ' failure to secure a bridge over the Lower Rhine spelled the end of Market Garden . While all other objectives had been achieved , the failure to secure the Arnhem road bridge over the Rhine meant that the operation failed in its ultimate objective . Field Marshal Montgomery claimed that the operation was 90 % successful and the Allies did possess a deep salient into German occupied territory that was quickly reinforced . Milton Shulman observed that the operation had driven a wedge into the German positions , isolating the 15th Army north of Antwerp from the First Parachute Army on the eastern side of the bulge . This complicated the supply problem of the 15th Army and removed the chance of the Germans being able to assemble enough troops for a serious counterattack to retake Antwerp . Chester Wilmot agreed with this , claiming that the salient was of immense tactical value for the purpose of driving the Germans from the area south of the Maas and removing the threat of an immediate counterattack against Antwerp . Kershaw views the situation differently , observing that the north flank of the west wall was not turned and the 15th Army was able to escape . Dr. John Warren of the American Historical Division of the United States Air Force believed that the Allies now controlled a salient leading nowhere . John Waddy is of the belief that the strategic and tactical debate of Market Garden will never be resolved . 
 Although a disaster for the British 1st Airborne Division , their fight north of the Rhine is considered an example of courage and endurance and one of the greatest feats of arms in the Second World War . 
 = = = Allied units = = = 
 The battle exacted a heavy toll on the 1st Airborne Division from which it would never recover . Three quarters of the formation were missing when it returned to England , including two of the three brigade commanders , eight of the nine battalion commanders and 26 of the 30 infantry company commanders . Some 500 men were still in hiding north of the Rhine , and over the coming months many of these were able to escape : initially in Operation Pegasus . New recruits , escapees and repatriated POWs joined the division over the coming months , but the division was still so much weakened that the 4th Parachute Brigade had to be merged into the 1st Parachute Brigade , and the division as a whole could barely produce two brigades of infantry . Between May and August 1945 , many of the men were sent to Denmark and Norway to oversee the German surrenders there but on their return the division was disbanded . 
 The Glider Pilot Regiment suffered the highest proportion of fatal casualties during the battle ( 17 @.@ 3 % killed ) . The regiment was so badly depleted that during Operation Varsity RAF pilots were used to fly many of the gliders . As glider operations were phased out after the war , the regiment shrank and was eventually disbanded in 1957 . 
 The Polish brigade was withdrawn to Nijmegen and helped defend the airborne corridor before returning to England in early October . Shortly afterward , the British began making Sosabowski and the Polish Brigade a scapegoat for the failure at Arnhem , perhaps to cover their own failings . On 17 October , Montgomery informed Alan Brooke — Chief of the Imperial General Staff — that he felt the Polish forces had " fought very badly " at Arnhem and that he did not want them under his command . Author David Bennett observes that Montgomery had almost certainly been fed gross misinformation that supported his own prejudices . A month later , Browning wrote a long and highly critical letter of Sosabowski to Brooke 's deputy . In it , he accused Sosabowski of being difficult , <unk> , argumentative and " loth to play his full part in the operation unless everything was done for him and his brigade " . It is possible that Browning himself wanted to make Sosabowski a scapegoat , although it may equally have been the work of officers of the 43rd Division . Browning recommended that Sosabowski be replaced - suggesting Lieutenant Colonel <unk> or Major <unk> - and in December the Polish government in exile duly dismissed him in a move almost certainly made under British pressure . Although it may be fair to say that Sosabowski was difficult to work with , his scapegoating is judged as disgraceful by many historical commentators . Brian Urquhart — who had done so much to warn his superiors about the dangers of Arnhem — described the criticism of Sosabowski and the brigade as " grotesque " and that his dismissal was a " shameful act " .

 German casualty figures are less complete than those of the Allies , and official figures have never been released . A signal possibly sent by II SS Panzer Corps on 27 September listed 3 @,@ 300 casualties ( 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 000 injured ) around Arnhem and Oosterbeek . Robert Kershaw 's assessment of the incomplete records identified at least 2 @,@ 500 casualties . In the Roll of Honour : Battle of Arnhem 17 – 26 September 1944 , J.A. Hey of the Society of Friends of the Airborne Museum , Oosterbeek identified 1 @,@ 725 German dead from the Arnhem area relating to the time of the battle . All of these figures are significantly higher than Model 's conservative estimate of 3 @,@ 300 casualties for the entire Market Garden area of battle ( which included Eindhoven and Nijmegen ) . 
 = = = Arnhem = = = 
 Dutch records suggest that at least 453 civilians died during the battle , either as a result of Allied bombing on the first day or during the subsequent fighting . After the battle , the residents of Arnhem and its surrounding towns and villages were forcibly evicted from their homes , allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line . Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war . The Dutch homes were then systematically looted , with the spoils being sent to bombing victims in Germany . The Germans continued to fight Allied forces on the plains between Arnhem and Nijmegen , and the bridge that the 1st Airborne had fought so hard for was eventually destroyed by the Allies to deny German forces its use . On 7 October , it was bombed and destroyed by Martin B @-@ 26 Marauders of 344th Bomb Group , USAAF . The buildings of Arnhem were heavily shelled by the Allies over the next few months and suffered further when the city was eventually liberated in April 1945 .

 Despite being the last great failure of the British Army , Arnhem has become a byword for the fighting spirit of the British people and has set a standard for the Parachute Regiment . Montgomery claimed that " in years to come it will be a great thing for a man to be able to say : ' I fought at Arnhem ' " , a prediction seemingly borne out by the pride of soldiers who took part , and the occasional desire of those who did not to claim that they were there . 
 Within days of Operation Berlin , the British returned to a heroes ' welcome in England . A list of 59 decorations was quickly published for the 2 @,@ 000 men who had returned and an investiture ceremony for the division was held at Buckingham Palace in December . Decorations for the 6000 who had not returned were not published until September 1945 and numbered only 25 . 
 Five of the British participants in the battle were awarded Britain 's highest award for gallantry , the Victoria Cross . Four were members of the Airborne forces and one was from the RAF . They were : 
 Lance @-@ Sergeant John Daniel Baskeyfield , 2nd Battalion , South Staffordshire Regiment 
 Major Robert Henry Cain , 2nd Battalion , South Staffordshire Regiment 
 Flight Lieutenant David Samuel Anthony Lord 271 Squadron , Royal Air Force 
 Captain Lionel Ernest Queripel , 10th Battalion , Parachute Regiment 
 Lieutenant John <unk> Grayburn , 2nd Battalion , Parachute Regiment 
 The British and Commonwealth system of battle honours recognised participation in fighting at Arnhem in 1956 , 1957 and 1958 by the award of the battle honour Arnhem 1944 to six units . 
 After the liberation of the Netherlands , the Grave Registration units of 2nd Army began the task of identifying the British dead . They were buried together in a field that is on permanent loan to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission just north of Oosterbeek . There are nearly 1 @,@ 800 graves in what is now known as the Airborne Cemetery , ¾ of which are for those killed during the 1944 battle . By 2003 , there were still 138 men unaccounted for and human remains , equipment and weaponry continue to be dug up in the farmland around the city . 
 In Germany , the battle was treated as a great victory and afterward no fewer than eight men were awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . The German dead were gathered together and buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem , but after the war they were reburied in Ysselsteyn . 
 The shattered Arnhem road bridge was briefly replaced by a succession of Bailey bridges before being rebuilt in the same style as the original . It was renamed John <unk> ( literally John Frost Bridge ) on 17 December 1977 . 
 On 31 May 2006 , HM Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands conferred two honours on the Polish forces who fought at the battle . The Polish 1st Independent Airborne Brigade was awarded the Dutch Military William Order for gallantry and Stanisław Sosabowski was posthumously awarded the Bronze Lion . In February of that year , an appeal was launched to raise funds so that a memorial to General Sosabowski and the brigade could be erected . The memorial was unveiled in September 2006 in a ceremony that sought to undo the injustice of 1944 . 
 The Hotel Hartenstein , used by Urquhart as his Headquarters , is now the home of the Airborne Museum . Several other memorials were built in Arnhem and Oosterbeek , and an annual parade is held in the area . A memorial near the museum reads : " To the People of Gelderland ; 50 years ago British and Polish Airborne soldiers fought here against overwhelming odds to open the way into Germany and bring the war to an early end . Instead we brought death and destruction for which you have never blamed us . This stone marks our admiration for your great courage remembering especially the women who tended our wounded . In the long winter that followed your families risked death by hiding Allied soldiers and Airmen while members of the resistance led many to safety . "

 The progress of the battle was widely reported in the British press , thanks largely to the efforts of two BBC reporters ( Stanley <unk> and Guy Byam ) and three journalists ( newspaper reporters Alan Wood of the Daily Express and Jack Smyth of Reuters ) who accompanied the British forces . The journalists had their reports sent back almost daily – ironically making communication with London at a time when Divisional Signals had not . The division was also accompanied by a three @-@ man team from the Army Film and Photographic Unit who recorded much of the battle – including many of the images on this page . 
 In 1945 , Louis Hagen , a Jewish refugee from Germany and a British army glider pilot present at the battle , wrote Arnhem Lift , believed to be the first book published about the events at Arnhem . In the same year filming began for the war movie Theirs is the Glory , which featured some original footage and used 120 Arnhem veterans as extras in many of the other scenes . Theirs is the Glory was released in 1946 and was followed in 1974 by the publication of Cornelius Ryan 's book A Bridge Too Far , which did much to bring the battle to a worldwide audience and then by Richard Attenborough 's film of the same name in 1977 , which used Frost and General Urquhart as military consultants . 
 English author Richard Adams , himself a former officer in the <unk> of 250th ( Airborne ) Light Company , Royal Army Service Corps , stated that the struggle of the anthropomorphised rabbits depicted in his award @-@ winning 1972 novel Watership Down ( adapted into an animated film in 1978 ) was inspired by the adventures of the officers of the 250 Company of the 1st Airborne Division . 
 = Vega = 
 Vega ( α <unk> , α Lyrae , Alpha Lyrae ) is the brightest star in the constellation Lyra , the fifth brightest star in the night sky and the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere , after Arcturus . It is a relatively close star at only 25 light @-@ years from Earth , and , together with Arcturus and Sirius , one of the most luminous stars in the Sun 's neighborhood . 
 Vega has been extensively studied by astronomers , leading it to be termed “ arguably the next most important star in the sky after the Sun . ” Vega was the northern pole star around 12 @,@ 000 BC and will be so again around the year 13 @,@ 727 when the declination will be + 86 ° 14 ' . Vega was the first star other than the Sun to be photographed and the first to have its spectrum recorded . It was one of the first stars whose distance was estimated through parallax measurements . Vega has served as the baseline for calibrating the photometric brightness scale , and was one of the stars used to define the mean values for the <unk> photometric system . 
 Vega is only about a tenth of the age of the Sun , but since it is 2 @.@ 1 times as massive its expected lifetime is also one tenth of that of the Sun ; both stars are at present approaching the midpoint of their life expectancies . Vega has an unusually low abundance of the elements with a higher atomic number than that of helium . Vega is also a suspected variable star that may vary slightly in magnitude in a periodic manner . It is rotating rapidly with a velocity of 274 km / s at the equator . This is causing the equator to bulge outward because of centrifugal effects , and , as a result , there is a variation of temperature across the star 's photosphere that reaches a maximum at the poles . From Earth , Vega is being observed from the direction of one of these poles . 
 Based on an observed excess emission of infrared radiation , Vega appears to have a circumstellar disk of dust . This dust is likely to be the result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk , which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System . Stars that display an infrared excess because of dust emission are termed Vega @-@ like stars . 
 = = Observation history = = 
 <unk> , the photography of celestial objects , began in 1840 when John William Draper took an image of the Moon using the daguerreotype process . On July 17 , 1850 , Vega became the first star ( other than the Sun ) to be photographed , when it was imaged by William Bond and John Adams Whipple at the Harvard College Observatory , also with a daguerreotype . Henry Draper took the first photograph of a star 's spectrum in August 1872 when he took an image of Vega , and he also became the first person to show absorption lines in the spectrum of a star . Similar lines had already been identified in the spectrum of the Sun . In 1879 , William Huggins used photographs of the spectra of Vega and similar stars to identify a set of twelve " very strong lines " that were common to this stellar category . These were later identified as lines from the Hydrogen Balmer series . Since 1943 , the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified . 
 The distance to Vega can be determined by measuring its parallax shift against the background stars as the Earth orbits the Sun . The first person to publish a star 's parallax was Friedrich G. W. von Struve , when he announced a value of 0 @.@ 125 arcseconds ( 0 @.@ 125 ″ ) for Vega . But Friedrich Bessel was skeptical about Struve 's data , and , when Bessel published a parallax of 0 @.@ 314 ″ for the star system 61 Cygni , Struve revised his value for Vega 's parallax to nearly double the original estimate . This change cast further doubt on Struve 's data . Thus most astronomers at the time , including Struve , credited Bessel with the first published parallax result . However , Struve 's initial result was actually surprisingly close to the currently accepted value of 0 @.@ 129 ″ , as determined by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite . 
 The brightness of a star , as seen from Earth , is measured with a standardized , logarithmic scale . This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star . The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude , while the brightest , Sirius , is of magnitude − 1 @.@ 46 . To standardize the magnitude scale , astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths . Thus , for many years , Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales . However , this is no longer the case , as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux . This approach is more convenient for astronomers , since Vega is not always available for calibration . 
 The <unk> photometric system measures the magnitude of stars through ultraviolet , blue , and yellow filters , producing U , B , and V values , respectively . Vega is one of six A0V stars that were used to set the initial mean values for this photometric system when it was introduced in the 1950s . The mean magnitudes for these six stars were defined as : U − B 
 = B − V = 
 0 . In effect , the magnitude scale has been calibrated so that the magnitude of these stars is the same in the yellow , blue , and ultraviolet parts of the electromagnetic spectrum . Thus , Vega has a relatively flat electromagnetic spectrum in the visual region — wavelength range 350 – 850 nanometers , most of which can be seen with the human eye — so the flux densities are roughly equal ; 2000 – 4000 Jy . However , the flux density of Vega drops rapidly in the infrared , and is near 100 Jy at 5 micrometers . 
 Photometric measurements of Vega during the 1930s appeared to show that the star had a low @-@ magnitude variability on the order of ± 0 @.@ 03 magnitudes . This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time , and so the subject of Vega 's variability has been controversial . The magnitude of Vega was measured again in 1981 at the David Dunlap Observatory and showed some slight variability . Thus it was suggested that Vega showed occasional low @-@ amplitude pulsations associated with a Delta Scuti variable . This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner , resulting in periodic pulsations in the star 's luminosity . Although Vega fits the physical profile for this type of variable , other observers have found no such variation . Thus the variability was thought to possibly be the result of systematic errors in measurement . However , a 2007 article surveyed these and other results , and concluded that " A conservative analysis of the foregoing results suggests that Vega is quite likely variable in the 1 @-@ 2 % range , with possible occasional excursions to as much as 4 % from the mean " . Also , a 2011 article affirms on its abstract that " The long @-@ term ( year @-@ to @-@ year ) variability of Vega was confirmed " . 
 Vega became the first solitary main @-@ sequence star beyond the Sun known to be an X @-@ ray emitter when in 1979 it was observed from an imaging X @-@ ray telescope launched on an Aerobee 350 from the White Sands Missile Range . In 1983 , Vega became the first star found to have a disk of dust . The Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) discovered an excess of infrared radiation coming from the star , and this was attributed to energy emitted by the orbiting dust as it was heated by the star .

 Vega can often be seen near the zenith in the mid @-@ northern latitudes during the evening in the Northern Hemisphere summer . From mid @-@ southern latitudes , it can be seen low above the northern horizon during the Southern Hemisphere winter . With a declination of + 38 @.@ 78 ° , Vega can only be viewed at latitudes north of 51 ° S. Therefore , it does not rise at all anywhere in Antarctica or in the southernmost part of South America , including Punta Arenas , Chile ( 53 ° S ) . At latitudes to the north of + 51 ° N , Vega remains continually above the horizon as a circumpolar star . Around July 1 , Vega reaches midnight culmination when it crosses the meridian at that time . 
 This star lies at a vertex of a widely spaced asterism called the Summer Triangle , which consists of the zero @-@ magnitude stars Vega in the constellation Lyra and Altair in Aquila , plus the first magnitude star Deneb in Cygnus . This formation is the approximate shape of a right triangle , with Vega located at its right angle . The Summer Triangle is recognizable in the northern skies for there are few other bright stars in its vicinity . Vega can be identified easily because Altair and its two neighboring stars form a line which points at Vega . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Vega 's spectral class is A0V , making it a blue @-@ tinged white main sequence star that is fusing hydrogen to helium in its core . Since more massive stars use their fusion fuel more quickly than smaller ones , Vega 's main @-@ sequence lifetime is roughly one billion years , a tenth of our Sun 's . The current age of this star is about 455 million years , or up to about half its expected total main @-@ sequence lifespan . After leaving the main sequence , Vega will become a class @-@ M red giant and shed much of its mass , finally becoming a white dwarf . At present , Vega has more than twice the mass of the Sun and its full luminosity is about 40 times the Sun 's value . However , because of its high rate of rotation , the pole is considerably brighter than the equator . Since we see it nearly pole @-@ on , its apparent luminosity from Earth is notably higher , about 57 times the Sun 's value . If Vega is variable , then it may be a Delta Scuti type with a period of about 0 @.@ 107 days . 
 Most of the energy produced at Vega 's core is generated by the carbon – nitrogen – oxygen cycle ( CNO cycle ) , a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon , nitrogen , and oxygen . This process requires a temperature of about 15 million K , which is higher than the core temperature of the Sun , but is less efficient than the Sun 's proton @-@ proton chain reaction fusion reaction . The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive , which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the ' ash ' from the fusion reaction within the core region . The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium . This is in contrast to the Sun , which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone . 
 The energy flux from Vega has been precisely measured against standard light sources . At <unk> Å , the flux is 3 @,@ 650 Jy with an error margin of 2 % . The visual spectrum of Vega is dominated by absorption lines of hydrogen ; specifically by the hydrogen Balmer series with the electron at the n = 2 principal quantum number . The lines of other elements are relatively weak , with the strongest being ionized magnesium , iron , and chromium . The X @-@ ray emission from Vega is very low , demonstrating that the corona for this star must be very weak or non @-@ existent . However , as the pole of Vega is facing us and a polar coronal hole may be present , confirmation of a corona as the likely source of the X @-@ rays detected from Vega ( or the region very close to Vega ) may be difficult as most of any coronal X @-@ rays would not be emitted along the line of sight . 
 Using <unk> , a magnetic field has been detected on the surface of Vega by a team of astronomers at the Observatoire du Pic du Midi . This is the first such detection of a magnetic field on a spectral class A star that is not an Ap chemically peculiar star . The average line of sight component of this field has a strength of − 0 @.@ 6 ± 0 @.@ 3 G. This is comparable to the mean magnetic field on the Sun . Magnetic fields of roughly 30 gauss have been reported for Vega , compared to about 1 gauss for the Sun . In 2015 , star spots were detected on the star 's surface — the first such detection for a normal A @-@ type star , and these features show evidence of rotational modulation with a period of 0 @.@ 68 days . 
 = = = Rotation = = = 
 When the radius of Vega was measured to high accuracy with an interferometer , it resulted in an unexpectedly large estimated value of 2 @.@ 73 ± 0 @.@ 01 times the radius of the Sun . This is 60 % larger than the radius of the star Sirius , while stellar models indicated it should only be about 12 % larger . However , this discrepancy can be explained if Vega is a rapidly rotating star that is being viewed from the direction of its pole of rotation . Observations by the CHARA array in 2005 – 06 confirmed this deduction . 
 The pole of Vega — its axis of rotation — is inclined no more than five degrees from the line @-@ of @-@ sight to the Earth . At the high end of estimates for the rotation velocity for Vega is 236 @.@ 2 ± 3 @.@ 7 km / s along the equator , which is 87 @.@ 6 % of the speed that would cause the star to start breaking up from centrifugal effects . This rapid rotation of Vega produces a pronounced equatorial bulge , so the radius of the equator is 19 % larger than the polar radius . ( The estimated polar radius of this star is 2 @.@ 362 ± 0 @.@ 012 solar radii , while the equatorial radius is 2 @.@ 818 ± 0 @.@ 013 solar radii . ) From the Earth , this bulge is being viewed from the direction of its pole , producing the overly large radius estimate . 
 The local gravitational acceleration at the poles is greater than at the equator , so , by the Von Zeipel theorem , the local luminosity is also higher at the poles . This is seen as a variation in effective temperature over the star : the polar temperature is near 10 @,@ 000 K , while the equatorial temperature is 7 @,@ 600 K. As a result , if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator , then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole . This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong ' gravity darkening ' effect . As viewed from the poles , this results in a darker ( lower intensity ) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star . The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator , while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium . 
 As Vega had long been used as a standard star for calibrating telescopes , the discovery that it is rapidly rotating may challenge some of the underlying assumptions that were based on it being spherically symmetric . With the viewing angle and rotation rate of Vega now better known , this will allow for improved instrument calibrations . 
 = = = Element abundance = = = 
 Astronomers term " metals " those elements with higher atomic numbers than helium . The metallicity of Vega 's photosphere is only about 32 % of the abundance of heavy elements in the Sun 's atmosphere . ( Compare this , for example , to a three @-@ fold metallicity abundance in the similar star Sirius as compared to the Sun . ) For comparison , the Sun has an abundance of elements heavier than helium of about <unk> = 0 @.@ <unk> ± 0 @.@ 002 . Thus , in terms of abundances , only about 0 @.@ 54 % of Vega consists of elements heavier than helium . 
 The unusually low metallicity of Vega makes it a weak Lambda Boötis @-@ type star . However , the reason for the existence of such chemically peculiar , spectral class A0 @-@ F0 stars remains unclear . One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity may be the result of diffusion or mass loss , although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star 's hydrogen @-@ burning lifespan . Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of gas and dust that was unusually metal @-@ poor . 
 The observed helium to hydrogen ratio in Vega is 0 @.@ 030 ± 0 @.@ 005 , which is about 40 % lower than the Sun . This may be caused by the disappearance of a helium convection zone near the surface . Energy transfer is instead performed by the radiative process , which may be causing an abundance anomaly through diffusion . 
 = = = Kinematics = = = 
 The radial velocity of Vega is the component of this star 's motion along the line @-@ of @-@ sight to the Earth . Movement away from the Earth will cause the light from Vega to shift to a lower frequency ( toward the red ) , or to a higher frequency ( toward the blue ) if the motion is toward the Earth . Thus the velocity can be measured from the amount of redshift ( or blueshift ) of the star 's spectrum . Precise measurements of this redshift give a value of − 13 @.@ 9 ± 0 @.@ 9 km / s . The minus sign indicates a relative motion toward the Earth . 
 Motion transverse to the line of sight causes the position of Vega to shift with respect to the more distant background stars . Careful measurement of the star 's position allows this angular movement , known as proper motion , to be calculated . Vega 's proper motion is 202 @.@ 03 ± 0 @.@ 63 milli @-@ arcseconds ( mas ) per year in right ascension — the celestial equivalent of longitude — and 287 @.@ 47 ± 0 @.@ 54 mas / y in declination , which is equivalent to a change in latitude . The net proper motion of Vega is 327 @.@ 78 mas / y , which results in angular movement of a degree every 11 @,@ 000 years . 
 In the Galactic coordinate system , the space velocity components of Vega are ( U , V , W ) = ( − 16 @.@ 1 ± 0 @.@ 3 , − 6 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 8 , − 7 @.@ 7 ± 0 @.@ 3 ) km / s , for a net space velocity of 19 km / s . The radial component of this velocity — in the direction of the Sun — is − 13 @.@ 9 km / s , while the transverse velocity is 9 @.@ 9 km / s . Although Vega is at present only the fifth @-@ brightest star in the sky , the star is slowly brightening as proper motion causes it to approach the Sun . Vega will make its closest approach in an estimated 264 @,@ 000 years at a perihelion distance of 13 @.@ 2 ly ( 4 @.@ 04 pc ) . 
 Based on this star 's kinematic properties , it appears to belong to a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group . However , Vega may be much older than this group , so the membership remains uncertain . This group contains about 16 stars , including Alpha Librae , Alpha Cephei , Castor , Fomalhaut and Vega . All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities . Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound . The estimated age of this moving group is 200 ± 100 million years , and they have an average space velocity of 16 @.@ 5 km / s .

 = = = Infrared excess = = = 
 One of the early results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite ( IRAS ) was the discovery of excess infrared flux coming from Vega , beyond what would be expected from the star alone . This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25 , 60 , and 100 μm , and came from within an angular radius of 10 arcseconds ( 10 ″ ) centered on the star . At the measured distance of Vega , this corresponded to an actual radius of 80 astronomical units ( AU ) , where an AU is the average radius of the Earth 's orbit around the Sun . It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension on the order of a millimeter , as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting – Robertson drag . The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle , causing it to spiral inward . This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star . 
 Subsequent measurements of Vega at 193 μm showed a lower than expected flux for the hypothesized particles , suggesting that they must instead be on the order of 100 μm or less . To maintain this amount of dust in orbit around Vega , a continual source of replenishment would be required . A proposed mechanism for maintaining the dust was a disk of coalesced bodies that were in the process of collapsing to form a planet . Models fitted to the dust distribution around Vega indicate that it is a 120 AU @-@ radius circular disk viewed from nearly pole @-@ on . In addition , there is a hole in the center of the disk with a radius of no less than 80 AU . 
 Following the discovery of an infrared excess around Vega , other stars have been found that display a similar anomaly that is attributable to dust emission . As of 2002 , about 400 of these stars have been found , and they have come to be termed " Vega @-@ like " or " Vega @-@ excess " stars . It is believed that these may provide clues to the origin of the Solar System . 
 = = = Debris disks = = = 
 By 2005 , the Spitzer Space Telescope had produced high @-@ resolution infrared images of the dust around Vega . It was shown to extend out to 43 ″ ( 330 AU ) at a wavelength of 24 μm , 70 ″ ( 543 AU ) at 70 μm and 105 ″ ( 815 AU ) at 160 μm . These much wider disks were found to be circular and free of clumps , with dust particles ranging from 1 – 50 μm in size . The estimated total mass of this dust is 3 × 10 − 3 times the mass of the Earth . Production of the dust would require collisions between asteroids in a population corresponding to the Kuiper Belt around the Sun . Thus the dust is more likely created by a debris disk around Vega , rather than from a protoplanetary disk as was earlier thought . 
 The inner boundary of the debris disk was estimated at 11 ″ ± 2 ″ , or 70 – 100 AU . The disk of dust is produced as radiation pressure from Vega pushes debris from collisions of larger objects outward . However , continuous production of the amount of dust observed over the course of Vega 's lifetime would require an enormous starting mass — estimated as hundreds of times the mass of Jupiter . Hence it is more likely to have been produced as the result of a relatively recent breakup of a moderate @-@ sized ( or larger ) comet or asteroid , which then further fragmented as the result of collisions between the smaller components and other bodies . This dusty disk would be relatively young on the time scale of the star 's age , and it will eventually be removed unless other collision events supply more dust . 
 Observations , first with the Palomar Testbed Interferometer by David Ciardi and Gerard van Belle in 2001 and then later confirmed with the CHARA array at Mt . Wilson in 2006 and the Infrared Optical Telescope Array at Mt . Hopkins in 2011 , revealed evidence for an inner dust band around Vega . Originating within 8 AU of the star , this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system . This may be caused by an intense bombardment of comets or meteors , and may be evidence for the existence of a planetary system . 
 = = = Possible planets = = = 
 Observations from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in 1997 revealed an " elongated bright central region " that peaked at 9 ″ ( 70 AU ) to the northeast of Vega . This was hypothesized as either a perturbation of the dust disk by a planet or else an orbiting object that was surrounded by dust . However , images by the Keck telescope had ruled out a companion down to magnitude 16 , which would correspond to a body with more than 12 times the mass of Jupiter . Astronomers at the Joint Astronomy Centre in Hawaii and at UCLA suggested that the image may indicate a planetary system still undergoing formation . 
 Determining the nature of the planet has not been straightforward ; a 2002 paper hypothesizes that the clumps are caused by a roughly Jupiter @-@ mass planet on an eccentric orbit . Dust would collect in orbits that have mean @-@ motion resonances with this planet — where their orbital periods form integer fractions with the period of the planet — producing the resulting clumpiness . 
 In 2003 it was hypothesized that these clumps could be caused by a roughly Neptune @-@ mass planet having migrated from 40 to 65 AU over 56 million years , an orbit large enough to allow the formation of smaller rocky planets closer to Vega . The migration of this planet would likely require gravitational interaction with a second , higher @-@ mass planet in a smaller orbit . 
 Using a coronagraph on the Subaru telescope in Hawaii in 2005 , astronomers were able to further constrain the size of a planet orbiting Vega to no more than 5 – 10 times the mass of Jupiter . The issue of possible clumps in the debris disc was revisited in 2007 using newer , more sensitive instrumentation on the Plateau de Bure Interferometer . The observations showed that the debris ring is smooth and symmetric . No evidence was found of the blobs reported earlier , casting doubts on the hypothesized giant planet . The smooth structure has been confirmed in follow @-@ up observations by Hughes et al . ( 2012 ) and the Herschel Space Telescope . 
 Although a planet has yet to be directly observed around Vega , the presence of a planetary system can not yet be precluded . Thus there could be smaller , terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star . The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star . From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega , the Sun would appear as a faint 4 @.@ 3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation . 
 = = Etymology and cultural significance = = 
 The name <unk> ( later Vega ) comes from a loose transliteration of the Arabic word <unk> ‘ meaning " falling " or " landing " , via the phrase an @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> ‘ , " the falling eagle " . The term " Al <unk> al Waki " appeared in the Al Achsasi al Mouakket star catalogue and was translated into Latin as Vultur <unk> , " the falling eagle / vulture " . The constellation was represented as a vulture in ancient Egypt , and as an eagle or vulture in ancient India . The Arabic name then appeared in the western world in the Alfonsine Tables , which were drawn up between 1215 and 1270 by order of Alfonso X. Medieval astrolabes of England and Western Europe used the names <unk> and <unk> , and depicted it and Altair as birds . 
 Each night the positions of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates . However , when a star is located along the Earth 's axis of rotation , it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star . The direction of the Earth 's axis of rotation gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes . A complete precession cycle requires 25 @,@ 770 years , during which time the pole of the Earth 's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars . At present the pole star is Polaris , but around 12 @,@ 000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega . Through precession , the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14 @,@ 000 . It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars . 
 Among the northern Polynesian people , Vega was known as <unk> o te tau , the year star . For a period of history it marked the start of their new year when the ground would be prepared for planting . Eventually this function became denoted by the Pleiades . 
 The Assyrians named this pole star Dayan @-@ same , the " Judge of Heaven " , while in Akkadian it was Tir @-@ anna , " Life of Heaven " . In Babylonian astronomy , Vega may have been one of the stars named <unk> , " the Messenger of Light " . To the ancient Greeks , the constellation Lyra was formed from the harp of Orpheus , with Vega as its handle . For the Roman Empire , the start of autumn was based upon the hour at which Vega set below the horizon . 
 In Chinese mythology , there is a love story of Qi Xi ( <unk> ) in which Niu Lang ( <unk> , Altair ) and his two children ( β and γ Aquilae ) are separated from their mother Zhi Nü ( <unk> , lit . " Weaving Girl " , Vega ) who is on the far side of the river , the Milky Way . However , one day per year on the seventh day of the seventh month of the Chinese lunisolar calendar , magpies make a bridge so that Niu Lang and Zhi Nü can be together again for a brief encounter . The Japanese Tanabata festival , in which Vega is known as <unk> ( <unk> ) , is also based on this legend . 
 In Zoroastrianism , Vega was sometimes associated with <unk> , a minor divinity whose name means " conqueror " . 
 The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria named it as <unk> , " the flying Loan " . 
 In Hindu mythology , Vega is called Abhijit . The author of Mahabharat , Maharshi Vyas , mentions in the chapter Vana Parva ( Chap . 230 , Verses 8 – 11 ) : " Contesting against Abhijit ( Vega ) , the constellation Krittika ( Pleiades ) went to " Vana " the summer solstice to heat the summer . Then the star Abhijit slipped down in the sky . " P. V. <unk> suggests in his book , The Scholarly Dating of Mahabharat , that the " slipping of Abhijit " and ascension of Krittika ( Pleiades ) might refer to the gradual drop of Vega as a pole star since 12 @,@ 000 BC . Vega is expected to become Earth 's pole star by the year 26 @,@ 000 by some estimates . 
 Medieval astrologers counted Vega as one of the Behenian stars and related it to <unk> and winter savory . Cornelius Agrippa listed its kabbalistic sign under Vultur <unk> , a literal Latin translation of the Arabic name . Medieval star charts also listed the alternate names <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for this star . 
 Vega became the first star to have a car named after it with the French <unk> Vega line of cars from 1954 onwards , and later on , in America , Chevrolet launched the Vega in 1971 . Other vehicles named after Vega include the ESA 's Vega launch system and the Lockheed Vega aircraft .

 " I See the Light " is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater for Walt Disney Animation Studios ' 50th animated feature film Tangled ( 2010 ) . A duet originally recorded by American recording artist and actress Mandy Moore and American actor Zachary Levi in their respective film roles as main characters Rapunzel and Flynn Rider , the folk @-@ inspired pop ballad serves as both the film 's love and theme song . Lyrically , " I See the Light " describes the developing romantic relationship between Rapunzel and Flynn , and is featured as the seventh track on the film 's soundtrack album . 
 Tangled was originally conceived by Disney animator Glen Keane . Subsequently , Walt Disney Animation Studios hired veteran Disney composer Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater to write the film 's songs . Initially , Menken and Slater had written a more anthemic version of " I See the Light " before finally re @-@ working it into a gentler , simpler and more folk @-@ oriented song . Menken would later reveal that , out of Tangled 's five songs and musical numbers , he is most proud of " I See the Light " . 
 " I See the Light " has inspired a generally mixed to positive reception from film and music critics , who were largely ambivalent towards the song 's content , questioning its originality . However , the " lantern sequence " during which " I See the Light " is performed by Rapunzel and Flynn has enjoyed widespread critical acclaim , with journalists and commentators praising its visuals and use of 3D . Critically , both the song and the scene have been compared to similar romantic musical sequences from preceding Disney animated films , including " Kiss the Girl " from The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) and " A Whole New World " from Aladdin ( 1992 ) , both of which are love songs also composed by Menken . 
 In spite of its lukewarm reviews , " I See the Light " has garnered numerous awards and accolades . The song was nominated for the Academy and Golden Globe awards for Best Original Song in 2011 , losing both , the former to " We Belong Together " from Toy Story 3 ( 2010 ) and the latter to " You Haven 't Seen the Last of Me " from Burlesque ( 2010 ) . Subsequently , " I See the Light " won both the Las Vegas Film Critics Society Award for Best Song and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media . Since its release , the song has been recorded and covered by various musical artists , including musical theatre performers David Harris and Lucy Durack , and classical singer Jackie Evancho .

 The concept of an animated film based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale " Rapunzel " originated from Disney animator Glen Keane in 1998 . Veteran Disney composer Alan Menken had just recently completed scoring Walt Disney Pictures ' Enchanted ( 2007 ) when he received a telephone call from Walt Disney Animation Studios in 2008 , who invited him to compose the music for the studio 's then @-@ upcoming animated film Tangled . Upon accepting , Menken invited frequent collaborator Glenn Slater , with whom he had previously worked on Disney 's Home on the Range ( 2004 ) and the Broadway musical adaptation of The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) , to serve alongside him as his co @-@ writing lyricist once again . 
 Aware that Tangled would not be " a [ traditional ] musical like Beauty and the Beast or [ The Hunchback of Notre Dame ] " , on both of which Menken worked as a composer , Menken described the film as a " hybrid " because it is " far from [ a ] classic break into song musical . " For Tangled , Menken challenged himself to come up with a different , unique sound that would differ significantly from the musical styles of his previous Broadway musical @-@ influenced film projects and compositions . Inspired by the ongoing motif of Rapunzel 's " long hair and the freedom she wanted " , Menken decided to draw particular influence from the musical genre of 1960s folk rock , citing the musicianship and artistry of Canadian singer @-@ songwriter Joni Mitchell as a major source of musical inspiration .

 When it came to writing the film 's songs and musical numbers , Menken and Slater " looked for what is going to be an appropriate song moment for the main characters . " In the specific case of " I See the Light " , Menken elaborated , " The lantern song ... flows pretty much out of the sense of completion and [ Rapunzel ] finally sees the lanterns and has this moment . It ’ s more of a montage number . " 
 Menken and Slater had originally intended for " I See the Light " to sound more " anthem @-@ like " . The songwriters eventually changed their minds , deciding to re @-@ write " I See the Light " into a gentler , more folk @-@ oriented song . Menken spoke of the creative writing process , " we began throwing melodies up , doing songs and riffs and harmonies , and we waited for something to stick " . Additionally , Menken later admitted that , out of Tangled 's five songs and musical numbers , he is most proud of " I See the Light " because it " is a great moment in the film and I am very happy with the beauty and simplicity of the song . " 
 Similarly , co @-@ director Byron Howard also took an immediate liking towards the song . Hailing " I See the Light " as his favorite of the film 's songs , Howard elaborated , " The moment [ co @-@ director Nathan Greno and I ] heard Alan Menken 's demo we knew that one would be a classic . " 
 A romantic duet performed during the narrative portion of the film by its two main characters , Rapunzel and Flynn Rider , " I See the Light " was recorded by American recording artist and actress Mandy Moore as the voice of Rapunzel and American actor Zachary Levi as the voice of Flynn Rider . While filming Tangled , Moore and Levi physically encountered and worked with each other only twice , once on two separate occasions , the purpose of one of which was to record the vocals for " I See the Light " . According to Levi , he and Moore first rehearsed the song live accompanied by the film 's 80 @-@ piece orchestra before eventually being divided into separate isolation booths to record their respective lyrics , verses and harmonies individually .

 Occurring towards the end of Tangled , " I See the Light " takes place during the film 's second act soon after Rapunzel and Flynn Rider have finally completed their grueling journey from Mother Gothel 's tower to Corona , arriving in the kingdom just in time to experience its annual lantern @-@ lighting ceremony , which Rapunzel has spent eighteen years – her entire life – observing at a distance from the confinement of Gothel 's tower . There the couple embarks on a boat ride to watch the ceremony as " the night sky [ is ] illuminated with a sea of lanterns . " During the pivotal scene , described by critics as the film 's " emotional peak " because of the fact that " Rapunzel ’ s dream of watching the floating lanterns seems to be <unk> [ z ] ed " , the musical number both " highlights the ... flight of the lanterns " while essentially triggering Rapunzel and Flynn ’ s " budding romance " , who are gradually beginning to fall in love . 
 According to Marianne <unk> of the Catholic News Agency , Rapunzel , during the scene , " finally sees for herself the wondrous floating lanterns she ’ s yearned to see her entire life " . Meanwhile , the audience is shown the way in which " love ... has blossomed between " the film 's two main characters . Commonly referred to by critics as one of Tangled 's " showstopping moments " , Rapunzel and Flynn perform the romantic duet while " play [ ing ] off each other " as they continue to fall in love 
 As a result of " I See the Light " ' s setting , romantic context and lyrical content , several comparisons have been drawn between both the song and its corresponding scene and various romantic musical sequences from a number of preceding Disney animated feature films , the most frequently referenced of which are " Kiss the Girl " from The Little Mermaid ( 1989 ) and " A Whole New World " from Aladdin ( 1992 ) , both romantic ballads also composed by Menken . One particular reviewer , Steven D. Greydanus of Decent Films Guide , drew comparisons between the scene and the musical " Nutcracker Suite " sequence from Disney 's animated feature film Fantasia ( 1940 ) , describing it as " a moment of visual transcendence . " 
 Throughout the filmmaking process , Tangled 's co @-@ directors Byron Howard and Nathan Greno continued to hold the scene in particularly high regard , constantly boasting to the production team that " I See the Light " " will be the most spectacular animated sequence you 've ever seen . " According to Greno , the use of 45 @,@ 000 floating lanterns during the scene was directly inspired by traditional Indonesian ceremonies during which people " set up rice paper lanterns and send them into the sky .

 Contrastingly , the climactic musical sequence during which " I See the Light " is performed by Rapunzel and Flynn , commonly referred to as the " lantern sequence " , has fared significantly better than the song itself , garnering widespread acclaim from film critics . Keith Uhlich of Time Out described the scene as " especially wonderful " , while Digital Spy 's Simon Reynolds similarly hailed it as one of the film 's most " striking moments " .

" Radio Times ' Alan Jones labeled the sequence one of the film 's " most beautifully uplifting moments " . Similarly , Christian Blauvelt of Slant Magazine highlighted the scene as one of Tangled 's " few moments of otherworldly beauty " . A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote , " A scene of paper lanterns descending through mist onto water is especially breathtaking , partly because it departs from the usual 3 @-@ D insistence on deep focus and sharply defined images , creating an experience that is almost tactile in its dreamy softness . " 
 The New York Post 's Lou Lumenick , whose response to the film 's use of 3D was generally mixed , described " I See the Light " as " the year ’ s best use of 3 @-@ D " .

 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided to modify the nomination rules pertaining to the Academy Award for Best Original Song after Menken 's Enchanted garnered three separate nominations for the award in 2008 , decreasing the nomination limit from three to only two from any individual film . After the release of Tangled , Menken revealed that the studio will only be submitting one song from the film to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for consideration for the Best Original Song award at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 " to avoid songs canceling each other out if nominated . " Menken decided upon " I See the Light " because he considers it " the heart and center of " the film and " seems to be the one that can break out . " Additionally , several critics expected the song to win Best Original Song , including Time 's Richard Corliss . 
 As widely anticipated , " I See the Light " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 83rd Academy Awards in 2011 , becoming Menken 's nineteenth Academy Award nomination .

 = Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor ( 782 ) = 
 The Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor in 782 was one of the largest operations launched by the Abbasid Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire . The invasion was launched as a display of Abbasid military might in the aftermath of a series of Byzantine successes . Commanded by the Abbasid heir @-@ apparent , the future Harun al @-@ Rashid , the Abbasid army reached as far as Chrysopolis , across the Bosporus from the Byzantine capital , Constantinople , while secondary forces raided western Asia Minor and defeated the Byzantine forces there . As Harun did not intend to assault Constantinople and lacked ships to do so , he turned back . 
 The Byzantines , who in the meantime had neutralized the detachment left to secure the Abbasid army 's rear in Phrygia , were able to trap Harun 's army between their own converging forces . The defection of the Armenian general Tatzates , however , allowed Harun to regain the upper hand . The Abbasid prince sent for a truce and detained the high @-@ ranking Byzantine envoys , who included Empress Irene 's chief minister , Staurakios . This forced Irene to agree to a three @-@ year truce and pay a heavy annual tribute . Irene then focused her attention to the Balkans , but warfare with the Arabs resumed in 786 , until mounting Arab pressure led to another truce in 798 , on terms similar to those of 782 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Taking advantage of the internal difficulties of the Umayyad Caliphate that resulted from the civil wars of the 740s and the subsequent Abbasid Revolution , the Byzantines under Emperor Constantine V ( reigned 741 – 775 ) were able to regain the initiative on their eastern borders from the Arabs , and pursued an aggressive strategy . With the gradual consolidation of the Abbasid regime in the 760s and 770s , the situation became more balanced : the Arabs resumed their large @-@ scale raids deep into Asia Minor , although the Byzantines were still capable of major <unk> . Thus in 778 , the Byzantines , under Michael Lachanodrakon , seized the town of Germanikeia ( Ma <unk> ) , where they captured significant amounts of booty and took many Syrian Christians captive , and defeated an army sent against them by the Abbasid general Thumama ibn al @-@ Walid . In the next year , the Byzantines took and razed the fortress city of Hadath , forcing Caliph al @-@ Mahdi ( r . 775 – 785 ) to replace the rather passive Thumama with the veteran al @-@ Hasan ibn Qahtaba . Hasan led over 30 @,@ 000 troops in an invasion of Byzantine territory , but the Byzantines offered no opposition and withdrew to well @-@ fortified towns and refuges , until a lack of supplies forced Hasan to return home without achieving much . 
 In response to these Byzantine successes , Caliph al @-@ Mahdi now resolved to take the field in person . On 12 March 780 , Mahdi departed Baghdad and via Aleppo marched to Hadath , which he refortified . He then advanced to <unk> , where he left the army and returned to Baghdad . His son and heir Harun — better known by his laqab , or regnal name , al @-@ Rashid — was left in charge of one half of the army , which raided the Armeniac Theme and took the small fort of <unk> . Thumama , who had been entrusted with the other half , penetrated deeper into Asia Minor . He marched west as far as the Thracesian Theme , but was heavily defeated there by Lachanodrakon . In June 781 , as the Arab invasion force assembled at Hadath under Abd al @-@ Kabir , a great @-@ great @-@ nephew of the Caliph Umar ( r . 634 – 644 ) , and again prepared to launch their annual raid , Empress Irene called up the thematic armies of Asia Minor and placed them under the eunuch sakellarios John . The Muslims crossed into Byzantine Cappadocia over the Pass of Hadath , and were met near Caesarea by the combined Byzantine forces under Lachanodrakon . The ensuing battle resulted in a costly Arab defeat , forcing Abd al @-@ Kabir to abandon his campaign and retreat to Syria . 
 This defeat infuriated the Caliph , who prepared a new expedition . Intended as a show of force and a clear display of the Caliphate 's superiority , it was the largest army sent against Byzantium in the second half of the 8th century : it allegedly comprised 95 @,@ 793 men , about twice the total Byzantine military establishment present in Asia Minor , and cost the Abbasid state some 1 @.@ 6 million nomismata , almost as much as the Byzantine Empire 's entire annual income . Harun was the nominal leader , but the Caliph took care to send experienced officers to accompany him . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 On 9 February 782 , Harun departed Baghdad ; the Arabs crossed the Taurus Mountains by the Cilician Gates , and swiftly took the border fortress of <unk> . They then advanced along the military roads across the plateau into Phrygia . There , Harun left his lieutenant , the <unk> al @-@ Rabi ' ibn Yunus , to besiege <unk> and guard his rear , while another force , reportedly 30 @,@ 000 men , under al @-@ <unk> ( an unspecified member of the powerful Barmakid family , probably Yahya ibn Khalid ) , was sent to raid the rich western coastlands of Asia Minor . Harun himself , with the main army , advanced to the Opsician Theme . The accounts of subsequent events in the primary sources ( Theophanes the Confessor , Michael the Syrian , and al @-@ Tabari ) differ on the details , but the general course of the campaign can be reconstructed . 
 According to Warren Treadgold , the Byzantine effort seems to have been led by Irene 's chief minister , the eunuch Staurakios , whose strategy was to avoid an immediate confrontation with Harun 's huge army , but wait until it had split up and advanced to meet its various detachments independently . The <unk> under Lachanodrakon confronted al @-@ <unk> at a place called <unk> , but were defeated and suffered heavy losses ( 15 @,@ 000 men according to Theophanes , 10 @,@ 000 according to Michael the Syrian ) . The outcome of al @-@ Rabi 's siege of <unk> is unclear , but he was probably defeated ; Theophanes 's phrasing may imply that the town was taken , but Michael the Syrian reports that the Arabs suffered great losses and failed to capture it , a version of events confirmed by hagiographic sources . Al @-@ Tabari reports that part of the main army under Yazid ibn Mazyad al @-@ Shaybani met a Byzantine force led by a certain Niketas who was " count of counts " ( perhaps the Count of the Opsician Theme ) , probably somewhere near Nicaea . In the ensuing battle , Niketas was wounded and unhorsed in single combat with the Arab general and forced to retire , probably to Nicomedia , where the imperial tagmata ( professional guard regiments ) under the Domestic of the Schools Anthony were assembled . Harun did not bother with them , and advanced to the town of Chrysopolis , across the Bosporus Strait from Constantinople itself . Lacking ships to cross the Bosporus , and with no intention of assaulting Constantinople in the first place , Harun probably intended this advance only as a show of force . 
 Furthermore , despite his success so far , Harun 's position was precarious , as the defeat of al @-@ Rabi threatened his lines of communication with the Caliphate . Consequently , after plundering the Byzantine capital 's Asian suburbs , Harun turned his army back , but during his march along the valley of the Sangarius River , east of Nicaea , he was surrounded by the forces of the tagmata under Anthony in his rear and of the <unk> under their general Tatzates to his front . Fortunately for him , at this point Tatzates , an Armenian prince who had defected from his Arab @-@ ruled homeland to the Byzantines in 760 and was closely associated with the iconoclast regime of Constantine V , secretly made contact with him . Tatzates offered to aid Harun in exchange for a pardon and a safe return for himself and his family to his native Armenia . Theophanes explains Tatzates 's actions with his hostility towards Irene 's favourite , Staurakios , but this evidently masks a broader dissatisfaction with Irene 's regime . As Ralph @-@ Johannes Lilie writes , " Tatzates did not see any big opportunities for himself under the new regime and indeed used the good chance that the situation offered him . " 
 Thus , when Harun asked for negotiations , Irene dispatched a delegation of three of her most senior officials : the Domestic Anthony , the magistros Peter , and Staurakios himself . Confident of their military position , they neglected to secure promises for their safety or hostages of their own , so that when they arrived in the Arab camp , they were made prisoners . Coupled with the treachery of Tatzates and the unreliability of the troops under his command , Irene was now forced to negotiate for their release , especially of her trusted aide Staurakios . 
 The two states concluded a three @-@ year truce in exchange for a heavy annual tribute — the Arab sources mention various amounts between 70 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 gold nomismata , while one also adds 10 @,@ 000 pieces of silk . Tabari 's account records that the tribute amounted to " ninety or seventy thousand dinars " , to be paid " at the beginning of April and in June every year " . In addition , the Byzantines were obliged to provide provisions and guides for Harun 's army on its march home , and to hand over Tatzates 's wife and property . Harun released all his captives ( 5 @,@ 643 according to Tabari ) , but kept the rich plunder he had gathered , and returned to the Caliphate in September 782 . Tabari , in his account of the expedition , says that Harun 's forces captured 194 @,@ 450 dinars in gold and 21 @,@ 414 @,@ 800 dirhams in silver , killed 54 @,@ 000 Byzantines in battle and 2 @,@ 090 in captivity and took over 20 @,@ 000 riding animals captive while slaughtering 100 @,@ 000 cattle and sheep . Tabari also reports that the amount of plunder was such that " a work horse was sold for a dirham and a mule for less than ten dirhams , a coat of mail for less than a dirham , and twenty swords for a dirham " — at a time when one to two dirhams was the usual daily salary of a labourer or soldier . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The successful Arab invasion had important repercussions in Byzantium . The outcome represented a major blow to Empress Irene 's prestige , while Tatzates , a capable and veteran leader , was lost to the Empire and became the ruler of his native Armenia for the Abbasids . On the other hand , despite the humiliating peace treaty , Byzantium 's losses were not excessive , especially considering the scale of the Arab attack , and Irene used the three years of the truce to strengthen her internal position : she seems to have dismissed most of the " old guard " of Constantine V 's generals , with the long @-@ serving and fanatically iconoclast Michael Lachanodrakon being the most prominent victim of this bloodless purge . In this way , Irene secured control over the military , and was able to refocus its efforts in expanding and consolidating Byzantine control over the Slavs of the Balkans . 
 Despite the truce , the chronicler Ibn <unk> mentions Arab raids into Asia Minor for the years 783 , 784 and 785 . If true , then these would probably represent only minor affairs , as the main sources agree that the truce was mutually respected until spring 785 . In that year , as Irene had strengthened her hold over the army and was preparing to confront the iconoclasts on the domestic front , she decided to cease payment of the tribute , and hostilities recommenced . In early 786 , the Byzantines scored a major success , sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia , which the Abbasids had spent the last five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross @-@ border expeditions . After the accession of Harun al @-@ Rashid to the caliphal throne in the same year , however , the Abbasids regained the initiative . Arab pressure mounted , and in 798 Irene was forced to ask for a peace treaty that repeated the stipulations of the 782 truce . 
 = European route E751 = 
 The European route E751 , or E751 , as defined by the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries of 1975 , and subsequent documents which amended the treaty , is an east @-@ west Class @-@ B branching European road route . Originating in Rijeka , Croatia , where it diverges from European route E61 before passing through the Kanfanar interchange , the route connects Pula , Rovinj , Poreč and Umag in Croatia with Koper in Slovenia . The route provides a high @-@ performance road link in Istria and Slovenian Littoral . Unlike most routes , the E751 centers on the Kanfanar interchange and has three arms , each extending to Rijeka , Pula and Koper . The total length of the route , including all the route arms , is 160 km ( 99 mi ) . 
 The E751 mostly consists of motorways , but considerable sections are either expressways or two @-@ lane roads with at @-@ grade intersections . All motorway sections of the E751 are tolled , using the electronic toll collection ( ETC ) and ticket systems . Since the 1980s , the E751 has gradually been upgraded from a regular two @-@ lane road to motorway standards , and further upgrades are still being carried out or planned in some areas , particularly in the Rijeka – Kanfanar section and in the section located in Slovenia . The bulk of the E751 consists of the Istrian Y roads operated by BINA Istra . The part of the route in Slovenia is managed by the Slovenian Roads Agency , part of the Government of Slovenia . 
 The E751 is considered to be of great importance for the economy and tourist industry of the region , as it links a large number of resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia , providing a significant access route for thousands of motoring tourists . Furthermore , two endpoints of the E751 are located in the vicinity of the two major Adriatic seaports of Rijeka and Koper .

 The 160 @-@ kilometre ( 99 mi ) long E751 , part of the International E @-@ road network , connects Croatian and Slovenian Adriatic coastal areas in the vicinity of the city of Rijeka , Istria and Slovenian Littoral . This European route is a Class B branch road , consisting mostly of motorways and expressways along with two @-@ lane roads that have at @-@ grade intersections . It diverges from European route E61 at the Matulji interchange of the Croatian A7 and the A8 motorways , and follows the A8 motorway route . Since sections of the A8 east of Rogovići interchange are still incomplete and lack the second carriageway , those comprise two @-@ lane , limited access roads with grade @-@ separated interchanges ( except the Opatija junction ) with the D8 state road and is at @-@ grade and regulated by traffic lights . As the A8 terminates at the Kanfanar interchange , the E751 switches to the six @-@ lane A9 motorway . At this junction , the E751 is signposted in both directions , following an approximately 30 kilometres ( 19 miles ) long arm of the Istrian Y system , consisting of the A9 and the A8 roads , to Pula and a considerably longer northward arm to Umag . The A8 and the A9 are the longest segments of the E751 , being 141 kilometres ( 88 miles ) long combined . Following the northern terminus of the A9 motorway in the Umag interchange , the E751 switches to the 0 @.@ 6 @-@ kilometre ( 0 @.@ 37 mi ) D510 connector and the northernmost section of the D21 state road running to the Kaštel / Dragonja border crossing to Slovenia . Beyond the border , the E751 follows the G11 road to the city of Koper , where the E751 terminates . Thus , unlike most routes , the E751 centers on a central interchange , Kanfanar , and has three arms , each extending to Rijeka , Pula and Koper . 
 The E751 route is of great importance for economy and tourist industry of Istria and Slovenian Littoral , as it links a large number of resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia , providing a significant access route for thousands of motoring tourists . These resorts include Brijuni National Park , Fažana , Rovinj , Poreč , Novigrad , Umag , Piran and Portorož on either side of the Croatian – Slovenian border . Furthermore , two endpoints of the E751 are located in vicinity of two major Adriatic seaports : the Port of Rijeka and the Port of Koper . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 Since June 2011 , the E751 comprises the Croatian A8 and A9 tolled motorways of the Istrian Y. The tolls there are based on the vehicle classification in Croatia using a closed @-@ toll system . Tolls charged along the A9 motorway toll plazas vary depending on the length of route traveled and range from 3 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 0 @.@ 40 ) to 26 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 3 @.@ 51 ) for passenger cars and 15 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 2 @.@ 02 ) to 185 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 25 @.@ 00 ) for semi @-@ trailer trucks . Although A8 also employs a ticket system , usage of the road is free except for vehicles traversing the Učka Tunnel and the Kanfanar – Rogovići section . A user of the entire length of the A8 is charged 36 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 4 @.@ 86 ) for passenger cars or up to 205 @.@ 00 kuna ( € 27 @.@ 70 ) for semi @-@ trailers , depending on vehicle classification in Croatia . Ticket systems employed by the A9 and the A8 are unified ; tolls are not charged when switching between the two roads . The toll is payable in either Croatian kuna or euros using major credit cards , debit cards and a number of prepaid toll collection systems . The latter includes various types of smart cards issued by the motorway operator and ENC , an electronic toll collection ( ETC ) system which is used by most motorways in Croatia and provides drivers with discounted toll rates for dedicated lanes at toll plazas . 
 The operator of the A9 and the A8 routes , BINA Istra , reported a 65 @.@ 8 million kuna ( € 8 @.@ 9 million ) VAT @-@ free toll income in the first half of 2011 ; this represents an increase of 30 @.@ 8 percent compared to the same period of the previous year . The figure includes the entire Istrian Y system : the A9 motorway and the A8 motorway . A major part of the increase is attributed to introduction of the closed @-@ toll system , which replaced an open toll system where the toll was charged at the Mirna Bridge and the Učka Tunnel only . The part of the E751 in Slovenia , maintained by the Slovenian Roads Agency of the Government of Slovenia , is not tolled , nor is a short part of the E751 consisting of less than 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 miles ) Croatian state roads . The state roads in Croatia are maintained by Hrvatske ceste . 
 = = History = = 
 The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe was formed in 1947 , and their first major act to improve transportation was the joint UN declaration numbered 1264 . Signed in Geneva on September 16 , 1950 , it was named the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries , which defined the first E @-@ road network . This declaration was amended several times before November 15 , 1975 , when it was replaced by the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries ( AGR ) , which established a route @-@ numbering system and improved standards for roads on the list . The AGR went through several changes , the last one of which , as of 2011 , occurred 2008 . Reorganization of the E @-@ roads network of 1975 and 1983 defined the E751 road and assigned it to Rijeka – Pula – Koper route . 
 Since the first section of the Istrian Y , which constitutes the bulk of the E751 route , started in 1976 , with the first section opening in 1981 , there were no high @-@ performance road routes in Istria . Instead , the E751 was signposted along state roads , specifically the D66 spanning Rijeka and Pula , and then switched to the D21 in Pula all the way to the Kaštel border crossing . As the Istrian Y system was being developed , the E751 designation was gradually transferred to the new route , with consistent signposting of the E751 along the A9 and the A8 , just as the D3 state road designation west of Rijeka was transferred to the B8 and B9 ( later replaced by the A8 and A9 respectively ) . 
 = = = Planned development = = = 
 As of September 2011 , there were several plans aimed at the upgrading of the E751 constituent roads in various stages of design or implementation . The A8 route is planned to be upgraded to six @-@ lane motorway standards by its concessionaire , BINA Istra . The upgrade construction works are completed along a 18 @-@ kilometre ( 11 mi ) section of the route west of Rogovići , while the remainder is scheduled to be upgraded by late 2014 or early 2015 . The A9 motorway is largely complete , and the missing structures required to achieve a full six @-@ lane cross @-@ section of the motorway at the Mirna Bridge and the Limska Draga Viaduct are planned to be completed by 2014 . The remaining unbuilt section of the motorway is a short connection to the Slovenian border and planned H5 expressway .

 = Battle for No.3 Post = 
 The Battle for No.3 Post ( 28 – 30 May 1915 ) was fought during the Gallipoli Campaign in the First World War , between the forces of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade and the Turkish 19th Division . 
 The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was responsible for the defence of the northern perimeter of the ANZAC beach @-@ head , holding a sector from the position known as Walker 's Top down the ridge line to the sea . Part of this defence line was formed by No.1 and No.2 Posts , isolated positions in the far north that could only be approached in safety during the hours of darkness . Near the end of May 1915 , the Turks started constructing a new position just inland from No.2 Post , that if left to be completed would cause problems for the New Zealanders . Therefore , it was decided to assault and capture the post . After the position was captured , it was named No.3 Post , and the New Zealanders settled in and attempted to improve its defences . The same night , the Turks counter @-@ attacked . Surrounded and cut off from the rest of the brigade , running short of ammunition and supplies , the defending 9th ( Wellington East Coast ) Squadron held out for twenty @-@ eight hours until relieved , and beat off several attempts to break through their lines . When the squadron was eventually relieved it was decided the post was untenable , and it was abandoned the same night . 
 The New Zealand Mounted Brigade 's casualties during the battle were forty @-@ two dead and 109 wounded . The exact number of Turkish casualties is not known but was around two hundred men . The New Zealand brigade went on to fight in the Battle of Chunuk Bair and the Battle of Hill 60 , and was then evacuated from the peninsula before the campaign ended in December 1915 .

 On 25 April , at the start of the Gallipoli Campaign , the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove . Included in the landings was the New Zealand and Australian Division , but the division had been forced to leave part of its strength , including the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade , behind in Egypt . The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula . However , heavy casualties , and the lack of any other reinforcements , forced them to reconsider the decision , and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role . 
 = = = New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade = = = 
 Under the command of Brigadier @-@ General Andrew Russell , the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was raised in August 1914 and consisted of three regiments of mounted infantry . While the brigade had an establishment of 1 @,@ 940 men , when dismounted its rifle strength was only the equivalent of an infantry battalion . Each of the brigade 's regiments was formed from three squadrons , each of 158 men organised into a headquarters and four troops . 
 When the brigade arrived in Egypt , it came under the command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division . In April 1915 , the division 's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination , and it was not until 1 May that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade learned about the Gallipoli landings . Four days later the brigade received news that it would also deploy , as reinforcements , to Gallipoli , but in a dismounted role without their horses . They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May , and disembarked at Anzac Cove . The next day , the brigade moved into the front line on the northern left flank , relieving the Royal Naval Brigade . Their trenches stretched from the Aegean Sea to Walker 's Ridge , and included two outposts , No.1 Post and No.2 Post . The latter position was the beach @-@ head 's most northern position , situated only two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from Chatham 's Post , which was the southernmost point . The outlying position of the two posts meant that movement between them and the main lines could only be undertaken safely at night . The brigade deployed with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the left , the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre , and the Wellington Mounted Rifles on the right . 
 = = = Turkish forces = = = 
 The First World War Ottoman Turkish Army was badly underestimated by the Allies . During the war it would defeat forces from the British , French and Russian armies . Before the landings Gallipoli was defended by several divisions , based on infantry battalion strong @-@ points overlooking potential landing beaches . By April 1915 , the Turks had 82 fixed and 230 mobile artillery pieces on the peninsula . 
 In May 1915 , the Turkish force that would confront the New Zealanders was provided by the 19th Division , comprising the 57th , 72nd and 77th Infantry Regiments , all under the command of Colonel Mustafa Kemal . Kemal was noted as " the most imaginative , most successful officer to fight on either side " during the Gallipoli Campaign . How the Turks viewed the invasion can be judged by Kemal 's orders to his troops following the initial landings ; " Men , I am not ordering you to attack . I am ordering you to die . In the time that it takes us to die , other forces and commanders can come and take our place . " 
 Virtually all the Turkish Army commanders , down to company commander level , were very experienced , being veterans of the Balkan Wars . But their command structure was weaker at the non @-@ commissioned officer ( NCO ) level , with only one NCO in each company . One advantage that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders , at the time , was their hand grenades , which were not used by the British forces .

 After an abortive Turkish attack in early May , from the middle of the month the New Zealanders observed their opponents improving their defensive positions . One position in particular was started overnight on 26 / 27 May , at the foot of the ridge that led down to No.2 Post and only 450 yards ( 410 m ) from it . It gave the New Zealanders cause for concern , and therefore it was decided that the position must be captured and denied to the Turks . 
 Plans for the assault were formed , and the task was given to the 1st ( Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry ) Squadron of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles , commanded by Major Percy Acton @-@ Adams . On 28 May , the squadron was concentrated at No.2 Post and at 22 : 00 left the post to capture the Turkish position . By 23 : 30 , after advancing along the ridge , they arrived and with only slight opposition drove off the twenty Turkish defenders at a cost of one dead and five wounded . They were followed up by the 6th ( Manawatu ) Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles , who carried entrenching tools to improve the defences and would then garrison the position , now named No.3 Post . 
 The 6th Squadron , who had orders to " hold the post until relieved " , started constructing defences against a Turkish counter @-@ attack , which would not be easy as the post was surrounded on three sides by the Turks . After sunrise on 29 May the squadron was in full view of the Turks and they were engaged by small arms and artillery fire . They were forced to take cover and stop building defences . That night at 21 : 00 the 6th Squadron was relieved by three troops ( nine officers and ninety @-@ three other ranks ) of the 9th ( Wellington East Coast ) Squadron , Wellington Mounted Rifles , commanded by Major Selwyn Chambers . 
 = = = Defence = = = 
 Chambers and his second in command , Captain Charles Spragg , immediately set about constructing a defensive trench across the post , and strengthening its other defences . But by now the Turks , from the 72nd Infantry Regiment , about 1 @,@ 000 @-@ strong , had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position . At 22 : 00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded , and at 23 : 35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks . The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully and out of sight to the defenders , so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks . This tactic worked well , and they broke up the Turkish assault , causing the attackers some casualties . The Turks did not withdraw far , and crept up to the edge of the New Zealanders ' trench during the night . They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders ' position . At the same time , small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down . 
 Just after midnight the New Zealanders sent the 2nd ( Wellington West Coast ) Squadron , commanded by Major James McGregor Elmslie , forward to reinforce the 9th Squadron . But by itself the 2nd Squadron was not strong enough to break through the Turkish lines and reach the post , and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting in the thick scrub . Eventually the 2nd Squadron had to form their own defensive position in the ground between No.2 and No.3 Posts . 
 At 03 : 00 , just before dawn , Spragg took command of the trench in the southern sector of No.3 Post , opposite where the Turks appeared to be gathering their forces to assault the post . He successfully deployed his men so that when the attack began , it was met and broken up by the New Zealanders ' small arms fire . But by 03 : 30 the post was under sustained Turkish rifle and grenade attack and the relieving 2nd Squadron was still held up on a ridge to the south of the post . Between them and No.3 Post was a strong Turkish force which had dug in and were in communication with the Turkish attackers in the gully to the north of the post . However , the 2nd Squadron could now bring their own small arms fire onto the Turks attacking No.3 Post , making them keep their heads down . At daylight Elmslie led a troop in an attack which captured a Turkish trench to the left of the post . At 06 : 30 communications were re @-@ established with No.3 Post by using signal flags , and Allied artillery were able to bring harassing fire onto the Turkish communications trenches . But by now the defenders were running short of supplies , especially ammunition , and no one could be spared to look after the wounded , who had to see to themselves . 
 The 6th Squadron , commanded by Major Charles Dick , were also sent forward to support the 2nd Squadron 's attempt to break through to the post . Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post , they reached a position on the open plateau to the north of No.3 Post , but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines , and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground . They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops . Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post , which they then occupied . Turkish attacks continued all day , and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position . It was now estimated that around 3 @,@ 000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post . 
 Unable to break through to No.3 Post during the day , the New Zealanders decided to wait for nightfall to make another attempt . At the same time the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were warned they would have to provide two squadrons to take over the defence , once the 9th Squadron had been relieved . During this time the Turks had not given up their attempts to recapture the post . At 19 : 00 Chambers signalled that the " repeated bombing of the trenches on the northern side of the post had resulted in a portion of the trenches being damaged , to such an extent that he could no longer prevent the enemy from getting in . " This was followed ten minutes later with a message that the Turks had occupied the trenches in the north of the post . Around the same time the 6th Squadron , advancing from the south , had managed to get to within one hundred yards ( 91 m ) of the post before being pinned down . Even though they now had fire support from a mountain artillery battery and a British destroyer , HMS Rattlesnake , they were unable to advance any further . As darkness approached the Turkish attacks lessened , and at 22 : 30 , covered by the 2nd and 6th Squadrons , the 10th ( Nelson ) Squadron and two troops from the 8th ( South Canterbury ) Squadron from the Canterbury Mounted Rifles managed to break through to No.3 Post . By 23 : 00 the 9th Squadron 's survivors had been evacuated and the Canterbury Regiment had taken over the defence of the post . An hour later the 2nd and 6th Squadrons were withdrawn back to the brigade lines . Shortly after the relief , it was decided that the post was untenable and it was abandoned . While the Canterburys were withdrawing south towards No.1 Post they were attacked by the Turks . The New Zealanders turned and opened fire , then counter @-@ attacked in a bayonet charge , forcing the Turks to withdraw before re @-@ occupying No.3 Post . The 9th Squadron had held out for twenty @-@ eight hours , during which the brigade had lost forty @-@ two men killed and 109 wounded , the vast majority from 9th Squadron . Turkish casualties were around two hundred men . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle for No.3 Post seemed a major event to those involved , but in General Ian Hamilton 's dispatches the fight only received a brief mention : " On 28 May , at 9 p.m. , a raid was made on a Turkish post overlooking the beach 1 @,@ 200 yards north of Kaba Tepe , H.M.S. " Rattlesnake " co @-@ operating . A party of 50 rifles rushed the post , killing or capturing the occupants . A similar raid was made against an enemy trench to the left of our line which cost the Turks 200 casualties , as was afterwards ascertained . " 
 The battle for No.3 Post cost the New Zealanders forty @-@ two dead and 109 wounded . The brigade fought another two battles at Gallipoli : the Battle of Chunuk Bair , and the Battle of Hill 60 . Their involvement in these battles proved costly , and in September 1915 , with a strength of only 249 men , they left the peninsula for the rest camp on the island of Lemnos . During the campaign , 4 @,@ 000 men served in the brigade ; 727 of those were killed and 1 @,@ 239 wounded , which equates to a casualty rate of almost fifty per cent . Amongst the dead were Chambers – the commander of the 9th Squadron – and Elmslie of the 6th Squadron . Both survived the battle for No.3 Post , but not the campaign , and were killed in action in August 1915 during the Battle of Chunuk Bair . Like many other New Zealanders , neither have a known grave , and they are therefore commemorated on the Chunuk Bair Memorial . The adjacent Commonwealth War Graves Commission Chunuk Bair Cemetery has 632 graves of which only ten men have been identified . During the 260 days of the Gallipoli Campaign , a total of 2 @,@ 721 New Zealand soldiers were killed and another 4 @,@ 852 wounded , out of the total 8 @,@ 556 New Zealanders who took part . The exact number of Turkish casualties at Gallipoli is not known , but has been estimated at 87 @,@ 000 dead , from a total of around 250 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 The war between the British and Ottoman Turkish Empires ended on 31 October 1918 , following the signing of the Armistice of Mudros . In November , the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were selected to be part of the Allied force of occupation for the Dardanelles peninsula . During their time there they took the opportunity to look for and bury the brigade 's war dead . Kemal , the commander of the Turkish 19th Division , survived the war . Following the Turkish War of Independence he became known as Atatürk ( Father of the Turks ) and became the first president of the new Republic of Turkey , where he is acknowledged as the nation 's " founding father " .

 New York State Route 146B ( NY 146B ) was a state highway in southern Saratoga County , New York , in the United States . It was 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) long and located entirely within the town of Clifton Park . The western terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 146 , its parent route , in the hamlet of Rexford . The eastern terminus of NY 146B was in the hamlet of Groom Corners , where it met Miller and Sugarhill roads . NY 146B was assigned c . 1932 and removed c . 1965 .

It passed to the south of the Edison Country Club and remained on the riverbank to an intersection with Grooms Road approximately 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) southeast of Rexford . Here , NY 146B turned eastward to follow Grooms Road to the hamlet of Groom Corners , a community based around the intersection of Grooms , Miller and Sugarhill roads .

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the portion of the Groom Corners – Waite Corners highway from Rexford to Waite Corners became part of the new NY 146 . The remainder of the highway from Rexford to Groom Corners was designated as NY 146B , a spur route of NY 146 , c . 1932 . NY 146B remained unchanged until c . 1965 , when the designation was removed from the highway .

 " Sister City " was written by Alan Yang and directed by series co @-@ creator Michael Schur . The episode featured comedian Fred Armisen in a guest appearance as Raul , the vice director of a Venezuelan parks department . Armisen was a cast member of NBC 's sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live , where he previously worked with performer Poehler and writer Schur . Armisen has played Venezuelan characters before , and previously imitated President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Saturday Night Live . Armisen said he got into character by thinking about his uncle , who is from Venezuela . But he said it was not a difficult performance because " most of the joke is the uniform " , which included a tan military @-@ style jacket with medals , a red beret and a sash with the colors of the Venezuela flag . The uniform also included a fictional seal designed by Schur , which included an image of Chavez , machine guns , an oil tower , a lion and a parrot . 
 Schur said of the episode 's plot , " They 're very confused because in Venezuela the government is so powerful ; their parks department travels with military escorts and motorcades and stuff . They have all the money in the world because of their oil and they ( don 't understand ) why Pawnee 's parks department is so <unk> @-@ <unk> . " A fan of Parks and Recreation since its inception , Armisen said he laughed as soon as he read the script , and found it even funnier during the table read with the cast . After working with Armisen , Rashida Jones described him as " one of the funniest people on the planet " . 
 Within a week of the episode 's original broadcast , three deleted scenes from " Sister City " were made available on the official Parks and Recreation website . In the first 100 @-@ second clip , Ron talks about his hatred for socialism , and Raul says he fears Ron because of his mustache , which he said makes him " cower in fear " ( repeatedly saying the word ' mustache ' ) . In the second minute @-@ long clip , Raul discusses the medals he received for his parks @-@ related accomplishments , including " doing away with people making speeches in the parks " , " organizing the garbage so it 's not all over the place " and " looking at the leaves " . In the third 100 @-@ second clip , Raul and the Venezuelans question why Leslie does not have a giant oil painting of herself in her office . After his final argument with Leslie , Tom refuses to follow Raul 's orders to open the door for him , and Raul has trouble opening it because " it 's been a while since I 've done this " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 " Sister City " largely portrayed Chavez and his socialist ideology in a negative light . The script portrays the Venezuelans as belittling and contemptuous toward Americans . They repeatedly claim Pawnee and the United States are inferior compared to the power and splendor they are accustomed to in Venezuela . Their negative attitude toward Americans is particularly demonstrated by the name of their delegation , the Committee to Humiliate and Shame America , as well as the line from one of the delegates , " This is not personal . We just think you are weak and your city is disgusting . " 
 While discussing how many television channels he gets in Venezuela , Raul said he already knows who wins Project Runway , a fashion design reality television show on the Bravo network . In trying to maintain composure in the face of insults from the Venezuelans , Leslie said she was following the example of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , of whom she said , " Nobody takes a punch like her . She 's the strongest , smartest punching bag in the world . " Raul says his city is also a sister city to Kaesong , North Korea , which he said is " far nicer " than Pawnee .

 In its original American broadcast on October 15 , 2009 , " Sister City " was seen by 4 @.@ 69 million household viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research . It was a drop from the previous week 's episode , " Practice Date " . " Sister City " received a 2 @.@ 0 rating / 6 share among viewers aged between 18 and 49 . The episode received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly writer Henning Fog said " Sister City " continued a trend of excellence in the second season that has established Parks and Recreation as NBC 's best comedy . Fog said the episode also further expanded its characters , by showing Leslie is not a complete pushover and Tom is a kind person . 
 Salon.com writer Heather Havrilesky called the episode an " instant classic " , and particularly praised the guest performance of Fred Armisen . She said the episode " benefits from the show 's writers ' increasing habit of giving everything from political scandals to lame local events the Onion treatment " . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said it was " another strong one " , and said the Leslie character is growing less clueless and more three @-@ dimensional . Robert Philpot of the Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram said he believed the show still too closely resembled The Office , but that " Sister City " " showed that Parks and Recreation can equal The Office for comic discomfort " . Fowler of IGN said the anti @-@ American sentiment demonstrated by the Venezuelan delegation " was a funny twist that didn 't completely wear itself out , although it came close " . Fowler particularly praised Armisen , who he said risked overshadowing the regular cast , and the sardonic comedy of Plaza . Not all reviews were positive . The A.V. Club writer Leonard Pierce , who said he felt the second season had been excellent so far , described " Sister City " as " easily the weakest episode of the season , maybe the series " . Pierce called the political overtones " ham @-@ handed " , the humor was too over @-@ the @-@ top , and the episode suffered from the absence of most of the supporting cast .

 = Russian monitor Admiral Spiridov = 
 The Russian monitor Admiral Spiridov was the name ship of her class of monitors built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the late 1860s . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and remained there for her entire career . Aside from an accidental collision her service was uneventful . The sister ships were reclassified as coast @-@ defense ironclads in 1892 before they became training ships in 1900 . Admiral Spiridov was stricken from the Navy List in 1907 and became a coal @-@ storage barge . Her ultimate fate is unknown . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Admiral Spiridov @-@ class monitors were significantly larger than their predecessors , the Charodeika class , and were 254 feet ( 77 @.@ 4 m ) long at the waterline . They had a beam of 43 feet ( 13 @.@ 1 m ) and a maximum draft of 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) . The ships were designed to displace 3 @,@ 196 long tons ( 3 @,@ 247 t ) , but turned out to be overweight and actually displaced 3 @,@ 505 to 3 @,@ 587 long tons ( 3 @,@ 561 to 3 @,@ 645 t ) . Their crew consisted of 280 officers and crewmen . The Admiral Spiridov class had a single two @-@ cylinder horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine , which drove a single propeller using steam provided by four rectangular fire @-@ tube boilers . The engine was designed to produce a total of 2 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 500 kW ) , which gave the ship a speed of 9 @.@ 1 knots ( 16 @.@ 9 km / h ; 10 @.@ 5 mph ) from 2 @,@ 060 ihp ( 1 @,@ 540 kW ) when she ran her initial sea trials in 1871 . Two years later , Admiral Spiridov ran them again , this time reaching 10 @.@ 2 knots ( 18 @.@ 9 km / h ; 11 @.@ 7 mph ) . The ship carried 280 long tons ( 280 t ) of coal which gave her a range of 1 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 600 km ; 1 @,@ 600 mi ) at full speed . She was fitted with three masts in a light fore @-@ and @-@ aft rig to steady her and aid in maneuvering . 
 The monitors were ultimately designed to be armed with four Obukhov 9 @-@ inch rifled guns , a pair in each turret . In 1874 – 75 the guns were replaced by a single 11 @-@ inch ( 279 mm ) gun . During the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 78 , a 9 @-@ inch mortar was fitted to attack the thin deck armor of enemy ships , but accuracy was poor and they were later removed , probably in the early 1880s . Admiral Spiridov retained her original guns until 1902 , although a more powerful 11 @-@ inch gun may have been installed after that date . Light guns for use against torpedo boats were added to the Admiral Spiridov @-@ class ships during the Russo @-@ Turkish War when a pair of 4 @-@ pounder 3 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 86 mm ) guns were mounted on the roofs of each gun turret . A variety of other small guns are known to have been fitted , but details are lacking . The ships could also carry 12 to 15 mines . 
 The hull of the Admiral Spiridov @-@ class monitors was completely covered by wrought @-@ iron armor that was 5 @.@ 5 to 6 @.@ 5 inches ( 140 to 165 mm ) thick amidships and thinned to 3 @.@ 25 inches ( 83 mm ) aft and 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 89 mm ) forward of the main belt . The turrets had 6 inches of armor , except around the gun ports , where it thickened to 6 @.@ 5 inches . The conning tower was 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and the deck armor was in two layers with a total thickness of 1 inch . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Admiral Spiridov , named for Admiral Grigory Spiridov , was ordered on 4 June 1865 from the Semiannikov & Poletika Shipyard , Saint Petersburg , although the formal keel @-@ laying was not until 20 November 1866 . Construction was delayed by changes to the design and late deliveries of components . She was launched on 28 August 1868 and then transferred to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep @-@ draft ships from being completed . This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships , and she officially entered service in 1869 at the cost of 1 @,@ 177 @,@ 500 rubles . 
 The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion , but she was not fully equipped until around 1872 and her trials continued until 1873 . Admiral Spiridov accidentally rammed the monitor Admiral Lazarev in Kronstadt harbor in 1871 , but was only slightly damaged . Steam @-@ powered steering gear was installed in the ship in 1887 and she was reclassified as a coast @-@ defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 . By this time , her role in Russian war plans was to defend the Gulf of Riga against an anticipated German amphibious landing . In 1900 , Admiral Spiridov was assigned to the Kronstadt Engineering School as a training ship . She was transferred to the Port of Kronstadt on 31 March 1907 for disposal . The ship was stricken on 14 August and Admiral Spiridov became a stationary coal @-@ storage barge . Her subsequent fate is unknown . One source suggests that she and her sister Admiral Chichagov , and the two Admiral Lazarev @-@ class monitors , were used as floating piers for the railroad bridge over the <unk> River during the construction of the Saint Petersburg – Murmansk Railroad in 1916 before being scrapped in the 1920s . 
 = Elizabeth Canning = 
 Elizabeth Canning ( married name Treat ; 17 September 1734 – June 1773 ) was an English maidservant who claimed to have been kidnapped and held against her will in a hayloft for almost a month . She ultimately became central to one of the most famous English criminal mysteries of the 18th century . 
 She disappeared on 1 January 1753 , before returning almost a month later to her mother 's home in Aldermanbury in the City of London , emaciated and in a " deplorable condition " . After being questioned by concerned friends and neighbours she was interviewed by the local alderman , who then issued an arrest warrant for Susannah Wells , the woman who occupied the house in which Canning was supposed to have been held . At Wells ' house in Enfield Wash , Canning identified Mary Squires as another of her captors , prompting the arrest and detention of both Wells and Squires . London magistrate Henry Fielding became involved in the case , taking Canning 's side . Further arrests were made and several witness statements were taken , and Wells and Squires were ultimately tried and found guilty — Squires of the more serious and potentially capital charge of theft . 
 However , Crisp Gascoyne , trial judge and Lord Mayor of London , was unhappy with the verdict and began his own investigation . He spoke with witnesses whose testimony implied that Squires and her family could not have abducted Canning , and he interviewed several of the prosecution 's witnesses , some of whom recanted their earlier testimony . He ordered Canning 's arrest , following which she was tried and found guilty of perjury . Squires was pardoned , and Canning sentenced to one month 's imprisonment and seven years of transportation . 
 Canning 's case pitted two groups of believers against one another : the pro @-@ Canning " Canningites " , and the pro @-@ Squires " Egyptians " . Gascoyne was openly abused and attacked in the street , while interested authors waged a fierce war of words over the fate of the young , often implacable maid . She died in Wethersfield , Connecticut , in 1773 , but the mystery surrounding her disappearance remains unsolved .

 Canning was born on 17 September 1734 in the City of London , the eldest of five surviving children born to William ( a carpenter ) and Elizabeth Canning . The family lived in two rooms in Aldermanbury Postern ( a northern extension of Aldermanbury that formerly ran from a postern gate on London Wall to Fore Street ; it no longer exists ) in London . Aldermanbury was a respectable but not particularly wealthy neighbourhood . Canning was born into poverty . Her father died in 1751 and her mother and four siblings shared a two @-@ room property with James Lord , an apprentice . Lord occupied the building 's front room , while Canning 's family lived in the back room . Her schooling was limited to only a few months at a writing school , and aged 15 or 16 she worked as a maidservant in the household of nearby publican John Wintlebury , who considered her an honest but shy girl . From October 1752 she lived at the neighbouring home of a carpenter Edward Lyon , who shared Wintlebury 's opinion of the young maidservant . Canning was described as a plump 18 @-@ year @-@ old , about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) tall with a face pitted by smallpox , a long , straight nose , and wide @-@ set eyes .

 Canning disappeared on 1 January 1753 . With no work that day , she spent time with her family and made plans to go shopping with her mother after visiting her aunt and uncle ( Alice and Thomas Colley ) , but changed her mind and instead remained with them for the evening . At about 9 pm , accompanied by her aunt and uncle for about two @-@ thirds of the journey , she left to return to her lodgings in Aldermanbury . 
 When she failed to return to her lodgings at Edward Lyon 's house , her employer twice went looking for her at her mother 's home . Mrs Canning sent her other three children to Moorfields to search for her , while James Lord went to the <unk> , who told him that they had left Elizabeth at about 9 : 30 pm near Aldgate church in Houndsditch . The next morning Mrs Canning also travelled to the <unk> ' house , but to no avail , as Elizabeth was still missing . Neighbours were asked if they knew of her whereabouts , and weeks passed as Mrs Canning searched the neighbourhood for her daughter , while her relatives scoured the city . An advertisement was placed in the newspapers , prayers were read aloud in churches and meeting houses , but other than a report of a " woman 's shriek " from a hackney coach on 1 January , no clues were found as to Elizabeth 's disappearance . 
 = = = Reappearance = = = 
 Canning reappeared at about 10 pm on 29 January 1753 . At the sight of her daughter , whom she had not seen for almost a month , Elizabeth Canning fainted . Once recovered she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours , and inside only a few minutes the house was full . Elizabeth was described as being in a " deplorable condition " ; her face and hands were black with dirt , she wore a shift , a petticoat , and a <unk> . A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear . According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital . They had partially stripped her , robbed her and hit her in the temple , rendering her unconscious . She awoke " by a large road , where was water , with the two men that robbed me " and was forced to walk to a house , where an old woman asked if she would " go their way " ( become a prostitute ) . Canning had refused , and the woman cut off her corset , slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft . There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month , with no visitors and existing only on bread and water . The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft . Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five @-@ hour journey home . She recalled hearing the name " Wills or Wells " , and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised , thought she had been held on the Hertford Road . On this evidence , John Wintlebury and a local journeyman , Robert Scarrat , identified the house as that of " Mother " Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash , nearly 10 miles ( 16 km ) distant . 
 Her reappearance and subsequent explanation ( including the assumption that she had been held at Wells 's house ) were the following day printed in the London Daily Advertiser . She was visited by the apothecary , but with her pulse faint , and so weak she could scarcely speak , she vomited up the medicine he gave her . He administered several <unk> until satisfied with the results , following which Canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to the Guildhall to see Alderman Thomas Chitty , to ask that he issue a warrant for Wells 's arrest . 
 = = = = Enfield Wash = = = = 
 Chitty issued the warrant and on 1 February Canning 's friends took her to Enfield Wash . Despite her poor physical condition Canning 's supporters wanted her to identify her captors and the room she claimed to have been held in , and worried she might die before then , took the risk of moving her . Wintlebury , Scarrat and Joseph Adamson ( a neighbour ) were the first to arrive , on horseback . They met the warrant officer and several peace officers , and waited for Susannah Wells to appear . Wells 's house had served a variety of functions , including that of a carpenter 's shop , a butchers and an ale @-@ house . The old woman kept animals in the house and occasionally had lodgers . She had twice been widowed ; her first husband was a carpenter and her second had been hanged for theft . She had also been imprisoned in 1736 for perjury . Sarah Howit , her daughter by her first husband , had lived there for about two years . Howit 's brother John was a carpenter like his father , and lived nearby . 
 When at about 9 am Wells entered her house , the officers immediately moved to secure the building . Inside they found Wells , an old woman named Mary Squires , her children , Virtue Hall and a woman they supposed was Wells 's daughter . Another woman , Judith Natus , was brought down from the loft to be questioned with the rest . The warrant officer who searched the loft was surprised when he discovered that it did not resemble the room described by Canning , and nor could he find evidence of her having jumped from the window . The rest of the party , who had by then arrived in a hired coach and chaise , were similarly surprised . 
 Canning , who had arrived in the chaise with her mother and two other people , was carried into the house by Adamson . There she identified Mary Squires as the woman who had cut off her stays , and claimed that Virtue Hall and a woman presumed to be Squires 's daughter had been present at the time . Canning was then taken upstairs where she identified the loft as the room in which she had been imprisoned — although it contained more hay than she recalled . Boards covering the window appeared to have only recently been fastened there . With such damning evidence against them , the suspects were taken to a nearby justice of the peace , Merry <unk> , who examined Canning alone , and then those from Wells 's house . Squires and Wells were committed , the former for removing Canning 's stays and the latter for " keeping a disorderly House " . George Squires and Virtue Hall , who both denied any involvement in the kidnapping , were set free ; Canning and her supporters were allowed home .

 Assault in 18th @-@ century England was viewed by the authorities not as a breach of the peace , but rather as a civil action between two parties in dispute . The onus therefore was on Canning to take legal action against those she claimed had imprisoned her , and she would also be responsible for investigating the crime . This was an expensive proposition and she would therefore require the help of her friends and neighbours to pursue her case . An additional complication was that rather than send such matters to trial , justices preferred to reconcile the parties concerned . Therefore , although it was the state in which she returned to them on 29 January which most offended Canning 's friends , it was the theft of her stays — valued then at about 10 shillings — that was the most promising aspect of the case . The theft could be tried under a capital statute , making the assault charge less worthy of legal attention . 
 While Canning 's medical treatment continued , her supporters , mostly men , prepared the case against Squires and Wells . They took legal advice from a solicitor , a Mr Salt , who advised them to consult the Magistrate and author Henry Fielding . Fielding was 45 years old , and after years of arguments with other Grub Street authors and a lifetime of drink , was approaching the end of his life . Since " taking the sacrament " four years earlier and becoming a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and Westminster , he had , with " volcanic energy " , concerned himself with the activities of criminals . In December 1751 he had published Amelia , a story of a young woman dragged into vice and folly by her abusive husband . Although the book was poorly received , with his experience of criminology Fielding believed he understood the depths to which humans could descend . Thus when Salt divulged the case to him on 6 February Fielding 's curiosity was piqued , and he agreed to take Canning 's sworn testimony the next day . Although Fielding was disinclined to believe a simple servant @-@ girl he was impressed with her modesty and genteel manner , and issued a warrant against all the occupants of Wells 's house , " that they might appear before me , [ and ] give Security for their good Behaviour " . Virtue Hall and Judith Natus were thus seized , but George Squires , his sisters , and Wells 's daughter Sarah Howit , had by then left the house and remained at large . 
 = = = = Early press reports = = = = 
 The London Daily Advertiser , a Grub Street publication , reported on 10 February : 
 The house of that notorious woman well known by the name of Mother Wells , between Enfield Wash and Waltham Cross , was immediately suspected ; and from many Circumstances appears to be the dismal Prison of the unhappy sufferer , whose melancholy Situation since her miraculous Escape is worthy of Compassion and Charitable contributions of all public @-@ spirited people , and anyone who has any regard for the Safety of their Children and Relations , who are equally liable to the same inhuman and cruel Usage ... all these circumstances being duly considered , it is not doubted but a Subscription or Contribution will soon be raised , to enable the Persons who have undertaken to detect this notorious Gang to prosecute their good Intentions with the utmost <unk> , as such a nest of Villains is of the greatest Danger to the Safety of his Majesty 's good Subjects . 
 Meanwhile Canning 's supporters were soliciting donations through the Case of Elizabeth Canning , an independently printed pamphlet designed to raise support for the prosecution of her captors . In the Case of Wells was clearly identified as " that Monster of a Woman " , and in an edited version which appeared a week later in the Public Advertiser it was revealed that Canning had suffered a fit after being struck on the head . Squires was called an " old Gypsy Woman " , who " robbed the girl of her stays ; and then in a miserable naked Condition , because she would not become a common Prostitute , confined her in an old Back Room or loft " . Although Squires was often referred to as a gypsy this identification had , on occasion , been called into question . Being named a gypsy could carry certain legal penalties and although these were rarely applied , gypsies were nevertheless treated as pariahs . Moore ( 1994 ) described Squires as a " dark , tall , but stooping , elderly woman , with an estimated age ranging from sixty to eighty , sometimes depicted as exceptionally hearty " , continuing " all accounts do agree that she was an exceptionally ugly woman , with a very large nose and a lower lip swollen and disfigured by scrofula .
