 Walton was never a facile or quick composer , and in his final decade , he found composition increasingly difficult . He repeatedly tried to compose a third symphony for André Previn , but eventually abandoned it . Many of his final works are re @-@ orchestrations or revisions of earlier music . He orchestrated his song cycle Anon. in Love ( originally for tenor and guitar ) , and at the request of Neville Marriner adapted his A minor String Quartet as a Sonata for Strings . One original work from this period was his Jubilate Deo , premiered as one of several events to celebrate his seventieth birthday . The British prime minister , Edward Heath , gave a birthday dinner for Walton at 10 Downing Street , attended by royalty and Walton 's most eminent colleagues ; Britten presented a Walton evening at Aldeburgh and Previn conducted an all @-@ Walton concert at the Royal Festival Hall . 
 Walton revised the score of Troilus and Cressida , and the opera was staged at Covent Garden in 1976 . Once again it was plagued by misfortune while in preparation . Walton was in poor health ; Previn , who was to conduct , also fell ill ; and the tenor chosen for Troilus pulled out . As in 1954 , the critics were generally tepid . Some of Walton 's final artistic endeavours were in collaboration with the film @-@ maker Tony Palmer . Walton took part in Palmer 's profile of him , At the Haunted End of the Day , in 1981 , and in 1982 Walton and his wife played the cameo roles of King Frederick Augustus and Queen Maria of Saxony in Palmer 's nine @-@ hour film Wagner . 
 Walton died at La Mortella on 8 March 1983 , at the age of 80 . His ashes were buried on Ischia , and a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey , where a commemorative stone to Walton was unveiled near those to Elgar and Britten . 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 In 1944 , it was said of Walton that he summed up the recent past of English music and <unk> its future . Later writers have concluded that Walton had little influence on the next generation of composers . In his later years , Walton formed friendships with younger composers including Hans Werner Henze and Malcolm Arnold , but although he admired their work , he did not influence their compositional styles . Throughout his life , Walton held no posts at music conservatoires ; he had no pupils , gave no lectures and wrote no essays . After his death , the Walton Trust , inspired by Susana Walton , has run arts education projects , promoted British music and held annual summer masterclasses on Ischia for gifted young musicians . 
 = = Music = = 
 Walton was a slow worker . Both during composition and afterwards he would continually revise his music ; he said , " Without an india @-@ rubber I was absolutely sunk . " Consequently , his total body of work from his sixty @-@ year career as a composer is not large . Between the first performance of Façade in 1923 , for example , and that of the Sinfonia Concertante in 1928 , he averaged only one small piece a year . Of his work as a whole , Byron Adams in Grove 's Dictionary of Music and Musicians writes : 
 Walton 's music has often been too neatly dismissed by a few descriptive tags : " bittersweet " , " nostalgic " and , after World War II , " same as before " . Such convenient categorizations ignore the expressive variety of his music and slight his determination to deepen his technical and expressive resources as he grew older . His early discovery of the basic elements of his style allowed him to assimilate successfully an astonishing number of disparate and apparently contradictory influences , such as Anglican anthems , jazz , and the music of Stravinsky , Sibelius , Ravel and Elgar . 
 The writer adds that Walton 's allegiance to his basic style never wavered and that this loyalty to his own vision , together with his rhythmic vitality , sensuous melancholy , sly charm and orchestral flair , gives Walton 's finest music " an imperishable glamour " . Another biographer of Walton , Neil Tierney , writes that although contemporary critics felt that the post @-@ war music did not match Walton 's pre @-@ war compositions , it has become clear that the later works are " if emotionally less direct , more profound . "

 Walton 's first work for full orchestra , Portsmouth Point ( 1925 ) , inspired by a Rowlandson print of the same name , depicts a rumbustious dockside scene ( in Kennedy 's phrase , " the sailors of H.M.S. Pinafore have had a night on the tiles " ) in a fast moving score full of syncopation and cross @-@ rhythm that for years proved hazardous for conductors and orchestras alike . Throughout his career , Walton wrote works in this pattern , such as the lively Comedy Overture <unk> , a virtuoso piece commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra , described by The Musical Times as " an ingenious blending of fragments in exhilarating profusion . " Walton 's post @-@ war works in this genre are the Johannesburg Festival Overture ( 1956 ) , the " diverting but hard @-@ edged Capriccio <unk> " ( 1968 ) , and the longer Partita ( 1957 ) , written for the Cleveland Orchestra , described by Grove as " an impressively concentrated score with a high @-@ spirited finale [ with ] steely counterpoint and orchestral virtuosity " . Walton 's shorter pieces also include two tributes to musical colleagues , Variations on a Theme by Hindemith ( 1963 ) and the Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten ( 1969 ) , in both of which the source material is gradually transformed as Walton 's own voice becomes more prominent . The critic Hugh Ottaway commented that in both pieces " the interaction of two musical personalities is … fascinating " . 
 = = = = Concertos and symphonies = = = = 
 Walton 's first successful large @-@ scale concert work , the Viola Concerto ( 1929 ) is in marked contrast to the raucous Portsmouth Point ; despite the common influence of jazz and of the music of Hindemith and Ravel , in its structure and romantic longing it owes much to the Elgar Cello Concerto . In this work , wrote Edward Sackville @-@ West and Desmond Shawe @-@ Taylor in The Record Guide , " the lyric poet in Walton , who had so far been hidden under a mask of irony , fully emerged . " Walton followed this pattern in his two subsequent concertos , for Violin ( 1937 ) and for Cello ( 1956 ) . Each opens <unk> , is in three movements , and contrasts agitated and jagged passages with warmer romantic sections . The Cello Concerto is more introspective than the two earlier concertos , with a ticking rhythm throughout the work suggesting the inexorable passage of time . 
 The two symphonies are strongly contrasted with one another . The First is on a large scale , reminiscent at times of Sibelius . Grove says of the work that its " orgiastic power , coruscating malice , sensuous desolation and extroverted swagger " make the symphony a tribute to Walton 's tenacity and inventive facility . Critics have always differed on whether the finale lives up to the rest of the work . In comparison with the First , the Second Symphony struck many reviewers as lightweight , and , as with many of Walton 's works of the 1950s , it was regarded as old fashioned . It is a very different kind of work from the First Symphony . David Cox describes it as " more a divertimento than a symphony ... highly personal , unmistakably Walton throughout " , and Kennedy calls it " somewhat enigmatic in mood , and a superb example of Walton 's more mature , concise , and mellow post @-@ 1945 style . " 
 = = = = Music for ballets , plays and films = = = = 
 Although generally a slow and perfectionist composer , Walton was capable of working quickly when necessary . Some of his stage and screen music was written to tight deadlines . He regarded his ballet and incidental music as of less importance than his concert works and was generally dismissive of what he produced . Of his ballets for Sadler 's Wells , The Wise Virgins ( 1940 ) is an arrangement of eight extracts from choral and instrumental music by Bach . The Quest ( 1943 ) , written in great haste , is , according to Grove , oddly reminiscent of Vaughan Williams . Neither of these works established itself in the regular repertoire , unlike the ballet score Walton arranged from the music of Façade , the music for which was expanded for full orchestra , still retaining the jazz influences and the iconoclastic wit of the original . Music from The Quest and the whole of the Viola Concerto were used for another Sadler 's Wells ballet , O.W. , in 1972 . 
 Walton wrote little incidental music for the theatre , his music for Macbeth ( 1942 ) being one of his most notable contributions to the genre . For the cinema he wrote the music for 13 films between 1934 and 1969 . He arranged the Spitfire Prelude and Fugue from his own score for The First of the Few ( 1942 ) , and he allowed suites to be arranged from his Shakespeare film scores of the 1940s and 1950s . In these films , Walton mixed Elizabethan pastiche with wholly characteristic <unk> music . Kennedy singles out for praise the Agincourt battle sequence in Henry V , where Walton 's music makes the charge of the French knights " <unk> real . " Despite Walton 's view that film music is ineffective when performed out of context , suites from several more of his film scores have been put together since his death . 
 = = = Opera = = = 
 Walton worked for many years on his only full @-@ length opera , Troilus and Cressida , both before its premiere and afterwards . It has never been regarded as a success . The libretto is generally considered weak , and Walton 's music , despite many passages that have won critical praise , is not dramatic enough to sustain interest . Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth @-@ century Italian opera in a post @-@ war era wary of heroic Romanticism . 
 Walton 's only other opera , The Bear , based on a comic vaudeville by Chekhov , is judged by critics as much more successful . It is , however , a one @-@ act piece , a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses , and so is infrequently seen . Operabase records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015 . 
 = = = Chamber works = = = 
 Apart from an early experiment in <unk> in his String Quartet ( 1919 – 22 ) , which he later described as " full of undigested Bartók and Schoenberg " , Walton 's major essays in chamber music are his String Quartet in A Minor ( 1945 – 46 ) and the Sonata for Violin and Piano ( 1947 – 49 ) . In the opinion of Adams in Grove 's Dictionary , the quartet is one of Walton 's supreme achievements . Earlier critics did not always share this view . In 1956 The Record Guide said , " [ T ] he material is not first class and the composition as a whole seems laboured . " The work exists also in its later expanded form as the Sonata for Strings ( 1971 ) , which , the critic Trevor Harvey wrote , combines Walton in his most energetically rhythmic mood with a " vein of lyrical tenderness which is equally characteristic and is so rewarding to listen to " . The Violin Sonata is in two closely related movements , with strong thematic material in common . The first movement is nostalgically lyrical , the second a set of variations , each one a semitone higher than its predecessor . Walton briefly refers back to Schoenberg with a dodecaphonic passage in the second movement , but otherwise the sonata is firmly tonal . 
 = = = Choral and other vocal music = = = 
 Walton 's liturgical compositions include the Coronation Te Deum ( 1952 ) , Missa brevis ( 1966 ) , Jubilate Deo ( 1972 ) , and Magnificat and Nunc dimittis ( 1974 ) , and the anthems A Litany ( 1916 ) and Set me as a seal upon thy heart ( 1938 ) . 
 One of the best @-@ known and most frequently performed of Walton 's works is the cantata Belshazzar 's Feast . Written for large orchestra , chorus and baritone soloist , it intersperses a choral and orchestral depiction of Babylonian excess and depravity , barbaric jazzy outbursts , and the lamentations and finally the rejoicing of the Jewish captives . The " couple of brass bands " added at Beecham 's suggestion to an already large orchestra each consist of three trumpets , three trombones and a tuba . Many critics judged it the most important English choral work since Elgar 's The Dream of Gerontius in 1900 . None of Walton 's later choral works have matched its popularity . They include In Honour of the City of London ( 1937 ) and a Gloria ( 1960 – 61 ) composed for the 125th anniversary of the Huddersfield Choral Society . 
 = = = Recordings = = = 
 From the days of 78 rpm discs , when relatively little modern music was being put on record , Walton was favoured by the record companies . In 1929 the small , new Decca company recorded eleven movements from Façade , with the composer conducting a chamber ensemble , with the speakers Edith Sitwell and Walton 's friend and colleague Constant Lambert . In the 1930s , Walton also had two of his major orchestral works on disc , both on Decca , the First Symphony recorded by Harty and the London Symphony Orchestra , and the Viola Concerto with Frederick Riddle and the LSO conducted by the composer . In the 1940s Walton moved from Decca to its older , larger rival , EMI . The EMI producer Walter Legge arranged a series of recordings of Walton 's major works and many minor ones over the next twenty years ; a rival composer expressed the view that if Walton had an attack of flatulence ( he used an earthier expression ) , Walter Legge would record it . 
 Walton himself , although a reluctant conductor , conducted many of the EMI recordings , and some for other labels . He made studio recordings of the First Symphony , the Viola Concerto , the Violin Concerto , the Sinfonia Concertante , the Façade Suites , the Partita , Belshazzar 's Feast , and suites from his film scores for Shakespeare plays and The First of the Few . Some live performances conducted by Walton were recorded and have been released on compact disc , including the Cello Concerto and the Coronation Te Deum . 
 Almost all Walton 's works have been recorded for commercial release . EMI published a " Walton Edition " of his major works on CD in the 1990s , and the recording of the Chandos Records " Walton Edition " of his works was completed in 2010 . His best @-@ known works have been recorded by performers from many countries . Among the frequently recorded are Belshazzar 's Feast , the Viola and Violin Concertos and the First Symphony , which has had more than twenty recordings since Harty 's 1936 set .

 " Always Mine " is a song by American Tejano pop recording artist Selena . Her brother and music producer A.B. Quintanilla wrote the song for her sixth LP record Dulce Amor ( 1988 ) . The song 's lyrics are about teenage love while dealing with negative peer pressure from friends . " Always Mine " was the third single from the album . The original version found on Dulce Amor is more Latin pop . It was released as a maxi single for Anthology ( 1998 ) . The version found on Anthology was remixed with freestyle music and electronic dance music . The song received generally positive reviews from music critics .

 " Always Mine " was released as a 12 " single , becoming the third single from Dulce Amor in 1988 . " Always Mine " is an uptempo Latin pop song that has influences of freestyle and electronic dance music . It is written in the key of B minor with 100 beats per minute . " Always Mine " ' s lyrics are about teenage love and facing negative peer pressure from friends who taunt Selena on ending her happy relationship . 
 The song opens with the hi @-@ hat and drums playing at the same time to make an uptempo beat . When Selena sings the first verse of the song , the electric piano begins playing . In the opening part of " Always Mine " , Selena sings that all her friends are telling her that she is a fool for liking a guy , and that she should give up on him . She then sings that many times she have indeed tried , however , because she is in love she can 't go through with it . After the first melody of " Always Mine " , Selena sings the second verse of the song . She sings that she had spent some time trying to think of her relationship and her friends ' comments towards the relationship . However , she continues to sing that she always ends up wanting to be with him . After this , Selena sings in Spanish " Como una <unk> que <unk> el agua / sin tu amor / se <unk> mi alma " ( English : Just like a flower that needs water , without your love , I have an empty soul ) . After the second melody part , Selena sings the chorus : " You will always be / always mine / be mine ' till the end of time / always mine " .

 Fustat ( also <unk> , Al Fustat , Misr al @-@ Fustat and Fustat @-@ Misr , and in Arabic : <unk> , al @-@ <unk> , Coptic : <unk> ) , was the first capital of Egypt under Muslim rule . It was built by the Muslim general ' Amr ibn al- ' As immediately after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in AD 641 , and featured the Mosque of Amr , the first mosque built in Egypt and in all of Africa . 
 The city reached its peak in the 12th century , with a population of approximately 200 @,@ 000 . It was the center of administrative power in Egypt , until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier , Shawar , to keep its wealth out of the hands of the invading Crusaders . The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo , which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph . The area fell into disrepair for hundreds of years and was used as a garbage dump . 
 Today , Fustat is part of Old Cairo , with few buildings remaining from its days as a capital . Many archaeological digs have revealed the wealth of buried material in the area . Many ancient items recovered from the site are on display in Cairo 's Museum of Islamic Art . 
 = = Egyptian capital = = 
 Fustat was the capital of Egypt for approximately 500 years . After the city 's founding in 641 , its authority was uninterrupted until 750 , when the Abbasid dynasty staged a revolt against the Umayyads . This conflict was focused not in Egypt , but elsewhere in the Arab world . When the Abbasids gained power , they moved various capitals to more controllable areas . They had established the center of their caliphate in Baghdad , moving the capital from its previous location of Damascus . Similar moves were made throughout the new dynasty . In Egypt , they moved the capital from Fustat slightly north to the Abbasid city of al @-@ Askar , which remained the capital until 868 . When the Tulunid dynasty took control in 868 , the Egyptian capital moved briefly to another nearby northern city , Al @-@ Qatta 'i . This lasted only until 905 , when Al @-@ Qatta 'i was destroyed and the capital was returned to Fustat . The city again lost its status as capital city when its own vizier , Shawar , ordered its burning in 1168 . The capital of Egypt was ultimately moved to Cairo . 
 = = Origin of name = = 
 According to legend , the location of Fustat was chosen by a bird : A dove laid an egg in the tent of ' Amr ibn al- ' As ( 585 – 664 ) , the Muslim conqueror of Egypt , just before he was to march against Alexandria in 646 . His camp at that time was just north of the Roman fortress of Babylon . Amr declared the dove 's nest as a sign from God , and the tent was left untouched as he and his troops went off to battle . When they returned victorious , Amr told his soldiers to pitch their tents around his , giving his new capital city its name , Miṣr al @-@ Fusṭāṭ , or Fusṭāṭ Miṣr , popularly translated as " City of the tents " , though this is not an exact translation . 
 The word Miṣr was an ancient Semitic root designating Egypt , but in Arabic also has the meaning of a large city or metropolis ( or , as a verb , " to civilize " ) , so the name Miṣr al @-@ Fusṭāṭ could mean " Metropolis of the Tent " . Fusṭāṭ Miṣr would mean " The Pavilion of Egypt " . Egyptians to this day call Cairo " Miṣr " , or , colloquially , <unk> , even though this is properly the name of the whole country of Egypt . The country 's first mosque , the Mosque of Amr , was later built in 642 on the same site of the commander 's tent . 
 = = Early history = = 
 For thousands of years , the capital of Egypt was moved with different cultures through multiple locations up and down the Nile , such as Thebes and Memphis , depending on which dynasty was in power . After Alexander the Great conquered Egypt around 331 BC , the capital became the city named for him , Alexandria , on the Mediterranean coast . This situation remained stable for nearly a thousand years . After the army of the Arabian Caliph Umar captured the region in the 7th century , shortly after the death of Muhammad , he wanted to establish a new capital . When Alexandria fell in September 641 , Amr ibn al @-@ As , the commander of the conquering army , founded a new capital on the eastern bank of the river . 
 The early population of the city was composed almost entirely of soldiers and their families , and the layout of the city was similar to that of a garrison . Amr intended for Fustat to serve as a base from which to conquer North Africa , as well as to launch further campaigns against Byzantium . It remained the primary base for Arab expansion in Africa until <unk> was founded in Tunisia in 670 . 
 Fustat developed as a series of tribal areas , <unk> , around the central mosque and administrative buildings . The majority of the settlers came from Yemen , with the next largest grouping from western Arabia , along with some Jews and Roman mercenaries . Arabic was generally the primary spoken dialect in Egypt , and was the language of written communication . Coptic was still spoken in Fustat in the 8th century . 
 Fustat was the center of power in Egypt under the Umayyad dynasty , which had started with the rule of Muawiyah I , and headed the Islamic caliphate from 660 to 750 . However , Egypt was considered only a province of larger powers , and was ruled by governors who were appointed from other Muslim centers such as Damascus , Medina , and Baghdad . Fustat was a major city , and in the 9th century , it had a population of approximately 120 @,@ 000 . But when General Gawhar of the Tunisian @-@ based Fatimids captured the region , this launched a new era when Egypt was the center of its own power . Gawhar founded a new city just north of Fustat on August 8 , 969 , naming it Al Qahira ( Cairo ) , and in 971 , the Fatimid Caliph al @-@ Mo <unk> moved his court from al @-@ Mansuriya in Tunisia to Al Qahira . But Cairo was not intended as a center of government at the time — it was used primarily as the royal enclosure for the Caliph and his court and army , while Fustat remained the capital in terms of economic and administrative power . The city thrived and grew , and in 987 , the geographer Ibn <unk> wrote that al @-@ Fustat was approximately one third the size of Baghdad . By 1168 , it had a population of 200 @,@ 000 . 
 The city was known for its prosperity , with shaded streets , gardens , and markets . It contained high @-@ rise residential buildings , some seven storeys tall , which could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people . Al @-@ Muqaddasi in the 10th century described them as Minarets , while Nasir Khusraw in the early 11th century described some of them rising up to 14 stories , with roof gardens on the top storey complete with ox @-@ drawn water wheels for irrigation . 
 The Persian traveler , Nasir @-@ i @-@ <unk> , wrote of the exotic and beautiful wares in the Fustat markets : iridescent pottery , crystal , and many fruits and flowers , even during the winter months . From 975 to 1075 , Fustat was a major production centre for Islamic art and ceramics , and one of the wealthiest cities in the world . One report stated that it paid taxes that were equivalent to US $ 150 @,@ 000 per day , to the administration of Caliph Mo <unk> . Modern archaeological digs have turned up trade artifacts from as far away as Spain , China , and Vietnam . Excavations have also revealed intricate house and street plans ; a basic unit consisted of rooms built around a central courtyard , with an arcade of arches on one side of the courtyard being the principal means of access . 
 = = Destruction and decline = = 
 In the mid @-@ 12th century , the caliph of Egypt was the teenager <unk> , but his position was primarily ceremonial . The true power in Egypt was that of the vizier , Shawar . He had been involved in extensive political intrigue for years , working to repel the advances of both the Christian Crusaders , and the forces of the Nur al @-@ Din from Syria . Shawar managed this by constantly shifting alliances between the two , playing them against each other , and in effect keeping them in a stalemate where neither army could successfully attack Egypt without being blocked by the other . 
 However , in 1168 , the Christian King Amalric I of Jerusalem , who had been trying for years to launch a successful attack on Egypt in order to expand the Crusader territories , had finally achieved a certain amount of success . He and his army entered Egypt , sacked the city of Bilbeis , slaughtered nearly all of its inhabitants , and then continued on towards Fustat . Amalric and his troops camped just south of the city , and then sent a message to the young Egyptian caliph <unk> , only 18 years old , to surrender the city or suffer the same fate as Bilbeis . 
 Seeing that Amalric 's attack was imminent , Shawar ordered Fustat city burned , to keep it out of Amalric 's hands . According to the Egyptian historian Al @-@ Maqrizi ( 1346 – 1442 ) : 
 Shawar ordered that Fustat be evacuated . He forced [ the citizens ] to leave their money and property behind and flee for their lives with their children . In the panic and chaos of the exodus , the fleeing crowd looked like a massive army of ghosts .... Some took refuge in the mosques and bathhouses ... awaiting a Christian onslaught similar to the one in Bilbeis . Shawar sent 20 @,@ 000 naphtha pots and 10 @,@ 000 lighting bombs [ mish 'al ] and distributed them throughout the city . Flames and smoke engulfed the city and rose to the sky in a terrifying scene . The blaze raged for 54 days .... 
 After the destruction of Fustat , the Syrian forces arrived and successfully repelled Amalric 's forces . Then with the Christians gone , the Syrians were able to conquer Egypt themselves . The untrustworthy Shawar was put to death , and the reign of the Fatimids was effectively over . The Syrian general Shirkuh was placed in power , but died due to ill health just a few months later , after which his nephew Saladin became vizier of Egypt on March 2 , 1169 , launching the Ayyubid dynasty . 
 With Fustat no more than a dying suburb , the center of government moved permanently to nearby Cairo . Saladin later attempted to unite Cairo and Fustat into one city by enclosing them in massive walls , although this proved to be largely unsuccessful . 
 In 1166 Maimonides went to Egypt and settled in Fustat , where he gained much renown as a physician , practising in the family of Saladin and in that of his vizier <unk> al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> , and Saladin 's successors . The title Ra 'is al @-@ Umma or al @-@ <unk> ( Head of the Nation or of the Faith ) , was bestowed upon him . In Fustat , he wrote his <unk> Torah ( 1180 ) and The Guide for the Perplexed . Some of his writings were later discovered among the manuscript fragments in the <unk> ( storeroom ) of the Ben Ezra Synagogue , located in Fustat . 
 While the Mamluks were in power from the 13th century to the 16th century , the area of Fustat was used as a rubbish dump , though it still maintained a population of thousands , with the primary crafts being those of pottery and trash @-@ collecting . The layers of garbage accumulated over hundreds of years , and gradually the population decreased , leaving what had once been a thriving city as an effective wasteland . 
 = = Modern Fustat = = 
 Today , little remains of the grandeur of the old city . The three capitals , Fustat , Al @-@ Askar and Al @-@ Qatta 'i were absorbed into the growing city of Cairo . Some of the old buildings remain visible in the region known as " Old Cairo " , but much of the rest has fallen into disrepair , overgrown with weeds or used as garbage dumps . 
 The oldest @-@ remaining building from the area is probably the Mosque of Ibn Tulun , from the 9th century , which was built while the capital was in Al @-@ Qatta 'i . The first mosque ever built in Egypt ( and by extension , the first mosque built in Africa ) , the Mosque of Amr , is still in use , but has been extensively rebuilt over the centuries , and nothing remains of the original structure . 
 It is believed that further archaeological digs could yield substantial rewards , considering that the remains of the original city are still preserved under hundreds of years of rubbish . Some archaeological excavations have taken place , the paths of streets are still visible , and some buildings have been partially reconstructed to waist @-@ height . But the site is difficult and dangerous to access because of the nearby slums . However , some artifacts that have been recovered so far can be seen in Cairo 's Museum of Islamic Art . 
 = Bal des Ardents = 
 The Bal des Ardents ( Ball of the Burning Men ) or Bal des Sauvages was a masquerade ball held on 28 January 1393 in Paris at which Charles VI of France performed in a dance with five members of the French nobility . Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator , Charles ' brother Louis , Duke of Orléans . King Charles and the remaining dancer , the noble knight Ogier de <unk> , survived . The ball was one of a number of events intended to entertain the young king , who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity . The event undermined confidence in Charles ' capacity to rule ; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility . The public 's outrage forced the king and his brother Orléans , whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery , into offering penance for the event . 
 Charles ' wife , Isabeau of Bavaria , held the ball to honor the remarriage of a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting . Scholars believe it may have been a traditional charivari , with the dancers disguised as wild men , mythical beings often associated with demonology , that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of Tudor England . The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart , and illustrated in a number of 15th @-@ century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy . The incident later provided inspiration for a scene in Edgar Allan Poe 's short story " Hop @-@ Frog " . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1380 , after the death of his father Charles V of France , the 12 @-@ year @-@ old Charles VI was crowned king , beginning his minority with his four uncles acting as regents . Within two years one of them , Philip of Burgundy , described by historian Robert Knecht as " one of the most powerful princes in Europe " , became sole regent to the young king after Louis of Anjou pillaged the royal treasury and departed to campaign in Italy ; Charles ' other two uncles , John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon , showed little interest in governing . In 1387 , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Charles assumed sole control of the monarchy and immediately dismissed his uncles and reinstated the Marmousets , his father 's traditional counselors . Unlike his uncles , the Marmousets wanted peace with England , less taxation , and a strong , responsible central government — policies that resulted in a negotiated three @-@ year truce with England , and the Duke of Berry being stripped of his post as governor of Languedoc because of his excessive taxation . 
 In 1392 Charles suffered the first in a lifelong series of attacks of insanity , manifested by an " insatiable fury " at the attempted assassination of the Constable of France and leader of the Marmousets , Olivier de Clisson — carried out by Pierre de Craon but orchestrated by John V , Duke of Brittany . Convinced that the attempt on Clisson 's life was also an act of violence against himself and the monarchy , Charles quickly planned a retaliatory invasion of Brittany with the approval of the Marmousets , and within months departed Paris with a force of knights . 
 On a hot August day outside Le Mans , accompanying his forces on the way to Brittany , without warning Charles drew his weapons and charged his own household knights including his brother Louis I , Duke of Orléans — with whom he had a close relationship — crying " Forward against the traitors ! They wish to deliver me to the enemy ! " He killed four men before his chamberlain grabbed him by the waist and subdued him , after which he fell into a coma that lasted for four days . Few believed he would recover ; his uncles , the dukes of Burgundy and Berry , took advantage of the king 's illness and quickly seized power , re @-@ established themselves as regents , and dissolved the <unk> council . 
 The comatose king was returned to Le Mans , where Guillaume de Harsigny — a venerated and well @-@ educated 92 @-@ year @-@ old physician — was summoned to treat him . After Charles regained consciousness , and his fever subsided , he was returned to Paris by Harsigny , moving slowly from castle to castle , with periods of rest in between . Late in September Charles was well enough to make a pilgrimage of thanks to Notre Dame de <unk> near Laon after which he returned again to Paris . 
 The king 's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as the result of sorcery ; modern historians such as Knecht speculate that Charles may have been experiencing the onset of paranoid schizophrenia . Charles continued to be mentally fragile , believing he was made of glass , and according to historian Desmond Seward , running " howling like a wolf down the corridors of the royal palaces " . Contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart wrote that the king 's illness was so severe that he was " far out of the way ; no medicine could help him " . During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize his wife , Isabeau of Bavaria , demanding her removal when she entered his chamber , but after his recovery Charles made arrangements for her to hold guardianship of their children . Queen Isabeau eventually became guardian to her son — the future Charles VII of France — ( b . 1403 ) , granting her great political power and ensuring a place on the council of regents in event of a relapse . 
 In A Distant Mirror : The <unk> 14th Century the historian Barbara Tuchman writes that the physician Harsigny , refusing " all pleas and offers of riches to remain " , left Paris and ordered the courtiers to shield the king from the duties of government and leadership . He told the king 's advisors to " be careful not to worry or irritate him .... Burden him with work as little as you can ; pleasure and forgetfulness will be better for him than anything else . " To surround Charles with a festive atmosphere and to protect him from the rigor of governing , the court turned to elaborate amusements and extravagant fashions . Isabeau and her sister @-@ in @-@ law Valentina Visconti , Duchess of Orléans , wore jewel @-@ laden dresses and elaborate braided hairstyles coiled into tall shells and covered with wide double <unk> that reportedly required doorways to be widened to accommodate them . 
 The common people thought the extravagances excessive yet loved their young king , whom they called Charles le bien @-@ <unk> ( the well @-@ beloved ) . Blame for unnecessary excess and expense was directed at the foreign queen , who was brought from Bavaria at the request of Charles ' uncles . Neither Isabeau nor her sister @-@ in @-@ law Valentina — daughter of the ruthless Duke of Milan — were well liked by either the court or the people . Froissart wrote in his Chronicles that Charles ' uncles were content to allow the frivolities because " so long as the Queen and the Duc d 'Orléans danced , they were not dangerous or even annoying " . 
 = = Bal des Ardents and aftermath = = 
 On 28 January 1393 , Isabeau held a masquerade at the Hôtel Saint @-@ Pol to celebrate the third marriage of her lady @-@ in @-@ waiting , Catherine de <unk> . Tuchman explains that a widow 's remarriage was traditionally an occasion for mockery and tomfoolery , often celebrated with masquerades or charivari characterized by " all sorts of licence , disguises , disorders , and loud blaring of discordant music and clanging of cymbals " . On the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay , whom Tuchman describes as well known for his " outrageous schemes " and cruelty , six high @-@ ranking knights performed a dance in costume as wood savages . The costumes , which were sewn onto the men , were made of linen soaked with resin to which flax was attached " so that they appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot " . Masks made of the same materials covered the dancers ' faces and hid their identities from the audience . Some chronicles report that the dancers were bound together by chains . Most of the audience were unaware that Charles was among the dancers . Strict orders forbade the lighting of hall torches and prohibited anyone from entering the hall with a torch during the performance , to minimize the risk of the highly flammable costumes catching fire . 
 According to historian Jan Veenstra the men <unk> and howled " like wolves " , spat obscenities and invited the audience to guess their identities while dancing in a " diabolical " frenzy . Charles ' brother Orléans arrived with Phillipe de Bar , late and drunk , and they entered the hall carrying lit torches . Accounts vary , but Orléans may have held his torch above a dancer 's mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell , setting fire to the dancer 's leg . In the 17th century , William Prynne wrote of the incident that " the Duke of <unk> ... put one of the Torches his servants held so neere the flax , that he set one of the Coates on fire , and so each of them set fire on to the other , and so they were all in a bright flame " , whereas a contemporary chronicle stated that he " threw " the torch at one of the dancers . 
 Isabeau , knowing that her husband was one of the dancers , fainted when the men caught fire . Charles , however , was standing at a distance from the other dancers , near his 15 @-@ year @-@ old aunt Joan , Duchess of Berry , who swiftly threw her voluminous skirt over him to protect him from the sparks . Sources disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the king aside to speak to him , or whether the king moved away toward the audience . Froissart wrote that " The King , who proceeded ahead of [ the dancers ] , departed from his companions ... and went to the ladies to show himself to them ... and so passed by the Queen and came near the Duchess of Berry " . 
 The scene soon descended into chaos ; the dancers shrieked in pain as they burned in their costumes , and the audience , many of them also sustaining burns , screamed as they tried to rescue the burning men . The event was chronicled in uncharacteristic vividness by the Monk of St Denis , who wrote that " four men were burned alive , their flaming genitals dropping to the floor ... releasing a stream of blood " . Only two dancers survived : the king , thanks to the quick reactions of the Duchess of Berry , and the Sieur de <unk> , who jumped into an open vat of wine and remained there until the flames were extinguished . The Count de <unk> died at the scene ; Yvain de Foix and Aimery Poitiers , son of the Count of <unk> , lingered with painful burns for two days . The instigator of the affair , Huguet de Guisay , survived a day longer , described by Tuchman as bitterly " cursing and insulting his fellow dancers , the dead and the living , until his last hour " . 
 The citizens of Paris , angered by the event and at the danger posed to their monarch , blamed Charles ' advisors . A " great commotion " swept through the city as the populace threatened to depose Charles ' uncles and kill dissolute and depraved courtiers . Greatly concerned at the popular outcry and worried about a repeat of the <unk> revolt of the previous decade — when Parisians armed with mallets turned against tax collectors — Charles ' uncles persuaded the court to do penance at Notre Dame Cathedral , preceded by an apologetic royal progress through the city in which the king rode on horseback with his uncles walking in humility . Orléans , who was blamed for the tragedy , donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at the Celestine monastery . 
 Froissart 's chronicle of the event places blame directly on Charles ' brother , Orléans . He wrote : " And thus the feast and marriage celebrations ended with such great sorrow ... [ Charles ] and [ Isabeau ] could do nothing to remedy it . We must accept that it was no fault of theirs but of the duke of Orléans . " Orléans ' reputation was severely damaged by the event , compounded by an episode a few years earlier in which he was accused of sorcery after hiring an apostate monk to imbue a ring , dagger and sword with demonic magic . The theologian Jean Petit would later testify that Orléans practiced sorcery , and that the fire at the dance represented a failed attempt at regicide made in retaliation for Charles ' attack the previous summer . 
 The Bal des Ardents added to the impression of a court steeped in extravagance , with a king in delicate health and unable to rule . Charles ' attacks of illness increased in frequency such that by the end of the 1390s his role was merely ceremonial . By the early 15th century he was neglected and often forgotten , a lack of leadership that contributed to the decline and fragmentation of the Valois dynasty . In 1407 , Philip the Bold 's son , John the Fearless , had his cousin Orléans assassinated because of " vice , corruption , sorcery , and a long list of public and private <unk> " ; at the same time Isabeau was accused of having been the mistress of her husband 's brother . Orléans ' assassination pushed the country into a civil war between the Burgundians and the Orléanists ( known as the Armagnacs ) , which lasted for several decades . The vacuum created by the lack of central power and the general irresponsibility of the French court resulted in it gaining a reputation for lax morals and decadence that endured for more than 200 years . 
 = = Folkloric and Christian representations of wild men = = 
 Veenstra writes in Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France that the Bal des Ardents reveals the tension between Christian beliefs and the latent paganism that existed in 14th @-@ century society . According to him , the event " laid bare a great cultural struggle with the past but also became an ominous foreshadowing of the future . " 
 Wild men or savages — usually depicted carrying a staff or club , living beyond the bounds of civilization without shelter or fire , lacking feelings and a soul — were then a metaphor for man without God . Common superstition held that long @-@ haired wild men , known as <unk> , who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals , lived in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees . In some village <unk> at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men , to represent demons , were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits . The Church , however , considered these rituals pagan and demonic . 
 Veenstra explains that it was believed that by dressing as wild men , villagers ritualistically " conjured demons by imitating them " — although at that period <unk> forbade a belief in wild men or an imitation of them , such as the costumed dance at Isabeau 's event . In folkloric rituals the " burning did not happen literally but in <unk> " , he writes , " contrary to the Bal des Ardents where the seasonal fertility rite had watered down to courtly entertainment , but where burning had been promoted to a dreadful reality . " A 15th @-@ century chronicle describes the Bal des Ardents as una <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " a dance to ward off the devil " ) . 
 Because remarriage was often thought to be a sacrilege — common belief ( contrary to the Gospel - Luke 20 : 27 @-@ 40 and Matthew 22 : 29 @-@ 30 ) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death — it was censured by the community . Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold : to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting — in an inherently pagan manner , which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike . A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well , according to Veenstra . The Book of Tobit partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon Asmodeus ; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish . 
 The event also may have served as a symbolic exorcism of Charles ' mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court . In the early 15th century , ritual burning of evil , demonic , or Satanic forces was not uncommon as shown by the Duke of Orléans ' later persecution of the king 's physician Jehan de Bar , who was burned to death after confessing , under torture , to practicing sorcery . 
 = = Chronicles = = 
 The death of four members of the nobility was sufficiently important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles , most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis , and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of illuminated manuscripts . While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening — the dancers were dressed as wild men , the king survived , one man fell into a vat , and four of the dancers died — there are discrepancies in the details . Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together , which is not mentioned in the Monk 's account . Furthermore , the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance . According to the historian Susan Crane , the Monk describes the event as a wild charivari with the audience participating in the dance , whereas Froissart 's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation . 
 Froissart wrote about the event in Book IV of his Chronicles ( covering the years 1389 to 1440 ) , an account described by scholar Katerina Nara as full of " a sense of pessimism " , as Froissart " did not approve of all he recorded " . Froissart blamed Orléans for the tragedy , and the Monk blamed the instigator , de Guisay , whose reputation for treating low @-@ born servants like animals earned him such universal hatred that " the Nobles rejoiced at his agonizing death " . 
 The Monk wrote of the event in the Histoire de Charles VI ( History of Charles VI ) , covering about 25 years of the king 's reign . He seemed to disapprove on the grounds that the event broke social mores and the king 's conduct was unbecoming , whereas Froissart described it as a celebratory event . 
 Scholars are unsure whether either chronicler was present that evening . According to Crane , Froissart wrote of the event about five years later , and the Monk about ten . Veenstra speculates that the Monk may have been an eyewitness ( as he was for much of Charles VI 's reign ) and that his account is the more accurate of the two . The Monk 's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the king 's court , however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro @-@ Burgundian and anti @-@ Orléanist stance , causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner . A third account was written in the mid @-@ 15th century by Jean Juvenal des Ursins in his biography of Charles , L 'Histoire de Charles VI : roy de France , not published until 1614 . 
 The Froissart manuscript dating from between 1470 and 1472 from the Harleian Collection held at the British Library includes a miniature depicting the event , titled " Dance of the <unk> " , attributed to an unknown painter referred to as the Master of the Harley Froissart . A slightly later edition of Froissart 's Chronicles , dated to around 1480 , contains a miniature of the event , " Fire at a Masked Dance " , also attributed to an unidentified early Netherlandish painter known as the Master of the Getty Froissart . The 15th @-@ century <unk> manuscript of Froissart 's Chronicles , held at the Bibliothèque nationale de France , has a miniature of the event . Another edition of Froissart 's Chronicles published in Paris around 1508 may have been made expressly for Maria of Cleves . The edition has 25 miniatures in the margins ; the single full @-@ page illustration is of the Bal des Ardents . 
 = Russian monitor Tifon = 
 Tifon ( Russian : <unk> ) was an Uragan @-@ class monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The design was based on the American Passaic @-@ class monitor , but was modified to suit Russian engines , guns and construction techniques . Spending her entire career with the Baltic Fleet , the ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen , but very little is known about her service . She was struck from the Navy List in 1900 , converted into a storage hulk for mines in 1909 and renamed Blokshiv No. 3 . The ship was <unk> by the Soviets in Finland in 1918 ; although retroceded to the Soviets in 1922 , she was later scrapped by the Finns . 
 = = Description = = 
 While the Uragans were extensively modified by the Russians , they did retain the single twin @-@ gun turret and low freeboard of the original Passaic @-@ class design . Tifon was 201 feet ( 61 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , with a beam of 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 16 – 10 @.@ 84 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 t ) , and her crew numbered 8 officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865 . They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877 . 
 The ship was fitted with a two @-@ cylinder , horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine built by the Baird Works of Saint Petersburg . It drove a single propeller using steam that was provided by two rectangular boilers . Specific information on the output of the ship 's engine has not survived , but it ranged between 340 – 500 indicated horsepower ( 254 – 373 kW ) for all the ships of this class . During Tifon 's sea trials on 19 June 1865 , she reached a maximum speed of 6 @.@ 7 knots ( 12 @.@ 4 km / h ; 7 @.@ 7 mph ) . The ship carried a maximum of 190 long tons ( 190 t ) of coal , which gave her a theoretical endurance of 1 @,@ 440 nmi ( 2 @,@ 670 km ; 1 @,@ 660 mi ) at full speed . 
 Tifon was designed to be armed with a pair of 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading guns purchased from Krupp of Germany and rifled in Russia , but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with the Krupp smoothbore guns . These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license @-@ built 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in 1867 – 68 . The <unk> were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine @-@ inch rifled guns . 
 All of the wrought @-@ iron armor that was used in the Uragan @-@ class monitors was in 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates , just as in the Passaic @-@ class ships . The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates , of which the three innermost plates extended 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline . The gun turret was protected by eleven layers of armor and the pilothouse above it had eight layers of armor . Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the funnel up to a height of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) above the deck . Unlike their predecessors , the Uragans were built without deck armor to save weight , but Tifon was modified for the addition of 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) armor plates after completion , although it is unknown if they were ever fitted . They were , however , manufactured and then placed in storage . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Construction of the ship began on 13 June 1863 at the New Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Tifon was laid down on 1 December 1863 and she was launched on 27 May 1864 . She entered service in 1865 and cost a total of 1 @,@ 105 @,@ 800 rubles , almost double her contract cost of 600 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she , and all of her sister ships except Latnik , made a port visit to Stockholm , Sweden in July – August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich . 
 Sometime after Tifon was completed , an armored ring , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) tall , was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it . Later , an armored , outward @-@ curving bulwark was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there . Three sponsons were later added , probably during the 1870s , to the upper portion of the turret . Each sponson , one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret , mounted a light gun , probably a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , for defense against torpedo boats . A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret , also probably during the 1870s . 
 Little is known about the ship 's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze . Tifon was reclassified as a coast @-@ defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900 , although she was not stricken until 17 August . Tifon was converted into a mine storage hulk in 1909 and renamed Blokshiv No. 3 on 27 October of that year . She was abandoned by the Soviets in Helsingfors ( Helsinki ) when they were forced to withdraw from Finland in April 1918 according to the terms of the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk , but she was later returned by the Finns in 1922 . The ship was subsequently broken up in Finland . 
 = Tower Heist = 
 Tower Heist is a 2011 American heist comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and written by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson , based on a story by Bill Collage , Adam Cooper and Griffin . It was released on November 2 , 2011 in the United Kingdom , with a United States release following two days later . Tower Heist follows Josh Kovaks ( Ben Stiller ) , Charlie Gibbs ( Casey Affleck ) and Enrique Dev <unk> ( Michael Peña ) , employees of an exclusive apartment building who lose their pensions in the Ponzi scheme of Wall Street businessman Arthur Shaw ( Alan Alda ) . The group enlist the aid of criminal Slide ( Eddie Murphy ) , bankrupt businessman Mr. Fitzhugh ( Matthew Broderick ) and another employee of the apartment building , Odessa ( Gabourey Sidibe ) , to break into Shaw 's apartment and steal back their money while avoiding the FBI agent in charge of his case , Claire Denham ( Téa Leoni ) . 
 Tower Heist began development as early as 2005 , based on an idea by Murphy that would star himself and an all @-@ black cast of comedians as a heist group who rob Trump International Hotel and Tower . As the script developed and changed into an Ocean 's Eleven – style caper , Murphy left the project . Ratner continued to develop the idea into what would eventually become Tower Heist , with Murphy later rejoining the production . Filming took place entirely in New York City on a budget of $ 75 million ( after tax rebates ) , with several buildings provided by Donald Trump used to represent the eponymous tower . The film score was composed by Christophe Beck and released commercially on November 1 , 2011 . 
 The film received mixed reviews with much of the praise going to the cast , including Broderick , Leoni and Stiller . However , Murphy was repeatedly singled out by critics as the star of the film , with critics feeling that he displayed a welcome return to the comedic style of his early career . Much of the criticism received by the film was focused on the plot which was considered " formulaic , " " rushed , " " dull " and " laborious . " The film earned almost $ 153 million during its theatrical run . 
 Prior to release , the film was involved in a controversy over plans by Universal Pictures to release it for home viewing on video on demand to 500 @,@ 000 Comcast customers , only three weeks after its theatrical debut . Concern over the implementation 's harming ticket sales and inspiring further films to follow suit resulted in several theater chains ' refusal to show the film at all if the plan went ahead , forcing Universal to abandon the idea .

 Josh Kovaks is the building manager of The Tower , a luxury apartment complex in New York City whose employees include concierge Charlie , who is expecting a child with Josh 's sister ; Enrique , a newly hired elevator operator ; Lester , the doorman nearing retirement ; Odessa , an immigrant maid from Jamaica ; and receptionist Miss Iovenko , who is studying to become a lawyer . 
 One morning Josh sees Arthur Shaw , a wealthy Tower resident , being kidnapped . Josh gives chase , but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham , who explains that Shaw was attempting to flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $ 2 billion in a Ponzi scheme . Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest , and they have lost everything ; Lester attempts suicide . After visiting Lester in hospital , Josh , Charlie , and Enrique confront Shaw , under house arrest in his penthouse apartment . Shaw 's insincere condolences enrage Josh and he smashes the windows of the 1963 Ferrari 250 GT <unk> displayed in Shaw 's apartment . Josh , Charlie , and Enrique are fired for the incident . 
 Josh meets Denham at a bar where she suggests that Shaw has concealed $ 20 million as a reserve , and that Josh should steal it . Josh , Charlie , Enrique , and evicted Tower tenant Mr. Fitzhugh conspire to find and steal the money from Shaw 's assumed safe . They supplement their inexperience by enlisting Josh 's childhood former friend Slide , a petty criminal , and Odessa , who has locksmith experience that can help open the safe . Charlie is later rehired as the Tower 's new manager , and warns Josh to abandon the plan or he will inform the police . Subsequently , Denham informs Josh that Shaw is scheduled for to attend court on Thanksgiving during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade to avoid publicity , and that Shaw will be set free . Josh and his team decide to break into Shaw 's apartment during the parade . 
 Slide attempts to betray the team by reaching the safe first , having tricked Odessa into giving him lessons . The team intercepts him at Shaw 's apartment , and during the ensuing struggle they break down a false wall , revealing Shaw 's empty safe . Slide and Fitzhugh struggle for Slide 's gun ; the gun goes off and the bullet hits the car , revealing gold underneath the Ferrari 's paint . They realize that Shaw used his money to buy gold , turn it into car parts , and assembled the car to hide the money in plain sight . Josh finds a ledger of Shaw 's illegal finances in the car 's glove box . They use a window @-@ washing platform to lower the car from the apartment into an empty apartment below before lowering it to the lobby on top of the elevator . As they reach the lobby , Denham and Shaw return , revealing the Thanksgiving court date as a ruse as part of the plan . Denham notes the missing car and Shaw 's safe and rearrests him for violating his bail by not declaring the latter . 
 Denham and the FBI arrest Josh and the crew ( except Slide ) as they walk outside the Tower . Miss Iovenko arrives , telling the FBI that she passed her bar exam three days ago and is acting as Josh 's attorney . She shows them Shaw 's ledger and tells them she will turn it over in exchange for everyone 's freedom . The FBI accepts on the condition that Josh , being the primary conspirator , must serve a minimal two @-@ year sentence , but Denham lowers it to 16 months to make sure Josh gets out for good behavior . Shaw is convicted and sentenced to prison for the rest of his life . 
 The team retrieves the car from its hiding place in Shaw 's rooftop pool and send various parts of the car to Tower employees to compensate for their lost pensions . As Josh is led to his cell , a satisfied smile slowly forms on his face .

 = = = Development = = = 
 The idea for Tower Heist began development as early as 2005 , when Murphy pitched a concept to producer Brian Grazer and Ratner concerning an all @-@ star cast of black comedians including Chris Tucker , Kevin Hart , Dave Chappelle , Tracy Morgan , and Martin Lawrence , as a group of disgruntled employees who plan to rob Donald Trump and Trump International Hotel and Tower . The film was originally titled Trump Heist under this concept . A script was developed by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage and over the course of the next five years , the script was rewritten by several writers including Russell Gewirtz , Rawson Marshall Thurber , Ted Griffin , Leslie Dixon , Noah Baumbach , and Jeff Nathanson , with the bulk of the work – and credit – going to Griffin and Nathanson . 
 Rewrites of the script gradually moved away from the ensemble of comedians and began to focus on two central characters , at which point Murphy left the project . For Ratner however , the modified script reminded him of the Ocean 's Eleven remake , a project he had developed but for which he was unavailable due to his commitment to directing Rush Hour 2 . 
 The project remained in development for a period of years but Ratner remained committed to the project , having enjoyed the heist films of the 1970s including The Taking of Pelham One Two Three , The Hot Rock , and The Anderson Tapes , turning down the opportunity to direct other films such as Horrible Bosses , which he instead produced . Ratner would also claim that he wanted to work with Murphy , whom Ratner partially credited as inspiring his Rush Hour films . As the script began to be finalized , Murphy was drawn back into the much @-@ changed project after being informed of Stiller 's participation , with Murphy being offered the role of Slide . Murphy rejoined as both a cast member and producer , alongside Grazer and Kim Roth . In later October 2010 , the film was finally scheduled for release , being given a November 4 , 2011 , release date . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Feeling the original concept was too close to Ocean 's Eleven , Ratner attempted to recruit Rush Hour screenwriter Nathanson to perform additional work on the Tower Heist script , but at that time Nathanson was unavailable . Ratner instead hired Griffin , a writer on the Ocean 's Eleven remake . Griffin " brought the real motivation and the heart to the concept " , moving away from the premise of performing an ensemble heist on a rich Donald Trump @-@ type , and focusing instead on a group of blue @-@ collar employees who take on a corrupt , thieving Bernard Madoff @-@ like businessman who has embezzled their pensions . Ratner enjoyed the pitch and brought it to Grazer who gave his approval . After taking the script to Stiller and bringing him into the project , Ratner had Noah Baumbach perform specific rewrites for Stiller 's character . Nathanson then came aboard the project and performed the final rewrites to Griffin 's screenplay in October 2010 , adding " the obstacles , complexities and specificities of the characters . " 
 To help develop the script , the filmmakers and writers spoke with the resident managers of several high @-@ profile New York hotels to learn of their experiences interacting with their clientele . This research gave Griffin the idea for Shaw 's possessing a vehicle in his apartment , which Grazer and Ratner eventually decided would be a rare 1963 Ferrari 250 GT <unk> which once belonged to Steve McQueen . On his research , Nathanson said : 
 " It was informative , to say the least , to speak with the people who work in these buildings . I interviewed everyone from doormen to housekeepers to building managers . There 's a whole underworld to the New York building scene that exists in the basements that most people are unaware of . They make it all possible , and you just never see it . It 's fascinating . " 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming began on November 2010 , taking place entirely in New York City on a budget of $ 85 million ( $ 75 million after tax rebates ) . Production designer Kristi Zea visited several upscale hotels and high @-@ rise residences to research the design elements to incorporate into the opulent surroundings of the tower and Shaw 's penthouse . Zea created an amalgamation of the elements she saw during her research to create a sophisticated lobby design for the tower . For Shaw 's penthouse , Zea took inspiration from a top @-@ floor apartment in the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Central Park West in Columbus Circle . Zea populated the apartment with an assortment of art pieces to represent Shaw 's status , based on specific artists and works that Ratner suggested . Zea decided to use modern @-@ classic reproduction designs by artists such as Pablo Picasso , Francis Bacon , Cy Twombly , and Andy Warhol . Explaining her decision , Zea said " These days , it seems wealthy people want to have wall power . They want to have art on their walls that means something and shows people , just like a car , that , ' I 'm rich , I 'm smart and I know what I 'm doing . ' " 
 Donald Trump allowed the production to use several of his own properties to portray the luxurious locales with the Trump International Hotel and Tower 's being used for exterior shots of the tower . Sections of the building were recreated on closed green screen sets for some of the film 's visual effects . A foot and car chase sequence was filmed on Central Park West and Columbus Avenue . Some vehicle filming occurred on sound stages in Brooklyn . The burglary itself takes place during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade , requiring the crew to film parts of the actual parade itself , and then recreate the event one week later for further filming . 
 For Shaw 's Ferrari , it was decided that purchasing an actual model – of which only 350 exist and would cost at least $ 1 million – would be too expensive and the vehicle would be unsuitable for filming purposes . Instead , two replicas were commissioned , a process which took three months under the supervision of prop master Peter <unk> . The replicas then received additional reinforcement for filming purposes from Steve <unk> and the special effects crew . After running camera tests on several authentic Ferrari colors , it was decided to paint the replicas bright red in order to create a lasting impression instead of using the actual metallic brown muted @-@ coloring of McQueen 's vehicle . 
 Sidibe and Murphy performed the only improvised scene , in which they are cracking a safe together . Test screenings did not result in any scenes being cut from the film , with Ratner claiming that the theatrical version is his " director 's cut " . However , he did remove scenes which he felt " didn 't fit " , or did not match the PG @-@ 13 rating the filmmakers were targeting . 
 In post @-@ production , Universal decided to film a new scene for the ending that would feature a reunion between Stiller and Murphy 's characters . Murphy , however , refused to return unless he were paid a further $ 500 @,@ 000 on top of his $ 7 @.@ 5 million salary . The studio declined to pay the additional money and the scene was not shot .

 Tower Heist received mixed to positive reviews from critics , garnering a 68 % approval rating from 175 critics – an average rating of 6 @.@ 2 out of 10 – on review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes , whose consensus reads : " Tower Heist is a true Brett Ratner joint : little brains to this caper , but it 's fun fluff , exciting to watch , and showcases a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy . " Metacritic provides a score of 59 out of 100 from 39 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews . " CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a " B " on an A + to F scale . 
 Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph called the film " a tolerably enjoyable Brett Ratner movie " , labeling it " brash , forgettable fun . " However , Robey criticized Ratner for having the mostly white characters require the aid of a black character for the heist , saying " it 's a little embarrassing that they can 't conceive of doing this without bailing a black criminal out of jail ... but cultural sensitivity has never been Ratner 's strong suit . " The Hollywood Reporter 's Todd McCarthy said that the film is " snappy , well cast and streetwise " but felt that it ignored the " contemporary economic issues at its core . " McCarthy said that Murphy 's performance was a return to form as " the rude , confrontational , <unk> Murphy audiences have nearly forgotten after all the silly kid comedies and heavy @-@ makeup outings of recent years , " and said that with his introduction " the film 's energy and amusement level kick up a few notches , " but that the enjoyment ebbs during the actual break @-@ in , in which " Murphy becomes neutered ... and the logistics of the heist become too far @-@ fetched and laborious . " 
 New York 's David Edelstein called it " a shameless but exuberantly well @-@ done caper comedy , " and praised the performances of Stiller , Murphy and Leoni , saying " Ben Stiller ... and Eddie Murphy ... show off two of the best fastballs in comedy , and Téa Leoni 's best scene as an FBI agent – drunk , both sloppy and blunt – makes you wish she had more . " Emanuel Levy called Tower Heist a " formulaic , haphazardly plotted action comedy ... whose best asset is its strong ensemble . " Levy said " What makes the picture ... work is not its plot , which is overly familiar and utterly implausible , but the socio @-@ psychological dynamics that prevail among the [ characters ] . " Levy singled out Stiller as " well cast " and Sidibe as having " some of the picture 's best lines , " but gave individual praise to Murphy , saying that he " dominates the second half of the picture , " rendering " a joyous performance that recalls his witty , charming , streetwise roles of the 1980s . " 
 Empire 's Nick de Semlyen awarded the film three out of five stars , calling it " fun if uneven stuff from Ratner , " with a " fairly dull " opening act . Semlyen said it was " a welcome return to form for Eddie Murphy , " but was critical that he is " sorely underused . " Semlyen praised Alda , saying that it is his " smarm offensive that turns out to be the primary pleasure . " The Village Voice 's Nick <unk> said that the film " deserves credit as a clean , well @-@ turned job , fleet and funny and inconsequential , " and appreciated the cast , praising Leoni as the " best thing going , " and Murphy 's " inspired " contributions . However , Pinkerton was critical of the script , describing it as " amateur as its crooks : the audience isn 't even fully aware of who 's in on the job when it kicks off , while other threads are left dangling . " 
 Roger Ebert awarded the film 2 @.@ 5 out of 4 , saying " This isn 't a great heist movie for a lot of reasons , beginning with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line , " but appreciated that the comedy did not " go heavy on the <unk> , the masturbatory and symphonies of four @-@ letter words " , calling it " funny in an innocent screwball kind of way . " Entertainment Weekly 's Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film " <unk> , eye @-@ catching , and essentially tacky , " and praised Murphy , saying " when Murphy is on screen , his comedic vigor ... <unk> the movie 's energy level ... but whenever Murphy wanders off , the movie 's pulse rate drops . Tower Heist is in effect two movies : One belongs to Murphy , the other to the rest of the cast . " Time Out London 's Trevor Johnston said that " though it 's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler , Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it 's equally hard to dislike , " but criticized the finale " which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously . " Conversely , Time Out New York 's David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars , saying " one nail @-@ biting moment and some much @-@ missed Murphy <unk> won 't keep you from feeling like you 're the one being ripped off . " 
 The New Yorker 's Anthony Lane criticized the plot , saying " toss everything you can find , starting with roughly diced plots , into the blender : such appears to be the method behind Tower Heist . " Lane called the characters " unlikable people " but offered praise to Broderick , saying he " underplays [ the character ] so well . " Lane lamented that " the notion of a theft from the thieves – from those who are lapped in lofty , screw @-@ you wealth – is a tempting one right now , but Tower Heist passes the buck . " Variety 's Peter Debruge was also critical , saying the film " goes wonky on the way to the bank , due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely , laughs . " Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were " a dull blue @-@ collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes , " and while the film " picks up some much @-@ needed momentum " with the actual heist , the " resolution feels rushed . " However , Debruge echoed praise for Murphy , calling his performance " a welcome return to the comic 's irreverent , ' 80s @-@ era persona , " and lamenting his limited screen @-@ time .

 = String Quartets , Op. 50 ( Haydn ) = 
 The String Quartets , Op. 50 ( Hob . III / 44 @-@ 49 , L. 36 @-@ 41 ) , were composed by Joseph Haydn in 1787 . The set of six quartets was dedicated to King Frederick William II of Prussia . For this reason the set is commonly known as the Prussian Quartets . Haydn sold the set to the Viennese firm Artaria and , without Artaria 's knowledge , to the English publisher William Forster . Forster published it as Haydn 's Opus 44 . Haydn 's autograph manuscripts for Nos. 3 to 6 of the set were discovered in Melbourne , Australia , in 1982 . 
 Each of the six quartets in the set has four movements , and in each case the movements are ordered in a conventional fast – slow – minuet – fast sequence . 
 The set was Haydn 's first complete set of quartets since the Opus 33 set of 1781 . While the Opus 33 set was apt for broad public consumption , the Opus 50 set is more serious and experimental . It is perhaps because of the Opus 50 's intellectual character that other sets among Haydn 's mature quartets have received more attention from performers . 
 = = History = = 
 Haydn conceived of what became Opus 50 set in a letter to the publishing house Artaria in 1784 , although he then put the project on hold for the Paris symphonies and The Seven Last Words of Christ . He started work in 1787 , composing the first two quartets in February . In April , Haydn received a letter from King Frederick William II of Prussia , praising Haydn for the copies of the Paris symphonies that he had sent . The letter enclosed a golden ring . Haydn sought to return the favour by dedicating the Opus 50 set to the King , and Artaria acceded to Haydn 's request to do so . 
 The history of the publication of Opus 50 set betrays one of the more remarkable examples of Haydn 's financial and commercial impropriety . Haydn hurriedly completed the set by September 1787 , when he sent the fifth quartet to Artaria . Meanwhile , in August , he had offered the set to the English publisher William Forster , who duly printed the six quartets before Artaria did . Haydn was deceiving both publishers : the offer to Forster was unbeknown to Artaria , while Haydn misled Forster into believing that no @-@ one else had been offered the set . Artaria learned of the Forster deal but published the set anyway , in December 1787 , as Haydn 's Opus 50 . 
 In 1982 , the original autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 of the set were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne , Australia , for the 250th anniversary of Haydn 's birth . After a concert at the festival , the manuscripts were presented in a plastic shopping bag to the conductor Christopher Hogwood . The Haydn scholar Georg Feder , who was visiting Australia at the time , then verified the scores to be the authentic original manuscripts of the four quartets . It emerged that the woman who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them , through successive generations , from an English colonel who had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand . The colonel 's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn 's pen . Until the 1982 discovery , publishers had been working from incomplete or non @-@ original editions .

 The six quartets in the set are : 
 Quartet No. 36 in B @-@ flat major , Op. 50 , No. 1 , Hob . III / 44

 In Haydn 's previous two sets of quartets , the Opus 20 ( " Sun " ) and Opus 33 ( " Russian " ) , he adopted a variety of cyclical structures . But in the Opus 50 set , each quartet follows a four @-@ movement fast – slow – minuet – fast sequence . The set is also characterised by a high degree of <unk> ( the use of a single theme within a movement ) . In a number of movements , including sonata form movements and minuets and trios , Haydn eschews presenting a second and contrasting theme and instead elects to explore the full potential of the primary theme . 
 The set 's dedicatee , King Frederick William II , was a capable amateur cellist . The set contains a number of striking passages for the cello , including in its opening of the first movement of No. 1 and its leading passages in the slow movements of Nos. 2 and 3 .

 The first quartet of the set , in B @-@ flat major , is numbered III / 44 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Allegro 
 Adagio non lento 
 Menuetto : Poco allegretto 
 Finale : Vivace 
 The first movement is in cut common ( 2 / 2 ) time . It starts with the cello , alone , playing eight quarter notes on the same B @-@ flat . It is not until the third measure of the movement that the violins and viola enter . The cello 's eight throbbing notes act as more than an introduction . They reappear at critical junctures throughout the movement , including at the beginning of the development and recapitulation sections , illustrating that they are part of the movement 's primary thematic material . The melody that follows the eight cello notes is echoed in Beethoven 's String Quartet No. 1 ( Op. 18 , No. 1 ) . 
 The second movement is in E @-@ flat major and strophic form , with a statement of a theme followed by three variations ( the second of which is in E @-@ flat minor ) and a coda . Haydn used a similar design for the slow movement of the Opus 20 , No. 4 quartet . In 1793 the poet Gabriele von <unk> set the movement 's theme to words , for inscription on a monument honouring Haydn in the composer 's home town of <unk> , Austria . 
 The third movement , a minuet and trio , features motivic elements that hark back to the previous two movements . In the trio , Haydn uses off @-@ beat entries and second @-@ beat <unk> to disrupt what would otherwise be a regular and conventional triple metre . 
 The fourth movement , in sonata form but with characteristics of a rondo , is replete with <unk> false <unk> and conclusions . In one example , the music lands in the tonic at the end of the recapitulation and apparent coda , and is followed by two measures of complete silence , creating an illusion of finality . However , the main theme is then reprised , and the real conclusion to the work follows some 20 measures later . 
 = = Opus 50 , No. 2 = = 
 The second quartet of the set , in C major , is numbered III / 45 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Vivace 
 Adagio cantabile 
 Menuetto : Allegretto 
 Finale : Vivace assai 
 The first movement is in 3 / 4 time , hitherto uncommon among Haydn 's opening movements . In this movement , Haydn departs from the <unk> approach that characterises many of his other sonata form movements in the set . The exposition presents two clearly distinct themes : the first in the tonic and the second in the dominant . 
 The second movement , in F major and marked " adagio cantabile " , commences with the statement of the primary theme by the second violin , before it is taken up by the first violin in the ninth measure . The first violin part enjoys a move into a high register in the movement 's central section as well as an elaborate solo passage towards the end of the movement . The movement 's central section also features a five @-@ measure passage of sixteenth notes for the cello , perhaps specially written for the opus 's cellist dedicatee . 
 The opening measure of the minuet , after an upbeat , is a descending C @-@ major triad ( G @-@ E @-@ C ) played by the first violin . The trio inverts this opening with an ascending triad ( C @-@ E @-@ G ) played by the second violin . 
 The finale is in sonata form . It features significant developments of a simple motif , and considerable dialogue between the four parts . The finale also contains a high degree of chromaticism , a feature that links the four movements of the work . The musicologist W. Dean Sutcliffe points to the recurrence of C ♯ at key points in each movement , serving at different times to create dissonance , to commence modulation ( music ) away from the tonic , or , as in the case of the finale , as a device for inflection . 
 = = Opus 50 , No. 3 = = 
 The third quartet of the set , in E @-@ flat major , is numbered III / 46 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Allegro con brio 
 Andante più <unk> allegretto 
 Menuetto : Allegretto 
 Finale : Presto 
 This is a concise work , in terms of its duration , the economy of thematic material presented , and also the narrow registers within which the four parts operate . The first movement is in 6 / 8 time and a <unk> sonata form . The development and recapitulation sections feature an example of Haydn 's musical jokes . In this case he tinkers with the movement 's sonata form by reference to an historical variation of it . The recapitulation starts only with a statement of the second phrase of the movement 's theme , which is in the dominant . This would have been a common technique earlier in the eighteenth century that , in this instance , is liable to confuse the unknowing listener looking for the statement of the first phrase of the theme in the tonic . It is not until 27 measures later that the listener is presented with a more emphatic reprise , which is actually a coda . The coda involves the statement of the main theme in the tonic that the listener might have been expecting , and it does so after two measures of pointed silence . 
 The form of the second movement , an Andante in B @-@ flat major , is indefinable . The movement involves elements of a theme and variations , but also has characteristics of both a ternary form movement and a rondo . Unlike a conventional theme and variation movement , the minor mode variation is placed immediately after the statement of the theme ; normally , the minor mode theme would be held back for later in the movement . The second variation involves very little actual variation , and is closer to a literal re @-@ statement of the theme that one would see in ternary form or a rondo . Also unconventionally , the second and third so @-@ called variations are separated by an eight @-@ measure free @-@ form passage . The cello enjoys a prominent role throughout the movement , with the viola often substituting as the bass accompaniment . The cello also presents the movement 's opening theme . 
 The one exception to the compactness of the quartet comes in the minuet . The minuet 's first half is a standard 12 measures , but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat @-@ side keys . The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B ♭ upbeat leading to an E ♭ . 
 The finale completes the interconnectedness of the work with a theme audibly similar to those of the first movement and the minuet and trio . The movement is the most economical of all : the exposition and development commence with nearly identical passages and conclude in exactly the same way . 
 = = Opus 50 , No. 4 = = 
 The fourth quartet of the set , in F @-@ sharp minor , is numbered III / 47 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Allegro <unk> 
 Andante 
 Menuetto : Poco allegretto 
 Finale : Fuga , allegro molto 
 This is the only quartet of the set in a minor key . Haydn employed F @-@ sharp minor as the home key of only three of his known works : this , his Symphony No. 45 ( " Farewell " ) , and his Piano Trio No. 40 ( Hob . XV / 26 ) . 
 The first movement 's exposition commences in the tonic of F @-@ sharp minor , before modulating to the relative major of A. After a long development section , the recapitulation both arrives and concludes in F @-@ sharp major . Sutcliffe argues that the perfunctory major @-@ key conclusion is not a " happy ending " but an " uneasy truce " that paves the way for the remainder of the quartet , the finale of which concludes in a minor key . 
 The second movement continues the major @-@ minor tussle that pervades the work as a whole . It is in double variation form , with the first theme in A major and the second theme in A minor . Again the movement ends abruptly , with an A @-@ major chord . 
 The relationship of the minuet ( in F @-@ sharp major ) and the trio ( in F @-@ sharp minor ) continues the overall tension between major and minor . The minuet features a startling harmonic shift : its second half is suddenly interrupted by a fortissimo D @-@ major chord , far remote from the home key , before a chromatic passage leads back to the dominant of C @-@ sharp major . The trio is linked to the minuet by the rhythmic similarities of their opening motifs . 
 The finale is a fugue that builds on motifs presented in the earlier three movements . The musicologist Donald Tovey , writing in 1929 , described the fugue as " tragic " on the scale of Beethoven 's String Quartet No. 14 ( Op. 131 ) , although Sutcliffe argues that the movement is more strained and discomforting than tragic .

 The fifth quartet of the set , in F major , is numbered III / 48 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Allegro moderato 
 Poco adagio 
 Tempo di Menuetto : Allegretto 
 Finale : Vivace 
 With its 2 / 4 time signature , pulse occurring on the eight notes , and " allegro moderato " tempo , the metre of the first movement is a throwback to an earlier and simpler style of opening movement . It begins with a simple duet between the two violins , before a second subject area that involves rapid sextuplets . The movement continues to feature subtle textural conversation between the violins , viola and cello that is not resolved until the coda . 
 The second movement , in B @-@ flat major , is in two parts : an exposition and a recapitulation . The first violin plays the leading role throughout , although the movement is characterised by rich textures between the four parts created by compositional devices such as contrary motion . It is this movement that gives the Op. 50 No. 5 the nickname of " Der Traum " , or " The Dream " . 
 The minuet is in F major , but it is not until well into its second half that a strong chord in the tonic arrives . Once again among the Opus 50 minuets , Haydn is unsettling harmonic conventions . Haydn also toys with metre towards the end of the minuet : it moves into , and concludes , essentially in duple time . The trio follows , and its theme almost identical to that of the minuet , albeit in a minor key and played by all four parts in unison . 
 Sutcliffe refers to the finale as the " one disappointing movement " of the Opus 50 quartets , arguing that it is " too straightforward structurally " , lacks " internal tension " , and might have been the product of the composer 's rush to finish the work , which was holding up publication of the whole set . 
 = = Opus 50 , No. 6 ( " The Frog " ) = = 
 The sixth and final quartet of the set , in D major , is numbered III / 49 in the Hoboken @-@ Verzeichnis catalogue . Its movements are : 
 Allegro 
 Poco adagio 
 Menuetto : Allegretto 
 Finale : Allegro con <unk> 
 Haydn 's choice of D major for this quartet , with the second movement in D minor , optimises the use of open strings and allows for the work to be the loudest and most grandiose of the set . The first movement opens peculiarly : the first violin starts on an E , and proceeds to play a four @-@ measure phrase that concludes with a D major chord . The use of a closing phrase to start the movement is the first of a number of unsettling incidents in the movement . The exposition withholds the expected cadence to the dominant almost until the exposition ends . And the movement itself has a tentative pianissimo ending that serves more as a link to the D @-@ minor Adagio than a proper conclusion . 
 The Adagio is in sonata form and presents a single theme . While the exposition modulates to a re @-@ statement of the theme in F major , the recapitulation modulates to D major . The movement ends in that key , pianissimo , with a segue ( an explicit direction given by Haydn to avoid too long a pause between the movements ) to the D @-@ major minuet . 
 The minuet is the shortest among those of the Opus 50 , but the trio features an exceptionally long second section , which uses drifting melodies , a fermata and a pair of two @-@ measure pauses to create a sense of timelessness . Neither the minuet nor the trio reaches a proper conclusion , and in this they continue a feature of the first two movements . The minuet ends with a perfunctory repetition of its main theme and the trio draws out its final cadence with a chromatic passage marked " diminuendo " . Again , Haydn reinforces the interconnectedness between the movements with an explicit direction to the performers for an immediate segue from the reprised minuet to the finale . 
 The finale brings out Haydn 's playfulness . Persistent <unk> pervades the movement ; the sound effect created resembles that of a croaking frog , and is what earned the quartet its nickname . But the movement is no mere auditory joke . It contains important thematic connections to the earlier movements that , aside from the explicit segues between movements , result in a significant degree of cyclic integration . The most important thematic connection is that the closing @-@ phrase opening of the first movement reappears in the finale in a modified form : it no longer stands alone , but as the second part of an eight @-@ measure phrase that forms the movement 's secondary theme . Presented in this context , the ambiguity inherent in its appearance in the first movement is resolved . 
 = Michael Coulson ( footballer ) = 
 Michael James Coulson ( born 4 April 1988 ) is an English professional footballer who plays as a winger or a striker for Scottish Premiership club St Johnstone . 
 Coulson started his career with hometown club Scarborough , making his first @-@ team debut in a Conference National match in 2004 . His first goal for the club , scored later that year , made him the youngest goalscorer in the club 's history . He signed for Championship side Barnsley in 2006 , before making a return to Conference Premier football with a loan at Northwich Victoria in 2007 . Coulson suffered two cruciate ligament injuries in the space of a year before being loaned to Chester City of the Conference in 2009 . Coulson joined League Two side Grimsby Town on loan later that year , signing for the club permanently in 2010 after their relegation to the Conference . He left Grimsby in 2012 , signing for newly promoted League Two team York City . In 2016 , after four years with York , Coulson signed for Scottish Premiership side St Johnstone .

 = = = Scarborough = = = 
 Born in Scarborough , North Yorkshire , Coulson started his career in the youth system of his hometown club Scarborough at the age of nine . In April 2004 , he went on trial with Premier League side Everton , playing in a youth academy game against Liverpool . Coulson captained the Scarborough under @-@ 19 team that won the Northern Alliance League title in the 2003 – 04 season . He made his first @-@ team debut as a 16 @-@ year @-@ old after coming on as a 79th minute substitute against Accrington Stanley in a 4 – 0 Conference National victory on 23 October 2004 , making him the second youngest player in Scarborough 's history . Coulson became Scarborough 's youngest goalscorer after he scored an equalising goal against Tamworth in a 2 – 2 draw on 15 March 2005 with 10 minutes of the game remaining . He signed a one @-@ year professional contract with Scarborough on 5 April 2005 and finished 2004 – 05 , his first in senior football , with two goals in 14 appearances . 
 During pre @-@ season Scarborough manager Nick Henry stated his hope that Coulson , along with fellow youngster Ryan Blott , would fill the gap left by some high @-@ profile departures in the summer . His first goal of 2005 – 06 came after scoring an 87th @-@ minute equaliser in a 1 – 1 draw away at Altrincham on 20 September 2005 , having entered the game as a second @-@ half substitute . He went on trial with League One Barnsley in January 2006 and the following month manager Andy Ritchie expressed his desire to sign Coulson in the summer . Despite this , Coulson decided against extending his trial at Barnsley , opting to return to the Scarborough team to help their fight against relegation . He finished the season seven goals from 33 appearances as Scarborough were relegated to the Conference North and was awarded the club 's annual Players ' Player of the Year and Fans ' Player of the Year awards . 
 = = = Barnsley = = = 
 Coulson was signed by Barnsley on a two @-@ year contract on 4 July 2006 , following their promotion to the Championship . Ritchie described him as a " good young , raw talent who I am sure will develop into a fine addition to our squad " . His debut came in Barnsley 's 2 – 2 draw away at Blackpool in the League Cup on 22 August 2006 , which Barnsley went on to win 4 – 2 in a penalty shoot @-@ out , and was booked during the match for a collision with Blackpool goalkeeper Rhys Evans . He scored his first Barnsley goal with a close range header in the third minute of stoppage time against Southend United in the FA Cup third round on 6 January 2007 , making the score 1 – 1 . He finished 2006 – 07 with one goal in six appearances . 
 He joined Conference Premier side Northwich Victoria on a one @-@ month loan on 31 August 2007 to provide cover for the injured Lee Steele . He made his debut on 4 September 2007 in a 2 – 0 defeat at home to Burton Albion , in which he came close to scoring but goalkeeper Kevin Poole and defender John Brayford blocked his efforts on goal . His first goal for Northwich came with the side 's only goal in a 3 – 1 home defeat to Histon , before being substituted in the 79th minute with a calf strain . Coulson returned to Barnsley after the loan expired on 30 September 2007 , despite caretaker manager Paul Warhurst having convinced him to stay at Northwich for another month . He finished the loan with two goals in six appearances . 
 Coulson 's return to the Barnsley first team came on 1 January 2008 after entering a 2 – 2 draw at home to Scunthorpe United as a half @-@ time substitute . Following this appearance , Coulson said : " I really enjoyed that chance and it has been a long time coming " . His second Barnsley goal came with the winner in an FA Cup third round 2 – 1 victory over Blackpool on 5 January 2008 , which was his first goal at Oakwell . He made an appearance as an 80th @-@ minute substitute for match winner Kayode Odejayi in the 1 – 0 home victory over Premier League side Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter @-@ final on 8 March 2008 . He suffered a knee injury in training on 21 April 2008 , rupturing an anterior cruciate ligament , which was expected to keep him sidelined for seven to nine months . Manager Simon Davey commented : " It 's a complete disaster for him . He 'd been coming on really well . He was the first name I looked to put on the bench " . Some consolation came after being named as Barnsley 's Young Player of the Year for 2007 – 08 . He finished the season with 16 appearances and one goal for Barnsley . 
 Coulson returned to training in early November before making his return to action later that month , scoring in a reserve team game against Grimsby Town . His first @-@ team return came on 22 November 2008 after entering Barnsley 's 2 – 1 defeat away at Preston North End as an 90th @-@ minute substitute . However , a recurrence of his knee injury in January 2009 ruled him out of action for the rest of 2008 – 09 , which he finished with three appearances . On 16 October 2009 , Coulson signed a one @-@ month loan deal with Conference Premier side Chester City , making his debut on 17 October 2009 against Gateshead in a 1 – 0 home victory . He scored his first goal for Chester on 7 November 2009 in a 3 – 1 win over Grays Athletic . After Chester failed in an attempt to extend his loan he returned to Barnsley in November 2009 , having scored one goal from five appearances . However , these were later removed from the records after Chester were expelled from the Football Conference the following February as a result of the club breaching five Conference rules . 
 = = = Grimsby Town = = = 
 On 19 November 2009 , Coulson signed for League Two side Grimsby Town on an initial one @-@ month loan . He made his debut two days later after starting in a 0 – 0 draw at Lincoln City . He scored his first goal for Grimsby on 5 December 2009 in his fourth appearance , a 1 – 1 draw with Dagenham & Redbridge , opening the scoring in the 36th minute before Dagenham equalised in the second half . His loan was extended for a second month in December 2009 , keeping him at Grimsby until 23 January 2010 . Shortly before the loan was due to expire , Coulson 's stay at Grimsby was extended until the end of 2009 – 10 on 19 January 2010 . He finished the season with five goals in 29 appearances for Grimsby , with the side being relegated to the Conference Premier . 
 Coulson was released by Barnsley at the end of the season , leaving him free to join up with Grimsby on a permanent basis , signing a two @-@ year contract on 31 May 2010 . In the third match of 2010 – 11 against Hayes & Yeading United on 21 August 2010 , he took a kick to his ankle , which was expected to keep him out of the team for a month . He returned on 18 September 2010 after starting in a 2 – 1 defeat at home to Fleetwood Town , but was substituted at half @-@ time . Coulson 's made a goalscoring second comeback from his ankle injury in Grimsby 's 2 – 2 draw with Eastbourne Borough on 30 October 2010 . For the first time as a Grimsby player he scored twice in one game in a 2 – 1 victory at home to AFC Wimbledon on 5 March 2011 , with a first half strike into the bottom left of the goal and a second half goal in the top @-@ left corner from inside the box . Coulson 's first season as a permanent Grimsby player concluded having scored nine goals in 33 appearances . 
 His first goal of 2011 – 12 came with the winner in Grimsby 's 1 – 0 away win at Forest Green Rovers on 3 September 2011 after capitalising on a defensive mistake . Coulson was handed a one @-@ match suspension after accumulating five yellow cards , missing the game against Newport County on 19 November . He made an immediate return to the Grimsby line @-@ up , starting in their 1 – 0 home win to League Two side Port Vale in the FA Cup first round on 22 November 2011 . His first two @-@ goal haul of the season came in a 3 – 0 victory at home to Darlington in the FA Trophy first round on 10 December 2011 , scoring Grimsby 's first and third goals . It was announced on 23 April 2012 that Coulson had rejected a new two @-@ year contract on reduced terms with Grimsby , meaning he would leave the club at the end of the season . Having been left out of the squad for Grimsby 's final two games of the season , Coulson spoke that he was saddened by the manner of his departure , saying " It would have been nice to go out on a high " . He finished his final season at Grimsby with 52 appearances and 10 goals .

Coulson missed York 's first penalty in the ensuing penalty shoot @-@ out , which the side went on to lose 4 – 2 . He then played in York 's first Football League fixture since their promotion , a 3 – 1 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012 . After picking up a cruciate ligament injury during York 's game against Accrington Stanley on 23 October 2012 , Coulson was expected to be out for the rest of 2012 – 13 .

 = Meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma = 
 The meteorological history of Hurricane Wilma , the most intense known tropical cyclone in the Atlantic basin , began in the second week of October 2005 . A large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the Caribbean Sea and gradually organized to the southeast of Jamaica . By late on October 15 , the system was sufficiently organized for the National Hurricane Center to designate it as Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Four . 
 The depression drifted southwestward , and under favorable conditions , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Wilma on October 17 . Initially , development was slow due to its large size , though convection steadily organized . From October 18 , and through the following day , Wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the Caribbean ; in a 30 @-@ hour period , the system 's central atmospheric pressure dropped from 982 mbar ( 29 @.@ 00 inHg ) to the record @-@ low value of 882 mbar ( 26 @.@ 05 inHg ) , while the winds increased to 185 mph ( 298 km / h ) . At its peak intensity , the eye of Wilma was about 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) in diameter , the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane . After the inner eye dissipated due to an eyewall replacement cycle , Hurricane Wilma weakened to Category 4 status , and on October 21 , it made landfall on Cozumel and on the Mexican mainland with winds of about 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . 
 Wilma weakened over the Yucatán Peninsula , and reached the southern Gulf of Mexico before accelerating northeastward . Despite increasing amounts of vertical wind shear , the hurricane re @-@ strengthened to hit Cape Romano , Florida , as a major hurricane . Wilma weakened as it quickly crossed the state , and entered the Atlantic Ocean near Jupiter , Florida . The hurricane again re @-@ intensified before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection . By October 26 , it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and the next day , the remnants of Wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada . 
 = = Formation = = 
 During the second week of October , an unusually large , monsoon @-@ like lower @-@ level circulation and a broad area of disturbed weather developed over much of the Caribbean Sea . The system was enhanced by diffluence from an upper @-@ level low across the southwestern Atlantic . By October 13 , a broad area of low pressure developed and persisted about 150 miles ( 240 km ) southeast of Jamaica , possibly aided by the passage of tropical waves through the area at the time . Convection increased and became slightly better organized , though upper @-@ level wind shear initially prevented development . The system drifted westward , and early on October 14 the convection became more concentrated and a little better organized as upper @-@ level wind shear lessened slightly . 
 Later on October 14 , the system became much better defined , with increasingly organized shower and thunderstorm activity , as conditions in the upper levels of the atmosphere became significantly more favorable . It was then that the National Hurricane Center first indicated that it was possible for a tropical depression to develop in the area . Dvorak classifications were initiated on October 15 . The system continued to organize , with the National Hurricane Center remarking the system could ultimately become a hurricane . By late on October 15 , the surface circulation became defined well enough , with sufficiently organized deep convection , for the National Hurricane Center to designate the system as Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Four while it was located about 220 miles ( 350 km ) east @-@ southeast of Grand Cayman . 
 The depression tracked slowly westward , a motion due to weak steering currents caused by a high pressure area to its north across the Gulf of Mexico . Initially , the center of circulation was broad without a defined inner core ; forecaster Lixion Avila remarked , " The area of minimum pressure could [ have been ] anywhere within 60 miles ( 97 km ) of its [ initial advisory position ] . " Initially , the tropical depression was forecast to drift west @-@ southwestward before turning to the north ; within five days of the forecast 's issuance , the system was predicted to be located about 80 miles ( 130 km ) south of the Isle of Youth as a 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) hurricane . However , the National Hurricane Center noted in the first advisory on the depression that there were " all indications that there could a dangerous hurricane in the northwestern Caribbean Sea in 3 to 5 days . " This was due to the depression being located within an environment very conducive for development , specifically low amounts of wind shear and very warm water temperatures . 
 As Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ Four drifted southwestward , it steadily organized ; by early on October 16 , rainbands began to gradually consolidate with well @-@ established outflow , and a large upper @-@ level anticyclone developed over the depression . Although deep convection and banding features increased , mid @-@ level dry air from the north prevented significant organization , and the convection was split into two primary areas . Surface buoy reports indicated that , due to its large size , the system failed to strengthen beyond tropical depression status , even though it received tropical storm strength Dvorak classifications from The National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Satellite Analysis Branch . Continued reconnaissance flights reported peak winds of about 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) . 
 = = Peak strength = = 
 By early on October 17 , the outer rainbands , which had previously dominated the structure of the cyclone , dissipated , while deep convection developed near and to the south of the center . Computer models predicted steady strengthening as the depression tracked westward before turning to the north . Of the intensity models , the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted an intensity of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) within 36 hours , with other forecasts being more conservative in their predictions . Deep convection continued to develop to the south of the center , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Wilma at 0600 UTC on October 17 , while located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) southeast of Grand Cayman . Upon becoming a tropical storm , the National Hurricane Center predicted Wilma to track west @-@ northwestward , reaching winds of 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) before striking the northeastern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula . 
 The storm continued to the southwest while deep convection persisted near the center . National Hurricane Center forecaster James Franklin remarked , " Confidence at the later ranges [ of the forecast track ] was unusually low " , due to wide divergences between computer models . Late on October 17 , a Hurricane Hunters flight into Wilma recorded winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , but an unusually low pressure of 989 mbar ( 29 @.@ 21 inHg ) , which would be more typical of a minimal hurricane . This was due to unusually low pressures across the region , which resulted in a lesser pressure gradient and thus lighter winds . Convection continued to develop near the center and became much more symmetrical . 
 Tropical Storm Wilma began to turn to the west @-@ northwest on October 18 , during which the storm developed a small , intermittent and ragged eye feature . It continued to intensify , and at 1200 UTC on October 18 , Wilma attained hurricane status while located about 225 miles ( 362 km ) south @-@ southeast of Grand Cayman . Shortly after reaching hurricane strength , the hurricane began undergoing explosive deepening , after the development of a " pinhole " eye 9 miles ( 14 km ) in diameter . This small eye was surrounded by a ring of deep convection , with cloud @-@ top temperatures of about − 125 ° F ( − 87 ° C ) . 
 Early on October 19 , Wilma attained major hurricane status while continuing to rapidly intensify , and by 0600 UTC , the storm 's maximum sustained winds increased to 165 mph ( 266 km / h ) , making Wilma a dangerous Category 5 storm on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . In the span of just 24 hours , Wilma had intensified from a 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) tropical storm to a 175 mph ( 282 km / h ) Category 5 hurricane , an unprecedented event for an Atlantic hurricane . The eye continued to contract to a diameter of about 2 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) , the smallest known eye in an Atlantic hurricane , and at 1200 UTC on October 19 , Wilma attained peak winds of 185 mph ( 298 km / h ) . The central pressure rapidly dropped 54 mbar ( 1 @.@ 65 inHg ) from 0000 to 0600 UTC , and at 0800 UTC , a Hurricane Hunters flight recorded a minimum central pressure of 884 mbar ( 26 @.@ 10 inHg ) in a dropsonde near the center of the extremely small eye . As the dropsonde did not reach the calm winds in the center , the pressure was estimated at 882 mbar ( 26 @.@ 05 inHg ) , the lowest pressure in an Atlantic hurricane on record . The pressure continued to fall as the Hurricane Hunters left the hurricane , and it is possible the pressure was slightly lower . Operationally , the peak intensity was estimated at 175 mph ( 282 km / h ) . At the time of its peak intensity , hurricane @-@ force winds extended only 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the small center of Wilma , with tropical storm force winds extending only about 160 miles ( 260 km ) . 
 = = First landfall = = 
 Shortly after peaking in intensity , the coldest cloud tops surrounding the eye warmed slightly and an outer eyewall began to develop , signifying an eyewall replacement cycle was occurring . By late on October 19 , the winds in Hurricane Wilma decreased to 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) as the inner 5 @-@ mile ( 8 km ) wide eye weakened and the wind field expanded . Early on October 20 the hurricane weakened to Category 4 status after the small , inner eye dissipated and the 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) wide outer eyewall became the dominant eye . At the time , the pressure measured 892 mbar ( 26 @.@ 34 inHg ) , the second @-@ lowest known pressure for a Category 4 hurricane ( Super Typhoon Judy had an 887 mb pressure at peak intensity ) , and Wilma retained the large eyewall as it turned northwestward . Initially , the hurricane was forecast to re @-@ intensify into a Category 5 hurricane , with one forecast predicting it to make landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula with winds of 165 mph ( 266 km / h ) , though Wilma remained a strong Category 4 hurricane as it tracked northwestward . 
 Steering currents remained weak , though a series of troughs eroded the high pressure system across the Gulf of Mexico , resulting in a turn towards the north @-@ northwest . Environmental conditions remained favorable , with the eye becoming more distinct early on October 21 . At about 2145 UTC on October 21 , Wilma made landfall on the island of Cozumel with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . It weakened slightly as it continued northwestward , and struck the Mexican mainland near Puerto Morelos , Quintana Roo , at 0330 UTC on October 22 , with winds of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) and gusts of up to 170 mph ( 270 km / h ) . 
 = = Second landfall and demise = = 
 On October 22 , the mid @-@ level ridge to the north of Wilma essentially dissipated , leaving the hurricane drifting northward across the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula . As the hurricane moved further inland , the eye became cloud @-@ filled as the deepest convection began to warm , and the winds gradually weakened during its passage over land . About 26 hours after making landfall on Cozumel , Wilma emerged into the southern Gulf of Mexico near Cabo Catoche with winds of about 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Upon reaching open waters , Reconnaissance Aircraft reported the remains of an inner eyewall and an outer eyewall oscillating between 70 and 90 miles ( 110 and 140 km ) in diameter . Convection deepened around the eyewalls , and the inner core of convection , which had previously become disrupted over land , became slightly better defined . 
 A powerful eastward @-@ moving mid @-@ level trough across the central United States turned the hurricane northeastward and caused it to gradually accelerate . Vertical wind shear increased as strong upper @-@ level southwesterly flow increased , though in spite of the shear Wilma continued to intensify . Early on October 24 , Wilma attained major hurricane status while located about 120 miles ( 190 km ) west @-@ southwest of Key West , Florida . It gradually became better organized , with the large 50 miles ( 80 km ) eye becoming very distinct on satellite and radar imagery . Wilma was able to retain its strength because large eyes in tropical cyclones are more stable and more resistant to vertical wind shear . Despite wind shear values of about 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) , Wilma strengthened further to reach winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . It weakened slightly as it approached Florida , and made landfall at Cape Romano with winds of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) at around 1030 UTC on October 24 . 
 Hurricane Wilma crossed the Florida peninsula in about 4 @.@ 5 hours while continuing to accelerate northeastward , and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) hurricane near Jupiter . A vigorous cold front associated with the mid @-@ level trough moved across the area to the west of Wilma , yet the cooler and drier air behind the front could not fully penetrate the inner core of the hurricane to weaken it . Shortly after exiting the Florida coastline , Wilma began to re @-@ intensify , believed to be due to a reduction of friction of the eyewall and warm waters of the Gulf Stream . Early on October 25 , the hurricane reached a secondary peak intensity of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) while located about 340 miles ( 550 km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . During the time , the large circulation of Wilma absorbed the much smaller Tropical Depression Alpha over the Bahamas . 
 Shortly after its secondary peak intensity , the wind shear , combined with its rapid forward motion of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , resulted in a steady weakening trend . The overall cloud pattern began to deteriorate , with the eye becoming less distinct and the convection less symmetric . By 1117 UTC on October 25 , the center was located to the northwest of the primary convection as cold air from the southwest entrained the circulation . The remaining convection continued to diminish , and by late on October 25 Wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located about 230 miles ( 370 km ) southeast of Halifax , Nova Scotia , and still at Category 1 intensity . The weakening extratropical remnant turned to the east @-@ northeast before being absorbed by another extratropical storm over Atlantic Canada on October 27 .

 Mississippi Highway 5 ( MS 5 ) is a state highway in Benton County , Mississippi . It runs 26 @.@ 929 mi ( 43 @.@ 338 km ) from MS 178 in Hickory Flat north to U.S. Route 72 ( US 72 ) to the south of Michigan City . The route runs through the Holly Springs National Forest for much of its length and passes through Ashland . To the south of Ashland , MS 5 has a concurrency with MS 4 . The MS 5 designation was first used by 1932 for an unpaved road between Hickory Flat and the Tennessee border in Michigan City . In 1943 , the northern terminus was cut back to US 72 . MS 5 was completely paved by 1951 and has retained its current alignment since then . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MS 5 begins at an intersection with MS 178 in the community of Hickory Flat , which is within the Holly Springs National Forest . The route heads north from this point on a two @-@ lane undivided road through dense forests with some fields and homes . After a junction with the western terminus of MS 2 , the highway continues through rural land and passes a few lakes . After crossing the Tippah River , MS 5 reaches the MS 4 intersection and forms a concurrency with that route . 
 The two routes leave the boundaries of the Holly Springs National Forest , passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes and coming to the community of Ashland . Here , MS 4 splits from MS 5 by turning to the west , and MS 5 becomes Boundary Drive , which runs by businesses and homes . The road intersects the western terminus of MS 370 before it leaves Ashland . The route heads into agricultural areas with some woodland and homes , making a turn to the northwest before resuming north . MS 5 comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with US 72 located to the south of Michigan City . MS 5 is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 .

 What is now MS 5 originally existed as an unnumbered unpaved road by 1928 . The MS 5 designation was assigned by 1932 for the road running from US 78 in Hickory Flat to the Tennessee border in Michigan City , where it connected to SR 18 . This road was a gravel road south of Ashland and an earth road north of Ashland . Two years later , the portion north of Ashland became a gravel road . In 1943 , the northern terminus of MS 5 was cut back to its current location at US 72 , with MS 7 connecting to SR 18 at the Tennessee border . By 1948 , the portion of route south of Ashland was paved . The remainder of the route was paved three years later . Since then , the route has not undergone any alignment changes .

 = Ecology = 
 Ecology ( from Greek : <unk> , " house " , or " environment " ; -λογία , " study of " ) is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment . It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology , geography , and Earth science . Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other , other organisms , and with abiotic components of their environment . Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity , distribution , amount ( biomass ) , and number ( population ) of particular organisms , as well as cooperation and competition between organisms , both within and among ecosystems . Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms , the communities they make up , and the non @-@ living components of their environment . Ecosystem processes , such as primary production , <unk> , nutrient cycling , and various niche construction activities , regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment . These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits , and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity . Biodiversity , which refers to the varieties of species , genes , and ecosystems , enhances certain ecosystem services . 
 Ecology is not synonymous with environment , environmentalism , natural history , or environmental science . It is closely related to evolutionary biology , genetics , and ethology . An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function . Ecologists seek to explain : 
 Life processes , interactions , and adaptations 
 The movement of materials and energy through living communities 
 The successional development of ecosystems 
 The abundance and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the environment . 
 Ecology is a human science as well . There are many practical applications of ecology in conservation biology , wetland management , natural resource management ( <unk> , agriculture , forestry , agroforestry , fisheries ) , city planning ( urban ecology ) , community health , economics , basic and applied science , and human social interaction ( human ecology ) . For example , the Circles of Sustainability approach treats ecology as more than the environment ' out there ' . It is not treated as separate from humans . Organisms ( including humans ) and resources compose ecosystems which , in turn , maintain biophysical feedback mechanisms that moderate processes acting on living ( biotic ) and non @-@ living ( abiotic ) components of the planet . Ecosystems sustain life @-@ supporting functions and produce natural capital like biomass production ( food , fuel , fiber , and medicine ) , the regulation of climate , global biogeochemical cycles , water filtration , soil formation , erosion control , flood protection , and many other natural features of scientific , historical , economic , or intrinsic value . 
 The word " ecology " ( " <unk> " ) was coined in 1866 by the German scientist Ernst Haeckel ( 1834 – 1919 ) . Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy , particularly from ethics and politics . Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle laid the foundations of ecology in their studies on natural history . Modern ecology became a much more rigorous science in the late 19th century . Evolutionary concepts relating to adaptation and natural selection became the cornerstones of modern ecological theory . 
 = = Integrative levels , scope , and scale of organization = = 
 The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro @-@ level ( e.g. , cells ) to a planetary scale ( e.g. , biosphere ) phenomena . Ecosystems , for example , contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms ( i.e. , individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities ) . Ecosystems are dynamic , they do not always follow a linear successional path , but they are always changing , sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest . An ecosystem 's area can vary greatly , from tiny to vast . A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem , but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it . Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf . Each of those aphids , in turn , support diverse bacterial communities . The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation , because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole . Some ecological principles , however , do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole , such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame . 
 = = = Hierarchical ecology = = = 
 The scale of ecological dynamics can operate like a closed system , such as aphids migrating on a single tree , while at the same time remain open with regard to broader scale influences , such as atmosphere or climate . Hence , ecologists classify ecosystems hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units , such as vegetation associations , climate , and soil types , and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional , landscape , and chronological scales . 
 To structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework , the biological world is organized into a nested hierarchy , ranging in scale from genes , to cells , to tissues , to organs , to organisms , to species , to populations , to communities , to ecosystems , to biomes , and up to the level of the biosphere . This framework forms a <unk> and exhibits non @-@ linear behaviors ; this means that " effect and cause are disproportionate , so that small changes to critical variables , such as the number of nitrogen <unk> , can lead to disproportionate , perhaps irreversible , changes in the system properties . " 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 Biodiversity ( an abbreviation of " biological diversity " ) describes the diversity of life from genes to ecosystems and spans every level of biological organization . The term has several interpretations , and there are many ways to index , measure , characterize , and represent its complex organization . Biodiversity includes species diversity , ecosystem diversity , and genetic diversity and scientists are interested in the way that this diversity affects the complex ecological processes operating at and among these respective levels . Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem services which by definition maintain and improve human quality of life . Preventing species extinctions is one way to preserve biodiversity and that goal rests on techniques that preserve genetic diversity , habitat and the ability for species to migrate . Conservation priorities and management techniques require different approaches and considerations to address the full ecological scope of biodiversity . Natural capital that supports populations is critical for maintaining ecosystem services and species migration ( e.g. , riverine fish runs and avian insect control ) has been implicated as one mechanism by which those service losses are experienced . An understanding of biodiversity has practical applications for species and ecosystem @-@ level conservation planners as they make management recommendations to consulting firms , governments , and industry . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 The habitat of a species describes the environment over which a species is known to occur and the type of community that is formed as a result . More specifically , " habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions , each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable ; that is , any component or characteristic of the environment related directly ( e.g. forage biomass and quality ) or indirectly ( e.g. elevation ) to the use of a location by the animal . " For example , a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem . Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy . For example , one population of a species of tropical lizards ( <unk> hispidus ) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna . The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage . Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians , and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats . <unk> and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably , but the former applies to a community 's environment , whereas the latter applies to a species ' environment . 
 Additionally , some species are ecosystem engineers , altering the environment within a localized region . For instance , beavers manage water levels by building dams which improves their habitat in a landscape . 
 = = = Niche = = = 
 Definitions of the niche date back to 1917 , but G. Evelyn Hutchinson made conceptual advances in 1957 by introducing a widely adopted definition : " the set of biotic and abiotic conditions in which a species is able to persist and maintain stable population sizes . " The ecological niche is a central concept in the ecology of organisms and is sub @-@ divided into the fundamental and the realized niche . The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist . The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists . The <unk> niche is defined more technically as a " Euclidean hyperspace whose dimensions are defined as environmental variables and whose size is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has positive fitness . " 
 Biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species ' traits and niche requirements . Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche . A trait is a measurable property , phenotype , or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival . Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits . Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment . This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range . The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource ; one will always out @-@ compete the other . When similarly adapted species overlap geographically , closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements . Some models and empirical studies , however , suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co @-@ evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species @-@ rich communities . The habitat plus the niche is called the <unk> , which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species . 
 = = = Niche construction = = = 
 Organisms are subject to environmental pressures , but they also modify their habitats . The regulatory feedback between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local ( e.g. , a beaver pond ) to global scales , over time and even after death , such as decaying logs or silica skeleton deposits from marine organisms . The process and concept of ecosystem engineering is related to niche construction , but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection . Ecosystem engineers are defined as : " organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species , by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials . In so doing they modify , maintain and create habitats . " 
 The ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process . The term " niche construction " is more often used in reference to the under @-@ appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche . An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of social insects , including ants , bees , wasps , and termites . There is an emergent homeostasis or <unk> in the structure of the nest that regulates , maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony . Termite mounds , for example , maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air @-@ conditioning chimneys . The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection . Moreover , a nest can survive over successive generations , so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Biomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth 's ecosystems , mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation . There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate , precipitation , weather and other environmental variables . Biomes include tropical rainforest , temperate broadleaf and mixed forest , temperate deciduous forest , taiga , tundra , hot desert , and polar desert . Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes , such as the human and oceanic <unk> . To a microbe , the human body is a habitat and a landscape . <unk> were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics , which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet . The oceanic microbiome plays a significant role in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet 's oceans . 
 = = = Biosphere = = = 
 The largest scale of ecological organization is the biosphere : the total sum of ecosystems on the planet . Ecological relationships regulate the flux of energy , nutrients , and climate all the way up to the planetary scale . For example , the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere 's CO2 and O2 composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis , with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals . Ecological theory has also been used to explain self @-@ emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale : for example , the Gaia hypothesis is an example of holism applied in ecological theory . The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent feedback loop generated by the metabolism of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self @-@ regulating range of tolerance . 
 = = = Individual ecology = = = 
 Understanding traits of individual organisms helps explain patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations , communities , and ecosystems . Several areas of ecology of evolution that focus on such traits are life history theory , <unk> , metabolic theory of ecology , and Ethology . Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity , life span , or metabolic costs of reproduction . Other traits may be related to structure , such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish , or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding . Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate , resource uptake rate , winter , and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs . 
 One set of characteristics relate to body size and temperature . The metabolic theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set of relationships between an organism ’ s body size and temperature and metabolic processes . In general , smaller , warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and this results in a variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates , reproduction and population growth rates , population size , and resource uptake rates . 
 The traits of organisms are subject to change through acclimation , development , and evolution . For this reason , individuals form a shared focus for ecology and for evolutionary ecology . 
 = = = Population ecology = = = 
 Population ecology studies the dynamics of specie populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment . A population consists of individuals of the same species that live , interact , and migrate through the same niche and habitat . 
 A primary law of population ecology is the Malthusian growth model which states , " a population will grow ( or decline ) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant . " Simplified population models usually start with four variables : death , birth , immigration , and emigration . 
 An example of an introductory population model describes a closed population , such as on an island , where immigration and emigration does not take place . Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that random processes create the observed data . In these island models , the rate of population change is described by : 
 <formula> 
 where N is the total number of individuals in the population , b and d are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively , and r is the per capita rate of population change . 
 Using these modelling techniques , Malthus ' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the logistic equation : 
 <formula> 
 where N is the number of individuals measured as biomass density , a is the maximum per @-@ capita rate of change , and K is the carrying capacity of the population . The formula states that the rate of change in population size ( <unk> / dT ) is equal to growth ( <unk> ) that is limited by carrying capacity ( 1 – N / K ) . 
 Population ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations . Commonly used types of data include life history , fecundity , and survivorship , and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as matrix algebra . The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas . In cases where basic models are insufficient , ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods , such as the <unk> information criterion , or use models that can become mathematically complex as " several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with the data . " 
 = = = = <unk> and migration = = = = 
 The concept of metapopulations was defined in 1969 as " a population of populations which go extinct locally and recolonize " . Metapopulation ecology is another statistical approach that is often used in conservation research . Metapopulation models simplify the landscape into patches of varying levels of quality , and metapopulations are linked by the migratory behaviours of organisms . Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement ; because , it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat . Migration is also a population @-@ level phenomenon , as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post @-@ glacial environments . Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and <unk> in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates . These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another . There is a larger taxonomy of movement , such as commuting , foraging , territorial behaviour , stasis , and ranging . Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration ; because , it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population . 
 In metapopulation terminology , migrating individuals are classed as emigrants ( when they leave a region ) or immigrants ( when they enter a region ) , and sites are classed either as sources or sinks . A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations , such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest . Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of juveniles that migrate to other patch locations . Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants ; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable . Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology . The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization . Small patches of lower quality ( i.e. , sinks ) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants . A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year , where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable . Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and field studies to explain metapopulation structure . 
 = = = Community ecology = = = 
 Community ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area . Community ecologists study the determinants of patterns and processes for two or more interacting species . Research in community ecology might measure species diversity in grasslands in relation to soil fertility . It might also include the analysis of predator @-@ prey dynamics , competition among similar plant species , or mutualistic interactions between crabs and corals . 
 = = = Ecosystem ecology = = = 
 Ecosystems may be habitats within biomes that form an integrated whole and a dynamically responsive system having both physical and biological complexes . Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials ( e.g. carbon , phosphorus ) between different pools ( e.g. , tree biomass , soil organic material ) . Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes . Research in ecosystem ecology might measure primary production ( g C / m ^ 2 ) in a wetland in relation to decomposition and consumption rates ( g C / m ^ 2 / y ) . This requires an understanding of the community connections between plants ( i.e. , primary producers ) and the decomposers ( e.g. , fungi and bacteria ) , 
 The underlying concept of ecosystem can be traced back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ( " Man and Nature " ) . Within an ecosystem , organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted . Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self @-@ organizing patterns across different scales of time and space . Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial , freshwater , atmospheric , or marine . Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each . A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are <unk> , which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity . 
 = = = = Food webs = = = = 
 A food web is the archetypal ecological network . Plants capture solar energy and use it to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis . As plants grow , they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores , and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption . The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain . The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web . Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows . 
 Food webs are often limited relative to the real world . Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat , such as a cave or a pond , and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems . Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms , which can be difficult to decipher , or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web . Despite these limitations , food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems . 
 Food webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships : some species have many weak feeding links ( e.g. , omnivores ) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links ( e.g. , primary predators ) . Theoretical and empirical studies identify non @-@ random emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time . Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions , and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups . This increases food web stability . Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated . 
 = = = = Trophic levels = = = = 
 A trophic level ( from Greek <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , meaning " food " or " feeding " ) is " a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the adjacent level nearer the abiotic source . " Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or <unk> among species . Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids , in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators , and the horizontal dimension represents the abundance or biomass at each level . When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level , they naturally sort into a ' pyramid of numbers ' . 
 Species are broadly categorized as autotrophs ( or primary producers ) , heterotrophs ( or consumers ) , and <unk> ( or decomposers ) . Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food ( production is greater than respiration ) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis . Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy ( respiration exceeds production ) . Heterotrophs can be further sub @-@ divided into different functional groups , including primary consumers ( strict herbivores ) , secondary consumers ( carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores ) , and tertiary consumers ( predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators ) . <unk> do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues . It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators , because compared to herbivores , they are relatively inefficient at grazing . 
 Trophic levels are part of the holistic or complex systems view of ecosystems . Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions , giving a macroscopic view of the system . While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top @-@ down control within food webs , it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems . This has led some ecologists to " reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete , homogeneous trophic levels is fiction . " Nonetheless , recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist , but " above the herbivore trophic level , food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores . " 
 = = = = Keystone species = = = = 
 A keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food @-@ web . Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role . The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities . The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics , other food web connections , and can cause the extinction of other species . 
 Sea otters ( Enhydra lutris ) are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species ; because , they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp . If sea otters are removed from the system , the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear , and this has a dramatic effect on community structure . Hunting of sea otters , for example , is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller 's sea cow ( <unk> gigas ) . While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool , it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance . It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem . Furthermore , food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common , so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied . 
 = = Ecological complexity = = 
 Complexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind . Global patterns of biological diversity are complex . This <unk> stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other , such as transitional areas or ecotones spanning landscapes . Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy , and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts . " What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one . " Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena , otherwise captured in the expression ( coined by Aristotle ) ' the sum is greater than the parts ' . 
 " Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types : spatial , temporal , structural , process , behavioral , and geometric . " From these principles , ecologists have identified emergent and self @-@ organizing phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence , ranging from molecular to planetary , and these require different explanations at each integrative level . Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady @-@ states directed by random fluctuations of history . Long @-@ term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales . These studies are managed by the International Long Term Ecological Network ( <unk> ) . The longest experiment in existence is the Park Grass Experiment , which was initiated in 1856 . Another example is the Hubbard Brook study , which has been in operation since 1960 . 
 = = = Holism = = = 
 Holism remains a critical part of the theoretical foundation in contemporary ecological studies . Holism addresses the biological organization of life that self @-@ organizes into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non @-@ reducible properties . This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system , such as an ecosystem , cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts . " New properties emerge because the components interact , not because the basic nature of the components is changed . " 
 Ecological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to <unk> . Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology : 1 ) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems , 2 ) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system , which leads to 3 ) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts . Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term . An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species . The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells . 
 = = Relation to evolution = = 
 Ecology and evolution are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences . Natural selection , life history , development , adaptation , populations , and inheritance are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory . Morphological , behavioural , and genetic traits , for example , can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances . In this framework , the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize , classify , and investigate life through common systematic principals , such as phylogenetics or the Linnaean system of taxonomy . The two disciplines often appear together , such as in the title of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution . There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution , and they differ more in their areas of applied focus . Both disciplines discover and explain emergent and unique properties and processes operating across different spatial or temporal scales of organization . While the boundary between ecology and evolution is not always clear , ecologists study the abiotic and biotic factors that influence evolutionary processes , and evolution can be rapid , occurring on ecological timescales as short as one generation . 
 = = = Behavioural ecology = = = 
 All organisms can exhibit behaviours . Even plants express complex behaviour , including memory and communication . Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism 's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications . Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals . This could include investigations of motile sperm of plants , mobile phytoplankton , zooplankton swimming toward the female egg , the cultivation of fungi by weevils , the mating dance of a salamander , or social gatherings of amoeba . 
 Adaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology . Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can . Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness . 
 Predator @-@ prey interactions are an introductory concept into food @-@ web studies as well as behavioural ecology . Prey species can exhibit different kinds of behavioural adaptations to predators , such as avoid , flee , or defend . Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed . To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats , organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history , such as growth , feeding , mating , socializing , or modifying their habitat . Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation , optimization , or efficiency . For example , " [ t ] he threat @-@ sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk " or " [ t ] he optimal flight initiation distance occurs where expected <unk> fitness is maximized , which depends on the prey 's initial fitness , benefits obtainable by not fleeing , energetic escape costs , and expected fitness loss due to predation risk . " 
 Elaborate sexual displays and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals . The birds @-@ of @-@ paradise , for example , sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship . These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well @-@ adapted individuals and desirable genes . The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors . 
 = = = Cognitive ecology = = = 
 Cognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from evolutionary ecology and neurobiology , primarily cognitive science , in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework . " Until recently , however , cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings . With consideration of the selection pressure on cognition , cognitive ecology can contribute intellectual coherence to the multidisciplinary study of cognition . " As a study involving the ' coupling ' or interactions between organism and environment , cognitive ecology is closely related to enactivism , a field based upon the view that " ... we must see the organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification and selection ... " . 
 = = = Social ecology = = = 
 Social ecological behaviours are notable in the social insects , slime moulds , social spiders , human society , and naked mole @-@ rats where <unk> has evolved . Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection . Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships , whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives . The social insects , including ants , bees , and wasps are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make @-@ up as every other male in the colony . In contrast , group <unk> find examples of altruism among non @-@ genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group ; whereby , it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another . Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members . 
 = = = Coevolution = = = 
 Ecological interactions can be classified broadly into a host and an associate relationship . A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate . Relationships within a species that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms . Examples of mutualism include fungus @-@ growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis , bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms , the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex , lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae , and corals with photosynthetic algae . If there is a physical connection between host and associate , the relationship is called symbiosis . Approximately 60 % of all plants , for example , have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients . 
 Indirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart . For example , trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet . This relationship is called commensalism ; because , many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen . If the associate benefits while the host suffers , the relationship is called parasitism . Although parasites impose a cost to their host ( e.g. , via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules , denying the services of a beneficial partner ) , their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and , thus , becomes difficult to forecast . Co @-@ evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism , such as grasses competing for growth space . The Red Queen Hypothesis , for example , posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure . 
 = = = Biogeography = = = 
 Biogeography ( an amalgamation of biology and geography ) is the comparative study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time . The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974 . Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots . For example , the theory of island biogeography , published by the mathematician Robert MacArthur and ecologist Edward O. Wilson in 1967 is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory . 
 Biogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals . Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies . Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions , such as migration and <unk> and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas . The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth 's biota . The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub @-@ discipline of biogeography . There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes . For example , the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming . 
 = = = = r / K @-@ Selection theory = = = = 
 A population ecology concept is r / K selection theory , one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain life @-@ history evolution . The premise behind the r / K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density . For example , when an island is first colonized , density of individuals is low . The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition , leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth . These early phases of population growth experience density @-@ independent forces of natural selection , which is called r @-@ selection . As the population becomes more crowded , it approaches the island 's carrying capacity , thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources . Under crowded conditions , the population experiences density @-@ dependent forces of natural selection , called K @-@ selection . 
 In the r / K @-@ selection model , the first variable r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable K is the carrying capacity of a population . Different species evolve different life @-@ history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces . An r @-@ selected species is one that has high birth rates , low levels of parental investment , and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity . Evolution favours high rates of fecundity in r @-@ selected species . Many kinds of insects and invasive species exhibit r @-@ selected characteristics . In contrast , a K @-@ selected species has low rates of fecundity , high levels of parental investment in the young , and low rates of mortality as individuals mature . Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting K @-@ selected characteristics , including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring . 
 = = = Molecular ecology = = = 
 The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis . Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies , such as the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992 . Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context . In 1994 , John <unk> also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book , Molecular Markers , Natural History and Evolution . Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint , such as bacteria , fungi , and nematodes . Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable . Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology . For example , molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous . In a biogeographical context , the marriage between genetics , ecology , and evolution resulted in a new sub @-@ discipline called phylogeography . 
 = = Human ecology = = 
 Ecology is as much a biological science as it is a human science . Human ecology is an interdisciplinary investigation into the ecology of our species . " Human ecology may be defined : ( 1 ) from a bio @-@ ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems ; ( 2 ) from a bio @-@ ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment ; and ( 3 ) as a human being , somehow different from animal life in general , interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way . A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three . " The term was formally introduced in 1921 , but many sociologists , geographers , psychologists , and other disciplines were interested in human relations to natural systems centuries prior , especially in the late 19th century . 
 The ecological complexities human beings are facing through the technological transformation of the planetary biome has brought on the Anthropocene . The unique set of circumstances has generated the need for a new unifying science called coupled human and natural systems that builds upon , but moves beyond the field of human ecology . Ecosystems tie into human societies through the critical and all encompassing life @-@ supporting functions they sustain . In recognition of these functions and the incapability of traditional economic valuation methods to see the value in ecosystems , there has been a surge of interest in social @-@ natural capital , which provides the means to put a value on the stock and use of information and materials stemming from ecosystem goods and services . Ecosystems produce , regulate , maintain , and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health ( cognitive and physiological ) , economies , and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world . Ecosystems relate importantly to human ecology as they are the ultimate base foundation of global economics as every commodity , and the capacity for exchange ultimately stems from the ecosystems on Earth . 
 = = = Restoration and management = = = 
 Ecology is an employed science of restoration , repairing disturbed sites through human intervention , in natural resource management , and in environmental impact assessments . Edward O. Wilson predicted in 1992 that the 21st century " will be the era of restoration in ecology " . Ecological science has boomed in the industrial investment of restoring ecosystems and their processes in abandoned sites after disturbance . Natural resource managers , in forestry , for example , employ ecologists to develop , adapt , and implement ecosystem based methods into the planning , operation , and restoration phases of land @-@ use . Ecological science is used in the methods of sustainable harvesting , disease , and fire outbreak management , in fisheries stock management , for integrating land @-@ use with protected areas and communities , and conservation in complex geo @-@ political landscapes . 
 = = Relation to the environment = = 
 The environment of ecosystems includes both physical parameters and biotic attributes . It is dynamically interlinked , and contains resources for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle . Like " ecology " , the term " environment " has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of " nature " . Environment " includes the physical world , the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation . " The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation , including abiotic factors such as temperature , radiation , light , chemistry , climate and geology . The biotic environment includes genes , cells , organisms , members of the same species ( conspecifics ) and other species that share a habitat . 
 The distinction between external and internal environments , however , is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality . There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life . The laws of thermodynamics , for example , apply to ecology by means of its physical state . With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles , a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem . In this way , the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated material parts . After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes ; however , they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole , or <unk> system as it was once called . This is known as the dialectical approach to ecology . The dialectical approach examines the parts , but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole ( or <unk> ) . Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem . 
 = = = Disturbance and resilience = = = 
 Ecosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space . A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community , such as a fire , flood , drought , or predation . Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods , and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates , species assemblages , and biomass densities within an ecological community . These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity . Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management . Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting as a kind of regenerative insurance . 
 = = = Metabolism and the early atmosphere = = = 
 The Earth was formed approximately 4 @.@ 5 billion years ago . As it cooled and a crust and oceans formed , its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia . Over the next billion years , the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into a mixture of carbon dioxide , nitrogen , and water vapor . These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth 's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat . There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and , in turn , the atmosphere also evolved . 
 Throughout history , the Earth 's atmosphere and biogeochemical cycles have been in a dynamic equilibrium with planetary ecosystems . The history is characterized by periods of significant transformation followed by millions of years of stability . The evolution of the earliest organisms , likely anaerobic methanogen microbes , started the process by converting atmospheric hydrogen into methane ( <unk> + CO2 → CH4 + 2H2O ) . <unk> photosynthesis reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane , by converting hydrogen sulfide into water or other sulfur compounds ( for example , <unk> + CO2 + <unk> → <unk> + H2O + 2S ) . Early forms of fermentation also increased levels of atmospheric methane . The transition to an oxygen @-@ dominant atmosphere ( the Great Oxidation ) did not begin until approximately 2 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 3 billion years ago , but photosynthetic processes started 0 @.@ 3 to 1 billion years prior . 
 = = = Radiation : heat , temperature and light = = = 
 The biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures . Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature . Heat affects growth rates , activity , behaviour , and primary production . Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation . The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet . Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity . <unk> , for example , have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment . In contrast , <unk> regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy . 
 There is a relationship between light , primary production , and ecological energy budgets . Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet 's ecosystems . Light is composed of electromagnetic energy of different wavelengths . Radiant energy from the sun generates heat , provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life , and also acts as a catalyst for genetic mutation . Plants , algae , and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through photosynthesis . Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of H2S are autotrophs . Autotrophs — responsible for primary production — assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as potential energy in the form of biochemical <unk> bonds . 
 = = = Physical environments = = = 
 = = = = Water = = = = 
 Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10 @,@ 000 times slower in water than in air . When soils are flooded , they quickly lose oxygen , becoming hypoxic ( an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg / liter ) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots . Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles . Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive , compete , and diversify in these environments . For example , their roots and stems contain large air spaces ( <unk> ) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases ( for example , CO2 and O2 ) used in respiration and photosynthesis . Salt water plants ( <unk> ) have additional specialized adaptations , such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and <unk> their internal salt ( NaCl ) concentrations , to live in estuarine , brackish , or oceanic environments . Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate , manganese ions , ferric ions , sulfate , carbon dioxide , and some organic compounds ; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier . The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation @-@ reduction potentials of the water . Carbon dioxide , for example , is reduced to methane ( CH4 ) by methanogenic bacteria . The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation . Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water . 
 = = = = Gravity = = = = 
 The shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces . On a large scale , the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion . These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth . On the organismal scale , gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth ( <unk> ) , orientation cues for animal migrations , and influence the biomechanics and size of animals . Ecological traits , such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves . The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms ( e.g. , height , size , shape ) , their behaviour ( e.g. , diving , running , flying ) , and the habitat occupied ( e.g. , water , hot deserts , cold tundra ) . 
 = = = = Pressure = = = = 
 Climatic and osmotic pressure places physiological constraints on organisms , especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes , or dive to deep ocean depths . These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere , as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences . For example , oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes . Water transportation by plants is another important <unk> process affected by osmotic pressure gradients . Water pressure in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions . For example , diving animals such as whales , dolphins , and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences . Differences between hagfish species provide another example of adaptation to deep @-@ sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations . 
 = = = = Wind and turbulence = = = = 
 Turbulent forces in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution , form and dynamics . On a planetary scale , ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global trade winds . Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat , nutrient , and biochemical profiles of ecosystems . For example , wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence , mixing the water column and influencing the environmental profile to create thermally layered zones , affecting how fish , algae , and other parts of the aquatic ecosystem are structured . Wind speed and turbulence also influence evapotranspiration rates and energy budgets in plants and animals . Wind speed , temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations . For example , the westerlies come into contact with the coastal and interior mountains of western North America to produce a rain shadow on the leeward side of the mountain . The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation ; this is called orographic lift and can cause precipitation . This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity , as species adapted to wetter conditions are range @-@ restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the xeric ecosystems ( e.g. , of the Columbia Basin in western North America ) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems . 
 = = = = Fire = = = = 
 Plants convert carbon dioxide into biomass and emit oxygen into the atmosphere . By approximately 350 million years ago ( the end of the Devonian period ) , photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17 % , which allowed combustion to occur . Fire releases CO2 and converts fuel into ash and tar . Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression . While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time , Charles Cooper brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s . 
 Native North Americans were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials . Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure , and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment . Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles . Plants , for example , are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires . Some species ( e.g. , Pinus halepensis ) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke . Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny . Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems . 
 = = = = Soils = = = = 
 Soil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet . It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions , and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology . The decomposition of dead organic matter ( for example , leaves on the forest floor ) , results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production . The whole of the planet 's soil ecosystems is called the <unk> where a large biomass of the Earth 's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels . Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves , for example , create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain . Collectively , these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation . Tree roots , fungi , bacteria , worms , ants , beetles , centipedes , spiders , mammals , birds , reptiles , amphibians , and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems . Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community . As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials , an ecological process called bioturbation . This <unk> soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production . Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem . No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils . <unk> studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period . Other events , such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period played a significant role in the early development of ecological <unk> in soils . 
 = = = = <unk> and climate = = = = 
 Ecologists study and measure nutrient budgets to understand how these materials are regulated , flow , and recycled through the environment . This research has led to an understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet , including minerals , soil , pH , ions , water , and atmospheric gases . Six major elements ( hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , sulfur , and phosphorus ; H , C , N , O , S , and P ) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth 's geochemical processes . From the smallest scale of biology , the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth . Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry . 
 The ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry . It is estimated that the Earth 's oceans hold 40 @,@ 000 gigatonnes ( Gt ) of carbon , that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt , and that fossil fuel emissions are 6 @.@ 3 Gt carbon per year . There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth 's history , regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land . For example , through the early @-@ mid Eocene volcanic outgassing , the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands , and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) concentrations to levels as high as 3500 ppm . 
 In the Oligocene , from twenty @-@ five to thirty @-@ two million years ago , there was another significant restructuring of the global carbon cycle as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis , C4 photosynthesis , and expanded their ranges . This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 550 ppm . The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change . Human @-@ driven modifications to the planet 's ecosystems ( e.g. , disturbance , biodiversity loss , agriculture ) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels . Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures , lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather , alter species distributions , and increase extinction rates . The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers , melting mountain ice caps , and rising sea levels . Consequently , species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate . Large sections of permafrost are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane ( CH4 ) emissions . There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle , because methane is a greenhouse gas that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long @-@ wave radiation than CO2 on a 100 @-@ year time scale . Hence , there is a relationship between global warming , decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early beginnings = = = 
 Ecology has a complex origin , due in large part to its interdisciplinary nature . Ancient Greek philosophers such as Hippocrates and Aristotle were among the first to record observations on natural history . However , they viewed life in terms of essentialism , where species were conceptualized as static unchanging things while varieties were seen as aberrations of an idealized type . This contrasts against the modern understanding of ecological theory where varieties are viewed as the real phenomena of interest and having a role in the origins of adaptations by means of natural selection . Early conceptions of ecology , such as a balance and regulation in nature can be traced to Herodotus ( died c . 425 BC ) , who described one of the earliest accounts of mutualism in his observation of " natural dentistry " . Basking Nile crocodiles , he noted , would open their mouths to give sandpipers safe access to pluck leeches out , giving nutrition to the sandpiper and oral hygiene for the crocodile . Aristotle was an early influence on the philosophical development of ecology . He and his student Theophrastus made extensive observations on plant and animal migrations , biogeography , physiology , and on their behaviour , giving an early analogue to the modern concept of an ecological niche . 
 Ecological concepts such as food chains , population regulation , and productivity were first developed in the 1700s , through the published works of microscopist Antoni van Leeuwenhoek ( 1632 – 1723 ) and botanist Richard Bradley ( 1688 ? – 1732 ) . <unk> Alexander von Humboldt ( 1769 – 1859 ) was an early pioneer in ecological thinking and was among the first to recognize ecological gradients , where species are replaced or altered in form along environmental gradients , such as a cline forming along a rise in elevation . Humboldt drew inspiration from Isaac Newton as he developed a form of " terrestrial physics " . In Newtonian fashion , he brought a scientific exactitude for measurement into natural history and even alluded to concepts that are the foundation of a modern ecological law on species @-@ to @-@ area relationships . Natural historians , such as Humboldt , James Hutton , and Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck ( among others ) laid the foundations of the modern ecological sciences . The term " ecology " ( German : <unk> , <unk> ) is of a more recent origin and was first coined by the German biologist Ernst Haeckel in his book <unk> <unk> der <unk> ( 1866 ) . Haeckel was a zoologist , artist , writer , and later in life a professor of comparative anatomy . 
 Opinions differ on who was the founder of modern ecological theory . Some mark Haeckel 's definition as the beginning ; others say it was Eugenius Warming with the writing of <unk> of Plants : An Introduction to the Study of Plant Communities ( 1895 ) , or Carl Linnaeus ' principles on the economy of nature that matured in the early 18th century . Linnaeus founded an early branch of ecology that he called the economy of nature . His works influenced Charles Darwin , who adopted Linnaeus ' phrase on the economy or polity of nature in The Origin of Species . Linnaeus was the first to frame the balance of nature as a testable hypothesis . Haeckel , who admired Darwin 's work , defined ecology in reference to the economy of nature , which has led some to question whether ecology and the economy of nature are synonymous . 
 From Aristotle until Darwin , the natural world was predominantly considered static and unchanging . Prior to The Origin of Species , there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms , their adaptations , and the environment . An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White ( 1720 – 1793 ) , considered by some to be one of the earliest texts on ecology . While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution , he was one of the founders of soil ecology , and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species . Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences . 
 = = = Since 1900 = = = 
 Modern ecology is a young science that first attracted substantial scientific attention toward the end of the 19th century ( around the same time that evolutionary studies were gaining scientific interest ) . Notable scientist Ellen Swallow Richards may have first introduced the term " <unk> " ( which eventually morphed into home economics ) in the U.S. as early 1892 . 
 In the early 20th century , ecology transitioned from a more descriptive form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history . Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905 , presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism . This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s . Clements ' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism . The <unk> paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason , who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms . This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the life histories of individual organisms and how this relates to the development of community associations . 
 The <unk> superorganism theory was an overextended application of an idealistic form of holism . The term " holism " was coined in 1926 by Jan Christiaan Smuts , a South African general and polarizing historical figure who was inspired by Clements ' superorganism concept . Around the same time , Charles Elton pioneered the concept of food chains in his classical book Animal Ecology . Elton defined ecological relations using concepts of food chains , food cycles , and food size , and described numerical relations among different functional groups and their relative abundance . Elton 's ' food cycle ' was replaced by ' food web ' in a subsequent ecological text . Alfred J. <unk> brought in many theoretical concepts applying thermodynamic principles to ecology . 
 In 1942 , Raymond Lindeman wrote a landmark paper on the trophic dynamics of ecology , which was published posthumously after initially being rejected for its theoretical emphasis . Trophic dynamics became the foundation for much of the work to follow on energy and material flow through ecosystems . Robert MacArthur advanced mathematical theory , predictions , and tests in ecology in the 1950s , which inspired a resurgent school of theoretical mathematical ecologists . Ecology also has developed through contributions from other nations , including Russia 's Vladimir Vernadsky and his founding of the biosphere concept in the 1920s and Japan 's Kinji <unk> and his concepts of harmony in nature and habitat segregation in the 1950s . Scientific recognition of contributions to ecology from non @-@ English @-@ speaking cultures is hampered by language and translation barriers . 
 Ecology surged in popular and scientific interest during the 1960 – 1970s environmental movement . There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology , environmental management , and protection . The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating the protection of wild places by notable ecologists in the history of conservation biology , such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley , have been seen as far removed from urban centres where , it is claimed , the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located . <unk> ( 2008 ) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology ( then called euthenics ) and brought about changes in environmental legislation . Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop , among others , were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s . 
 In 1962 , marine biologist and ecologist Rachel Carson 's book Silent Spring helped to mobilize the environmental movement by alerting the public to toxic pesticides , such as DDT , bioaccumulating in the environment . Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health . Since then , ecologists have worked to bridge their understanding of the degradation of the planet 's ecosystems with environmental politics , law , restoration , and natural resources management . 
 = Bob Meusel = 
 Robert William Meusel ( July 19 , 1896 – November 28 , 1977 ) was an American baseball left and right fielder who played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for eleven seasons from 1920 through 1930 , all but the last for the New York Yankees . He was best known as a member of the Yankees ' championship teams of the 1920s , nicknamed the " Murderers ' Row " , during which time the team won its first six American League ( AL ) pennants and first three World Series titles . 
 Meusel , noted for his strong outfield throwing arm , batted fifth behind Baseball Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig . In 1925 , he became the second Yankee , after Ruth , to lead the AL in the following offensive categories : home runs ( 33 ) , runs batted in ( 138 ) and extra base hits ( 79 ) . Nicknamed " Long Bob " because of his 6 @-@ foot , 3 inch ( 1 @.@ 91 m ) stature , Meusel batted .313 or better in seven of his first eight seasons , finishing with a .309 career average ; his 1 @,@ 005 RBI during the 1920s were the fourth most by any major leaguer , and trailed only Harry Heilmann 's total of 1 @,@ 131 among AL right @-@ handed hitters . Meusel ended his career in 1930 with the Cincinnati Reds . He hit for the cycle three times , and was the second of four major leaguers to accomplish this feat as many as three times during a career . 
 His older brother , Emil " Irish " Meusel , was a star outfielder in the National League ( NL ) during the same period , primarily for the New York Giants .

 Meusel was born in San Jose , California , the youngest of Charlie and Mary Meusel 's six children . At an early age he moved to Los Angeles , where he attended Los Angeles High School . Meusel started his career with the Vernon Tigers of the Pacific Coast League in 1917 . He joined the US Navy during World War I and played for the Navy baseball team . He went back to the Tigers for the 1919 season , batting .330 . He also played third base in the minors . 
 On December 14 , 1921 Meusel married Edith Cowan , with whom he had one daughter . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Meusel 's contract was purchased by the New York Yankees in early 1920 . After a productive spring training , Meusel replaced future Hall of Famer Frank Baker at third base . He played his first game on April 14 , 1920 . In his rookie season , Meusel had a .328 batting average with 11 home runs and 83 runs batted in over 119 games . He finished fourth in the league in doubles with 41 while sharing time with Duffy Lewis in left field . 
 In the 1921 season , Meusel started in 149 out of 154 games , primarily playing right field . He batted .318 , finishing second in the league in home runs with 24 and third in the league with 136 runs batted in . He hit for the cycle in a win against the Washington Senators on May 7 . In the second game of a September 5 doubleheader , he tied a major league record for outfielders ( previously accomplished by nine others ) by recording four assists . He broke a club record and tied Jack Tobin of the St. Louis Browns for the league lead in outfield assists with 28 ; he was considered to be one of the league 's best all @-@ around players . Meusel 's brother , Irish , was acquired by the New York Giants from the Philadelphia Phillies mid @-@ season , and helped lead the Giants to the pennant . The two brothers played against each other in the 1921 World Series where the Giants faced their tenants ( the Yankees played their home games in the Polo Grounds , the ball park owned by the Giants ) . Bob Meusel stole home in Game 3 of the Series . He doubled in Babe Ruth for the winning run in Game 5 for a one @-@ game lead , but the Yankees lost the next three games and the Series ( the last best @-@ of @-@ nine in World Series history ) . His batting average in those eight games was a mere .200 . 
 At the same time , Meusel , Bill Piercy , and Ruth signed up to play in a barnstorming tour . It was a violation of baseball rules at the time , and Meusel and Ruth had previously been warned about playing with the tour . As punishment , Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis suspended them for the first five weeks of the 1922 season and fined them their World Series cash share of $ 3 @,@ 362 ( $ 47 @,@ 529 today ) each . That season Meusel only played in 121 games , hitting .319 with 16 home runs and 84 runs batted in as he gradually shifted to left field to allow Ruth to instead play right field . Meusel occasionally played right field in Yankees games away from home to protect Ruth from the sun , as the sun affected Ruth 's skill as an outfielder . Despite the games he missed , he again led the AL in assists with 24 . He hit for the cycle for the second time of his career in a win against the Detroit Tigers on July 21 . The Yankees managed to win the American League pennant for the second year in a row , but they were again beaten by the Giants , this time in five games . Meusel had the highest batting average of the Yankees at the end of the Series with .300 . 
 In 1923 , Meusel hit .313 with 9 home runs and 91 runs batted in as the Yankees moved into their new Yankee Stadium . Meusel helped lead the team to their first World Series title , in their third consecutive matchup with the Giants . Meusel had the most runs batted in ( eight ) of any player in the Series . He hit a two @-@ run triple in the second inning to help the Yankees win Game 4 at the Polo Grounds , drove in five runs in Game 5 and had a key two @-@ run single that gave the Yankees the lead for good in Game 6 . 
 Before the 1924 season started , Meusel 's close friend Tony <unk> , shortstop for the Boston Braves , was killed when the car in which he was riding flipped over in San Diego . Meusel was a passenger in the vehicle but escaped unhurt . That year Meusel hit .320 with 12 home runs and 120 runs batted in , playing in 143 games . In a game against the Tigers on June 13 , Meusel was involved in one of the most notorious brawls in baseball history . With the Yankees leading 10 – 6 in the top of the ninth inning , Ty Cobb , the star and manager of the Tigers , gave pitcher Bert Cole the signal to hit Meusel with a pitch . Ruth saw the signal and warned Meusel , who was hit in the back and rushed to fight Cole . Both teams rushed onto the field to brawl , and Cobb and Ruth started fighting as well . Over a thousand fans also rushed onto the field , and a riot erupted . The police managed to control the brawl and arrested several fans . The umpire of the game , Billy Evans , pushed Meusel and Ruth out of Navin Field to safety . American League President Ban Johnson punished Meusel and Cole by fining them and issuing a ten @-@ day suspension . 
 Meusel had a breakout year in 1925 . He led the American League in home runs ( 33 ) , runs batted in ( 138 ) , games played ( 156 ) and extra base hits ( 79 ) . Despite this , he finished merely tied for 18th position overall for the AL 's Most Valuable Player award , far behind winner ( and former Yankee ) Roger Peckinpaugh of the Washington Senators . The Yankees had their worst season of the decade , finishing seventh in the league with a 69 – 85 record . In the following 1926 season , Meusel only played in 108 games , batting .315 with 12 home runs and 81 runs batted in . In the 1926 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals , Meusel dropped a key fly ball with one out and the bases loaded in the fourth inning of Game 7 , allowing the Cardinals to tie the game 1 @-@ 1 ; the next batter singled to drive in two more runs . Meusel had chance to redeem himself later in the game , but made infield outs in both the fifth and seventh innings , each time with two men on base . In the bottom of the ninth inning , with New York trailing 3 @-@ 2 , Cardinals starting pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander retired the first two batters and then walked Ruth . Meusel was up to bat when Ruth tried to steal second base , and catcher Bob O 'Farrell threw him out , ending both the game and the Series ; Meusel only hit .238 . 
 Meusel was a key member of the 1927 New York Yankees team , which many consider to be one of the greatest baseball teams ever . That season Meusel played in 135 games , hitting .337 with 8 home runs and 103 runs batted in , and finished second in the league with 24 stolen bases ; on May 16 he stole second , third and home in one game . In the 1927 World Series , Meusel batted only <unk> and broke the record for the most strikeouts in a four @-@ game series with seven , but the Yankees swept the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games . In 1928 Meusel played in 131 games , hitting .297 with 11 home runs and 111 runs batted in . He hit for the cycle a record @-@ tying third time on July 26 against the Tigers . The Yankees reached the World Series for the third year in a row , playing the Cardinals in a rematch from two years previously . In Game 1 of the Series , Meusel hit the only home run in his World Series career as the Yankees won the game and went on to sweep the series 4 – 0 . 
 Prior to the start of the 1930 season , the Yankees sold Meusel to the Cincinnati Reds , and he played in 110 games , hitting .289 with 10 home runs and 69 runs batted in . The Reds released Meusel after the season , and he went on to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association where he played the 1931 season , hitting .283 . He went back to the Pacific Coast League in 1932 , where he played 64 games with the Hollywood Stars , batting .329 with four home runs before retiring . 
 Meusel 's major league career ended with 368 doubles , 94 triples , 156 home runs , a <unk> slugging percentage , 1 @,@ 067 runs batted in , 826 runs scored and 140 stolen bases . Most of his various Yankee career records for right @-@ handed hitters were broken by Tony Lazzeri in the mid @-@ 1930s ; Joe DiMaggio broke his marks for batting average , slugging average and doubles in the late 1940s . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 After retiring from baseball , Meusel worked as a security guard at a US Navy base for 15 years . He was in attendance when his former teammate Lou Gehrig made his famous ' <unk> Man on the Face of the Earth ' speech on July 4 , 1939 . He also appeared in the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees , as well as the 1948 film The Babe Ruth Story , as himself in a cameo role on both occasions . 
 Meusel died of natural causes at his home in Downey , California in 1977 , and was buried at Rose Hills Memorial Park in Whittier . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Meusel received the most recognition for being a member of the " Murderers ' Row " teams of the mid @-@ 1920s , which included Ruth , Gehrig , second baseman Tony Lazzeri and center fielder Earle Combs . He shares the record for the most times hitting for the cycle with three , tying the mark set by Long John Reilly in 1890 ; Babe Herman later tied the mark in 1933 ; 82 years later , Adrián Beltré also achieved the feat in 2015 . Meusel had one of the strongest arms of the era ; in his obituary , The New York Times called his throwing arm " deadly accurate " . Hall of Fame manager Casey Stengel , who played on the 1921 through 1923 Giants teams , said that he had never seen a better thrower . 
 Harvey Frommer described Meusel as a heavy drinker and womanizer who did not get along with his teammates . His manager Miller Huggins called him " indifferent " . He was quiet and reserved , rarely giving newspaper interviews until his career was winding down . He was also known for his lazy attitude , such as refusing to run out ground balls , which many said kept him from achieving greatness . Regularly among the league leaders in strikeouts , his 24 career strikeouts in the World Series were a record for right @-@ handed hitters until Yankees Hank Bauer and Gil McDougald surpassed it in 1958 . 
 Meusel was considered for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame by its Veterans Committee in 1982 , but the committee instead selected former commissioner Happy Chandler and former Giants shortstop Travis Jackson in its balloting . 
 In 1925 Bob Meusel joined Philadelphia Athletics outfielder Tilly Walker ( 1918 ) , St. Louis Browns outfielder Ken Williams ( 1922 ) and later Lou Gehrig ( 1931 ) as the only players other than Babe Ruth to win the AL home run title between 1918 and 1931 . Both Walker and Gehrig won the title jointly with Ruth while Williams and Meusel won the title individually . 
 = Near South Side , Chicago = 
 The Near South Side is a community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . It is located just south of the downtown central business district , the Loop , which is itself a community area . The Near South Side 's boundaries ( see map ) are as follows : North — Roosevelt Road ( 1200 S ) ; South — 26th Street ; West — Chicago River between Roosevelt and 18th Street , Clark Street between 18th Street and Cermak Road , Federal between Cermak Road and the Stevenson Expressway just south of 25th Street , and Clark Street again between the Stevenson and 26th Street ; and East — Lake Michigan . 
 The portion of the Near South Side located near Lake Shore Drive contains some of the most well @-@ known structures in Chicago : Soldier Field , the home of the National Football League Chicago Bears ; McCormick Place , Chicago 's primary convention center ; the Museum Campus , which contains the Field Museum , the Shedd Aquarium , and the Adler Planetarium ; and Northerly Island . The remaining area is currently undergoing a major residential and mixed @-@ use redevelopment . As part of the Chicago 2016 Olympic bid , the Olympic Village was planned to be located on a 37 @-@ acre ( 150 @,@ 000 m2 ) truck parking lot south of McCormick Place that is mostly in the Douglas community area and partly in the Near South Side . 
 = = History = = 
 The Near South Side is one of the most dynamic of Chicago 's communities . It has undergone a metamorphosis from a Native American homeland to a blue collar settlement , to an elite socialite residential district , to a center for vice , to a slum , to a public housing and warehouse district , and finally to the home of a newly gentrified residential district . 
 = = = Beginnings and continuous change = = = 
 The Near South Side was initially noted for wagon trails winding through a lightly populated bend of Lake Michigan . This area was first populated by settlers working for the Illinois & Michigan Canal , who subsequently worked in the lumber district . Proximity to the railroads attracted light manufacturing and shops . In 1853 , the community was absorbed by the extension of the city limits to 31st Street ; in the same period , the Illinois Central Railroad was built into Chicago . In 1859 , a South State Street horse @-@ drawn streetcar line , linking the area to downtown , attracted wealthy families to the area . By the time of the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 , it was home to some of the city 's finest mansions and most elite social families , and in the 1890s the railroad 's Central Station opened at 12th Street . However , by the start of the 20th century , rapid transit evolved and many families moved slightly farther from the Loop business district . The railroads brought warehouses and light manufacturing . Michigan Avenue between 14th Street and 22nd Street became an auto row . The " Levee " vice district of brothels and gambling dens around Cermak Street and State Street prospered until 1912 . Burnham Park and several accompanying institutions were built in the 1910s and 1920s . World War I and post World War I Great Migration settlers moved in and created the low @-@ rent " Black Belt " . Urban renewal and public housing projects later replaced some of the slums . In the 1940s , some of the city ’ s slums were on the Near South Side . 
 = = = Century of Progress = = = 
 The Century of Progress International Exposition was the name of the World 's Fair held on the Near South Side lakefront from 1933 to 1934 to celebrate the city 's centennial . The theme of the fair was technological innovation over the century since Chicago 's founding . More than 40 million people visited the fair , which symbolized for many hope for Chicago and the nation , then in the midst of the Great Depression . 
 = = = Modern day = = = 
 West of Lake Shore Drive , much of the Near South Side , in the middle of the twentieth century , consisted largely of railroad tracks and interchanges until the 1960s , when middle @-@ class housing developments were built in the community area . In 1977 , George Halas surrendered 51 acres ( 210 @,@ 000 m2 ) of railyards for redevelopment as Dearborn Park apartments , townhouses and accompanying tree @-@ lined walkways . In 1988 , the second phase of Dearborn Park construction began between State St. and Clark St. , south of Roosevelt Rd . A housing boom emerged in the 1990s and continues to the present day with the construction of many new condominium and apartment towers . 
 Construction of the Central Station development commenced in 1990 . This was a mixed @-@ use development on 72 acres ( 290 @,@ 000 m2 ) of former rail yards and air rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street . Simultaneously , loft conversion spread to the warehouses and light manufacturing structures along the major north @-@ south Avenues of Michigan , Indiana , and Wabash , which returned them to residential properties 100 years after the flight of the elite Chicago socialites . Among the prominent buildings are One Museum Park and One Museum Park West along a redeveloped Prairie Avenue . 
 = = Parks and museums = = 
 Landfill use created Burnham Park and Northerly Island in the 1920s and 1930s along Lake Michigan . The Field Museum of Natural History , Soldier Field , Adler Planetarium and the John G. Shedd Aquarium were constructed on this newly reclaimed land at this time . Later , Merrill C. Meigs Field Airport was built . Northerly Island connects to the rest of the Museum Campus through a narrow isthmus along Solidarity Drive dominated by Neoclassical sculptures of Kościuszko , <unk> and Nicolaus Copernicus . 
 The newly developed Central Station area includes three park areas . Mark Twain Park lies between South Indiana Avenue and Lake Shore Drive at 15th Place . Daniel Webster Park is bounded by 14th Street , South Indiana Avenue and townhouse developments . The Grant Park Extension lies east of One Museum Park and South of Roosevelt . The developers donated 1 @.@ 5 acres ( 6 @,@ 100 m2 ) for one park to the city and developed the other two as part of its approval process . The donated tract protects the northward view of Grant Park . 
 = = = McCormick Place = = = 
 Fairs and exhibitions held on the lakefront sites created demand for an exhibition hall . In 1960 , construction was begun on McCormick Place , a huge exposition and convention complex at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named for newspaper magnate Robert R. McCormick . The original building burned in 1967 , and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 at the behest of mayor Richard J. Daley . Large expansions were added in 1986 , 1997 and 2007 . The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodation . McCormick Place also houses the Arie Crown Theater , and it is the annual location for the Chicago Auto Show .

 The area includes the Prairie Avenue Historic District ( with both the John J. Glessner House and the Henry B. Clarke House ) and the historic ( former ) R. R. Donnelley & Sons printing company building ( which now houses network routers and switches for much of the city ) . The Glessner House , which is perhaps the best known historic structure in this district , is now a museum . William Wallace Kimball 's home is now home to the United States Soccer Federation headquarters . Formerly , several important residences were located in this region . Additionally , the Fort Dearborn Massacre sculpture was on the property of the George Pullman residence as a tribute to the massacre , which occurred in the neighborhood . Most of the Prairie Avenue families worshiped at the Second Presbyterian Church of Chicago . 
 Adler Planetarium , R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co . Calumet Plant , Henry B. Clarke House , Coca Cola Company Building ( on Wabash ) , Field Museum of Natural History , John J.

 = = Redevelopment = = 
 Beginning in the mid @-@ 1990s , factories started being replaced with or converted to loft condominiums . The redevelopment continued through the early 2000s decade . South Loop residential development has expanded to the Dearborn Park neighborhood ( between State and Clark Streets South of Roosevelt Road ) . The new Central Station neighborhood is the site of major mixed use development that includes One Museum Park , One Museum Park West , numerous residential condominiums and luxury townhomes . This development is built on 72 acres ( 290 @,@ 000 m2 ) of former rail yards and air space rights east of Indiana Avenue between Roosevelt Road and 18th Street that include the former location of the Central Station terminal . Also , a wave of loft conversions in Printer 's Row that has spread to major North @-@ South Avenues such as Michigan , Wabash , and Indiana is making them residential streets again in this neighborhood after a century of other uses . The planned development has expanded from 69 to 80 acres ( 320 @,@ 000 m2 ) and includes properties between Michigan and Indiana Avenues . In 2006 , the Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance , a non @-@ profit organization was formed to provide representation for thousands of South Loop residents , including the Prairie District , Central Station and Museum Park , Motor Row , the South Michigan Ave Corridor , as well as other areas of the Near South Side . 
 = = Streets = = 
 Lake Shore Drive was reconstructed in 1996 so that it no longer cut through the Museum Campus . Previously the northbound lanes ran east of Soldier Field . After reconstruction both northbound and southbound lanes ran west of Soldier Field . 
 Its northern boundary ( Roosevelt Road ) marks the end of consecutively named east @-@ west streets . East @-@ west streets north of Roosevelt Road have street names except between State Street and Michigan Avenue . There are two block @-@ long 8th and 11th Streets and a four @-@ block 9th Street . Most streets south of Roosevelt simply use street numbers . Streets in this neighborhood from 13th to 26th are mostly numbered . Cullerton St ( 20th Street ) & Cermak Road ( 22nd Street ) are two of the few named east @-@ west cross streets . Numbering continues southward in Chicago into the upper hundreds at a pace of 8 blocks per mile . 
 = = South Loop / Printer 's Row overlap = = 
 Because neighborhood line drawing is sometimes imprecise , there is some confusion regarding where the South Loop neighborhood ( which incorporates Printer 's Row ) begins and ends . Some sources do not define its northern boundary , while defining its southern boundary as Cermak Street ( 22nd Street ) and its western boundary as Canal Street . The Prairie District Neighborhood Alliance , a not @-@ for @-@ profit neighborhood organization , has grown to provide support and representation to thousands of residents living in and around the South Loop and Near South Side of Chicago , including the Prairie Avenue District , Central Station and Museum Park , Motor Row and the South Michigan Avenue corridor , but the organization does not exclude those that are part of the broader South Loop and Near South Side community . The Greater South Loop Association represents residents living between Congress to the North , the Chicago River to the west and the Stevenson Expressway ( approximately 25th Street ) to the south . South Loop Neighbors serves residents only as far South as " approximately " 15th Street and as far west as the river . Fodor 's has its own definition of the South Loop as the area bounded by Cermak , Michigan Avenue , the Chicago River , and Congress Parkway @-@ Eisenhower Expressway . 
 The South Loop is described as the neighborhood immediately south of " the Loop " , yet " the Loop " has multiple meanings . The Loop is a community area bounded by the Chicago River , Lake Michigan and Roosevelt Road . However , the term is also used to refer to the specific area bounded by the circular portion of the Chicago " L " , which goes as far south as Van Buren Street or Congress Avenue ( and this is described as the northern border of Printer 's Row and the South Loop ) . Some primary sources cite Printer 's Row and the South Loop as part of the Near South Side community area . This transit @-@ related area is the northern portion of the community area . Saying it is south of the former places it in the Near South Side , while saying it is part of the latter places it in the Loop . The Official City of Chicago Loop Map supports the latter .

 Residents are zoned to schools in Chicago Public Schools . K @-@ 8 schools serving sections of the Near South Side include Drake School , National Teacher Academy , and South Loop School . Phillips Academy High School is the zoned high school of the Near South Side . 
 = Edward Rotheram = 
 Captain Edward Rotheram CB RN ( 27 December 1753 – 6 November 1830 ) was a senior officer of the British Royal Navy , who served for many years during the American War of Independence , French Revolutionary War and Napoleonic Wars . During his service , Rotheram saw action at several major naval engagements , including as a lieutenant at the Glorious First of June in 1794 and as captain of HMS Royal Sovereign at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 . Although he was highly praised for his actions at both battles , he was not well regarded in the service , being once described by his admiral at Trafalgar , Cuthbert Collingwood , as " a man of no talent as a sea officer " and " a stupid man " . 
 Rotheram gained a reputation as a difficult officer to serve with , and he rapidly alienated his fellow officers and the sailors who served under him . Ultimately this character trait resulted in his removal from service and overlooking for promotion in 1808 after being court martialled for inappropriate behaviour towards junior officers . The rest of his life was spent requesting the Admiralty , often in an aggressive manner , for both further service and the rewards he felt were his due . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Rotheram was born in 1753 at Hexham in Northumberland to Dr. John Rotheram , a local physician , and his wife Catherine Roberts . Rotheram was the second of the couple 's seven children and was educated , with his brothers , at Head School in Newcastle @-@ Upon @-@ Tyne , where the family moved when Edward was seven . His elder brother John Rotheram was later a senior professor in natural philosophy at St Andrew 's University . Edward Rotheram went to sea at a young age , joining a collier sailing from Newcastle and serving aboard merchant ships for several years . In 1777 however , Rotheram joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman during the American Revolutionary War . 
 Initially serving on HMS Centaur , Rotheram moved to HMS Barfleur in 1780 and HMS Monarch shortly afterwards as a lieutenant , serving under Lord Howe . Monarch was heavily engaged in the West Indian campaign during the latter stages of the war , and Rotheram saw action at the Battle of Martinique in 1780 , the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781 and the Battle of St Kitts and the Battle of the Saintes in 1782 . Following the end of the war at the start of 1783 , Rotheram returned to Britain as a reserve officer on half @-@ pay . 
 = = Lieutenant and commander = = 
 In 1785 , Rotheram married Dorothy Harle of Newcastle , with whom he had three daughters . He returned to naval service in 1787 aboard HMS Bombay Castle and over the next four years moved between HMS Culloden and HMS Vengeance , all in the Channel Fleet . In 1792 Rotheram was made first lieutenant of HMS Culloden and was still in this position when the French Revolutionary War broke out a year later . Culloden was part of the Channel Fleet under Rotheram 's old commander Lord Howe , and the ship was captained by Isaac Schomberg during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 , in which Howe pursued a French fleet deep into the Atlantic , bringing it to battle at the Glorious First of June . 
 Culloden was not closely engaged in the opening stages of the battle , for which Schomberg would later be heavily criticised . Rotheram , however , gained acclaim in the battle 's aftermath by organising the Culloden 's boats and the boats of other nearby ships into a rescue party that saved hundreds of French sailors from the sinking Vengeur du Peuple . In recognition for this operation , Rotheram was promoted commander on 6 July 1794 and given command of the storeship HMS Camel in the Mediterranean Fleet . In 1797 Rotheram moved to the sloop HMS Hawke , which he commanded in the West Indies until 1800 , returning to Britain in 1800 aboard HMS Lapwing to be made a post captain . 
 Rotheram commanded Lapwing for the next two years , operating with the Channel Fleet and capturing several small French prizes . In 1802 Rotheram returned to reserve ashore during the Peace of Amiens . This retirement lasted until 1804 , when Rotheram was recalled up to service as flag captain of HMS Dreadnought , a second rate ship of the line that flew the flag of Vice @-@ Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood . Collingwood and Rotheram had a poor relationship , Collingwood commenting by letter to his brother that " He [ Rotheram ] is a man of no talent as a sea officer , and of little assistance to me . " Nevertheless , when Collingwood moved to HMS Royal Sovereign in October 1805 as second @-@ in @-@ command of the fleet under Lord Nelson blockading the Franco @-@ Spanish fleet in Cadiz , he brought Rotheram with him . Nelson was aware of the personal conflict between the men , and invited both Collingwood and Rotheram to dinner in a partially successful effort to reconcile them . 
 = = Trafalgar = = 
 At the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805 , Royal Sovereign was the first ship in Collingwood 's division to breach the enemy lines , and Collingwood and Rotheram appear to have reconciled some of their differences as they cooperated well in handling the ship . Collingwood even called to his captain ; " Rotheram , what would Nelson give to be here ! " , Nelson 's HMS Victory being several minutes behind Royal Sovereign in engaging the enemy . Rotheram was also noted during the action for refusing to remove his full dress uniform and large cocked hat , apparel which was not only impractical in a naval engagement but which also marked him as a target for enemy snipers . 
 Royal Sovereign 's main opponent was the large Spanish first rate Santa Ana , with whom she was engaged for several minutes at the start of the action without support . During this time , Royal Sovereign was at one point engaged with five different enemy ships , and suffered heavy damage and casualties during the engagement , finally subduing the 112 @-@ gun Santa Ana after a duel lasting several hours . Both ships were left unmanageable at the end of the engagement , Royal Sovereign being taken in tow by HMS Euryalus into which Collingwood transferred his flag . Royal Sovereign had suffered nearly 150 casualties , Santa Ana over 300 by the end of the battle . Santa Ana was later abandoned by her captors and ultimately fell back into Spanish hands , but Royal Sovereign reached the safety of Gibraltar soon after the battle . 
 In the aftermath of the action , Rotheram left Royal Sovereign to take command of HMS Bellerophon , whose captain , John Cooke had been killed by a French sniper . Cooke had been targeted due to the dress uniform he had worn during the battle . Bellerophon escorted Victory carrying Nelson 's body back to Britain , and Rotheram carried the guidon behind the coffin at Nelson 's funeral in London . Rotheram was presented with a gold medal and sword of honour in recognition of his services in the action , and continued in command of Bellerophon . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Rotheram remained in command of Bellerophon in the English Channel and the North Sea until 1808 , when he was court martialled and reprimanded for unacceptable conduct towards his ship 's junior officers and chaplain . Rotheram remained in the service , but was never again employed at sea . Collingwood summed the situation up in a letter to his sister , stating " Though I think him a stupid man I was in hope he might have gone on in the ship I put him in , which I believe was the only chance he had of being in a ship " . 
 Although his career was over , Rotheram continued to request sea service and honours from the Admiralty , becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands . At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815 , a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods , but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath , a step below knighthood . He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued to request appointments , finally being made one of the captains of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828 . Rotheram died in Bildeston in 1830 and was buried in St Mary Magdelene Church in the village , where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible today . Rotheram was never awarded any further honours or promoted to admiral , having lost his seniority in the court martial of 1808 . 
 = Stephen Mallory = 
 Stephen Russell Mallory ( 1812 – November 9 , 1873 ) served in the United States Senate as Senator ( Democrat ) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the outbreak of the American Civil War . For much of that period , he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs . This was a time of rapid naval reform , and he insisted that the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France , the foremost navies in the world at that time . He also wrote a bill , and guided it through Congress , that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession . 
 Although he was not a leader in the secession movement , Mallory followed his state out of the Union . When the Confederate States of America was formed , he was named Secretary of the Navy in the administration of President Jefferson Davis . He held the position throughout the existence of the Confederacy . Because of indifference to naval matters by most others in the Confederacy , Mallory was able to shape the Confederate Navy according to the principles he had learned while serving in the US Senate . Some of his ideas , such as the incorporation of armor into warship construction , were quite successful and became standard in navies around the world . On the other hand , the navy was often handicapped by administrative ineptitude in the Navy Department . During the war , he was weakened politically by a Congressional investigation into the Navy Department for its failure in defense of New Orleans . After months of taking testimony , the investigating committee concluded that it had no evidence of wrongdoing on his part . 
 Mallory resigned after the Confederate government had fled from Richmond at the end of the war , and he and several of his colleagues in the cabinet were imprisoned and charged with treason . After more than a year in prison , the public mood had softened , and he was granted parole by President Andrew Johnson . He returned to Florida , where he supported his family in his final years by again practicing law . Unable to hold elective office by the terms of his parole , he continued to make his opinions known by writing letters to newspapers . His health began to deteriorate , although he was not incapacitated until the very end . He died on November 9 , 1873 . 
 He was the father of Stephen Russell Mallory , a U.S. Representative and Senator from Florida . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mallory was born in Trinidad , British West Indies , in 1812 . His parents were Charles and Ellen Mallory . His father was a construction engineer originally from Redding , Connecticut . He met and married the Irish @-@ born Ellen Russell in Trinidad , and there the couple had two sons . 
 The family moved to the United States and settled in Key West , Florida , in 1820 . Young Stephen was sent to school near Mobile , Alabama , but his education was interrupted by his father 's death . His elder brother John also died about this time . To support herself and her surviving son , Ellen opened a boarding house for seamen . Then she sent her son away for further schooling at a Moravian academy in Nazareth , Pennsylvania . Although he was for all of his life a practicing Catholic , he had only praise for the education he received at the academy . After about three years , his mother could no longer afford to pay his tuition , so in 1829 his schooling ended and he returned home . 
 = = Adulthood in Florida = = 
 Young Mallory prepared for a profession by reading law in the office of Judge William Marvin . Because of its geographical position , Key West was often sought as a port of refuge for ships caught in storms , and was for the same reason near frequent shipwrecks . Marvin was recognized as an authority on maritime law , particularly applied to laws of wreck and salvage , and Mallory argued many admiralty cases before him . He was reputed to be one of the best young trial lawyers in the state . 
 His career prospering , in 1838 Mallory courted and wed Angela Moreno , a member of a wealthy Spanish @-@ speaking family living in Pensacola . Their marriage produced nine children , five of whom died young ; surviving into adulthood were daughters Margaret ( " Maggie " ) and Ruby , and sons Stephen R. Jr . ( " Buddy " ) , and Attila ( " Attie " ) . Buddy followed his father into politics , and he would eventually also serve as U.S. Senator from Florida . 
 Mallory held a few minor public offices , beginning in 1832 with his selection as town marshal . One of his first paid positions was as Inspector of Customs , for which he earned three dollars per day . Later , President Polk appointed him Collector of Customs . Before his marriage , he joined the Army and took part in the Seminole War , 1835 – 1837 . He also was elected judge for Monroe County for the years 1837 – 1845 . 
 In 1850 , the sectional differences that eventually culminated in the Civil War led to a convention to be held in Nashville , Tennessee , for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern ( slave @-@ holding ) states . Although Mallory had held no statewide offices , he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate to the convention . Personal considerations kept him from attending , but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers .

 The term in office of Senator from Florida David Levy Yulee expired in 1850 . He sought reappointment , but he had aligned himself too strongly with the Fire @-@ eaters , and also had antagonized some commercial interests in the state . The moderates who favored working within the Union still dominated Florida politics , and they successfully sought to put Mallory in place of the radical Yulee . The selection process in the Florida state legislature was somewhat irregular , and Yulee protested , carrying his protest all the way to the Senate itself . That body determined that the Florida legislature had acted within its authority in certifying Mallory , and so he was seated . 
 = = = Senator from Florida = = = 
 Much of what he did in the Senate can be described as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state . With his sponsorship , the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida , and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy ; both bills failed in the House of Representatives . He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians , although the problem seems to have been overstated . His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids , and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state . He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida . None of this would have been considered exceptional for the era . 
 = = = Committee on Naval Affairs = = = 
 Mallory was placed on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs . His assignment became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13 , 1851 , recommended Congressional action on two issues . First was the problem of what to do with ineffective officers in the Navy . At the time , promotion was based solely on seniority , and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties . Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates . The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress , and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating ; they wanted a return to the old ways , or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority . 
 Mallory 's first major speech in Congress was in favor of a return to flogging , which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle . His position was unpopular throughout the nation , and Congress refused to lift the ban . His views on flogging , for good or ill , were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore 's proposals , that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy . He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs , and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand . It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers , who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers . Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list , the first compulsory retirement in the history of the US Navy . By most accounts , the board did its work creditably , but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree . Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury , too crippled to go to sea , but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of oceanography . Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases , and the debate was renewed . In the end , however , Mallory 's views prevailed , a testimonial to his parliamentary skills . The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War , when both men sided with the South . 
 Mallory 's tenure on the Committee on Naval Affairs came during a time of great innovation in naval warfare . He kept abreast of developments in other navies , and he made sure that the US Navy would incorporate the latest thinking into its new ships . Britain and France , then the two foremost navies in the world , were in the process of converting their fleets from sail to steam , and from paddles to screws . In 1853 , the committee recommended passage of a bill providing for the addition of six new screw frigates to the fleet ; when delivered , some considered them to be the best frigates in the world . In 1857 , his committee persuaded the Senate to authorize twelve sloops @-@ of @-@ war . These entered the navy beginning in 1858 , on the verge of the Civil War . 
 Another innovation that was being considered was that of armor . Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time , enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities . No armored vessels were commissioned while he was in the Senate , but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere . He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor ; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens , it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853 , when Mallory gave his argument . His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project , but in his supporting speech he expressed some of the principles that guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy . 
 = = = Sectional crisis = = = 
 Representing as he did a state in the Deep South , Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance on the issues that were tearing the nation apart . The occasion arose when the Senate considered the admission of Kansas to the Union . Its Lecompton Constitution would allow slavery in Kansas , and citizens who were against extending the practice into new territories seized upon the widespread irregularities in the adoption procedure to oppose it . Senator Preston King of New York mounted a two @-@ hour attack on the constitution and Southern policy in general , following which Mallory replied in what his biographers describe as " probably his most effective speech in the Senate . " One segment of his talk presented the rationale of the slave @-@ holders in their unwillingness to accept majority rule . Addressing the question whether the constitution had been ratified by " the people , " he said : " States have conferred , and may at any time confer , their whole political power on a minority . They may make disqualifications dependent upon the tenure of freehold estate , upon the payment of tax , upon militia duty , or upon the color of skin ; but whoever the State chooses to confer her political authority upon , are the people . " He foresaw the decline in relative power of the slave @-@ holding states , although at this time he did not believe it would necessarily lead to secession . He concluded his remarks by a pledge to follow the South whatever happened : " It is not for me to indicate the path she [ the South ] may , in her wisdom , pursue ; but , sir , ... my whole heart is with her , and she will find me treading it with undivided affections . " 
 Despite his willing adherence to the Southern position on the issues that were dividing the country , Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement . He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession . That occurred on January 10 , 1861 , making Florida the third state ( behind South Carolina and Mississippi ) to leave the Union . On January 21 , Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate . 
 In the days before Abraham Lincoln took office , parties in the seceding states disagreed over the proper course of action concerning the forts within their domains . In Florida , three forts remained in the possession of the United States Army : Fort Zachary Taylor at Key West , Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas , and Fort Pickens near Pensacola . Some of the most strident secessionists proposed that they be taken over immediately , by force if needed , beginning with Fort Pickens . Cooler heads hoped to avoid bloodshed and gain possession by negotiation ; they made much of the conciliatory words of William H. Seward , already selected to be Secretary of State in the incoming administration . Mallory and Florida 's other Senator , David L. Yulee , and the two Senators from Alabama sent telegrams to their respective governors urging caution . Other Southern Senators lent their support , and President @-@ elect Jefferson Davis seemed to agree . In the end , the moderates won out , and no attack was made on Fort Pickens . Although Mallory was hardly alone , his political opponents later used his perceived pro @-@ Union stance as an excuse to attack him . 
 = = Confederate Secretary of the Navy : nomination and confirmation = = 
 The governmental structure of the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much like that of the parent United States . The executive branch was partitioned into several departments , each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president . The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department , and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy . He was chosen for two principal reasons : first , he had extensive experience with nautical affairs , both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington ; and second , he was from Florida . In a bow to the principle of States ' Rights , Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states . Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that the occupant would not be the best person available , the selection process worked well in Mallory 's case . 
 Mallory 's nomination as Secretary of the Navy was submitted to the Provisional Congress as soon as the act establishing a navy was passed . Despite his evident qualifications , it drew significant opposition ; his detractors cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro @-@ secession . Ultimately , however , he was confirmed . 
 = = = Naval organization and operations = = = 
 As few other persons in the Confederate government were interested in naval matters , Mallory had almost free rein to shape the department , as well as the navy it controlled , according to his own views . The result was very much the product of his prior experience . The Department of the Navy was organized into separate offices , equivalent to the bureau system of the United States Navy ; whereas the US Navy had five bureaus , the Confederate Navy had only four : Orders and Detail ( dealing with personnel ) , Provisions and Clothing , Medicine and Surgery , and Ordnance and Hydrography . Although there was no Office of Construction and Repair , its function was met by John L. Porter . Porter served as Chief Naval Constructor , without title from the start until the position was officially established in 1863 , and thereafter with title until the end of the war . A few other functions lay outside the bureau system : a small Marine Corps , a few men who were sent to Europe to acquire vessels there and who reported directly to Mallory , and a Torpedo Bureau . 
 At the start , the Confederate Navy faced one of the problems that Mallory had encountered when he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Naval Affairs : an overabundance of high @-@ ranking officers who were too old to go to sea . This came about because the Confederacy had created its navy by promising that men resigning from the US Navy would enter the CS Navy at their old rank . Hoping to avoid the stagnation that was the result of the former promotion process , Mallory proposed that promotion should depend solely on " gallant or meritorious conduct during the war . " His proposal was quickly made into law by the Confederate Congress . Still not completely satisfied , in 1863 Mallory initiated the creation of a Provisional Navy , which in effect established two officer corps . The officers whom Mallory or his advisers deemed incapable of combat were retained in the Regular Navy , while young and presumably more aggressive officers would transfer to the Provisional Navy . Officers for fighting ships would be drawn from the Provisional Navy , and they could be promoted without regard for seniority if they served with distinction . 
 Mallory also was able to shape naval policy and doctrine . After viewing the disparity between the shipbuilding and other manufacturing facilities of the Confederacy and those of the Union , he set forth a fourfold plan for the navy : 
 1 . Send out commerce raiders to destroy the enemy 's mercantile marine . 
 2 . Build ironclad vessels in Southern shipyards for defensive purposes . 
 3 . <unk> by purchase or construction abroad armored ships capable of fighting on the open seas . 
 4 . <unk> new weapons and techniques of warfare . 
 = = = Attacks on Union commerce = = = 
 From the start , one of the main efforts of the Confederate Navy was to counter the blockade of its ports by the Union Navy . Mallory believed that by attacking the merchant shipping that carried trade to Northern ports he could force his Union counterpart , Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles , to divert his own small fleet to defend against the raiders . In the early days of the war , the Confederacy tried to enlist the services of private shipowners in the service by offering letters of marque and reprisal . Issuance of the letters was not in the purview of the Navy Department , but Mallory was aware of them and saw them as part of his plan . For several reasons , the privateers did not have the success that was hoped for . Although they ventured out throughout the war , they had only fleeting success , and that had ceased by the end of the first year . 
 He was more directly involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders , ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce . He first proposed their use as early as April 18 , 1861 . The first raider , CSS Sumter , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30 , 1861 . From then until after the war was over , the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping , inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day . They failed of their primary purpose , however , because Welles maintained the Union blockade , and international trade continued as before , carried in ships flying foreign flags . 
 = = = Naval reform : ironclads = = = 
 No other aspect of Mallory 's tenure as Secretary of the Navy is better known than his advocacy of armored vessels . He argued that the Confederacy could never produce enough ships to compete with the industrial Union on a ship @-@ by @-@ ship basis . As he saw it , the South should build a few ships that were individually so far superior to their opponents as to dominate . In his words , " The perfection of a warship would doubtless be a combination of the greatest known ocean speed with the greatest known floating battery and power of resistance . " He hoped that armored warships would prove to be the " ultimate weapon . " He did not anticipate that his opponents would also produce armored vessels , which rapidly became important parts of both navies . Furthermore , other navies , notably Great Britain and France , stepped up the conversions of their own fleets from wood to iron . Certainly the change was under way even before the Civil War broke out ; his legacy consists in forcing the change to be made sooner than would otherwise have been done . 
 The first ironclad to be created at Mallory 's urging was CSS Virginia . The burned and scuttled USS Merrimack had been raised at Gosport ( Norfolk ) Navy Yard , and an armored casemate built on her hull . For armament , she carried 12 guns . She was also fitted with an iron ram . On March 8 , 1862 , she attacked the Union fleet enforcing the blockade at Hampton Roads , on the James River near Norfolk . She sank two major Union warships ( USS Cumberland and Congress ) , and menaced a third ( Minnesota ) , which had grounded in the attempt to get into action . The damages she suffered were negligible . In that first day of the battle , she had demonstrated the basic validity of Mallory 's belief that armored warships could destroy the best wooden ships and were almost impervious to damage in return . As is well known , when Virginia returned to battle the next day intending to finish off Minnesota , she encountered the Union 's Monitor . The two armored vessels fought inconclusively , demonstrating the flaw in Mallory 's argument : an ultimate weapon is truly decisive only if one side does not have it . 
 After Virginia , most other Confederate ironclads had at best limited success , and many were complete failures . Particularly embarrassing were four that were contracted to be built for service on the Mississippi River . Of the four , only one , CSS Arkansas , entered into combat in the way that was intended , with full crew and under steam . Of the others , Tennessee was destroyed on the stocks ; Mississippi was hastily launched and then burned to avoid capture ; and Louisiana was used merely as an ineffectual floating battery at the Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip , when the fate of New Orleans was decided , and she was then blown up rather than be surrendered . No parties in the Confederacy acquitted themselves well in the three losses , but Mallory must bear a large part of the blame . Poor administration is among the foremost reasons for the delays that hindered completion of the vessels . By failing to prioritize their construction , he allowed Louisiana and Mississippi to compete for scarce resources . Because he did not delegate responsibility , he was swamped with details of the construction of Virginia while letting problems concerning the other ships go unresolved . And because he accepted the role implicitly assigned to his service as secondary to the Army , the Navy had to work with only the materials and funds that were left over after the Army had satisfied its needs . 
 = = = Mission to Europe = = = 
 The backward condition of shipyards in the seceding states convinced Mallory that he would have to look abroad to obtain the vessels that he thought would be able to challenge the U.S. Navy . He selected two men as his primary representatives : James D. Bulloch and Lieutenant James H. North of the Confederate States Navy . North was a disappointment , but Bulloch proved to be one of the most effective agents for the Confederacy in Europe . He sought diligently and discreetly in England to acquire ships for the purposes of his government while working within or around the framework of the neutrality laws of the host nation . 
 Four of the Confederate Navy raiders were purchased in Britain : CSS Florida , Georgia , Shenandoah , and above all , Alabama . Probably Mallory would have liked to have more , but the record shows that the few that were commissioned were more than adequate . 
 Efforts to purchase or have built ironclad warships were unsuccessful despite Bulloch 's best efforts . Buying them was never seriously considered , as the Royal Navy would not care to give any of its best ships to a foreign power , no matter how favorably disposed . Contracts were made with private shipyards in both Britain and France to build rams to Confederate naval specifications , but their ultimate purpose could not be disguised . They therefore directly violated the neutrality laws , and American ( that is , Union ) officials immediately informed the governments of their existence . For a while , Her Majesty 's Government chose to turn a blind eye on developments , but the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg caused them to reconsider . On September 5 , 1863 , Ambassador Charles Francis Adams sent a message to Foreign Minister Lord John Russell informing him that the first of the ironclads was about to leave , and that " it would be superfluous in me to point out to your Lordship that this means war . " The ship was not permitted to leave and was later seized for the Royal Navy . As the French government had implicitly agreed to follow Britain 's lead concerning North America , all the contracts were voided . 
 = = = New weapons = = = 
 The Civil War provided a testing ground for numerous innovations in warfare , and Mallory was in position to provide support for many of them . His advocacy of armored vessels has been described and is the development most closely associated with his name , but he encouraged the development of several other weapons . For example , he favored the use of rifled guns , as opposed to the smoothbore muzzle loaders used in the Union Navy . The favored gun was a rifle designed by the head of his Office of Ordnance and Hydrography , Lieutenant John Mercer Brooke . The Brooke rifle gave Rebel gunners a qualitative advantage over their Yankee counterparts that persisted to the end of the war . 
 The torpedo office , officially named the Submarine Battery Service , developed underwater explosive devices , known as " torpedoes " at that time but as " mines " today . The office was initially led by Mallory 's enemy Matthew Fontaine Maury , and later by Lieutenant Hunter Davidson . The first ship to be lost to mines was USS Cairo , on December 12 , 1862 . Subsequently , more vessels of all types were lost in combat to mines and torpedoes than from all other causes combined . 
 In Charleston Harbor , Army Captain Francis D. Lee , supported by General P. G. T. Beauregard , developed a small boat that would carry a spar torpedo . His craft , known as David , successfully exploded a torpedo against the side of USS New Ironsides , severely damaging her . Later , the more famous H. L. Hunley used one of Lee 's spar torpedoes to sink USS Housatonic , the first ship to be sunk by a submarine . The Navy Department had not provided active support for Lee 's experiments , but their successful result led to the use of spar torpedoes on ships throughout the fleet . ( Less favorably for the Rebel cause , spar torpedoes were also immediately adopted by the Union Navy , and one was used in October 1864 to sink the ironclad CSS Albemarle . ) 
 = = Investigation of the Navy Department = = 
 The loss of New Orleans came as a tremendous shock to the Confederacy , and a spate of recriminations followed . Members of Congress , noting the failure of the ironclads , blamed the navy in particular , and suggested that there was no need for a separate Navy Department . Hoping to forestall such a proposal , Mallory was able to persuade the Congress instead to investigate the conduct of the department . Each house put five of its members on the investigating committee . The chairman , Senator Clement C. Clay , was known as one of Mallory 's friends , as was Representative Ethelbert Barksdale . They were at least partially balanced by Representative Henry S. Foote , a persistent critic of secession and everything that the entire Davis administration had done . Also weighing in against Mallory was Senator Charles M. Conrad , chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee , who was not a member of the investigating committee but who did appear as a prosecution witness . The committee continued to meet for more than six months , and ended with no finding of neglect or malfeasance . 
 The investigation may have weakened Mallory politically and certainly diverted him from other duties , but it was not enough to drive him from office . Perhaps because there was no one to replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president , Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war . After the surrender of Lee 's army at Appomattox , Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South , first to Danville , Virginia , then to Greensboro , North Carolina , Charlotte , Abbeville , South Carolina , and finally Washington , Georgia . There , Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange , Georgia , where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children .

 = = = Capture and imprisonment = = = 
 A large part of the population of the Northern states believed that the Davis government was somehow involved in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln , and although there was no evidence of their complicity , it was a political reality that had to be dealt with . One result was that the political radicals were able to force the government to prosecute those who had led the war against the Union . Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason , among other things ; on May 20 , 1865 , while he was still at La Grange , he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody . From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor , where he was confined as a political prisoner . 
 For several months , the demand of the public for vengeance increased , so that Mallory feared that he would face the death penalty if convicted . However , no bill of particulars to specify precisely which of his acts constituted treason was ever presented , and it became increasingly clear that no one in the Confederate government was guilty of assassinating the former president . The period for extracting vengeance passed with no one put on trial , and hope was revived . From his prison cell , Mallory began to write letters in a personal campaign to gain release . He petitioned President Andrew Johnson directly , and enlisted the support of some of his former colleagues in the Senate . His wife Angela visited Washington and importuned President Johnson and other persons who had influence . Johnson was already quite lenient in granting pardons , and the popular clamor for harsh punishment began to recede by the end of the year . On March 10 , 1866 , Johnson granted Mallory a " partial parole . " Although he was no longer in jail , he was required to stay with his daughter in Bridgeport , Connecticut until he could take the oath of allegiance . 
 = = = Release and return to Florida = = = 
 In June 1866 , Mallory visited Washington , where he called on many of his old friends and political adversaries , including President Johnson and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton , who received him cordially . He got permission to return to Florida ; his return was somewhat delayed by problems with his health , but on July 19 he arrived at his home in Pensacola . 
 By the terms of his parole , Mallory was not permitted to hold public office , so he made a living by reopening his old law practice . Nominally excluded from politics , he managed to make his views known by writing letters and editorials for Florida newspapers . At first he urged acceptance of the reconstituted Union and acquiescence in the policies of Reconstruction , but he soon came out in opposition , particularly against black suffrage . 
 He had long suffered occasional attacks of gout , and these continued to plague him in the postwar years . In the winter of 1871 @-@ 1872 he began to complain of his heart , and his health began to deteriorate . Still , he remained active , and the end came rather quickly . He is said to have been " listless " on November 8 , 1873 , and that night he began to fail . On the morning of November 9 he died . He was buried in St. Michael 's Cemetery , Pensacola , Florida .

 Pokémon Diamond Version and Pearl Version ( ポケットモンスター <unk> & <unk> , Poketto Monsutā <unk> & <unk> , " Pocket Monsters : Diamond & Pearl " ) are role @-@ playing games ( RPGs ) developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS . With the enhanced remake Pokémon Platinum , the games comprise the fifth installment and fourth generation of the Pokémon series of RPGs . First released in Japan on September 28 , 2006 , the games were later released to North America , Australia , and Europe over the course of 2007 . 
 Like previous Pokémon games , Diamond and Pearl chronicle the adventures of a young Pokémon trainer as he / she trains and battles Pokémon while also thwarting the schemes of a criminal organization . The games add many new features , such as Internet play over the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection and changes to battle mechanics and Pokémon Contests , along with addition of 107 new Pokémon . The games are independent of each other but feature largely the same plot and while both can be played separately , it is necessary to trade between them in order to complete the games ' <unk> . 
 Development of Diamond and Pearl was announced at a Nintendo Press conference in the fourth calendar quarter of 2004 . The games were designed with features of the DS . It was forecasted to be released in Japan in 2005 , but was shipped in 2006 . In promotion of the games , Nintendo sold a limited @-@ edition Nintendo DS Lite in Japan , and held a release party celebrating their North American release . 
 The games received generally favorable reviews . Most critics praised the addition of Wi @-@ Fi features and felt that the gameplay , though it had not received much updating from previous games , was still engaging . Reviewers were divided on the graphics , however , and the audio was criticized as being primitive . The games enjoyed more commercial success than their Game Boy Advance predecessors : with around 18 million units sold worldwide , Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen , while outselling their successors , Black and White , by over 2 million copies . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Pokémon Diamond and Pearl are role @-@ playing games with adventure elements . The basic mechanics of the games are largely the same as their predecessors . As with all Pokémon games for handheld consoles , gameplay is in third @-@ person overhead perspective , and consists of three basic screens : a field map , in which the player navigates the main character ; a battle screen ; and the menu , in which the player configures his or her party , items , or gameplay settings . The player begins the game with no Pokémon or Poké Balls , but is given the choice of three Pokémon as a part of the story line . Once Pokéballs are obtained , the player can capture more Pokémon using Pokéballs . The player can also use his / her Pokémon to do damage to the other Pokémon . Whenever the player encounters a wild Pokémon or is challenged by a trainer to a battle , the screen switches to a turn @-@ based battle screen where the Pokémon fight . During battle , the player may fight , use an item , switch the active Pokémon , or flee ( the last not an option in battles against trainers ) . All Pokémon have hit points ( HP ) ; whenever a Pokémon 's HP is reduced to zero , it faints and cannot battle unless revived at a Pokémon center or with an item . If the player 's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon ( causes it to faint ) , it receives experience points . After accumulating enough experience points , it can level up ; most Pokémon evolve into a new species of Pokémon whenever they reach a certain level . Pokémon 's stats also increase every time it levels up , and they will also learn new moves as well . If the player cancels an evolution the Pokémon will learn new moves faster . 
 Apart from battling , capturing Pokémon is the most important element of Pokémon gameplay . Although other trainers ' Pokémon cannot be captured , the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle . A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player 's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon . Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used ; the lower the target 's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball , the higher the success rate of capture is . Also , inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate , making it easier to capture wild Pokémon . Each species has a capture rate of its own as well . 
 = = = New features = = = 
 As with other generations of Pokémon games , Diamond and Pearl retained the basic gameplay of their predecessors while introducing additional new features . Increased from three times of day in Gold and Silver , there are five time periods in Diamond and Pearl : morning , day , afternoon , evening , and night . Diamond and Pearl introduced several changes to battle mechanics . In previous generations , Pokémon moves were classified as " physical " or " special " based on their type ; for example , all Fire @-@ type moves were special and all Ground @-@ type moves were physical . In Diamond and Pearl , however , moves are categorized into three groups . Attacks that make physical contact with the opponent are " physical " , attacks that do not make physical contact are " special " , and moves that do not deal damage directly are classified as " status " . 
 Some of the games ' new features capitalize on the Nintendo DS 's features . The <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a simulated <unk> , uses the DS 's bottom screen and hosts applications including a clock , a calculator , a map , a counter , and a drawing pad . These applications are obtained throughout the game . Beneath Sinnoh 's surface is the Underground ( <unk> , <unk> ) , a large area used for wireless multiplayer gaming ; in it , players can create and decorate secret bases ( first featured in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire ) and participate in minigames . Diamond and Pearl also employ support for the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection , allowing players to communicate through voice chat , trade , and battle online . The main system for trade is the Global Trade Station , which allows players to trade with people around the world . Players can search for any Pokémon that they have seen in the game and can offer their own ; if another player is offering the requested Pokémon and is looking for the offered Pokémon , the trade occurs immediately . ( The trade does not have to be instant ; an offer can be left for other players to browse and complete , even while the player is offline . ) Certain species of Pokémon traded internationally will have a Pokédex entry in the language of the game it originated from . 
 Diamond and Pearl 's Pokémon Contests ( events in which the player 's Pokémon compete in a show to win ribbons ) consist of three stages , two more than the Contests of the Game Boy Advance games . In the Visual Competition stage , players use the Nintendo DS 's touchscreen to place accessories on their Pokémon to boost a particular trait , such as " Cool " or " Cute " , and earn points . In the Dance Competition stage , the player must tap buttons on the touchscreen in rhythm with the music . The final stage , Acting Competition , is similar to Pokémon Contests of the Game Boy Advance games ; Pokémon use their moves to appeal to the judges and crowd . Like <unk> in the third @-@ generation games , baked goods called <unk> can be made from berries and fed to Pokémon in order to boost a particular trait , and therefore , the likelihood of success in a relevant Contest . 
 = = = Connectivity to other devices = = = 
 In addition to compatibility with each other , Diamond and Pearl offer compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Pokémon RPGs , Pokémon Ranger , and Pokémon Battle Revolution . After earning the National Pokédex in Diamond and Pearl , the player can " Migrate " Pokémon from the Game Boy Advance games to Diamond and Pearl by inserting a Game Boy Advance cartridge into the Game Boy Advance cartridge slot of the Nintendo DS while Diamond or Pearl is in the DS slot . After six Pokémon are uploaded from the cartridge , they are sent to the Pal Park , an area where the player can capture the transferred Pokémon . Pokémon uploads are restricted to six every twenty @-@ four hours per Game Boy Advance cartridge , and the player must capture the uploaded Pokémon before performing another transfer . Pokémon transferred to Diamond and Pearl this way cannot be sent back to a Game Boy Advance cartridge . After completing a special mission in Pokémon Ranger , the player will be able to send a <unk> egg or <unk> from Ranger to Diamond or Pearl . Finally , players can wirelessly upload Pokémon from Diamond and Pearl to the Wii games Pokémon Battle Revolution and My Pokémon Ranch . DS players can also connect to the Internet and " battle " with other players around the world . They can use " DS Wireless " to play with people within approximately 5 m . They can also play underground ( for example , steal flags , find spheres and set traps ) .

 Diamond and Pearl are set in the fictional region of Sinnoh , an island based on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō . Sinnoh is probably not directly connected to any other region in the Pokémon universe , much like Hoenn . It is characterized by large , snow @-@ covered mountains ( Mt . Coronet , a part of a mountain range , divides Sinnoh in half ) . In this game , the starters are the grass @-@ type Turtwig , the fire @-@ type Chimchar , and the water @-@ type Piplup . Turtwig can evolve into <unk> and then into <unk> , Chimchar can evolve into <unk> and then into <unk> , and Piplup can evolve into <unk> and then into <unk> . Unlike other regions , Sinnoh has a " northern " feel to it because it is the only region with snow @-@ covered routes . Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways ; it has three main lakes ( Verity , <unk> , and Valor ) that form a triangle . Unlike the Hoenn region , however , which is mostly water routes , only 30 percent of Sinnoh 's landscape comprises waterways . Underneath Sinnoh 's surface is the Sinnoh Underground , which is a large maze of caves and tunnels .

 The games chronicle the adventures of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by collecting and training Pokémon . Like most games in the series , Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders , professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type . Gym Leaders ( Roark , Gardenia , <unk> , Wake , Fantina , Byron , Candice , and <unk> ) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges , key to the advancement of the plot . As in Ruby and Sapphire , the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate ( and here , it is Team Galactic ) , who plans to use Pokémon to restructure the region into a Utopia . 
 Like all other Pokémon RPGs , Diamond and Pearl begin in the protagonist 's hometown . After viewing a television report about a media @-@ conducted search for a Red <unk> , which was spotted at a faraway lake ( Johto 's Lake of Rage ) , the protagonist and his or her best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it . They spot Professor Rowan , a Pokémon evolution researcher , and his assistant , the playable character not selected in the game : Lucas ( boy ) or Dawn ( girl ) . After a short discussion , the professor and his assistant leave the lake , leaving a briefcase behind . When they are attacked by wild Starly , the protagonist and his or her rival examine the case . The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase ( Turtwig , Chimchar , or Piplup ) with which to battle the Starly . After defeating the Starly , Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor . Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist and his or her chosen Pokémon , Rowan offers it to him or her , asking that he or she embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex . 
 The protagonist encounters the main antagonist , Team Galactic , early in the game , when he or she must save Professor Rowan from its thugs ; however , its motives are unclear until later . The protagonist encounters the Team twice ( when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City ) before it takes over Sinnoh 's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge , Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building , where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain , an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia ( in Pearl ) or Dialga ( in Diamond ) ( both in Pokémon Platinum , though <unk> appears after this ) . After releasing the trio , the protagonist is able to access the cave atop Mt . Coronet , where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia . The legendary Pokémon 's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh , causing the newly free <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> to attempt to stop it . The player then battles Palkia / Dialga ; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon , Sinnoh returns to normal . After this , the player will continue , eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League 's Elite Four : Aaron , Bertha , Flint , and Lucian . After defeating all four members , the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion , a woman named Cynthia , who had appeared before in the game . If the protagonist beats Cynthia , he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion , beating the game . After the player beats the game , there is a new island to explore that is filled with other types of Pokémon . His or her old friend , who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before , will be waiting for him or her here . The old friend will challenge the player to another battle . On this island , there are also stores and a tournament center .

 With Pokémon Dash 's release and the release date of the Nintendo DS , the development of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl was announced at a Nintendo Press conference in the fourth calendar quarter of 2004 .

Nintendo of Europe announced a release date of July 27 , 2007 , for the European Union , and Nintendo Australia announced a June 21 release date .

To celebrate the Australian release of the games , Nintendo launched the nationwide Nintendo DS Connection Tour 07 ; each stop in the tour featured events such as Pokémon Trading Card Game competitions and Pokémon trivia games . 
 The success of the games revived the popularity of the Pokémon brand . George Harrison , then Nintendo of America 's vice president of marketing , noted that the games were attracting " players of all ages " — from younger children to " grown men and women " and older players who " played the original Pokémon games " . As a result , Pokémon USA opened a temporary boutique in the Times Square Toys " R " Us that sold exclusively Pokémon licensed merchandise including Jakks Pacific @-@ created action figures , plush toys , backpacks , and clothing . Ronald <unk> , president of Toys " R " Us , stated that the store planned to open temporary boutiques in all 585 of its domestic locations .
