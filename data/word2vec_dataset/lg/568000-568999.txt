 The episode begins at the National Mall , where Major General Benjamin Bloch ( Scott Hylands ) gives a speech to a crowd of Vietnam War veterans . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , and Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) patrol the crowd , searching for a potential gunman . However , when the agents see the gunman , he repeatedly disappears and makes their efforts to track him difficult . Mulder finds himself aiming his gun towards the panicked crowd , desperately searching for the gunman as he had disappeared right in front of him . 
 Twelve hours earlier , at Fort Evanston , Maryland , Lieutenant General Peter MacDougal ( Bill Agnew ) is shot in his limousine by the gunman . Skinner briefs the agents on the killing , noting a king of hearts playing card — used by the soldiers in Vietnam to mark their kills — was left at the scene . The FBI suspects a far @-@ right paramilitary group , the Right Hand , of killing MacDougal in an effort to stop an upcoming re @-@ dedication of a Vietnam war memorial in Washington . 
 Mulder and Scully head to Virginia to question the Right Hand 's leader , Denny Markham ( Larry Musser ) . A search of his fenced @-@ off cabin uncovers ammunition and a photograph showing him in the company of a Sergeant Nathaniel Teager ( Peter LaCroix ) . After being arrested , Markham reveals that Teager was a soldier in Vietnam who was left for dead as a prisoner of war . Meanwhile , at the Vietnam memorial , Teager approaches a war widow and claims that her husband is still alive as a POW . After giving the woman her husband 's dog tags , Teager mysteriously disappears . 
 Skinner informs the agents that Teager is officially dead , and that his remains are at the Army 's forensics lab . However , Mulder learns that the lab only possesses Teager 's dental remains , and that the cause of his death was recorded as " inconclusive " . Mulder believes that General John Steffan ( William Nunn ) , who signed Teager 's death certificate , is his next target . Teager makes his way past Pentagon security and kills Steffan in his office . Upon seeing Teager on the Pentagon 's surveillance tapes , Mulder notes the frequent unexplained appearances and disappearances of Viet Cong troops reported by POWs in Vietnam . 
 During a meeting with Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) , Mulder learns that Steffan , McDougal , and Bloch were all involved in negotiations concerning POWs . Meanwhile , as Bloch 's motorcade makes its way to the Mall , Scully spots Teager in the crowd , only to see him vanish in an instant . Mulder tells Skinner and Scully that the government has arranged for their investigation to fail in an effort to cover up the truth about American POWs still being kept in Vietnam . 
 In the present , during the re @-@ dedication ceremony , Mulder realizes that no one can see Teager if they are in his line of sight . Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade , where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound . Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape . As he succumbs to his wounds , Teager repeats his Army identification . Afterwards , the Pentagon states that the assassin was a different person — which Mulder denounces as a lie . He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War as he looks upon Teager 's name on the memorial wall .

 After producer Howard Gordon saw on 60 Minutes episode about the American secret agents the CIA left behind during the Vietnam War , he was intrigued and decided to develop a future script based around this . Howard was scheduled to only write one episode of the season , the nineteenth entry " Synchrony " . However , Gordon met with Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz the day before the holiday break to pitch his idea . After getting frustrated developing the episode 's plot summary , Gordon requested Carter 's help in exchange for a shared writing credit . Gordon then wrote the script during the break . 
 Gordon had been considering a man that turned invisible in the political and metaphorical sense for a while , but he still needed a way for physical invisibility . The eventual concept came after the writer spoke with his ophthalmologist brother , who told about blind spots regarding malfunctioning retinal spots or optic nerves , which do not impair humans due to a brain compensation . Gordon noted , " these stories come from scientific research ... So I said , what if someone could actually create a field of vision where none actually exists ? " Gordon decided to use a Vietnam War veteran given " they are getting old , and like the Holocaust survivor of ' Kaddish ' , starting to die " , and the opportunity would allow a larger role for Skinner . General MacDougal was named after the show 's editor , Heather MacDougall . 
 The episode featured a finished replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial that was first featured in an incomplete state during " Never Again " . The replica was first put on Vancouver 's Jericho Park due to the locale 's " expansive , groomed , flat " characteristics . Only portions of the wall were real , whereas the rest were created via computer generated imagery ( CGI ) . Day scenes at the monument were shot at Jericho Park , whereas night scenes took place at Ballantyne Pier , which was a large warehouse . The grandstand that had been assembled at Jericho Park was dismantled and reassembled in the warehouse . The replica had fake names created by the sister of art assistant Kristina Lyne due to legal reasons , which included names of The X @-@ Files cast and crew . In addition , two of them , " Jesse R. Ellison " and " Harlan L. Hahn " , referenced noted writer Harlan Ellison and model Jessica Hahn . The crowd for the memorial 's <unk> scene , which at times was duplicated through CGI , consisted of 500 extras , fifty of which won the opportunity to appear on the show in local radio contests . 
 A civilian underpass in Stanley Park doubled as Freedom Plaza . During the filming in the park , several public photographers sought out Anderson . Because of a stipulation of filming in parks , the police cannot deny anyone access . To compensate for this , many of the available crew and production staff members formed a " human blockade " to prevent the paparazzi from disturbing the shots . The terminal for the Canada Place waterfront building served as a stand @-@ in for the interior of the Pentagon .

 " Unrequited " premiered on the Fox network on February 23 , 1997 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 9 , with a 16 share , meaning that roughly 10 @.@ 9 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 16 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . " Unrequited " was seen by 16 @.@ 56 million viewers on first broadcast . The episode first aired in the United Kingdom on January 7 , 1998 on BBC One . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a " B – " . He wrote that " Unrequited " " isn 't a very good episode " of the series , but that it is " a potent one all the same " due to its " great ideas " that are unfortunately never expanded upon . VanDerWerff felt that the episode 's biggest problem was that it started in media res and revealed the episode 's conclusion , writing " it 's a pretty great starting point for an episode . Instead , it 's actually the endpoint " . Despite the negativity towards the plot , he wrote that the entry was " a good episode for Skinner " in that it gives him a mission and alludes to his past in a realistic way . Furthermore , VanDerWerff also applauded the way the show used the Vietnam War in a way that felt " fresh " . Independent reviewer Sarah Stegall awarded the episode a two out of five and derided it as a " pseudo @-@ political story " . She was negative towards the " lack of emotional investment " , which she felt was what damaged the episode ; she called Teager a cipher who was portrayed as a " Twitchy Vet " rather than a " Tragic Hero " . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five . They heavily criticized the episode for taking place before the events of " Kaddish " and " Memento Mori " in an attempt to not deal with Scully 's cancer . Furthermore , the two criticized the episode for being " thin stuff " and heavily padded ; Shearman and Pearson note that the long teaser is replayed in the episode " to no new dramatic effect " and that Covarrubias 's appearance offers no new information . Paula Vitaris , writing for Cinefantastique , rated " Unrequited " one star out of four , writing that it " collapses under the weight of its message " and that it " fails to bring to life any of its guest characters " . Furthermore , she criticized the reusing of the teaser , noting that it " just comes off as a writer 's device " .

 The halfbeaks ( family Hemiramphidae ) are a geographically widespread and numerically abundant family of epipelagic fish inhabiting warm waters around the world . The halfbeaks are named for their distinctive jaws , in which the lower jaws are significantly longer than the upper jaws . The similar viviparous halfbeaks ( family <unk> ) have often been included in this family . 
 Though not commercially important themselves , these forage fish support artisanal fisheries and local markets worldwide . They are also fed upon by other commercially important predatory fishes , such as billfishes , mackerels , and sharks . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 In 1775 , Carl Linnaeus was the first to scientifically describe a halfbeak , Esox brasiliensis . In 1775 Peter Forsskål described two more species as Esox , Esox far and Esox marginatus . It was not until 1816 that Georges Cuvier created the genus Hemiramphus ; from then on , all three were classified as Hemiramphus . In 1859 , Gill erected Hemiramphidae , deriving its name from Hemiramphus , the family 's type genus . The name comes from the Greek hemi , meaning half , and <unk> , meaning beak or bill . 
 The <unk> are primarily marine and found in the Atlantic , Pacific , and Indian Oceans , though some inhabit estuaries and rivers . The <unk> are confined to the Indo @-@ West Pacific <unk> region , an area running from East Africa to the Caroline Islands . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The halfbeaks ' fossil record extends into the Lower Tertiary . The earliest known halfbeak is <unk> <unk> from the Eocene at Monte Bolca , Italy . Apart from differences in the length of the upper and lower jaws , recent and fossil halfbeaks are distinguished by the fusion of the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones into a plate . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 The phylogeny of the halfbeaks is in a state of flux . 
 On the one hand , there is little question that they are most closely related to three other families of streamlined , surface water fishes : the flyingfishes , needlefishes , and sauries . Traditionally , these four families have been taken to together comprise the order <unk> . The halfbeaks and flyingfishes are considered to form one group , the superfamily <unk> , and the needlefishes and sauries another , the superfamily <unk> . 
 On the other hand , recent studies have demonstrated that rather than forming a single monophyletic group ( a clade ) , the halfbeak family actually includes a number of lineages ancestral to the flyingfishes and the needlefishes . In other words , as traditionally defined , the halfbeak family is paraphyletic . 
 Within the subfamily <unk> , the " flying halfbeak " genus <unk> has proved to be particularly problematic ; while morphologically closer to the flyingfishes , molecular evidence places it with Hemiramphus and Euleptorhamphus . Together , these three genera form the sister group to the flyingfish family . The other two <unk> genera Hyporhamphus and <unk> form another clade of less clear placement . 
 Rather than being closely related to the flyingfishes , the subfamily <unk> appears to be the sister group of the needlefishes and sauries . This is based on the pharyngeal jaw apparatus , sperm ultrastructure , and molecular evidence . However , this hypothesis has awkward implications for how the morphological evolution of the group is understood , because the fused pharyngeal plate has been considered reliably diagnostic of the halfbeak family . Furthermore , the existing theory that because juvenile needlefish pass through a developmental stage where the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw ( the so @-@ called " halfbeak stage " ) the theory that halfbeaks are paedomorphic needlefish is untenable . In fact the unequal lengths of the upper and lower jaws of halfbeaks appears to be the basal condition , with needlefish being relatively derived in comparison . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 The halfbeaks are elongate , streamlined fish adapted to living in open water . Halfbeaks can grow to over 40 centimeters ( 16 in ) SL in the case of <unk> viridis . The scales are relatively large , cycloid ( smooth ) , and easily detached . There are no spines in the fins . A distinguishing characteristic is that the third pair of upper pharyngeal bones are <unk> ( fused ) into a plate . Halfbeaks are one of several fish families that lack a stomach , all of which possess a pharyngeal jaw apparatus ( pharyngeal mill ) . Most species have an extended lower jaw , at least as juveniles , though this feature may be lost as the fish mature , as with <unk> , for example . 
 As is typical for surface dwelling , open water fish , most species are silvery , darker above and lighter below , an example of countershading . The tip of the lower jaw is bright red or orange in most species . 
 Halfbeaks carry several adaptations to feeding at the water surface . The eyes and nostrils are at the top of the head and the upper jaw is mobile , but not the lower jaw . Combined with their streamlined shape and the concentration of fins towards the back ( similar to that of a pike ) , these adaptations allow halfbeaks to locate , catch , and swallow food items very effectively . 
 = = Range and habitat = = 
 Halfbeaks inhabit warm seas , predominantly at the surface , in the Atlantic , Indian , and Pacific oceans . A small number are found in estuaries . Most species of marine halfbeaks are known from continental coastlines , but some extend into the western and central Pacific , and one species is endemic to New Zealand . Hemiramphus is a worldwide marine genus . 
 = = Ecology and behavior = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Marine halfbeaks are omnivores feeding on algae ; marine plants such as seagrasses ; plankton ; invertebrates such as pteropods and crustaceans ; and smaller fishes . For some subtropical species at least , juveniles are more predatory than adults . Some tropical species feed on animals during the day and plants at night , while other species alternate between carnivory in the summer and herbivory in the winter . They are in turn eaten by many ecologically and commercially important fish , such as billfish , mackerel , and sharks , and so are a key link between trophic levels . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Marine halfbeaks are typically pelagic schooling forage fish . The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir for example is found in sheltered bays , coastal seas , estuaries around southern Australia in waters down to a depth of 20 meters ( 66 ft ) . These fish school near the surface at night but swim closer to the sea floor during the day , particularly among beds of seagrasses . Genetic analysis of the different sub @-@ populations of the eastern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir in South Australian coastal waters reveals that there is a small but consistent migration of individuals among theme , sufficient to keep them genetically homogeneous . 
 Some marine halfbeaks , including Euleptorhamphus velox and Euleptorhamphus viridis , are known for their ability to jump out of the water and glide over the surface for considerable distances , and have consequently sometimes been called flying halfbeaks . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Hemiramphidae species are all external fertilizers . They are usually egg @-@ layers and often produce relatively small numbers of fairly large eggs for fish of their size , typically in shallow coastal waters , such as the seagrass meadows of Florida Bay . The eggs of Hemiramphus brasiliensis and H. <unk> are typically 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 059 – 0 @.@ 098 in ) in diameter and have attaching filaments . They hatch when they grow to about 4 @.@ 8 – 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 19 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) in diameter . Hyporhamphus melanochir eggs are slightly larger , around 2 @.@ 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 11 in ) in diameter , and are unusually large when they hatch , being up to 8 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 33 in ) in size . 
 Relatively little is known about the ecology of juvenile marine halfbeaks , though estuarine habitats seem to be favored by at least some species . The southern sea garfish Hyporhamphus melanochir grows rapidly at first , attaining a length of up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) in the first three years , after which point growth slows . This species lives for a maximum age of about 9 years , at which point the fish reach up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) and weigh about 0 @.@ 35 kg ( 0 @.@ 77 lb ) .

 = = = <unk> fisheries = = = 
 Halfbeaks are not a major target for commercial fisheries , though small fisheries for them exist in some places , for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish ( Hyporhamphus melanochir ) . and the eastern sea garfish ( Hyporhamphus australis ) . Halfbeaks are caught by a variety of methods including seines and pelagic trawls , dip @-@ netting under lights at night , and with haul nets . They are utilized fresh , dried , smoked , or salted , and they are considered good eating . However , even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries , they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species . 
 In some localities significant bait fisheries exist to supply sport fishermen . One study of a bait fishery in Florida that targets Hemiramphus brasiliensis and Hemiramphus <unk> suggests that despite increases in the size of the fishery the population is stable and the annual catch is valued at around $ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 = A Rugrats Chanukah = 
 " A Rugrats Chanukah " , titled onscreen as " Chanukah " and sometimes called the " Rugrats Chanukah Special " , is a special episode of Nickelodeon 's animated television series Rugrats . The first episode of the show 's fourth season and the sixty @-@ sixth overall , it tells the story of the Jewish holiday Chanukah through the eyes of the Rugrats , who imagine themselves as the main characters . Meanwhile , Grandpa Boris and his long @-@ time rival , Shlomo , feud over who will play the lead in the local synagogue 's Chanukah play . 
 Raymie Muzquiz directed " A Rugrats Chanukah " from a script by J. David Stem and David N. Weiss . In 1992 , Nickelodeon executives had pitched the idea of a Chanukah special to the production team , but the concept was revised and became the 1995 special , " A Rugrats Passover " . After production of the Passover episode wrapped , the crew returned to the Chanukah idea . Nickelodeon broadcast " A Rugrats Chanukah " on December 4 , 1996 ; the episode received a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 9 and positive reviews from television critics . Along with other Rugrats episodes featuring Boris and his wife , the special attracted controversy when the Anti @-@ Defamation League compared the character designs to anti @-@ Semitic drawings from a 1930s Nazi newspaper . 
 = = Plot = = 
 On Chanukah , Grandma Minka reads a book about the meaning of the holiday to the babies Tommy , Chuckie , Phil , and Lil . The babies imagine that they are the story 's characters ; Judah ( Tommy ) is outraged by King " <unk> " , who has taken over the Jewish kingdom and forced Greek culture on its inhabitants . Judah leads an army of Jewish Maccabees to war against <unk> 's Seleucid Empire , emerging victorious . The story is left unfinished as Minka stops to help make latkes in the kitchen with her daughter Didi . 
 Meanwhile , Grandpa Boris is furious that Shlomo , a rival from his youth in Russia , is pictured in the local newspaper for playing the Greek king in the local synagogue 's Hanukah play , where Boris is portraying Judah . The babies find out about Shlomo and form the impression that he truly is the Greek king , whom they dub the " Meanie of Chanukah " . At the play that night , they attempt to storm on stage to defeat the " Meanie of Chanukah " , but are stopped and taken into the synagogue 's nursery . Angelica is in the nursery already and , vehement in her desire to watch a Christmas special that is airing that night , convinces the babies to help her break out and steal a television set from the custodian 's office . 
 Boris and Shlomo begin fighting on stage during the play , interrupting the production and inciting an intermission . Backstage , Shlomo and Boris argue once more , with Boris mentioning Shlomo 's dedication to his business pursuits over familial values . Shlomo informs Boris that he had a wife who died before bearing him children , making Boris feel sympathy for his rival . Angelica sprints backstage , bumping into Shlomo and inadvertently destroying the television set . Shlomo unsuccessfully tries to console her , but eventually lets Boris take over . Tommy hands Shlomo the Chanukah story book Minka read to the babies earlier ; Boris convinces Shlomo to read it to the children . In the conclusion of the story , the Maccabees <unk> the Holy Temple , and discover that there is only enough oil to light the Temple 's eternal flame for one day ; miraculously , it remains lit for eight . Shlomo 's reciting dissolves both the babies ' assertion of him as the " Meanie of Chanukah " and his and Boris ' rivalry .

 Nickelodeon executives pitched the idea of making a Chanukah special to the Rugrats production team in 1992 . Paul Germain , the show 's co @-@ creator , responded with a Passover special instead , as he considered it to be a " funny idea " and of " historical interest " . " A Rugrats Passover " was completed in 1995 ; the show was one of the first animated television series to produce a special for a Jewish holiday . After production wrapped on " A Rugrats Passover " , the crew considered creating the Chanukah special that Nickelodeon had originally pitched . The episode was written by David Stem and David Weiss , and directed by Raymie Muzquiz . By the time Weiss came to write the teleplay , he had abandoned Christianity and converted to Judaism . 
 Paramount Home Video finished production of the home media version in July 1997 ; originally scheduling a release date of October that year , Paramount instead pushed the VHS release into 1998 . In time for Christmas 1997 , Paramount released the video Nickelodeon Holiday , which featured " A Rugrats Chanukah " and other holiday specials , such as " Hey Arnold 's Christmas " for US $ 12 @.@ 95 ( equivalent to $ 19 @.@ 09 in 2015 ) . On August 31 , 2004 , Paramount also released a DVD compilation titled Rugrats Holiday Celebration , which featured several holiday @-@ themed episodes , including " A Rugrats Chanukah " . Sarah Willson adapted the episode into the book , The Rugrats ' Book of Chanukah , illustrated by Barry Goldberg and published by Simon & Schuster in 1997 .

On December 1 , 2001 , CBS broadcast the episode for the first time on its network , at 8 : 30 p.m. Eastern Time . Carrying a TV @-@ Y parental rating , it followed the Rugrats Christmas special , " The Santa Experience " . Nickelodeon has aired the episode throughout subsequent holiday seasons . 
 " A Rugrats Chanukah " received positive reviews from television critics , and is one of the most popular episodes of Rugrats . Delia O <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times called it a " multigenerational tale " . Judith Pearl , in her book The Chosen Image : Television 's Portrayal of Jewish Themes and Characters , described the episode as a " fun [ treatment ] of Chanukah " . Chuck Barney of Knight Ridder and the Tribune News Service considered the episode a " hilariously imaginative take on the Chanukah legend " . 
 In a 1999 issue of TV Guide , " A Rugrats Chanukah " was listed at number 5 in their " 10 Best Classic Family Holiday Specials " . TV Guide later wrote that " Nickelodeon 's Rugrats secured its place in television history " with the episode , opining that it could " entertain a child of any religious denomination " . Ted Cox of the Daily Herald said that although the episode was not as good as the show 's Passover special — which he considered " among the best holiday TV specials ever produced " — it was " still noteworthy " . DVD Talk reviewer Francis Rizzo III wrote that the special " has a great historical opening " .

 = Battle of Ettlingen = 
 The Battle of Ettlingen or Battle of Malsch ( 9 July 1796 ) was fought during the French Revolutionary Wars between the armies of the First French Republic and Habsburg Austria near the town of Malsch , 9 kilometres ( 6 mi ) southwest of Ettlingen . The Austrians under Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen tried to halt the northward advance of Jean Victor Marie Moreau 's French Army of Rhin @-@ et @-@ Moselle along the east bank of the Rhine River . After a tough fight , the Austrian commander found that his left flank was turned . He conceded victory to the French and retreated east toward Stuttgart . Ettlingen is located 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) south of Karlsruhe . 
 The Rhine Campaign of 1796 saw Moreau 's army facing the Austrian Army of the Upper Rhine under Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour in the south . Meanwhile , Jean @-@ Baptiste Jourdan 's French Army of Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse opposed the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles in the north . Jourdan drubbed Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg at Altenkirchen on 4 June , compelling Archduke Charles to rush to the rescue with reinforcements . Charles defeated Jourdan at Wetzlar on the 15th , forcing him to pull back to the west bank of the Rhine . At this time there was a shake up in the high command and the archduke was put in control of both Austrian armies . In Charles ' absence , Moreau successfully crossed the Rhine at Kehl on the night of 23 – 24 June and beat Latour at Rastatt on 5 July . Leaving Wilhelm von Wartensleben in charge in the north , Charles rushed south to confront Moreau along the Alb River near Ettlingen . After an all @-@ day combat , the Austrians held the advantage on their right wing near Malsch , but the French had defeated their left wing in the Black Forest .

 = = = Plans = = = 
 At the beginning of the Rhine Campaign of 1796 , Austria had two armies in Germany , the Army of the Upper Rhine under Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser and the Army of the Lower Rhine under Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen . The left wing of the 80 @,@ 000 @-@ man Army of the Upper Rhine guarded the Rhine River from Mannheim to Switzerland under Anton Sztáray , Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph , Prince of Condé while its right wing was on the west bank around Kaiserslautern . The Army of the Lower Rhine had a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ strong right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg on the east bank observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf . The archduke 's remaining 70 @,@ 000 troops lay on the west bank along the Nahe River with powerful garrisons in Mainz and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress . 
 The Army of Rhin @-@ et @-@ Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was deployed with its right flank at <unk> , its center on the Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken . The Army of Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse commanded by Jean @-@ Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne , while the 22 @,@ 000 men of its left wing under Jean @-@ Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf . The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks . The strategic plan called for Jourdan to start by advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals . First , it was hoped that this would cause the Austrians to abandon the west bank of the Rhine . Second , the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau 's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south . 
 Until this time , the Army of Rhine @-@ et @-@ Moselle consisted of independent divisions . When Moreau assumed command he reorganized the army into three corps or wings plus a small reserve . Over the objections of all three men , he named Louis Desaix , Laurent Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr and Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino wing commanders . The system soon proved its worth . Moreau 's other innovation was to group many of the heavy cavalry regiments in the army reserve . The Chasseurs à Cheval , Dragoon and Hussar regiments remained attached to the infantry divisions . On 8 June , Ferino 's Right Wing had three divisions led by François Antoine Louis Bourcier ( 9 @,@ 281 infantry , 690 cavalry ) , Henri François Delaborde ( 8 @,@ 300 infantry , 174 cavalry ) and Augustin Tuncq ( 7 @,@ 437 infantry , 432 cavalry ) . Desaix 's Center had three divisions commanded by Michel de Beaupuy ( 14 @,@ 565 infantry , 1 @,@ 266 cavalry ) , Antoine Guillaume Delmas ( 7 @,@ 898 infantry , 865 cavalry ) and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles ( 4 @,@ 828 infantry , 962 cavalry ) . Saint @-@ Cyr 's Left Wing had two divisions under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme ( 7 @,@ 438 infantry , 895 cavalry ) and Alexandre Camille Taponier ( 11 @,@ 823 infantry , 1 @,@ 231 cavalry ) . Altogether , Moreau 's Army of Rhin @-@ et @-@ Moselle numbered 71 @,@ 581 foot soldiers and 6 @,@ 515 cavalry , plus gunners and sappers . Counting artillery and other elements , Moreau 's total was 79 @,@ 592 soldiers while Jourdan commanded 77 @,@ 792 men .

 The Rhine Campaign of 1795 had concluded with an armistice . On 20 May 1796 , the Austrians notified the French that the truce would end on 1 June . The minute it expired , Kléber led two divisions across the armistice line heading south toward Charles ' right wing . The French beat the Duke of Württemberg in the Battle of Altenkirchen on 4 June , capturing 3 @,@ 000 Austrians , four colors and 12 guns . By 6 June Kléber 's wing was on the Lahn River and Archduke Charles began evacuating the west bank of the Rhine in order to concentrate against the French incursion . Kléber was joined within a few days by Jourdan and most of the Army of the Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse . At about this time , the Austrian high command began transferring Wurmser and 25 @,@ 000 Austrians to Italy due to the successes of Napoleon Bonaparte . On 15 June , the archduke defeated the French in the Battle of Wetzlar . Subsequently , Jourdan recrossed to the west bank of the Rhine while Kléber retreated north toward Düsseldorf . 
 With Wurmser leaving the theater , Archduke Charles was given command over both Austrian armies . Wilhelm von Wartensleben took command of the Army of the Lower Rhine while Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour assumed leadership of the Army of the Upper Rhine . Jourdan and Kléber 's advance had caused their opponents to abandon the west bank of the Rhine and had drawn Charles north , as planned . Meanwhile , Moreau mounted operations against the Austrian fortifications opposite Mannheim in order to lead his enemies into thinking that it was the main attack . But on 24 June 1796 , Moreau launched a successful river crossing in the Battle of Kehl . The 7 @,@ 000 defending troops of the Swabian Regional Contingent put up a stout fight but were defeated with the loss of 700 soldiers , 14 guns and 22 munition wagons . The French reported losses of 150 . Subsequently , Sztáray took command of the Swabians who were reinforced up to a strength of 9 @,@ 000 by some Austrians . On the 28th Sztáray was beaten by Desaix at Renchen . The French sustained 200 casualties while allied losses amounted to 550 killed and wounded plus 850 men , seven guns and two munition wagons captured . 
 Having blocked Jourdan , Archduke Charles began moving troops south to oppose the Army of Rhin @-@ et @-@ Moselle as early as 21 June . He received the news that Moreau was across the Rhine on the 26th . Leaving 25 @,@ 351 foot and 10 @,@ 933 horse under Wartensleben and 27 @,@ 000 more around Mainz , the archduke raced south . The last units of the Moreau 's army made it across the Rhine on 29 June , though Delaborde remained guarding the west bank of the Rhine for a time . For a few days the French enjoyed a numerical superiority of 30 @,@ 000 to 18 @,@ 000 over their opponents . Moreau then made the remarkable decision to switch the positions of two of his wings ; Desaix now led the Left Wing while Saint @-@ Cyr commanded the Center . He also reorganized his army , reassigning some regiments that got lost in the confusion of the river crossing . Army of Rhin @-@ et @-@ Moselle expanded its bridgehead in a semicircle . Desaix moved downstream ( north ) , Ferino moved upstream ( south ) and Saint @-@ Cyr operated in the hills , ready to support either wing . The French irruption caused Fröhlich and Condé to retreat up the Rhine and Kinzig Rivers while Sztáray and the Swabians fell back to Freudenstadt . 
 Moreau had an opportunity to smash one of the enemy forces , but he moved slowly . Saint @-@ Cyr started from Oberkirch on 2 July . The next day his wing moved in an easterly direction , seizing enemy positions at <unk> , on the <unk> Mountain and at Freudenstadt . This deep thrust completely separated Fröhlich from the rest of the Army of the Upper Rhine . Latour and Sztáray tried to hold a position behind the <unk> River but Desaix attacked them in the Battle of Rastatt on 5 July . To assist in this operation , Moreau directed Saint @-@ Cyr to move down the <unk> valley . On the same day as Rastatt , Taponier 's division captured Gernsbach . At Rastatt , the French employed 19 @,@ 000 infantry and 1 @,@ 500 cavalry to spar with 6 @,@ 000 Austrians led by Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg and Johann <unk> von <unk> . The French turned both Austrian flanks , forcing their enemies to pull back east toward Ettlingen . Casualties on both sides were light . The Austrians lost 200 men and three guns captured . At Ettlingen Latour found the archduke 's leading elements , with the main body still a few days distant . The Austrians were in a vulnerable situation but Moreau delayed for three days at Rastatt , allowing Charles to bring up 25 battalions and 39 squadrons .

 On 1 July 1796 , Ferino 's Right Wing was organized into one division under Delaborde and four brigades led by Nicolas Louis Jordy , Nicolas Augustin Paillard , Jean Victor Tharreau and Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> . Jordy led the 3rd and 38th Line Infantry Demi Brigades . Tharreau directed the 3rd Light and the 56th , 74th , 79th and 89th Line Infantry Demi Brigades . Paillard commanded the 12th and 21st ( heavy ) Cavalry Regiments while <unk> commanded the 18th Cavalry , 4th Dragoon and 8th Hussar Regiments . Tuncq was not listed as leading a division . Ferino 's wing counted 18 @,@ 622 foot soldiers and 1 @,@ 039 horsemen . 
 At the same date , Desaix 's Left Wing was made up of the divisions of Beaupuy and Delmas . In Beaupuy 's division , Dominique Joba led the 10th , 62nd and 103rd Line and the 10th Light Demi Brigades while Gilles Joseph Martin <unk> Saint @-@ Suzanne commanded the 4th and 8th Chasseurs à Cheval and the 6th Dragoons . In Delmas ' division Jean Marie <unk> <unk> directed the 50th and 97th Line and 16th Light Infantry Demi Brigades while Maurice <unk> led the 7th Hussar and 10th and 17th Dragoon Regiments . Xaintrailles was not named as a division commander . Desaix 's command comprised 17 @,@ 126 bayonets and 2 @,@ 058 sabers . 
 A report from 9 July 1796 showed that Saint @-@ Cyr 's Center had two divisions under Duhesme and Taponier . In Duhesme 's division , Dominique Vandamme 's brigade included the 17th Line ( 2 @,@ 793 ) and 100th Line ( 2 @,@ 479 ) , 20th Chasseurs à Cheval ( 254 ) and 11th Hussars ( 38 ) . Duhesme 's division counted 5 @,@ 272 infantry and 292 cavalry . Taponier 's division consisted of the brigades of Henri François Lambert , Antoine Laroche <unk> and Claude Lecourbe . Lambert led the 93rd Line ( 3 @,@ 119 ) and 109th Line ( 2 @,@ 769 ) . Laroche directed the 21st Light ( 2 @,@ 284 ) and 31st Line ( 2 @,@ 840 ) .

 On 3 July , the Army of the Upper Rhine was organized into divisions under Fröhlich , Fürstenberg , Sztáray and Johann Sigismund Riesch . In addition , Archduke Charles personally commanded divisions under Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze and von Lindt . Fröhlich had three brigades led by Condé , Johann Jacob von <unk> and Simon von Wolf . Fürstenberg led seven brigades under <unk> , Milius , Joseph Heinrich von <unk> , Ignaz Gyulai , Johann Baptist von Leloup , Franz Walter Anton von Canisius and Paul Devay . The last two brigades were detached to Latour 's direct command along with the divisions Sztáray and Riesch . Sztáray 's division included five brigades under Ludwig Wilhelm Anton Baillet de Latour @-@ Merlemont , Konrad Valentin von Kaim , Prince Joseph de Lorraine @-@ Vaudemont , Duke Alexander of Württemberg and Johann I Joseph , Prince of Liechtenstein . Riesch 's division had three brigades under Count Palatine , Adam <unk> de <unk> and an unknown officer . In the archduke 's corps , Hotze commanded three Austrian brigades under Wilhelm Lothar Maria von Kerpen , Franz Seraph of Orsini @-@ Rosenberg and Joseph von Schellenberg . Lindt led five Electoral Saxon brigades . 
 The Austrian order of battle for 9 July showed the army organized into four columns . The 1st Column under Kaim included two brigades under Schellenberg and Christoph von <unk> . Schellenberg had two battalions each from Grand Duke of Tuscany Nr. 23 and Olivier Wallis Nr. 29 Infantry Regiments , six companies from the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Slavonian Infantry Regiment and one squadron of the Archduke Ferdinand Hussar Regiment Nr. 32 . <unk> led three battalions of the Archduke Charles Nr. 3 Infantry Regiment , the <unk> and Retz Grenadier Battalions and two squadrons each of the Szekler Hussar Regiment and Waldeck Dragoon Regiment Nr. 39 . 
 Sztáray commanded the 2nd Column which consisted of an Advanced Guard under Devay , two brigades led by Latour @-@ Merlemont and the Prince of Lorraine and two <unk> mounted units , four squadrons each of the Archduke John Dragoons Nr. 26 and Waldeck Dragoons . Devay led two battalions of the Pellegrini Nr. 49 Infantry Regiment , one battalion each of the <unk> Nr. 51 and Serbian Infantry Regiments , seven squadrons of the Archduke Ferdinand Hussars and six squadrons of the Kinsky Chevau @-@ légers Nr. 7 . Latour @-@ Merlemont commanded three battalions of the Manfredini Nr. 12 Infantry Regiment and the Candiani , Dietrich , <unk> and Warren Grenadier Battalions . Lorraine directed four squadrons each of the Kavanaugh Nr. 12 and Archduke Franz Nr. 29 Cuirassiers . 
 Latour led the 3rd Column which was organized into an Advanced Guard under Canisius and three brigades directed by Kerpen , Liechtenstein and Württemberg . Canisius commanded three battalions of the Franz Kinsky Nr. 47 Infantry Regiment , four companies from the Serbian and three companies of the Slavonian Infantry Regiments , six squadrons of the <unk> Chevau @-@ légers Nr. 28 , four squadrons of the Szekler Hussars and two squadrons of the Coburg Dragoons Nr. 37 . Kerpen led three battalions of the Alton Nr. 15 Infantry Regiment and the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Grenadier Battalions . Liechtenstein controlled three squadrons of the Kaiser Dragoons Nr. 1 . Württemberg directed six squadrons of the Mack Nr. 20 and four squadrons of the Ansbach Nr. 33 Cuirassiers . 
 The small 4th Column was commanded by Johann Nepomuk von Mosel and consisted of two battalions of the Schröder Nr. 7 Infantry Regiment , one battalion of the Leloup Jägers and two squadrons each of the Albert Nr. 5 and Kaiser Nr. 15 Carabiniers . Lindt 's Saxon infantry was made up of the Brandenstein and <unk> Grenadier Battalions , one battalion of Weimar Jägers , and one battalion each of the <unk> , Prinz Anton , Prinz Clemens , Prince Gotha and Van der <unk> Infantry Regiments . The Saxon mounted troops included four squadrons each of the Carabinier , Hussar and Prinz Albert and Courland Chevau @-@ léger Regiments plus two squadrons of the Saxe @-@ Gotha Cavalry Regiment . Altogether , Charles had about 32 @,@ 000 troops available .

 After conferring with Desaix and Saint @-@ Cyr at Renchen , Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796 . This decision preempted Archduke Charles , who had planned to attack the French on the 10th . The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest . For his part , Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach . Latour held the Austrian right near the Rhine , Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch , Kaim defended the left @-@ center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt 's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg . 
 Moreau accompanied Desaix 's Left Wing with the divisions of Delmas and Sainte @-@ Suzanne ( vice Beaupuy ) , Bourcier 's Reserve and Saint @-@ Cyr 's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains . Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each time by the Austrians . Latour tried to force his way around the French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve . Finding his horsemen outnumbered near <unk> , Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay . In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM . In the evening the Austrians were pushing Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt . 
 Kaim had six battalions of infantry , four squadrons of cavalry and plenty of artillery deployed at <unk> . He posted three more battalions at <unk> to the north and an advance guard in Loffenau . Saint @-@ Cyr left Duhesme 's division behind to guard Freudenstadt and the <unk> Mountain . He started from Gernsbach with 12 battalions plus six more borrowed from the Reserve . Finding that the Saxons were marching south along the Enz River to turn his right flank , he sent Taponier with six battalions and 150 hussars east to <unk> . Taponier surprised the Saxons and sent them scurrying back north . With Lambert and Lecourbe 's brigades , Saint @-@ Cyr advanced through Loffenau to <unk> northwest of <unk> where he confronted Kaim . Finding the Austrians in powerful defenses , Saint @-@ Cyr tried to draw Kaim 's troops out of position . 
 Employing elements of the 84th and 106th Line , the French wing commander ordered the troops not to press home their assault , but to retreat every time they came against strong resistance . Each attack was pushed farther up the ridge before receding into the valley . When the fifth assault in regimental strength gave way , the defenders finally reacted , sweeping down the slope to cut off the French . Saint @-@ Cyr now sprung his trap . Lecourbe led the massed grenadier companies to attack one Austrian flank , other reserves bored in on the other flank and the center counterattacked . The French troops that struck the Austrian right were hidden in the nearby town of <unk> . As the Austrians gave way , the French followed them up the ridge right into their positions . Nevertheless , Kaim 's men laid down such a heavy fire that Lecourbe 's grenadiers were thrown into disorder and their leader nearly captured . At length , Saint @-@ Cyr 's troops emerged triumphant , inflicting 1 @,@ 000 casualties on their opponents and capturing two cannons . Kaim was compelled to withdraw east across the hills to Neuenbürg . From there , Kaim and Lindt 's soldiers fell back toward Pforzheim . 
 = = Results = = 
 French losses numbered 2 @,@ 000 killed and wounded plus 400 captured . The Austrians suffered 1 @,@ 300 killed and wounded with 1 @,@ 300 captured . On 10 July , Charles evacuated Malsch and ordered a forced march east to Pforzheim via Karlsruhe . Also on the 10th , the French occupied Ettlingen and Neuenbürg . Anxious to protect his magazines at Heilbronn , Charles halted at Pforzheim for a few days . For his part , Moreau would not believe that Charles had given up , so he waited around Ettlingen for several days . Meanwhile , the Austrians packed their supplies into wagons and headed east on 14 July . The next day , Moreau moved on Pforzheim but found the archduke gone . 
 When Archduke Charles withdrew from the Rhine valley , he left about 30 @,@ 000 troops in garrisons along the river . There were 15 @,@ 000 foot and 1 @,@ 200 horse in Mainz , 3 @,@ 000 infantry in Ehrenbreitstein , 8 @,@ 800 infantry and 300 cavalry in Mannheim and 2 @,@ 500 foot soldiers in Philippsburg . To contain the first two , Jourdan left 28 @,@ 545 troops under François Séverin Marceau @-@ <unk> while Moreau only detailed 2 @,@ 800 infantry and 240 cavalry to watch the last two places . For the most part , the Austrian garrisons remained quiescent . But the Austrians in Mannheim caused mischief by attacking Kehl on 18 September . More might have been accomplished in that assault , but the Austrian soldiers paused to pillage the French camp and were driven off by their enemies . Even so , Charles not only lost the services of the 30 @,@ 000 men in the fortresses but also of the Swabians , Saxons and other German allies when he retreated from the Rhine . These auxiliary forces began to negotiate with the French when their territories were occupied . 
 Historian Ramsay Weston Phipps believed that Charles might have remained along the Rhine and defeated the French armies one after the other . Unlike the divided command of the French , the Austrians enjoyed unity of command . After Ettlingen , Phipps thought that the correct French strategy was for the two French armies to join . However , this was not part of Carnot 's plan , which was for each army to operate against the Austrian flanks . Carnot 's strategy had succeeded in 1794 during the Flanders Campaign and he expected that it would win again . However , in 1794 the Coalition was made up of several countries with different vulnerabilities , while in 1796 Charles could issue a command and expect it to be obeyed . The next clash would be the Battle of Neresheim on 11 August .

 = Coconut crab = 
 The coconut crab , Birgus latro , is a species of terrestrial hermit crab , also known as the robber crab or palm thief . It is the largest land @-@ living arthropod in the world , and is probably at the upper size limit for terrestrial animals with exoskeletons in recent times , with a weight of up to 4 @.@ 1 kg ( 9 @.@ 0 lb ) . It can grow to up to 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) in length from leg to leg . It is found on islands across the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific Ocean as far east as the Gambier Islands mirroring the distribution of the coconut palm ; it has been extirpated from most areas with a significant human population , including mainland Australia and Madagascar . 
 The coconut crab is the only species of the genus Birgus , and is related to the terrestrial hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita . It shows a number of adaptations to life on land . Like hermit crabs , juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection , but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell . Coconut crabs have organs known as " branchiostegal lungs " , which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing . They cannot swim , and will drown if immersed in water for long . They have developed an acute sense of smell , which has developed convergently with that of insects , and which they use to find potential food sources . Mating occurs on dry land , but the females migrate to the sea to release their fertilised eggs as they hatch . The larvae are planktonic for 3 – 4 weeks , before settling to the sea floor and entering a gastropod shell . Sexual maturity is reached after about 5 years , and the total lifespan may be over 60 years . 
 Adult coconut crabs feed on fruits , nuts , seeds , and the pith of fallen trees , but will eat carrion and other organic matter opportunistically . The species is popularly associated with the coconut , and has been widely reported to climb trees to pick coconuts , which it then opens to eat the insides . While coconut crabs can climb trees , and can eventually open a coconut collectively , coconuts are not a significant part of their diet . Coconut crabs are hunted wherever they come into contact with people and are subject to legal protection in some areas . In the absence of precise information the IUCN lists the species as " data deficient " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Birgus latro is the largest terrestrial arthropod , and indeed terrestrial invertebrate , in the world ; reports about the size of Birgus latro vary , but most sources give a body length of up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) , a weight of up to 4 @.@ 1 kg ( 9 @.@ 0 lb ) , and a leg span of more than 0 @.@ 91 m ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) , with males generally being larger than females . The carapace may reach a length of 78 mm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) , and a width of up to 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) . 
 The body of the coconut crab is , like that of all decapods , divided into a front section ( cephalothorax ) , which has 10 legs , and an abdomen . The front @-@ most pair of legs has large chelae ( claws ) , with the left being larger than the right . The next two pairs , as with other hermit crabs , are large , powerful walking legs with pointed tips , which allow coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces . The fourth pair of legs is smaller with <unk> @-@ like chelae at the end , allowing young coconut crabs to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection ; adults use this pair for walking and climbing . The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs , and by the males in mating . This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace , in the cavity containing the breathing organs . There is some difference in colour between the animals found on different islands , ranging from orange @-@ red to purplish blue ; in most regions , blue is the predominant colour , but in some places , including the Seychelles , most individuals are red . 
 Although Birgus latro is a derived type of hermit crab , only the juveniles use salvaged snail shells to protect their soft abdomens , and adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells to protect their abdomens . Unlike other hermit crabs , the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells but instead harden their abdominal terga by depositing chitin and chalk . Not being constrained by the physical confines of living in a shell allows this species to grow much larger than other hermit crabs in the family <unk> . Like most true crabs , B. latro bends its tail underneath its body for protection . The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land , but has to be moulted periodically . Adults moult annually , and dig a burrow up to 1 m ( 3 ft 3 in ) long in which to hide while vulnerable . It remains in the burrow for 3 to 16 weeks , depending on the size of the animal . After moulting , it takes 1 to 3 weeks for the exoskeleton to harden , depending on the animal 's size , during which time the animal 's body is soft and vulnerable , and it stays hidden for protection . 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 Except as larvae , coconut crabs cannot swim , and they will drown if left in water for more than an hour . They use a special organ called a branchiostegal lung to breathe . This organ can be interpreted as a developmental stage between gills and lungs , and is one of the most significant adaptations of the coconut crab to its habitat . The branchiostegal lung contains a tissue similar to that found in gills , but suited to the absorption of oxygen from air , rather than water . This organ is expanded laterally and is <unk> to increase the surface area ; located in the cephalothorax , it is optimally placed to reduce both the blood / gas diffusion distance and the return distance of oxygenated blood to the pericardium . Coconut crabs use their hindmost , smallest pair of legs to clean these breathing organs and to moisten them with water . The organs require water to properly function , and the coconut crab provides this by stroking its wet legs over the spongy tissues nearby . Coconut crabs may drink water from small puddles by transferring it from their chelipeds to their maxillipeds . 
 In addition to the branchiostegal lung , the coconut crab has an additional rudimentary set of gills . Although these gills are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families <unk> and the <unk> , they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area . 
 = = = Sense of smell = = = 
 The coconut crab has a well @-@ developed sense of smell , which it uses to locate its food . The process of smelling works very differently depending on whether the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air . As most crabs live in the water , they have specialised organs called <unk> on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell . However , as coconut crabs live on the land , the <unk> on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects . While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths , the same need to detect smells in the air led to the development of remarkably similar organs . Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception . They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances . The smells of rotting meat , bananas , and coconuts , all potential food sources , catch their attention especially . Research has shown that the olfactory system in the coconut crab 's brain is well @-@ developed compared to other areas of the brain . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Coconut crabs mate frequently and quickly on dry land in the period from May to September , especially between early June and late August . Male coconut crabs have spermatophores and deposit a mass of spermatophores on the abdomen of the female ; the abdomen opens at the base of the third pereiopods , and fertilisation is thought to occur on the external surface of the abdomen as the eggs pass through the spermatophore mass . The extrusion of eggs occurs on land in crevices or burrows near the shore . Shortly thereafter , the female lays her eggs and glues them to the underside of her abdomen , carrying the fertilised eggs underneath her body for a few months . At the time of hatching , the female coconut crab releases the eggs into the ocean . This usually takes place on rocky shores at dusk , especially when this coincides with high tide . The empty egg cases remain on the female 's body after the larvae have been released , and the female eats the egg cases within a few days . The larvae float in the pelagic zone of the ocean with other plankton for three to four weeks , during which a large number of them are eaten by predators . The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post @-@ larval <unk> stage ; this process takes from 25 to 33 days . Upon reaching the <unk> stage of development , they settle to the bottom , find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell , and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs . At that time , they sometimes visit dry land . Afterwards , they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water . As with all hermit crabs , they change their shells as they grow . Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces . When they outgrow their shells , they develop a hardened abdomen . The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching . They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Coconut crabs live in the Indian Ocean and the central Pacific Ocean , with a distribution that closely matches that of the coconut palm . The western limit of the range of B. latro is Zanzibar , off the coast of Tanzania , while the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn mark the northern and southern limits , respectively , with very few population in the subtropics , such as the Ryukyu Islands . There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the <unk> of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius , but it no longer occurs in any of these places . As they cannot swim as adults , coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae . 
 Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean has the largest and densest population of coconut crabs in the world , although it is outnumbered there by more than 50 times by the Christmas Island red crab , Gecarcoidea natalis . Other Indian Ocean populations exist on the Seychelles , including Aldabra and <unk> , but the coconut crab is extinct on the central islands . Coconut crabs occur on several of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal . They occur on most of the islands , and the northern atolls , of the Chagos Archipelago . 
 In the Pacific , the coconut crab 's range became known gradually . Charles Darwin believed it was only found on " a single coral island north of the Society group " . The coconut crab is far more widespread , though it is not abundant on every Pacific island it inhabits . Large populations exist on the Cook Islands , especially Pukapuka , Suwarrow , Mangaia , <unk> , Mauke , Atiu , and Palmerston Island . These are close to the eastern limit of its range , as are the Line Islands of Kiribati , where the coconut crab is especially frequent on <unk> ( Washington Island ) , with its abundant coconut palm forest . The Gambier Islands marks the species ' eastern limit . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet of coconut crabs consists primarily of fleshy fruits ( particularly <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Pandanus elatus , P. <unk> ) , nuts ( coconuts Cocos nucifera , Aleurites <unk> ) and seeds ( <unk> reticulata ) , and the pith of fallen trees . However , as they are omnivores , they will consume other organic materials such as tortoise hatchlings and dead animals . They have been observed to prey upon crabs like Gecarcoidea natalis and <unk> <unk> , as well as scavenge on the carcasses of other coconut crabs . During a tagging experiment , one coconut crab was observed killing and eating a Polynesian Rat ( Rattus exulans ) . Coconut crabs may be responsible for the disappearance of Amelia Earhart 's remains , consuming them after her death and hoarding her skeletal remnants in their burrows . 
 The coconut crab can take a coconut from the ground and cut it to a husk nut , take it with its claw , climb up a tree 10 m ( 33 ft ) high and drop the husk nut , to access the coconut meat inside . They often descend from the trees by falling , and can survive a fall of at least 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) unhurt . Coconut crabs cut holes into coconuts with their strong claws and eat the contents , although it can take several days before the coconut is opened . 
 Thomas Hale Streets discussed the behaviour in 1877 , doubting that the animal would climb trees to get at the nuts . In the 1980s , Holger <unk> was able to confirm Streets 's report , observing and studying how they open coconuts in the wild . The animal has developed a special technique to do so : if the coconut is still covered with husk , it will use its claws to rip off strips , always starting from the side with the three germination pores , the group of three small circles found on the outside of the coconut . Once the pores are visible , the coconut crab will bang its pincers on one of them until they break . Afterwards , it will turn around and use the smaller pincers on its other legs to pull out the white flesh of the coconut . Using their strong claws , larger individuals can even break the hard coconut into smaller pieces for easier consumption . 
 = = = Habitat = = = 
 Coconut Crabs are considered one of the most terrestrial decapods , with most aspects of its life linked to a terrestrial existence ; they will drown in sea water in less than a day . Coconut crabs live alone in underground burrows and rock crevices , depending on the local terrain . They dig their own burrows in sand or loose soil . During the day , the animal stays hidden to reduce water loss from heat . The coconut crabs ' burrows contain very fine yet strong fibres of the coconut husk which the animal uses as bedding . While resting in its burrow , the coconut crab closes the entrances with one of its claws to create the moist microclimate within the burrow necessary for its breathing organs . In areas with a large coconut crab population , some may come out during the day , perhaps to gain an advantage in the search for food . Other times they will emerge if it is moist or raining , since these conditions allow them to breathe more easily . They live almost exclusively on land , returning to the sea only to release their eggs ; on Christmas Island , for instance , B. latro is abundant 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from the sea . 
 = = = Relationship with human beings = = = 
 Adult coconut crabs have no known predators apart from other coconut crabs and humans . Its large size and the quality of its meat means that the coconut crab is extensively hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population . The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac , and intensive hunting has threatened the species ' survival in some areas . While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous , it may become so depending on its diet , and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred . For instance , consumption of the sea mango <unk> <unk> by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due to the presence of cardiac <unk> . 
 The pincers of the coconut crab are powerful enough to cause noticeable pain to a human ; furthermore , the coconut crab will often keep its hold for extended periods of time . Thomas Hale Streets reports a trick used by Micronesians of the Line Islands to get a coconut crab to loosen its grip : " It may be interesting to know that in such a dilemma a gentle titillation of the under soft parts of the body with any light material will cause the crab to loosen its hold . " 
 In the Cook Islands , the coconut crab is known as <unk> or <unk> , and in the Mariana Islands it is called <unk> , and is sometimes associated with <unk> 'na because of the traditional belief that ancestral spirits can return in the form of animals such as the coconut crab .

 Coconut crab populations in several areas have declined or become locally extinct due to both habitat loss and human predation . In 1981 , it was listed on the IUCN Red List as a vulnerable species , but a lack of biological data caused its assessment to be amended to " data deficient " in 1996 . 
 Conservation management strategies have been put in place in some regions , such as minimum legal size limit restrictions in Guam and Vanuatu , and a ban on the capture of egg @-@ bearing females in Guam and the Federated States of Micronesia . In the Northern Mariana Islands , hunting of non @-@ egg @-@ bearing adults above a carapace length of 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) may take place in September , October and November , and only under licence . There is a bag limit of 5 coconut crabs on any given day , and 15 across the whole season . 
 In Tuvalu coconut crabs live on the motu ( islets ) in the Funafuti Conservation Area , a marine conservation area covering 33 square kilometres ( 12 @.@ 74 square miles ) of reef , lagoon and motu on the western side of Funafuti atoll .

 The coconut crab has been known to western scientists since the voyages of Sir Francis Drake around 1580 and William Dampier around 1688 . Based on an account by Georg Eberhard Rumphius ( 1705 ) , who had called the animal " Cancer <unk> " , Carl Linnaeus ( 1767 ) named the species Cancer latro , from the Latin latro , meaning " robber " . The genus Birgus was erected in 1816 by William Elford Leach , containing only Linnaeus ' Cancer latro , which was thus renamed Birgus latro . Birgus is classified in the family <unk> , alongside one other genus , Coenobita , which contains the terrestrial hermit crabs . 
 Common names for the species include coconut crab , robber crab and palm thief , which mirrors the animal 's name in other European languages ( e.g. German : <unk> ) . 
 = Metroid : Other M = 
 Metroid : Other M is an action @-@ adventure video game developed by " Project M " , a team consisting of members from Nintendo , Team Ninja and D @-@ Rockets , and published by Nintendo for the Wii console . It is part of the Metroid series , and was released in North America on August 31 , 2010 . This was shortly followed by the release in Japan , Australia and Europe in September 2010 . The game is set between the events of Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion . The player assumes the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran , who investigates a derelict space station along with a Galactic Federation platoon , which includes her former commanding officer , Adam Malkovich . 
 Other M is played from a third @-@ person perspective using only with the Wii Remote , and focuses on exploration and combat . Other M introduces melee attacks which could only be executed when an enemy 's health was reduced to a certain degree . Impressed with the 2004 action game Ninja Gaiden , series co @-@ creator Yoshio Sakamoto approached Team Ninja to develop Other M , while D @-@ Rockets was brought in to handle the in @-@ game cutscenes . The development team employed a simple control scheme to make the game more intuitive and attractive , and gave significant focus on plot and characterization , with extensive usage of cinematics and voice acting . 
 Upon release , Other M received favorable reviews , with much praise to its gameplay , music , graphics and overall atmosphere . Some journalists , however , criticized its plot and Samus ' characterization in the game , which was considered negative deviation from the series ' norm . Other M received an Editors ' Choice Award and the award for Coolest Atmosphere of 2010 from IGN , was nominated for Best Wii Game of the 2010 by GameTrailers and picked by Wired as one of the best games of the year , but was also chosen as one of the worst games of the year by Entertainment Weekly and Attack of the Show ! , and as the third Biggest Disappointment of 2010 by Game Informer . It was the third best @-@ selling video game in Japan during its week of release , and it was the ninth best @-@ selling game in North America during September 2010 . The long @-@ term sales numbers were considered disappointing by Nintendo , as a half a million copies of the game were sold in North America by November 2010 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 As in previous Metroid games , Metroid : Other M is set in a large world with elevators that connect regions . Each elevator contains rooms separated by doors , which mostly open automatically , but sometimes need a special action to be unlocked . Other M unfolds in a more linear manner due to its focus on storyline ; Navigation Booths , similar to the Navigation Rooms from Metroid Fusion , tell the player where to go , and the in @-@ game map highlights the next objective . The gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets , platform jumping , and shooting enemies . While there are power @-@ ups scattered around the Bottle Ship , a few items are already equipped by Samus , but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes her to do so . Unlike other games in the series , enemies do not drop items , with the restoration of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths , or employing of the Concentration technique , where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health . 
 The regular gameplay features a third @-@ person perspective , where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally . Samus can jump , fire the arm cannon , and turn into a morph ball , which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs . While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles , the game 's environments are three @-@ dimensional and movement is not limited to a two @-@ dimensional plane . Other M is the first in the series to feature a melee combat system . With well @-@ timed button presses , players can use special techniques such as the Sense Move , which allows them to dodge enemy attacks , and the <unk> , where Samus jumps on the enemy and fires a charged shot at point @-@ blank range . 
 When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen , the angle switches into a first @-@ person perspective , where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles ; however , players cannot move in this perspective . There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes ; for example , fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person , while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points . Additionally , the first @-@ person mode is also used in exploration , such as locating hidden items .

 Metroid : Other M takes place between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion , and is set on a Galactic Federation Bottle Ship . The main environment is the vessel interior , known as the Main Sector , along with the other environments that are contained in " sectors " or gigantic spheres within the ship : the Biosphere , a lush , tropical region ; the <unk> , an arctic environment ; and the Pyrosphere , a heated , lava @-@ filled area . Later on in the game , the ship is revealed to be a secret facility which contains many different lifeforms with the purpose of turning them into bioweapons . The facility eventually abandoned them after the crew managed to breed a Queen Metroid and propagate Metroids in Sector Zero , a recreation of the Space Pirates ' base in Zebes , and interfaced with them via an artificial intelligence in an android body named MB . It is modeled after Mother Brain and is able to communicate with Metroids and other creatures through telepathy . 
 The player takes on the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran , who investigates the Bottle Ship after receiving a " Baby 's Cry " -type distress signal . Upon docking , she encountered the squad she had been a part of when she had been enrolled in the Galactic Federation Army , the " 07th Platoon " , consisting of several soldiers : Adam Malkovich , the commanding officer to Samus during her time in the Federation ; Anthony Higgs , the point man of the 07th Platoon and Samus ' past colleague ; Lyle Smithsonian , a special forces trooper in charge of demolition assignments and who suffers from <unk> ; K.G. Misawa , the recon scout ; Maurice Favreau , the engineer ; and James Pierce , a communications expert . <unk> in the game , Samus learns that the Federation soldiers are mysteriously killed by a secret assassin among their ranks , who she calls the " Deleter " . Other characters include Dr. Madeline Bergman , the site manager and development director of the Bottle Ship 's secret projects ; and MB , named Melissa Bergman , an android created to replicate Mother Brain 's artificial intelligence . Adam 's deceased brother , Ian Malkovich , is included in one of Samus ' flashbacks . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The story begins as Samus awakens in a Galactic Federation facility , after dreaming about her battle with Mother Brain and the death of the Metroid larva on planet Zebes . Time passes and Samus receives a distress signal from a dormant " Bottle Ship , " which floats a short distance away from a Federation vessel . Upon entering the ship , Samus encounters the Galactic Federation 07th Platoon , among which her old colleagues from her military career : commanding officer Adam Malkovich , and point man Anthony Higgs . Adam treats Samus very harshly due to the circumstances of her departure from the army , and orders his team not to reveal any details of their mission to " an outsider " . After she saves them from monsters , Adam eventually allows Samus to cooperate with the platoon under the condition that she follow his orders . The platoon is then briefed , and assigned to go on solo searches to investigate the Bottle Ship . 
 At the Biosphere 's Exam Center , Samus and the 07th Platoon learn that the ship 's director , Dr. Madeline Bergman , had conducted research on illegal bioweapons for the Federation . After a mysterious reptilian creature attacks before being driven off , Adam directs Samus to pursue the monster to the Pyrosphere , though is quickly directed to the <unk> to find any survivors . There , she encounters an unidentified woman , but is shortly attacked by an unidentified 07th Platoon soldier . Realizing there is a traitor amongst the platoon , Samus dubs him the " Deleter " . Returning to the Pyrosphere to pursue the mysterious reptilian creature , Samus discovers that it is actually a juvenile stage of the dragon @-@ like Ridley . Adam tries to get through to her before he is attacked . Anthony draws Ridley 's attention and challenges him , but is seemingly killed , forcing Samus to battle with him . As Samus leaves the Pyrosphere , she discovers the " Deleter " heading to the Biosphere and follows him to the <unk> Research Center , where Samus meets the woman from before , who claims to be " Madeline Bergman " . Madeline tells Samus that an artificial intelligence program based on Mother Brain , called MB , was created to control the Metroids , harbored in a secret area known as Sector Zero . As Samus approaches towards Sector Zero , Adam stops her from entering , telling her that the Metroids in the said sector are most invulnerable to cold . Adam commands Samus to defeat Ridley and secure the safety of a survivor in " Room MW " of the <unk> Research Center . Adam then heads to Sector Zero to activate its self @-@ destruct sequence , sacrificing himself in the process . 
 Swearing to finish the mission , Samus returns to the research center , where she finds the body of James Pierce and mummified remains of Ridley . She discovers the survivor that Adam mentioned , and confronts a Queen Metroid . She defeats the creature and pursues the survivor , who reveals herself as Madeline Bergman . She tells Samus that MB was the person met earlier , an android created to establish a relationship with the Metroids . MB revolted and developed a personality similar to Mother Brain , telepathically commanding the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board . MB appears and confronts Samus and Madeline . Suddenly , a group of Federation Marines rushes into the room , and MB summons the Bottle Ship 's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone . After being frozen by a distraught Madeline , MB is shot dead by the Marines . The colonel praises Samus for her involvement in the mission , but orders a Marine to escort her back to her ship . A Marine complies and reveals himself as Anthony , the only surviving member of the 07th Platoon . Samus , along with Madeline and Anthony , then leave for the Galactic Federation headquarters in her gunship . 
 In a post @-@ credits epilogue , Samus returns to the Bottle Ship , now marked for destruction by the Galactic Federation , to retrieve something that is irreplaceable . After battling a <unk> , a monster Samus had also fought in Zebes , she arrives at the control center and recovers Adam 's platoon helmet . The Bottle Ship 's self @-@ destruct sequence is remotely activated , which Samus – in her Zero Suit – escapes with Adam 's helmet . 
 = = Development = = 
 Metroid : Other M was developed by " Project M " , a team of over 100 people that includes staff from Nintendo , Team Ninja , and D @-@ Rockets , with production lasting for three years . During the launch of the Wii console in 2006 , Nintendo producer and chief Metroid designer Yoshio Sakamoto decided to create a new Metroid game for it , but opted to work with an outside company , as his usual development team " didn 't actually have the know @-@ how to produce something that was 3D " . Eventually , Sakamoto approached Yosuke Hayashi of Team Ninja to discuss the incorporation of the flashy Ninja Gaiden engine into a new engine to encompass his new vision of a 3D Metroid game . Sakamoto served as producer and scenario designer , and main design was done by three designers from the Game Boy Advance titles of the series , Metroid Fusion and Metroid : Zero Mission . Team Ninja took charge of the programming and 3D modeling , and D @-@ Rockets handled the CG cutscenes . Hayashi described the work on the game as " a great honour " since he was a fan of the series , and stated Team Ninja tried to include as many creatures seen in previous games as possible . 
 While Retro Studios tried to create " the ultimate first @-@ person experience " with the Metroid Prime series , Sakamoto 's approach with gameplay was different , particularly for the story Other M intended to tell . When Sakamoto met Team Ninja , he said his intent was a game with " controls as simple as those of a NES game " , so it would appeal to modern players . Team Ninja agreed with that approach , as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre , and tried to make the game employ only the Wii Remote , without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion . The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action , with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed . Sakamoto focused on 2D @-@ like gameplay because he considered it more " comfortable " for audiences , particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes , as he thought 2D " [ doesn 't ] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences " . While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts , a few of the elements that " made those games unique " were implemented into Other M , such as the " immersive sight " of the first @-@ person mode . When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden , Yosuke Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action @-@ based sequences , there will still be the exploration @-@ based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games . Yoshio Sakamoto said that Other M 's story progression was in the same manner as Metroid Fusion , and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is " unlike anything that 's ever been done at Nintendo ; it 's more than just a collaborative effort — it 's one group working toward a common goal " . 
 Before Other M 's development , Sakamoto did not think too much about " what kind of person Samus Aran was and how she thinks and her personality " , particularly because the games tried to depict Samus as a mysterious person . Sakamoto and Team Ninja put much focus on backstory in the game to present Samus as an " appealing human character " , something important for future installments , as players would get further interest in Samus ' adventures . Hayashi said that one of the development team 's goals was to have the player " connect with Samus as the story and action develops " . Sakamoto also said the game would " bring everyone up to the same level of understanding in the Metroid universe " , and would not only introduce the series to new players but also create new challenges for fans . The chronological setting between Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion was chosen because Sakamoto considered the period " so critical that without addressing it , we wouldn 't be able to make new games that show Samus ' adventures that take place after the events of Metroid Fusion " . 
 D @-@ Rockets , a company specialized in CG animation for video games and commercials , was brought into the project for its in @-@ game cinematics on Team Ninja productions . Director Ryuji Kitaura said when Nintendo gave him the instructions , he considered the work " overwhelming " - most of D @-@ Rockets work only involved high @-@ quality CG , while Nintendo aimed to " make the parts of the game that the player controls the same quality as the cinematics , in order to make them seamless " and Sakamoto intended to cutscenes to give emotional depth to Samus . Team Ninja and D @-@ Rockets worked separately most of the time , and only started to collaborate about a year into production , to make sure the in @-@ game action and the cutscenes had the same style . Over 300 storyboards which took six months to be completed , and ten teams were employed on the development of cutscenes . For increased realism , professional camera operators helped with the motion capture , and Samus ' face had a more detailed frame to make expressions more lifelike . Kitaura tried to include more scenes with Samus outside her powered armor , to illustrate " the human , weak side of Samus , her expressions and gesture " , but Sakamoto convinced him otherwise with a declaration that the Power Suit acts as a shield for both enemy attacks and the reveal of her emotions . As a special feature , players can unlock " Theater Mode " , a two @-@ hour film presentation , upon completion of the game . Divided into chapters , this film contains every cut @-@ scene of the game , along with several clips of gameplay footage recorded by the developers . Other M uses a dual @-@ layer disc due to extensive usage of cinematics in the game . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Kuniaki Haishima composed the soundtrack of Other M. The team hired Haishima to write the music because the producers felt he could " tell the story with melodies " and " powerfully [ helped ] us depict Samus ' feelings and emotions " . Parts of the soundtrack were recorded and performed by <unk> @-@ Orchestra in Tokyo and Asian Philharmonic Orchestra in Beijing . Furthermore , a " piece of piano music " was made by a member of staff at Sakamoto 's request . 
 For the game 's voice acting , Jessica Martin was cast to play Samus in the English version of Other M , and said that recording sessions took over a year which resulted in the voice cast being required to record lines with storyboards and unfinished cutscenes as basis . Adam Malkovich was voiced by Dave Elvin ; while Mike <unk> provided the voice of Anthony Higgs . In Japanese , voice actors Ai Kobayashi , Rikiya Koyama , Kenji Nomura and Shizuka Itō provided the voices of Samus , Adam , Anthony and MB respectively . Seattle @-@ based Bad Animals Studio and Ginza @-@ based <unk> Haus recorded voice @-@ overs in English and Japanese languages respectively . 
 = = Marketing and release = = 
 The game was first announced by Nintendo of America president and CEO Reggie Fils @-@ Aimé and a trailer was briefly shown during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009 . Fils @-@ Aime stated that Metroid : Other M would " take you deeper into Samus ' story " , and also noted that the game would be a return to the style of the traditional series as opposed to the Metroid Prime series , though the game would have a " harder edge " . On E3 2010 , the game had a playable demo , which GameTrailers picked as Best Wii Game and Action / Adventure Game of the expo , and was nominated for Game of the Show . Previews of Other M were also featured in the 2010 editions of Game Developers Conference and Nintendo Media Summit . Fils @-@ Aime expected global sales of between 1 @.@ 5 and 2 million units . 
 Metroid : Other M was released in North America on August 31 , 2010 . It had an original release date of June 27 , 2010 , but it was postponed by two months , as the high standards of the development team got them behind the completion schedule . In other territories , Other M was released September 2 in Japan and Australia , and one day later in Europe , where its release was preceded by a large marketing campaign with television spots , trailers at theaters , and online ads . GameStop began providing an art folio for purchasers who pre @-@ ordered the game containing " 16 individual high @-@ quality cards " . The cards feature concept artwork , in @-@ game screenshots , and a description from Samus ' perspective . Metroid : Other M was later re @-@ released on the Wii U 's Nintendo eShop , in Japan on March 17 , 2016 ; and in Europe on March 31 .

 Metroid : Other M was met with " generally favorable " reviews , according to Metacritic . GameSpot praised the control scheme , combat system , and the search for secrets ; they wrote that the former two were " unique and responsive " and the latter was " very rewarding " . Famitsu reviewers complimented the Sense Move technique as " by far the best " , and the switch between perspectives , which " works surprisingly well " . IGN called the gameplay " a really impressive evolution of the old @-@ school Metroid design " , and GameTrailers described it as " a nice compromise between satisfying fans and opening up the series for a wider audience " . Good Game 's two presenters " enjoyed the atmosphere of it [ ... ] and was quite hooked to keep making progress " . The game 's graphics were also well @-@ received , garnering some acclaim . Christian Donlan of Eurogamer exclaimed that Other M bears graphical similarities to Metroid Prime which " tend to come across as nicely @-@ built video game levels at best " . IGN claimed that despite the graphics not being on par with the Prime series , it was still regarded as " one of the best looking games on Wii " . The Daily Telegraph described the environments as " lush and detailed " , and said they helped " capturing the ethos of old @-@ school Metroid " . IGN also praised the game 's " storytelling with motion @-@ captured acting and voice @-@ over " , and Wired applauded cutscenes " with slick graphic effects " . The music was praised as atmospheric and faithful to the franchise , though GameSpot felt they were " more like outtakes from older entries than a moody new soundtrack " . 
 Complaints were raised on the first person perspective . The A.V. Club 's David Wolinsky felt that the " Where 's Waldo ? -like sequences " were irritating . Similarly , Ryan Scott of GameSpy complained that they were " oh @-@ god @-@ I 'm @-@ going @-@ to @-@ snap @-@ the @-@ disc @-@ in @-@ half frustrating " and considered the perspective a " weird forced handicap " , while Official Nintendo Magazine commented that " [ t ] hese bits are atrocious " and took " 20 frustrating minutes trying to figure out what we were supposed to look at during one scene , only to realise there was a tiny green patch of liquid on the grass " . Game Informer expressed disappointment that " [ it ] also takes away your ability to move [ while in first person view ] " . Critics responded poorly to the mechanic of power @-@ up restriction ; they derided it as a deviation from the series ' tradition of item discovery , and even more strongly criticized it as nonsensical and condescending in terms of story . GamesRadar derided the game 's linearity in comparison with Metroid Fusion , a game which took a similar approach . The website also found the enemies to be " a largely unimpressive collection " , a gripe which Edge also had ; it wrote that " truly testing enemies are only found in the last stretch " . Other M 's short length was criticized by reviewers , by critics such as GameTrailers , which writes that the bonuses such as art galleries were not stimulating enough to entice replay value . 
 Major criticism focused on the script , dialogue , and cutscene length . GameSpot felt that the " unskippable " cutscenes and " the overabundance of story in Other M were a negative deviation from Metroid tradition " . Game Informer states that they " often run as long as 15 minutes , exhausting players with repetition of obvious plot points and overwrought dialogue as mature and interesting as a teenager ’ s diary " and declared Samus as " [ t ] he biggest culprit in the bad storytelling " . 1UP.com complained that as the game progresses " instead of getting more of the things that work [ combat ] , you get more of the things you don 't care about [ overwrought story ] " . Donlan cited the plot as " the future 's dumbest soap opera at worst " . Wolinsky echoes the misgivings about Samus ' immaturity , petulant behavior , and misguided loyalty . GamePro writes that while the story and Samus ' monologues did not compel them , " it helped contextualize her entire existence " which developed the character to " an actual human being who 's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past " . Contrarily , Justin Haywald of 1UP.com found the portrayal " lifeless and boring " and " nonsensical " . G4 TV 's Abbie Heppe considered a portrayal of Samus as " sexist " ; she wrote that she " cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man " , and found that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals . Heppe also described the dialogue as " sounding like they came from a tween drama " . Ben " Yahtzee " Croshaw of The Escapist 's Zero Punctuation was particularly critical on the game , calling the story a " bloated , cancerous mass ... turning one of gaming 's toughest female icons into a shrieking <unk> in a submissive relationship with a <unk> in a fancy cap " . He described the gameplay as " infinitely stronger [ than the story ] in that it 's merely bad . " 
 The reception from the series ' fanbase towards the game was generally mixed . In a 1UP.com Presents feature , Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were disappointed by the game 's story , power @-@ up restrictions and its " awkward handling of its leading lady " . Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed @-@ to @-@ positive reactions from Japanese fans . Kotaku 's Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by " many people " for the game 's story . In a September 2011 interview with G4 TV , Hayashi clarified that the story was " definitely the product of Mr. Sakamoto at Nintendo . We definitely worked with them on the project , but that was all him . " Nintendo Treehouse producer Nate <unk> stated that the scene depicting Samus ' encounter with Ridley " is not a sign of weakness , but of strength . People who call out that scene as anything but empowering are kind of missing the point " . He added that " Samus ’ story — her voice , her motivations , everything about her — has largely been a matter of individual perception , especially in the US , where people haven ’ t read any of the official manga related to her childhood .

 Sorkin gathered inspiration for the show from a number of places . According to the Huffington Post , " Sorkin got the idea [ for the show ] from watching TV ... while writing The American President . He was watching ESPN , and found the humor and banter from the anchors ( Dan Patrick and ... either Keith Olbermann or Craig Kilborn ) intoxicating , and decided to create a comedy set in that world " . The show utilises a laugh track , which the Post @-@ Gazette described as following " an unwritten primetime rule : all half @-@ hour shows , except animated comedies ... must have a laugh track " and Hollywood.com 's Peter Hall calls a " goof " that " crippled " the first few episodes " of the show .

 Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker was positive , despite his initial skepticism . He worried that Aaron Sorkin would not be able to translate big @-@ screen success on films such as A Few Good Men and The American President to television , and believed before watching the show that it was " a golden opportunity to stink up prime time with the sort of smug , <unk> , life @-@ <unk> ironic talking heads who 've outlasted their naughty @-@ boy novelty status on ESPN " . However , after watching the show , he wrote " But against all odds , Sports Night is a home run , a hole in one , a touchdown — at once the most consistently funny , intelligent , and emotional of any new @-@ season series . " 
 The Huffington Post 's Bob Sassone , while reviewing the show retrospectively in 2006 , praised the " intelligent writing , fast @-@ paced dialogue , and a strong ensemble cast of smart , moral characters all working toward a common goal . " He also pointed out links <unk> Night and Aaron Sorkin 's next production , the critically acclaimed The West Wing . The Washington Post called Sports Night " the best new ABC sitcom of the season " and also commented " Aaron Sorkin ... [ has ] certainly got a knack for snappy , and occasionally moving , dialogue . " They were among a number of publications to point out how the show would appeal to sports fans and non @-@ sports enthusiasts alike . The Associated Press marked Sports Night out as one of the few potential successes amongst the freshman shows for the 1998 – 99 season . Entertainment Weekly believed that the season as a whole deserved to be nominated for best comedy at the Emmys .

 = From Here to Eternity the Musical = 
 From Here to Eternity the Musical is a musical with music and lyrics by Stuart Brayson and Tim Rice and a book by Bill Oakes . Based on the novel of the same name , written by James Jones , the musical made its West End and world premiere in 2013 , at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London . 
 Jones 's novel From Here to Eternity was a best @-@ seller and well known for its successful movie adaptation . Jones 's manuscript was heavily censored by his publisher to remove profanity and references to gay prostitution ; the unexpurgated version was not published until 2011 . Once it was , composer Stuart Brayson thought it might be adapted as a musical , and proposed the project to Tim Rice , who acquired the stage rights and wrote the lyrics . 
 The musical was announced in May 2011 and opened on 23 October 2013 , a year later than originally planned . The West End production stars Darius Campbell as Warden , Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt , and Ryan Sampson as Maggio . The work received mixed reviews , though Brayson was praised for an imaginative score . The production closed on 29 March 2014 , after a run of six and a half months . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The musical is set in 1941 , at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii , in the months leading up to the Attack on Pearl Harbor . The story tells the tale of G Company , in particular First Sergeant Milt Warden , who begins an affair with his captain 's wife Karen , insubordinate soldier and male hustler Maggio and Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt , an infantryman from Kentucky and self @-@ described " thirty @-@ year man " ( a career soldier ) , who falls in love with prostitute Lorene . Because he blinded a fellow soldier while boxing , the stubborn Prewitt refuses to box for his company 's outfit led by Captain Dana " Dynamite " Holmes and then resists the " Treatment , " a daily hazing ritual in which the non @-@ commissioned officers of his company run him into the ground . 
 = = Background = = 
 The basis of the musical is the 1951 novel From Here to Eternity by James Jones . In 1941 , Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii , at the time of Pearl Harbor , and the novel was loosely based on his experiences in the 27th Infantry Regiment . It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers in the months leading up to the attack , in particular Private <unk> , a boxer who no longer wants to fight having blinded an opponent , and Sergeant Milt Warden , who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer . 
 James 's story was censored by its publisher , Scribner as it would not allow profanity and gay <unk> to remain in the text . Jones fought the censorship but had to back down ; despite this it won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1952 and is recognised as one of the twentieth century 's best American novels . The title of From Here to Eternity is inspired by Rudyard Kipling 's poem Gentlemen @-@ <unk> , in particular the line " damned from here to Eternity " . Two years later in 1953 , it was adapted into a film starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr , which achieved success at the box office and won eight Academy Awards , including Best Picture . The movie was also initially deemed controversial because of the source text 's critical views on the Army , with minor changes being made to the script to gain the military 's co @-@ operation . The uncensored version of the novel was released in May 2011 , initially as an e @-@ book . 
 The idea for the musical came from Stuart Brayson , who had been sending cassette tapes with music ideas to Tim Rice since they had first met in the 1980s , when Brayson was a member of the band Pop . In 2002 , Brayson sent Rice a tape of music and lyrics to form the basis of a stage version of From Here to Eternity . Rice liked the idea but only intended to produce the show , however after Bill Oakes had been hired to write the book gaps appeared where new songs were needed and some no longer fitted within the context of the show . Rice agreed to write around six new songs , but ultimately ended up writing around 90 % of the show 's lyrics inspired by Brayson 's original lyrics . On the subject Rice said : " Stuart 's were very good , but they weren 't theatrical and there is a difference . I often wish I could write great rock lyrics , but I can 't , however , I can do reasonable lyrics within the context of a show . There are people who can write good tunes , but few who can do theatrical lyrics . " 
 In May 2011 , Tim Rice and Lee Menzie announced that an adaption was being planned . Rice acquired the stage rights at an initial cost of around US $ 40 @,@ 000 , with the intention of opening the show in London the following year . Although the show did not ultimately open until 2013 , a workshop of the show took place in 2012 . 
 As the show is based on the uncensored novel released in 2011 , rather than the 1953 film adaptation , it contains references to prostitution and gay sex , as well as the Army 's investigation into them , that the film did not feature . The right to create the musical adaptation came with the condition that it had to be based on the original book . James Jones 's daughter Kaylie and son Jamie were in the audience for the show 's opening night in London . During its preview period some people walked out of the performance , having been unprepared for the nudity and swearing in the production . Darius Campbell who played First Sergeant Milt Warden , said that the " James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we 've dived in head first . Maybe some of the nudity , swearing and explicitness have been too much for them , but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film – and wanted to see more – have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful . " Kaylie admitted they had doubts about the idea of the show when it first came up , but added that " I 'm thrilled — it 's so sophisticated and moving . " She also noted that she " was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes , because my dad said this is just the way it was back then " and that " my father would have been amazed " .

 On 26 October 2012 , producers announced that the show would play the Shaftesbury Theatre from September 2013 , with tickets going on sale in April . The show has a book by Bill Oakes and is directed by Tamara Harvey , with choreography by Javier De Frutos , orchestrations by David White , set and costume design by <unk> Gilmour , lighting design by Bruno Poet and sound design by Mick Potter . The musical features an original score , with music by Stuart Brayson and lyrics by Tim Rice . The musical adaption marked Rice 's first entirely new show since Aida and Brayson 's first West End musical . Former US Marine Ray Elliott , also head of the James Jones literary society , was hired to ensure an accurate picture of military life for the era . Elliott read the script to ensure it was realistic , ran military drills , taught the cast how to salute all ranks and how to hold rifles correctly . The show received its first public outing as part of West End Live in June 2013 , with star Robert Lonsdale singing " Fight the Fight " . 
 On 1 July 2013 , full casting was announced with Darius Campbell playing Warden , Robert Lonsdale playing Private Prewitt , Ryan Sampson playing Maggio , <unk> Harrison playing Lorene and Rebecca Thornhill playing Karen . From Here to Eternity began previews on 30 September 2013 , at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London , and held its official opening gala night on 23 October . In all the London production features a cast of thirty three and a fifteen @-@ member band . A typical London performance runs two hours and 50 minutes , including one interval of 15 mins . 
 On 29 November 2013 , it was announced the production would close on 26 April 2014 , after a 7 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ month run , with the possibility of reopening at another theatre . The closure was later brought forward a month to 29 March . To mark the 72nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor on 7 December 2013 , the cast joined with The Military Wives choir for a special post curtain rendition of the song " The Boys of ' 41 " .

 Michael Billington of The Guardian noted that the original novel had helped offset overly heroic images of the American soldier , but in the wake of Abu <unk> , the view of the military was already mixed , " why now , and what does music add to the story ? " Quentin Letts of the Daily Mail deemed the show " harmless nonsense " but acknowledged an outside chance it could become a camp classic . Simon Edge of the Daily Express deemed the show " a commendably ambitious work that makes a refreshing addition to the West End menu . " Paul Taylor of The Independent suggested , " For all the show 's many defects , though , you come away impressed by its seriousness of purpose " . 
 Taylor praised the music : " Brayson 's catchy score , which moves deftly through swing , blues , jazz and early rock 'n'roll can rise to good old showbiz brassiness when needed " . Henry <unk> of the Evening Standard gave a mixed view of the music , " There are seductive melodies and a couple of genuinely catchy songs . But it never settles into a single confident idiom , and between the big numbers there are lulls , especially in the overlong first half . " Letts praised Campbell for his vocal talents , stating that he " does some worthy old @-@ fashioned crooning – in a pleasant song called ' Marking Time ' there are moments when he actually sounds like Nat King Cole . " 
 Taylor predicted on 24 October 2013 , " Wags have quipped that it should be called From Here to November . But I reckon it 's going to survive quite a bit longer than that . "

 = Ruislip Woods = 
 Ruislip Woods is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and national nature reserve covering 726 acres ( 294 ha ) in Ruislip in the London Borough of Hillingdon . The woods became the first national nature reserve in an urban area of England in May 1997 , receiving the Green Flag Award in 2006 . Ruislip Local Nature Reserve at TQ 090 899 is part of the national nature reserve . 
 Evidence of Bronze Age settlements has been found within the woods during archaeological excavations . Timber from the woods has been used in the building of several nationally significant buildings , as well as locally ; the Great Barn at Manor Farm was built from oak from the woods . 
 Ownership of the woods passed with the manor from Ernulf de Hesdin to Bec Abbey and on to King 's College , Cambridge over the years , until Park Wood was sold to the local authority . The remaining woods were purchased from other owners and Ruislip Woods was formed . 
 = = History = = 
 Use of the wood has been dated back to the Bronze Age , after a barbed spearhead was discovered by a metal detector user . During an excavation of the findspot in 1984 the spearhead , measuring 4 @.@ 75 inches ( 121 mm ) in length , was found to have been lying in an oval pit with fragments of pottery , indicating it to be the collection of domestic waste from a settlement . 
 The woods are the remains of the dense woodland which would have covered the county of Middlesex from prehistoric times . Woodland was cleared over time for farming and housing . 
 Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , Ernulf de Hesdin was given the manor of Ruislip , which included the woods , in recognition of his service to William the Conqueror . In 1087 , Ernulf de Hesdin passed the manor to the Bec Abbey . During the Abbey 's ownership , timber from the woods was used in the construction of the Tower of London in 1339 , Windsor Castle in 1344 , the Palace of Westminster in 1346 and the manor of the Black Prince in Kennington . Locally , the Great Barn on the Manor Farm site was constructed of oak from the woods . King 's College , Cambridge became lords of the manor in 1451 . 
 The manor of Ruislip became part of the Ruislip @-@ Northwood Urban District , though it remained under the ownership of King 's College , Cambridge . A town @-@ planning competition led to a design being chosen that envisaged the clearance of much of the woods and historic sites in Ruislip to make way for 7 @,@ 642 homes , enough for 35 @,@ 000 residents , across the manor . A planning scheme adapted from the original was presented to the public in February 1913 and was approved by the Local Government Board in September 1914 . The outbreak of the First World War halted all construction work , by which time only three new roads had been completed . It did not resume again until 1919 . 
 In February 1931 , the woods were included in a sale by King 's College to the urban district council . Park Wood was sold for £ 28 @,@ 100 , with Manor Farm and the old Post Office included as a gift to the people of Ruislip . King 's had also wished to present the wood as a gift but was required by the University and College 's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land . Middlesex County Council contributed 75 % of the cost , as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day @-@ trippers from outside the district . Under a 999 @-@ year lease , the council agreed to maintain the wood and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council . An area of the wood to the south was not included in the lease agreement and three residential roads were later constructed on it . 
 Copse Wood was purchased by Middlesex County Council and London County Council in 1936 for £ 23 @,@ 250 , being joined by Mad Bess Wood in the same year . The urban district council , together with Middlesex and London County Councils , purchased the 186 acres ( 75 ha ) wood for £ 28 @,@ 000 in a compulsory purchase from Sir Howard Stransom Button . 
 In 1984 , Battle of Britain House , which had been built in Copse Wood in 1905 by Josef Conn , was destroyed by fire and the ruins demolished . The house was originally a private home , but during the Second World War was used by the United States military to train saboteur agents for missions in occupied France . 
 On 21 May 1997 , the woods became a national nature reserve , the first in an urban area of England . The Ruislip Woods Trust was established that year as a charity dedicated to the conservation of the woods , while encouraging greater public interaction with them . 
 In June 2008 , a new off @-@ road cycle trail was unveiled in <unk> Wood , named after the former head of democratic services at Hillingdon Council in recognition of his long service to the borough . The " David Brough Cycle Trail " , covering 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) , was officially opened on 24 June . 
 = = Flora and fauna = = 
 The main species of trees in the woods include English oak , sessile oak , hornbeam , beech , silver birch , wild service tree , aspen , rowan , field maple , crack willow , wild cherry , hazel and holly . 
 Wild flowers are also in abundance around the woods , and include common knapweed , harebell , <unk> <unk> , heather , bluebell , <unk> , yellow archangel , snowdrops and honeysuckle . 
 According to the London Borough of Hillingdon , the most common species ' of birds found within the woods are mute swan , Canada goose , robin , green woodpecker , jay , nuthatch , lesser spotted woodpecker , greater spotted woodpecker , cuckoo , sparrowhawk , tree creeper , tawny owl , willow tit and woodcock . 
 Cattle are grazed in Poor 's Field each year to maintain the level of the vegetation . Wild mammals include foxes , hedgehogs , stoats , weasels , mink , grey squirrels and badgers . Several species of bat also live in the woods . 
 = = Management = = 
 The reserve covers four woods : Park Wood , Mad Bess Wood and Copse Wood in Ruislip , with <unk> Wood in Harefield . Poor 's Field and <unk> 's Lake in Ruislip are also part of the reserve . There is no definitive explanation as to why Mad Bess Wood received its name , although one theory is that it was named after a female landowner who patrolled the wood looking for poachers . 
 The woods are managed by the London Borough of Hillingdon , which inherited them from the former Ruislip @-@ Northwood Urban District . The council maintains the volunteer @-@ run Ruislip Woodlands Centre in the grounds of Ruislip Lido , a reservoir within Park Wood . Ruislip Woods received the Green Flag Award in 2006 . 
 The woods were coppiced on rotation throughout the years with the timber being sold to local tanneries . By the time King 's College took ownership of the manor , the woods were let out for pheasant shooting . <unk> of the woods continues today , under a 20 @-@ year rotation to aid in the natural growth of the woodland . 
 Ducks Hill Road and Breakspear Road North pass through the woods in Ruislip and Harefield respectively . 
 = Cameron White = 
 Cameron Leon White ( born 18 August 1983 ) is an Australian cricketer for the Melbourne Renegades and is the former Australian Twenty20 and Victorian Bushrangers captain . A powerful middle order batsman and right @-@ arm leg @-@ spin bowler , White made his first @-@ class cricket debut as a teenager in the 2000 – 01 season for the Victorian Bushrangers as a bowling all @-@ rounder . Early comparisons with Victoria team @-@ mate Shane Warne faded as White took on a role closer to that of Andrew Symonds , a batsman who bowled occasionally . 
 In 2003 – 04 , he became Victoria 's youngest ever captain at the age of 20 when he took over leadership of their one @-@ day side , and the first @-@ class captaincy followed the season after . International recognition came for the first time in 2005 , but White found himself in and out of the side as the selectors and national captain Ricky Ponting looked for White to improve his bowling to play as a front @-@ line spinner . Two successful winters with English county side Somerset helped to propel White back into the selectors ' minds . White had a short Test career playing four Test matches in 2008 . 
 His tenure as T20 captain ended with the 2012 series against India where he was dropped following poor form in the Big Bash League . He was succeeded by Melbourne Stars teammate George Bailey . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 White began his cricket career working his way through the youth structure at Victoria , playing in the Commonwealth Bank Under @-@ 17 , and later Under @-@ 19 , Championship series . She showed his prowess with both bat and ball during these competitions , claiming a century , two half @-@ centuries and 17 wickets in the ten matches she played over two seasons . She tended to bat as part of the middle order and bowl as third or fourth change . His first @-@ class debut came in March 2001 , aged 17 , against New South Wales . Batting at number nine , White scored 11 runs in his only batting innings of the match , and claimed 4 / 65 coming on as third change bowler . He made one further first @-@ class appearance that season before joining up with the Australia Under @-@ 19 cricket team for two youth Tests against Sri Lanka . 
 He captained the <unk> Cricket Academy side that toured New Zealand , beating New Zealand Academy 3 – 1 in a four @-@ match one @-@ day series , after a pair of draws in two three @-@ day matches . Soon after , he made his List A debut for Victoria , but the match was rained off after 42 @.@ 1 overs without White taking any part in the match . White received his first senior man of the match award a few days later for his two wickets and score of 91 batting at number seven during the Pura Cup match against South Australia . He was named as captain of the Australia Under @-@ 19 squad to compete in the 2002 Under @-@ 19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand , and led his team to victory in the competition , beating South Africa by seven wickets in the final . White finished the tournament as the leading run @-@ scorer with 423 runs , with two of the other top @-@ four batsmen also being Australian . 
 Despite his success with the bat during the Under @-@ 19 World Cup , Victoria continued to use White as a bowling all @-@ rounder , a decision that seemed to be justified in the 2002 – 03 season when White passed 50 just once in his 13 first @-@ class innings and claimed 28 wickets . In his last match of the season , he claimed his maiden five and ten @-@ wicket hauls , taking 6 / 66 in the first @-@ innings against Western Australia and 4 / 70 in the second @-@ innings to help Victoria to a 10 wicket victory . 
 = = = Youngest ever captain = = = 
 Following a season which had seen Darren Berry and Shane Warne share the captaincy of Victoria 's ING Cup side , the Victoria selectors appointed White as the captain for the 2003 – 04 season . Aged only 20 , White became the youngest player to captain the Victoria state side in its 152 @-@ year history to that point . His coach , David Hookes said that " White has shown at a young age a successful understanding of captaining a team " . The decision was supported by the reports that during the Under @-@ 19 World Cup , he captained the side with " flair , control and maturity far beyond his years " . White was also called upon to captain the first @-@ class side early in the 2003 – 04 season , after regular captain Berry broke his finger during a practice match . After a win and a loss while captaining the ING Cup side , White was named man of the match on his debut as Pura Cup captain , taking six wickets to lead Victoria to a five wicket victory over Queensland . 
 White was given his first taste of international cricket in December 2003 . Having taken four Indian wickets during a tour match for Victoria , White was selected to play for Australia A against the same opposition later in the tour . Batting at number six in an Australian side that also included Victoria team @-@ mate Brad Hodge , and was captained by Michael Hussey , White made little impression on the Indians , making just 20 runs in his two innings and taking no wickets . White retained his place in the A side to face Zimbabwe in two 50 @-@ over contests , claiming two wickets . 
 The 2003 – 04 season saw White 's batting improve markedly in first @-@ class cricket but he tore some ligaments in his right leg , therefore ending his 2003 – 04 season . A return of five half @-@ centuries in eighteen innings saw his season average finish in excess of 30 for the first time . He also claimed 30 wickets in the season , the most in a single season in his career to date , although his average suffered compared with the previous season , rising to over 35 . A couple of cameo innings also indicated what was to come , 58 runs off 65 balls against Western Australia , and 75 runs off 97 balls against South Australia , an innings that included 7 fours and 3 sixes , showcased the strengths that would later see White shine in the shorter Twenty20 format of the game . 
 These improvements in White 's game , and an injury to Stuart MacGill , saw White named as part of the 13 @-@ man Australia Test squad to tour Zimbabwe . With the Australia selectors keen to take two spinners on the tour , MacGill 's injury allowed them to select White " with a view to the future . " A tour match against Zimbabwe A brought a wicket for White , but he was denied the chance of making his Test debut when the two @-@ match series was called off due to disputes between the Zimbabwe cricket board and their rebel players . White described the decision as a missed opportunity " to see how everything went and how an international Test match is played " . 
 The 2003 – 04 season had been capped by victory in the Pura Cup following a 321 victory over Queensland in the final , in which White made a half @-@ century and claimed five of the oppositions wickets . Victoria captain Berry retired from professional cricket after the triumph , and White was named as his replacement for 2004 – 05 . White was pleased with the appointment , saying that the captaincy " brings out the best in my game and the extra responsibility is good for me " . In December 2004 , White made his maiden first @-@ class century , making 119 after Victoria were forced to follow @-@ on against Queensland . His partnership of 205 with Ian Harvey , a record seventh @-@ wicket partnership for Victoria , and 152 from opener Jason <unk> helped Victoria recover to a second @-@ innings total of 508 / 8 declared . A fine bowling performance then saw Queensland bowled out for just 169 , capping a " remarkable fightback " by Victoria .

 During his early career , parallels were drawn Victoria team @-@ mate Shane Warne ; both were blonde , and both were leg @-@ spinners . It was soon apparent that he did not have the ability to turn the ball as much as Warne , his style being described as more reminiscent of Anil Kumble instead . Mid @-@ way through the 2004 – 05 season , White played four matches for Australia A against the touring West Indians and Pakistanis . Three 50 @-@ over matches brought him two half @-@ centuries and a duck , and his first experience of Twenty20 cricket resulted in an unbeaten 58 with a strike rate over 150 . Victoria did not qualify for either Pura Cup or ING Cup finals , but White 's improvement was again significant ; his first @-@ class averages remained roughly the same as in the previous season , but he more than doubled his previous best season batting average in one @-@ day cricket , passing 30 in the format . 
 After his impressive form for Australia A during January 2005 , White was selected as part of the Australia A side to tour Pakistan in September that year . After claiming four wickets , and averaging 35 @.@ 50 with the bat in the 2 four @-@ day matches , White shone in the subsequent one @-@ day games . Not required to bat in the first , he then scored 106 not out in the second and 59 not out in the third , also claiming a tail @-@ end wicket . Having now demonstrated his ability as a big @-@ hitting all @-@ rounder , White was selected to make his international debut during the 2005 ICC Super Series against the ICC World XI . Shaun Pollock , captaining the World XI team , said that his batsmen would target the young leg @-@ spinner , but Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he expected White to bowl , after he 'd " handled things well in the Victoria game against them " . He was named as supersub in the first two matches , being on field only during the ICC World XI innings , therefore being unable to bat . He did not bowl in the first match , and only bowled three wicket @-@ less overs in the second . Despite controversy regarding the official status of the matches , these two appearances as supersub signified White 's first two One Day International ( ODI ) appearances . He started the third match , but as Australia closed their innings on 293 / 5 , White was again not required to bat , nor did he bowl in the following ICC World XI innings . 
 White was named as a bowling supersub again for the first ODI of the Chappell – Hadlee Trophy , replacing <unk> at the start of the New Zealand innings . He bowled one wicket @-@ less over , conceding four runs . After missing out on the second match , White returned for the third , getting the opportunity to bat for the first time . He was dismissed for a golden duck , falling to Chris Martin first ball . In the New Zealand innings , he claimed his first senior international wicket , bowling Hamish Marshall . 
 = = = International contract not renewed = = = 
 2005 – 06 was the first season that Twenty20 cricket was played domestically in Australia , and White with his Victoria team were the quickest to adapt to the new format . White earnt a man of the match award in his first match in the tournament , scoring 45 runs off 32 balls and claiming a single wicket . Two wickets followed in the second match , and a second victory granted Victoria a place in the final . Facing New South Wales in the final , White added 46 off 16 balls , scoring at almost three runs a ball . He claimed 3 / 8 in the following innings , helping to restrict New South Wales to 140 , giving Victoria the championship title . White finished the tournament with 99 runs , second only to Brad Hodge , and 6 wickets , trailing only Shane Harwood , both Victoria team @-@ mates . 
 In April 2006 , White joined up with English county side Somerset for the first match of the County Championship . After Somerset were forced to follow @-@ on by Gloucestershire , White came in at number five and scored 172 runs off 228 balls before finally being caught off the bowling of former Victoria team @-@ mate Ian Harvey . Despite this innings , Somerset only managed a team total of 287 , and lost the match by an innings and seven runs . Two weeks later , on 1 May , Cricket Australia announced that along with James Hopes and Mick Lewis , Cameron White 's national contract would not be renewed for the next 12 months . When Somerset captain Ian Blackwell suffered a shoulder injury that put him out of the game for three months , White was named as his replacement . As with Australia Under @-@ 19s and Victoria , the added responsibility seemed to improve his game . A score of 109 * against Glamorgan in the 50 @-@ over Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy was followed immediately by 131 * in the County Championship against Worcestershire , a half @-@ century against the touring Sri Lankans and then a second @-@ innings 108 against Surrey , all made in the first half of June . 
 The Twenty20 Cup gave White another chance to display his skills in the shortest format of the game . White was joined at Somerset by fellow Australian Justin Langer for the tournament , and the pair shone in Somerset 's opening match of the competition . Opening the innings , Langer made 90 runs off 46 balls , but was outscored and outpaced by White 's 116 * , scored at more than two runs a ball . The century was White 's first in Twenty20 cricket , and he capped off his performance by claiming Gloucestershire 's tenth wicket to wrap up a 117 run victory . Just under two weeks later , White surpassed this score , at the time the joint highest made in Twenty20 cricket , with 141 * against Worcestershire . His runs , made off 70 balls , set a new world record Twenty20 total that would stand for almost two years before being beaten by Brendon McCullum . He finished the competition with the leading batting average , and his 403 runs trailed only team @-@ mate Langer 's 464 and Leicestershire batsman Hylton Ackerman 's 409 . 
 In August , with Somerset slumping , White scored back @-@ to @-@ back fourth @-@ innings centuries in the County Championship , but neither could rescue his side from defeat . First , he made 111 against Essex , and then under a week later , he made the highest individual score in the fourth @-@ innings of a first @-@ class match by remaining 260 not out at the close of Somerset 's innings as Derbyshire beat them to record their first home win in four years . Despite Somerset finishing bottom of Division Two of the County Championship , White had his most successful season of cricket in his career to that point . Having made his highest score , and hit five centuries in first @-@ class cricket , his batting average was almost 60 , and his one @-@ day batting average exceeded 40 .

 A strong start to the 2006 – 07 Australian domestic season , exemplified by 150 * against Tasmania in the Pura Cup and 126 * against New South Wales in the Ford Ranger Cup ( previously ING Cup ) saw White recalled to the Australia one @-@ day squad . Chief of selectors , Andrew Hilditch described his inclusion in the squad , praising his " great form with the bat and [ he ] has had some terrific performances with the ball " . In an interview with Australian newspaper The Age , White professed his relief at returning to the international scene , stating that " I don 't really care if I get picked as a batting allrounder or a bowling allrounder , or just as a bat or bowler , as long as I get picked . " An international Twenty20 against England saw White rewarded with a man of the match award for his 40 * off 20 balls , and 1 / 11 with the ball in hand . In his next batting innings , White scored 45 runs including 3 sixes against New Zealand , leading team @-@ mate Andrew Symonds to praise his ability to strike the cricket ball , saying that " when you 've got that going on at the other end , it makes it a lot easier for me " . Despite his excellent form with the bat , White 's bowling was proving to be mostly ineffective . For this reason , as well as the improved form of Brad Hodge and the selection of Brad Hogg and Shane Watson for their ability with the ball , he was dropped for the finals of the Commonwealth Bank Series and left out of the World Cup squad . 
 Despite not being named in the World Cup squad , White played all three ODIs in the Chappell – Hadlee Trophy against New Zealand . This was because some of the senior players were rested ahead of the World Cup , or sustained injuries . Stand @-@ in captain Michael Hussey only called upon him to bowl three overs during the series , all in the second match , in which he was expensive , conceding almost 10 runs an over . He hit a quick 42 * in that match , scoring six boundaries including 3 sixes . He was less impressive with the bat in the other two matches , making 13 on both occasions .

 White returned to the Victoria side in time to captain his team in the Ford Ranger Cup final , which they lost to Queensland by 21 runs . Two Pura Cup matches brought a couple of wickets and 96 runs , and then a month 's break before his first match back in England , where he returned to Somerset for a second season . He was amongst the runs immediately , one of eight centurions as Somerset played Middlesex . Fellow Australian Langer , also returning to Somerset made 315 , and White added 114 as Somerset eventually reached 850 / 7 declared . White scored three more half @-@ centuries before the month was out , and in the first match of May , was one of four Australians to reach three figures as Somerset hosted <unk> . Against Gloucestershire , he again showed his ability to remain calm and keep scoring even as those around him fell , making 241 in a Somerset first @-@ innings in which James Hildreth was the only other player to pass 50 . White passed 1 @,@ 000 runs in the County Championship for the second time , and his batting average topped 70 as Somerset won promotion from Division Two , a turnaround from the previous season when they had finished bottom of the division , ' winning ' the competition 's wooden spoon . The season also saw a slight improvement in White 's bowling , his 20 first @-@ class wickets coming at an average of 32 @.@ 75 , his best in a domestic season . Despite his impressive season , due to English counties only being allowed one overseas player for the 2008 season , White did not see his contract with the county renewed , Somerset preferring to keep captain Justin Langer . Somerset 's Director of Cricket , Brian Rose paid tribute to White , saying " It was a difficult choice with the new ruling about only one overseas player because Cameron has also done tremendous things for us . " 
 It was on the back of this form that White once again toured Pakistan with the Australia A squad , but he finished the series with just two wickets , both coming in the first @-@ class matches , and a handful of runs . Two months into the Australian domestic season , White was forced to retire hurt after colliding with Queensland bowler Lee <unk> , and after the match it was revealed he 'd fractured his foot . He 'd been carrying the injury since the start of the season , and the collision led to a full break , putting White out for six weeks . White conceded that the injury would almost certainly rule out any chance he had of playing for the national team that summer . He returned in early January , playing the last three matches of the Twenty20 tournament , including the final which Victoria won by 32 runs , although White only managed to make one run off eight balls . For the second season in a row , White was named as captain of the Prime Minister 's XI , and claimed two Sri Lankan wickets in the 50 @-@ over contest . White led Victoria to both Pura Cup and Ford Ranger Cup finals in 2007 – 08 , but they lost both , to New South Wales and Tasmania respectively . 
 The auction for the inaugural season of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) saw the majority of the world 's cricketing talent up for sale in a very public forum . For the thirteen Australians on offer , this was in sharp contrast to the secrecy which surrounded the value of national contracts . White was finally sold for $ 500 @,@ 000 to the Royal Challengers Bangalore , $ 50 @,@ 000 more than Shane Warne fetched , and more again than Ricky Ponting , Matthew Hayden and Michael Hussey . The apparent discrepancy was in part due to the possibility that international involvement could rule Australia 's Test players out of much , if not all of the first two years of the tournament . Rahul Dravid , Bangalore 's ' icon ' player , described White as an exciting addition , saying " White is a very exciting Twenty20 player and his domestic record [ with two Twenty20 hundreds ] in Australia is phenomenal . " Despite his price , White had a largely disappointing time in his only IPL season . He finished the tournament with 114 runs , over 500 less than fellow Australian and the competition 's leading run @-@ scorer Shaun Marsh .

 White was recalled to the Australian ODI and Twenty20 squads for the 2008 tour of the West Indies . He scored 10 runs off 6 balls in a rain @-@ reduced 11 @-@ over Twenty20 contest , and in a 50 @-@ over tour match against University of West Indies Vice @-@ Chancellor 's XI , made 34 but remained wicket @-@ less in his eight overs with the ball . By this stage in his career , White was generally considered a middle @-@ order batsman who bowled a bit , but Australia captain Ponting saw his place in the team as that of the front @-@ line spinner . " White 's obviously been picked as the spinner on this tour . We just need to keep exposing him to different situations and putting him under a bit more pressure . Hopefully he plays a big role for us during the series . " Despite Ponting 's comments , he used White as the fourth @-@ change bowler in the first ODI , bringing the slow left @-@ arm spin of Michael Clarke on first . White conceded 32 runs in his six overs without a breakthrough , and did not bowl at all in the second match , as Clarke claimed the man of the match award for his half @-@ century and three wickets . Although White scored 40 * at quicker than a run a ball , the return of Andrew Symonds for the last three ODIs left White out of the team again . 
 It was the absence of Symonds , sent home from the 2008 – 09 series against Bangladesh for skipping a team meeting to go fishing , that gave White another opportunity in the ODI team . Although stand @-@ in captain Clarke mirrored the action of Ponting by bringing himself on before the Victoria captain , White claimed a career @-@ best three wickets for five runs off the 10 balls he bowled . After the match , White admitted he had to prove he could deal with the pressures of international cricket , but was upbeat , saying " it was nice to get a few wickets but it would have been nice to get a few overs under the belt as well . " He claimed two more wickets in the second match and , after not being required to bowl in the third , finished the series with an average under 10 . 
 He was selected as captain of the Australia A team to compete against New Zealand A and India A in a tri @-@ series hosted by India . The captaincy gave White an opportunity to give himself plenty of overs , in total he bowled over 30 overs , claiming eight wickets in the competition , second only to Piyush Chawla . He displayed his all @-@ round ability by finishing with the fifth highest batting average and leading his team to the final , in which they beat India A by 156 runs . 
 When Symonds was dropped from the tour of India due to disciplinary issues , Greg Shipperd , White 's coach at Victoria , claimed that White should have been called up rather than Watson , claiming that the leg @-@ spinner " looked ideal to fill the aggressive role vacated by Symonds – he is a great counter @-@ puncher " . When fellow Victorian leg @-@ spinner Bryce <unk> left the tour injured , White got the call @-@ up to the Test squad that Shipperd felt he deserved , although he was nominally selected as a specialist bowler . After Jason Krejza , the other spinner on the tour , conceded 199 runs for no wickets in a match against the Board President 's XI , White was considered the safer option , although Ponting publicly endorsed Krejza after his wicket @-@ less match . Despite Ponting 's apparent leanings , White was preferred , and became the 402nd Australian to receive his Test cap . He was selected to bat at number eight , usually a specialist bowler 's position , despite generally playing first @-@ class cricket as a batsman . 
 At the end of the first Test , in which White took the solitary wicket of Sachin Tendulkar , Ponting said " He 's come along in leaps and bounds in his bowling . He 's probably exceeded my expectations with what he 's done , although he did not take the wickets . " White improved his return in the second Test , claiming three wickets , but only took one more in the last two matches . Although Ponting extolled White in public , he once again often opted to use the part @-@ time spin of Clarke before and more frequently than White throughout the series . White 's five wickets on the tour came at a bowling average of almost 70 , and with Symonds named in Test squad to face New Zealand , there was no place in the squad for White . 
 = = = One @-@ day specialist = = = 
 Although not included in the Test squads to face either New Zealand or South Africa , White was named in the ODI and Twenty20 squads to face South Africa at home , and professed " it was a good feeling to know you are still in the mix " . White played in a more familiar role in the <unk> , batting in the middle @-@ order , and after a disappointing 7 in the first match , made 40 * off 18 in the second to push Australia 's total up beyond South Africa 's reach . He had a steady ODI series , in which he was again used as a middle @-@ order batsman , and part @-@ time spinner . He retained his place for the one @-@ day series against New Zealand , but had limited involvement , making 27 runs from his two innings , though he did claim two wickets in his seven overs bowling . 
 His lack of involvement with the Test squad allowed him to return to Victoria to lead them in a losing cause in the Ford Ranger Cup final , a narrow 12 run loss to Queensland . Draws against Tasmania and Queensland , set up another Queensland – Victoria final , this time in the Sheffield Shield ( formerly the Pura Cup ) . White was named as man of the match as he led his team to their first championship since 2003 – 04 , scoring 135 and 61 as Queensland were out @-@ played comprehensively . 
 White remained in Australia 's Twenty20 team for their two matches in South Africa , but was not involved in their ODI matches , and subsequently was not named as part of their squad for the ICC World Twenty20 . However , after Symonds was sent home from the tournament due to ' an alcohol @-@ related incident ' , White was called up as his replacement . Australia were knocked out in the group @-@ stage of the competition with White unused in their two matches , Cricinfo 's Brydon Coverdale lambasting Australia 's belief that " the players who carry them in Test and 50 @-@ over cricket can do the same in three @-@ hour games " . White returned to Australia to captain the A team against Pakistan and showed consistency with the bat , culminating in 73 * in the Twenty20 match . 
 = = = Knowing his role = = = 
 Named in both one @-@ day squads for the tour of England , and in the Champions Trophy squad , White 's role in the team was now that of a batsman . In the rain @-@ abandoned Twenty20 in England , he made his best Twenty20 International score of 55 , and was the only player to cope with the poor conditions on a two @-@ paced pitch . In the ODI series , White saw himself promoted to number three in the absence of Ponting , and responded with scores of 53 and 42 in the first two matches , before making his maiden international century in the third . His 124 @-@ ball 105 saw him named man of the match in his last match before Ponting 's return which would see him drop back down the batting order . He played the remaining four matches of the series at number six , but finished the tour as Australia 's leading run @-@ scorer in ODIs . 
 White was ever @-@ present in Australia 's triumph in the 2009 Champions Trophy , saving his best performance for the final where , having been promoted to number four , he scored a patient 62 against New Zealand to help Australia recover from 6 / 2 to ease to a six wicket victory . The following ODI series against India saw White remain at number four due to injuries to Michael Clarke and Brad Haddin , and he made three half @-@ centuries including a remarkable 57 off 33 balls including 5 sixes . After being in and out of the Australian set @-@ up earlier in his career , White claimed " I think my best position is up around where I have been batting " , a statement backed up by an average of 41 @.@ 71 in his 18 appearances since his call @-@ up to face England earlier that year . The higher responsibility placed on White as a batsman was balanced by a much lower responsibility with the ball ; across the whole of the 2009 season , he only bowled three balls in One Day International cricket . 
 Upon the retirement of Ricky Ponting from international Twenty20 cricket , there were some calls for White to be promoted to captain the side , led by his Victoria coach Greg Shipperd . Despite these calls , White backed the favourite , incumbent vice @-@ captain Michael Clarke for the role . White was eventually named as Clarke 's vice @-@ captain , although worries about Clarke 's injury @-@ prone back and his struggles with form in Twenty20 resulted in continued calls for White to take over , though White again backed Clarke , claiming " Michael 's going to do a great job and I 'll just look forward to working with him . I 'm still really young in the [ Australia ] job as well and very inexperienced at this level , so I think I can learn a lot off him . " 
 The return of Clarke to the ODI team for the Pakistan series also saw White move down the order again , although batting at number five , he made his second international century in the first match , scoring 105 from 88 balls to help drive Australia to victory . White continued to perform well with the bat in the series , making a half @-@ century in the second match and making decent totals in a number of the other games as Australia swept the series 5 – 0 .

 Straight Outta Lynwood is the twelfth studio album by " Weird Al " Yankovic , released on September 26 , 2006 . It was the sixth studio album self @-@ produced by Yankovic . The musical styles on the album are built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid @-@ 2000s . The album 's lead single , " White & Nerdy " , is a parody of Chamillionaire 's hit single " Ridin ' " . The single peaked at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 ; " Canadian Idiot " also charted , peaking at number 82 . 
 The album featured five parodies . Aside from the aforementioned " White & Nerdy " and " Canadian Idiot " , the album also contains lampoons of " Confessions Part II " by Usher , " Do I Make You Proud " by Taylor Hicks , and " Trapped in the Closet " by R. Kelly . The other half of the album is original material , featuring many " style parodies " , or musical imitations of existing artists . These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Brian Wilson , Rage Against the Machine , Sparks , animated musical specials , Cake , and 1980s charity songs . Originally , there were plans for the album 's lead single to have been a spoof of James Blunt 's hit " You 're Beautiful " entitled " You 're Pitiful " , but Blunt 's record label , Atlantic , blocked the commercial release of the parody . 
 The CD release was a DualDisc ; one side of the disc played the album , and the other side functioned as a DVD , featuring animated music videos for many of the songs on the record . Straight Outta Lynwood was met with mostly positive reviews , with many critics praising " White & Nerdy " and " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " . Some of the original songs , however , were met with a more mixed reception . The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200 . " White & Nerdy " became Yankovic 's highest @-@ charting single , as well as his first Platinum @-@ certified single . The record itself was certified Gold for shipments of over 500 @,@ 000 copies .

 = = = Originals = = = 
 On July 5 , 2005 , recording for Straight Outta Lynwood officially began at Santa Monica Sound Records , in Santa Monica , California . By late 2005 , six originals — " Pancreas " , " Close but No Cigar " , " Virus Alert " , " Don 't Download This Song " , " I 'll Sue Ya " , and " Weasel Stomping Day " — had been recorded . " Weasel Stomping Day " describes , in the style of animated musical specials of the 1960s , a supposedly traditional holiday in which participants don Viking helmets , spread mayonnaise on their lawns , and " snap [ the titular animals ' ] <unk> spines in half . " " I 'll Sue Ya " is a Rage Against the Machine style parody , taking aim at the abundance of frivolous lawsuits in the United States . Yankovic chose to juxtapose the style of Rage Against the Machine with lyrics about lawsuits because he felt that humor could be derived by pairing the <unk> of the band 's music with a topic so vacuous . " Don 't Download This Song " , a style parody of 1980s charity songs , such as " We are the World " , " Hands Across America " , and " Do They Know It ’ s Christmas ? " , " describes the perils of online music file @-@ sharing " . According to Yankovic himself , the song takes a moderate approach to the peer @-@ to @-@ peer music download situation , arguing that both sides — people trying to illegally download music and the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) — can act hypocritically depending on the situation . 
 " Virus Alert " is a style parody of Sparks , specifically their work in the mid @-@ 1970s , such as their album Kimono My House ( 1974 ) . It details " the evil that lurks in your email inbox . " " Close but No Cigar " is a style parody of Cake . It tells the story of a man that breaks up with his seemingly perfect girlfriends due to the most inconsequential of flaws . The song was inspired by an actual friend of Yankovic 's who was never satisfied with any of his dates ; Yankovic later explained that " the song was inspired by [ the ] attitude , that nothing could ever be good enough . " The final original recorded , " Pancreas " , is a song mainly about the biological functions of the aforementioned organ . The song is an imitation of the musical stylings of Brian Wilson , specifically his work found on the 1966 album Pet Sounds , released by the Beach Boys , and their aborted follow @-@ up album , Smile . Yankovic joked that the reason the song was written was because " my pancreas has given so much to me over the years , I felt like I needed to give something back to it " . 
 = = = Parodies and polka = = = 
 On February 19 , 2006 , Yankovic began working on the album 's parodies . During these sessions , three parodies were recorded ; the first of these , " Canadian Idiot " , is a play on " American Idiot " by Green Day . It is a satirical commentary on American nationalism and the stereotypical American view of Canadians . The song is ironic , and Yankovic has stated that the song 's anger is a joke and that he loves Canada . Next , Yankovic began working on " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " , a parody of R. Kelly 's " Trapped in the Closet " . Yankovic was inspired to pen the spoof after hearing the " brilliant and wonderful and ridiculous " original . Efforts to make the parody more convoluted than the original were first considered but then abandoned by Yankovic ; he eventually reasoned , however , that he could make his version " a little more stupid " . Thus , the song is an excruciatingly detailed narrative about a couple getting hamburgers at the drive @-@ thru , which was " the most banal thing [ Yankovic ] could think of at the time . " Because the song was three times the length of a normal song , legally , Yankovic would have been required to pay thrice the statutory rate for royalties . This in turn would have forced Yankovic to remove one of his parodies from the album . However , R. Kelly allowed Yankovic to only pay the royalty rate for one song . To round out the first session , Yankovic recorded " Confessions Part III " , a play on " Confessions Part II " by Usher . The song purports to be a continuation of the Usher songs " Confessions " and " Confessions Part II " , focusing on trivial , silly , strange , and disturbing confessions ; Yankovic explained that , " After hearing Usher do [ the original songs ] , I couldn ’ t help but think that maybe he ’ d left a few things out , that there were a few confessions he had yet to make . " 
 After being denied permission to release " You 're Pitiful " , Yankovic penned " Do I Creep You Out " and " White & Nerdy " to take the parody 's place , recording both on July 22 , 2006 . The first of these is a play on " Do I Make You Proud " by Taylor Hicks , in which a singer addresses the object of his affection and stalking ; the song was also Yankovic 's jab at American Idol , a musical competition show that Hicks had won in May 2006 . The final parody written and recorded for the album was " White & Nerdy " , a parody of " Ridin ' " by Chamillionaire featuring Krayzie Bone . The song describes the life of a white nerd whose wish to " roll with the <unk> " is impeded by his stereotypically white and nerdy behavior ; the song is also filled with references to nerd culture . Yankovic later joked that it was a song he " was born to write " due to association with nerd humor . While Yankovic usually records his songs together with his band , the backing tracks for " White and Nerdy " were completely recorded by guitarist Jim West — who handled the synthesizer production — and Jon " Bermuda " Schwartz — who was tasked with recording the drums . The two musicians recorded their specific tracks at their home studios , and the finished audio tracks were then brought to Westlake Studio in Los Angeles , California , where Yankovic added his vocals . Chamillionaire himself put " White & Nerdy " on his official MySpace page and said that he enjoys the parody . In an interview , he also stated he was pleasantly surprised by Yankovic 's rapping ability , saying : " He 's actually rapping pretty good on it , it 's crazy ... I didn 't know he could rap like that . " 
 " Polkarama ! " , a medley of popular hit songs set to a polka beat , was recorded during the second parody session . Yankovic explained that , " if there ’ s a song that I think is really ripe for parody but I just can ’ t think of a clever enough idea , sometimes it ’ ll end up in the polka medley . " Regarding their popularity , Yankovic has said , " At this point , it 's sort of mandatory for me to do a polka medley . Fans would be rioting in the streets , I think , if I didn 't do a polka medley . " 
 = = = " You 're Pitiful " controversy = = = 
 Yankovic had originally wanted to record a parody of James Blunt 's hit " You 're Beautiful " and release it as the lead single for the album . The parodist had approached Blunt about the spoof , and the singer approved his idea . Yankovic then went into the recording studio on April 12 , 2006 , and recorded his version , entitled " You 're Pitiful " . However , Blunt 's record company , Atlantic Records , told Yankovic that he could not include the song on his album . Yankovic eventually learned that Atlantic felt " it was ' too early ' in James ' career for a parody , and that they were afraid that focusing any more attention on ' Beautiful ' at that point might lead to the perception of James as a ' one @-@ hit wonder . ' " 
 At first , the label promised that they would let Yankovic release the parody at an unspecified later date . Yankovic , however , later learned that they had no such intentions . Since Blunt himself was fine with the parody , Yankovic decided to release " You 're Pitiful " as a free digital download on his website , noting that , " if James Blunt himself were objecting I wouldn 't even offer my parody for free on my Web site . But since it 's a bunch of suits — who are actually going against their own artist 's wishes — I have absolutely no problem with it . " 
 = = = Unused ideas = = = 
 Yankovic had wanted to record a parody of Daniel Powter 's " Bad Day " for the album entitled " You Had a Bad Date " , but Powter initially refused . Powter then changed his mind " literally the day before [ Yankovic ] went into the studio to record ' White & Nerdy ' " , at which point , according to Yankovic , " the train had left the station " . T @-@ Pain had also given Yankovic permission to record a parody of " I 'm N Luv ( Wit A Stripper ) " called " I 'm in Luv Wit Da Skipper " , referencing the character from the 1960s sitcom Gilligan 's Island . Yankovic later decided not to record the song , but T @-@ Pain was still thanked in the album 's liner notes . Despite this , Yankovic still performed the song in the parody medley during his Straight Outta Lynwood Tour . Besides his " Bad Day " and " I 'm N Luv ( Wit A Stripper ) " parodies , Yankovic also claimed to have several " mediocre " ideas such as " Holodeck Girl " ( a spoof of " Hollaback Girl " by Gwen Stefani ) , " IRS " ( a play on " S.O.S. " by Rihanna ) , and " <unk> " ( a parody of " SexyBack " by Justin Timberlake ) . In addition , Nickelback had originally given Yankovic permission to use their song " Photograph " in " Polkarama " ; however , Yankovic was unable " to find a way to incorporate the song into [ Polkarama ] where it didn 't sound wedged in or tacked on " , and he decided not to use it , although Nickelback was also thanked in the liner notes for Straight Outta Lynwood .

 The title is a takeoff on Straight Outta Compton , an album by N.W.A. Lynwood , California , Yankovic 's home town , is a neighboring community to Compton , California . The cover art , inspired by " gangsta imagery " , depicts Yankovic , wearing a Lynwood , California , letterman 's jacket and holding a pit bull on a leash , in front of a Chevrolet . All of the images from the album were taken on April 22 , 2006 , by Michael Blackwell , an Atlanta , Georgia , photographer who has also taken images of notable hip hop stars as T.I. , Lil ' Scrappy , and Young Jeezy . The pit bull on the cover is named Dough Boy , and is owned by a local couple that was walking by during the photo shoot . Yankovic had always planned for this album to be titled Straight Outta Lynwood , even when the lead single was going to be " You 're Pitiful " ; Yankovic had liked the ironic juxtaposition of having a gangsta rap @-@ inspired album cover and title , with " such a toothless ballad for the lead parody " . However , the cover ended up being unintentionally appropriate when " White & Nerdy " became the lead track on the album . The numbers and letters on the album cover have several meanings : " <unk> " are the initials of both Yankovic 's daughter and his father . The number " 27 " is an in @-@ joke with Yankovic 's fans , but February 7 was also his mother 's birthday . The license plate originally read " 27 <unk> " during the photo shoot . The photograph that was originally going to be the cover was later used for the back of the CD case .

 While Yankovic 's previous albums generated only one or two official music videos , Straight Outta Lynwood spawned nine , and the DualDisc release of the album included videos for all six original songs . Yankovic 's record label had suggested he release a DualDisc , and he was in favor of the idea once he realized that he could hire animators to create videos for the original songs , in order to make the release more rewarding for fans who purchased it . At first , Yankovic was unsure who he would be able to hire , because of the budget , but to his surprise , many artists signed on . Bill Plympton animated a video for " Don 't Download This Song " , which preceded the release of the album , and Thomas Lee , best known for his Flash music video " Star Wars Gangsta Rap " , animated a video for " I 'll Sue Ya " . A music video for " Virus Alert " was helmed by David Lovelace , creator of Retarded Animal Babies ; Yankovic admitted to exercising more creative control over this video than the others present on the DVD , citing concern with Lovelace 's previous content . John Kricfalusi and Katie Rice animated a video for " Close but No Cigar " . Yankovic had long been a fan of Kricfalusi , who is perhaps best known as the creator of the cartoon series Ren & Stimpy . The video " takes an irreverent look at the world of dating as seen thru [ sic ] the eyes of Cigarettes the cat . " Jim Blashfield created a video for " Pancreas " using stock footage from the Prelinger Archives . Finally , <unk> Films released a stop @-@ motion video for " Weasel Stomping Day " that aired on September 24 , 2006 as part of " The Munnery " , the show 's 32nd episode of the Adult Swim TV show Robot Chicken . 
 Subsequent videos were also made for three of the album 's parodies . On August 15 , 2006 , Yankovic announced that he planned to shoot a music video for " White & Nerdy " in the Los Angeles area on August 21 , 24 , 25 , and 27 . He posted a solicitation for volunteers to appear in the video on his MySpace blog . The video was filmed in high definition . Originally , it was going to be released on September 18 at 9 PM Pacific Time on <unk> , but , since the video had been leaked , AOL cancelled the premiere event and uploaded the video early . Soon thereafter , VH1 began airing the video in " large rotation " , meaning it was shown roughly 20 times a day . Near the end of 2006 , animators at <unk> made a video for " Do I Creep You Out " , and Doug Bresler released a video for " Trapped in the Drive Thru " in 2007 . In regards to the latter , Bresler 's original cut of the video featured the male in the song looking like Yankovic . Yankovic later asked that Bresler give the character a more neutral look , noting that if a live action video had been made , he " would almost certainly be playing a character [ in the video , and ] not ' Weird Al ' " . Bresler complied , and gave the character a more generic hairstyle . MuchMusic , a 24 @-@ hour Canadian cable music and variety television channel , ran a fan @-@ made " Canadian Idiot " video contest on their website , but it was later scrapped due to lack of entries .

 Chris Carle of IGN awarded the album an 8 out of 10 , denoting a " great " release . He called it " another solid record to add to the collection ; just the right nostalgic blend of parodies , gross @-@ out songs and polka . " Specifically , he selected " White & Nerdy " , " Polkarama ! " , and " Weasel Stomping Day " as the album 's stand @-@ out tracks , but felt that original songs like " Pancreas " and " I 'll Sue Ya " were either not funny or " late to the party " . David Jeffries of AllMusic awarded the record three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of five and called it " inspired " . He highlighted " White & Nerdy " as a choice single , calling it a " reason to celebrate [ Yankovic 's ] return " . Jeffries applauded " Canadian Idiot " and " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " , calling both funny , and he also noted that the originals from the album were humorous as well . However , he felt that the Usher and Taylor Hicks parodies were " only mildly humorous " and that some of the original songs " really drag " when compared to the others . Gavin Edwards of Rolling Stone awarded the album three out of five stars and highlighted " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " as the album 's best song , writing , " ' Weird Al ' is funniest when he 's singing about food . " 
 Al Shipley of Stylus gave the album a " B – " and felt that , while " White & Nerdy " was a solid parody , the other spoofs on the album were not quite up to par . He praised " Pancreas " and " Virus Alert " as the album 's best style parodies , comparing the latter to the 1985 single " Dare to Be Stupid " , while criticizing " I 'll Sue Ya " , " Close but No Cigar " , and " Don 't Download This Song " . Shipley concluded that the most hilarious moment on the album was Yankovic singing the lyrics to " Candy Shop " by 50 Cent over a polka beat in " Polkarama ! " Scott Shetler of Slant Magazine awarded the album three stars out of five . He felt that in the 2000s , Yankovic 's work had gradually declined in quality , but that Straight Outta Lynwood displayed " occasional flashes of genius " , such as " White & Nerdy " , which he praised for Yankovic 's rapping ability . Shetler also felt that " Trapped in the Drive @-@ Thru " , was impressive , although he noted it was not as spectacular as it could have been . Once again , " Confessions , Pt . III " and " Do I Creep You Out " were described as " throwaways " . However , Shetler wrote that " for once , Yankovic 's originals are better than his parodies " , highlighting " Pancreas " , " I 'll Sue Ya " , and " Don 't Download This Song " as the best songs on the album .

 = Mac Scelling = 
 Mac Scelling ( fl . 1154 – 1173 / 1174 ) , also known as Mac <unk> , was a prominent twelfth @-@ century military commander engaged in conflicts throughout Ireland . He is first recorded in 1154 commanding the maritime forces of Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn , King of Cenél nEógain in a bloody encounter against Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair , King of Connacht . Muirchertach 's naval forces were drawn from the western peripheries of Scotland and the Isles . He next appears on record in 1173 / 1174 , supporting the cause of Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair , King of Connacht against the English colonisation of Mide . An early modern Scottish source claims that a man of the same name was a bastard son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte , King of the Isles . If Mac Scelling was indeed related to Somairle , this relationship could cast light on the latter 's conflict with Guðrøðr Óláfsson , King of the Isles , a man who appears to have opposed Muirchertach at some point in his career . Although not termed so in contemporary sources , Mac Scelling may be regarded as an early archetype of later gallowglasses , heavily @-@ armed Scottish mercenaries recruited by Irish rulers in centuries that followed . 
 = = In the service of the Meic Lochlainn = = 
 Midway through the twelfth @-@ century , Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn , King of Cenél nEógain ( died 1166 ) pressed forth to claim to the high @-@ kingship of Ireland , an office then held by elderly Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair , King of Connacht ( died 1156 ) . In 1150 , Muirchertach invaded Connacht , and succeeded in gaining hostages from the kingdom . Although Muirchertach and Toirrdelbach made peace the following year , their forces clashed the year after that , with Muirchertach 's defeat of Toirrdelbach 's son , Ruaidrí ( died 1198 ) . In 1154 , the forces of Toirrdelbach and Muirchertach again met in a major conflict fought off the Inishowen coast , in what was perhaps one of the greatest naval battles of the twelfth century . The engagement is briefly recorded by the Annals of Tigernach , and expanded upon by the Annals of the Four Masters . According to the latter source , Muirchertach 's maritime forces were mercenaries drawn from Galloway , Arran , Kintyre , Mann , and " the territories of Scotland " . The annal @-@ entry further reveals that Mac Scelling himself commanded Muirchertach 's forces , and that his teeth were knocked out in the affair . Although Toirrdelbach 's forces obtained a narrow victory , his northern maritime power seems to have been virtually nullified by the severity of the contest , and Muirchertach soon after marched on Connacht , <unk> , and Dublin . As a result of the Dubliners ' resulting submission , Muirchertach effectively secured himself the high @-@ kingship . There is reason to suspect that Muirchertach 's use of foreign warriors — including Mac Scelling himself — strongly influenced the composition of Cath <unk> na <unk> for <unk> , a contemporary Gaelic text that forms a sequel to the epic Táin Bó <unk> . 
 = = An apparent Meic Somairle namesake = = 
 Mac Scelling 's identity and origins are unknown . His name is similar to that of " Gall mac <unk> " , a supposed bastard son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte , Lord of Argyll ( died 1164 ) , noted by the early modern Book of Clanranald . Somairle was a brother @-@ in @-@ law of Guðrøðr Óláfsson , King of the Isles ( died 1187 ) , a man who succeeded to the kingship of the Isles after the death of his father in 1153 . Within a few years , Somairle and Guðrøðr fought for control of the Kingdom of the Isles . Although Somairle succeeded in ousting Guðrøðr , he himself was dead within a decade , and Guðrøðr regained the throne . If Mac Scelling was indeed a member of the Meic Somairle — the descendants of Somairle — this relationship may cast light upon Somairle 's struggles in the Isles . For instance , Mac Scelling 's cooperation with Muirchertach could be evidence that Guðrøðr faced united opposition from Somairle and Muirchertach . In fact , there is evidence indicating that Guðrøðr and Muirchertach were indeed at odds at some point in the 1150s or 1160s , as the former appears to have briefly gained the kingship of Dublin at the expense of Muirchertach 's authority as overlord . Nevertheless , it is also possible that the battle took place before Somairle and Guðrøðr struggled for the kingship . Guðrøðr is otherwise known to have married a granddaughter of Muirchertach , and seems to have had an earlier marriage to another member of the Uí Néill . These matrimonial unions could be evidence of an alliance between Guðrøðr and Muirchertach in the 1150s . Mac Scelling 's participation in Muirchertach 's service , therefore , could have been undertaken during a period of cooperation between the Isles and the Uí Néill .

 In the last third of the twelfth century , Diarmait Mac Murchada , King of Leinster ( died 1171 ) was deposed and driven from Ireland by his rivals . He subsequently enlisted the aid of English mercenaries and launched an invasion of Ireland . In 1170 , the combined forces of Diarmait and Richard fitz Gilbert de Clare , Earl of Pembroke ( died 1176 ) conquered Dublin . The following year , the aforesaid Ruaidrí , who was then the reigning High King of Ireland and King of Connacht , along with Lorcán Ua Tuathail , Archbishop of Dublin ( died 1180 ) , appealed to Guðrøðr for military assistance from the Isles . Although Ruaidrí besieged the town by land , whilst Guðrøðr blockaded it by sea , Dublin remained firmly in English hands . Within the year , Henry II , King of England ( died 1189 ) arrived in Ireland and consolidated English control . One of the few provincial kings who refused to submit to Henry was Ruaidrí himself ; and in 1173 or 1174 , he assembled a massive host from northern Ireland in campaign to bring a halt to the English colonisation of Mide . According to the Song of Dermot and the Earl , one of the numerous rulers who rallied to Ruaidrí 's cause was Mac Scelling himself . This source further states that Ruaidrí enlisted support not only support from Leath <unk> — a reference to northern Ireland — but also from " les Norreys " and " les Norreis " — two terms that may refer to Norsemen . The Song of Dermot and the Earl , therefore , appears to indicate that Ruaidrí indeed received support from the Hebrides . 
 = = <unk> <unk> = = 
 The little that is known of Mac Scelling suggests that he was an early archetype of what latter became known as gallowglasses , heavily @-@ armed mercenaries , recruited from the West Highlands and Islands of Scotland by Irish rulers in later centuries . Although first specifically recorded in the last decade of the thirteenth century , gallowglasses were almost certainly utilised at least a generation before . The aforesaid apparent reference to Mac Scelling by the Song of Dermot and the Earl could be evidence that he had taken up residence in Ireland like later gallowglasses . 
 = 1943 Mazatlán hurricane = 
 The 1943 Mazatlán hurricane was a powerful tropical cyclone ( at least Category 4 ) that lashed the southern coast of Sinaloa on the morning of 9 October 1943 . The hurricane went essentially undetected before it made landfall just south of Mazatlán on 9 October with a pressure below 958 @.@ 6 millibars ( 28 @.@ 31 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of at least 136 miles per hour ( 219 km / h ) . The hurricane destroyed two small towns and half of Mazatlán , killing at least 106 persons , injuring 102 , and leaving over 1 @,@ 000 homeless . Total damage was estimated at $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( 1943 USD , $ 56 million 2008 USD ) . The hurricane was the strongest on record to strike Mazatlán .

 Sources do not reveal the exact origin of this tropical cyclone . On 8 October , a developing tropical cyclone passed between the Revillagigedo Islands and Islas Marías . It moved rapidly northeastward and arrived on the coast of Sinaloa as an intense hurricane . 
 Mazatlán Observatory reported that the atmospheric pressure began dropping at 1 : 30 am on 9 October and fell 0 @.@ 827 inches of mercury ( 28 @.@ 0 hPa ) in 8 hours , and reached a minimum of 958 @.@ 6 millibars ( 28 @.@ 31 inHg ) . At 1530 UTC 9 October , the hurricane made landfall just south of Mazatlán . At 9 : 30 am , the observatory reported winds of 134 miles per hour ( 216 km / h ) for a period of 15 minutes , which period ended when the wind blew the anemometer loose . The hurricane ranks as the strongest on record to strike the city . 
 The storm dropped little precipitation as it passed Mazatlán , but 2 inches ( 51 mm ) fell on the afternoon of 9 October . 
 As the storm continued inland , it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over the Sierra Madre Occidental . The storm apparently passed into Chihuahua and was predicted to continue into the southern United States , though the remainder of its path is unknown . 
 The cyclone was dissipated over the state of Durango within a day after landfall . Heavy rain developed across parts of Texas on 12 / 13 October 1943 . 
 = = Effects and aftermath = = 
 Moving ashore as a powerful hurricane , the storm destroyed the small towns of El <unk> , now in Mazatlán Municipality , and <unk> . The storm partially destroyed Villa Unión ( a town now in Mazatlán Municipality ) and severely damaged the port at Mazatlán . In these towns , approximately 100 persons lost their lives . Though the storm was reported to have struck " without warning " , most residents in the destroyed cities ably reached safety in higher ground . The hurricane destroyed about half of the buildings in Mazatlán , and near the ocean , the combination of strong waves , high winds , and rainfall heavily damaged many hotels and houses . The storm damaged water systems , leaving people without potable water or sewage systems . In a 50 miles ( 80 km ) portion of the coastline , the storm severely impacted the communication and transportation infrastructure . The airport at Mazatlán sustained damage to its radio tower , and for at least 18 hours , the only communication between the city and the rest of Mexico was through the radio of a plane in the airport . Total damage was estimated at $ 4 @.@ 5 million ( 1943 USD , $ 56 million 2008 USD ) . 
 Of several fishing boats and a small Mexican Navy vessel caught in the storm , no trace reportedly was found ; all persons aboard these vessels apparently died . A small coastal boat arrived in the port of Mazatlán after the storm and reported six crew members missing . 
 Within two days after the storm , the death toll rose to 18 ; the next day , the Associated Press reported 52 deaths and 102 injuries . Ten days after the storm , military officials reported the death toll rose to 57 , and the number of people left homeless by the storm reached over 1 @,@ 000 . 
 By 24 hours after the storm , President Manuel Ávila Camacho ordered nurses and doctors on standby , and for military workers in the area to prepare to assist in the aftermath . By five days after the storm , officials had restored power and communications in the area . Around the same time , the president issued an appeal for public donations for storm victims . Within a week , citizens sent large quantities of food , clothing , and medicine to the worst affected areas . The President of Mexico personally visited Mazatlán with other officials , bringing aid in the form of medicine and clothing .

 = British rhythm and blues = 
 British rhythm and blues ( or R & B ) was a musical movement that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s , and reached a peak in the mid @-@ 1960s . It overlapped with , but was distinct from , the broader British beat and more purist British blues scenes , attempting to emulate the music of African American blues and rock and roll pioneers , such as Muddy Waters and Howlin ' Wolf , Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley . It often placed greater emphasis on guitars and was often played with greater energy . 
 The origins of the movement were in the British jazz , skiffle and folk movements of the 1950s . The 1958 visit of Muddy Waters influenced key figures Cyril Davies and Alexis Korner to turn to electric blues and form the band Blues Incorporated , which became something of a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians . A flourishing scene of clubs and groups emerged in the later 1950s and 1960s and bands began to break through into mainstream success . Major acts included the Rolling Stones , Manfred Mann , The Animals , The Yardbirds , Them , and the Spencer Davis Group , who dominated the UK and US charts from 1964 , in the wake of the Merseybeat craze , becoming central to the mod subculture in the UK and a second wave of British Invasion acts in the US . 
 Several of the bands and their members went on to become leading rock music performers of the late 1960s and early 1970s , helping to create psychedelic , progressive and hard rock and making rhythm and blues a key component of that music . In the mid to late @-@ 1970s , British R & B enjoyed a revival through the British soul and disco scenes , the pub rock circuit , new wave music and the mod revival , and has enjoyed a resurgence of interest since the late 1980s . In the 2000s , a British version of contemporary R & B began gaining popularity , and since the late 2000s the success of British female singers influenced by soul and R & B led to talk of another " R & B British invasion " . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Commentators often distinguish British rhythm and blues bands from beat bands ( who were influenced by rock and roll and rockabilly ) on the one hand , and , from " purist " British blues ( which particularly emulated Chicago electric blues artists ) , on the other , although there was considerable crossover between the three sets of musicians . Merseybeat bands like the Beatles , or from the parallel beat scene in Manchester , were influenced by American forms of music that included rockabilly , girl groups and the early Motown sound , helping them to produce commercial orientated form of music that began to dominate the British charts from 1963 . However , bands from the developing London club scene were mainly concerned to emulate black rhythm and blues performers , including the work of Chess Records ' blues artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin ' Wolf , but also wider rhythm and blues singer and rock and roll pioneers like Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley resulting in a " rawer " or " grittier " sound . 
 British rhythm and blues differed in tone from that of African American artists , often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy . British rhythm and blues singers were criticised for their emulation of rhythm and blues vocal styles , with shouts , glottal stops , moans and cries . However , vocalists such as Van Morrison , Mick Jagger , Eric Burdon and Steve Winwood did not attempt to emulate a particular singer and were seen by critics as able to sing the blues convincingly and with some power . In cover versions of R & B songs , riffs were often simplified or used less frequently . The object of the music was usually to whip up energy , rather than to produce musical finesse . Many groups were based around guitars ( rhythm , lead and bass ) and drums and as a result arrangements tended to be guitar @-@ oriented and at higher tempos than the originals . Amplification of guitars to the highest levels of underpowered amplifiers created the over @-@ driven guitar sound that would become characteristic of rock music . 
 Nick Logan and Bob Woffinden noted that after the split of Blues Incorporated at the end of 1962 , four main strands could be discerned in British Rhythm and Blues . Cyril Davies left to attempt to recreate the Chicago electric blues of Muddy Waters . The style would be the major influence on the later emergence of the blues boom , particularly through the work of John Mayall 's Bluesbreakers . Alexis Korner continued with Blues Incorporated , bringing in jazz saxophonist Graham Bond and developing a more jazz orientated sound . This strand would be taken up by acts including the Graham Bond Organisation , Manfred Mann and Zoot Money . A unique form was pursued by Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames , who as the resident band at the Flamingo club on Wardour Street , unusual in having a predominantly black audience of American GIs and locals , also utilised jazz , but mixed R & B with elements of Caribbean music , including Ska and <unk> . The Rolling Stones and others focused on rocking guitar music based on the work of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and would be followed by many small guitar and drum based groups , many of which would rapidly move into rock music .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 In the early 1950s blues music was largely known in Britain through blues @-@ influenced boogie @-@ woogie , and the jump blues of Fats Waller and Louis Jordan . Imported recordings of American artists were brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain during and after World War II , merchant seamen visiting the ports of London , Liverpool , Newcastle on Tyne and Belfast , and in a trickle of ( illegal ) imports . From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI ( the latter , particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records ) , began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to the emerging market . 
 Outside of recordings , occasional radio broadcasts were one of the few ways that British people could become familiar with the blues . A one @-@ off broadcast by Josh White while he was visiting Britain in 1951 was so popular that he was asked to perform for a series of programmes for the BBC , eventually titled The Glory Road and broadcast in 1952 . Later that year , folk song collector Alan Lomax , then resident in London , produced a series of three programmes under the title The Art of the Negro , of last of which , " Blues in the Mississippi Night " featured folk blues recordings by artists including Muddy Waters , Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker and was the first introduction of many later followers of the blues to the music and hardships of life for African Americans in the Southern US . The next year the Jazz Club programme , hosted by Max Jones , included a recital of " Town and Country Blues " , which played music by a wide range of blues artists . 
 = = = Jazz = = = 
 The British rhythm and blues scene developed in London out of the related jazz , skiffle and folk club scenes of the 1950s . The first of these scenes , that of jazz , had developed during the Second World War as a reaction to swing , consciously re @-@ introducing older elements of American jazz , particularly that of New Orleans to produce trad jazz . This music incorporated elements of the blues and occasional blues @-@ influenced singles reached the British Charts , including Humphrey Lyttelton 's self @-@ penned " Bad Penny Blues " ( 1956 ) , the first jazz record to reach the British top 20 . 
 British trad jazz band @-@ leader Chris Barber was one of the major figures in the development and popularisation of rhythm and blues in Britain the 1950s . His interest in the blues would help foster both the skiffle craze and the development of electric rhythm and blues , as members of his dance band would be fundamental to both movements . He founded the National Jazz League partly as a means of popularising the blues , served as co @-@ director of the National Jazz Federation and helped establish the Marquee Club , which would become one of the major venues for British R & B bands . He also brought over American folk and blues performers who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America , a series of tours that began with Josh White and Big Bill Broonzy in 1951 , and would include Brownie McGhee , Sonny Terry , Memphis Slim , Muddy Waters and Lonnie Johnson . 
 = = = Skiffle = = = 
 Lonnie Johnson played at the Royal Festival Hall in 1952 on a bill opened by a group led by the young Tony Donegan , who later took Johnson 's forename as his own . Donegan became the key figure in the development of the British skiffle " craze " , beginning in Ken Colyer 's <unk> by playing American folk and blues songs , particularly those derived from the recordings of Huddie Leadbetter , during intervals to the accompaniment of guitar , washboard and tea @-@ chest bass in a lively style that emulated American jug bands . After Colyer left in 1954 to form a new outfit , the band became Chris Barber 's Jazz Band , and members of the band played " race blues " songs in concert intervals and recorded as The Lonnie Donegan Skiffle Group . They released their high @-@ tempo version of Leadbelly 's " Rock Island Line " in 1956 and it became a major hit , spending eight months in the Top 20 , peaking at number six ( and number eight in the U.S. ) . It was the first début record to go gold in Britain , selling over a million copies worldwide . This stimulated the explosion of the British " skiffle craze " and it has been estimated that in the late 1950s there were 30 – 50 @,@ 000 skiffle groups in Britain . Sales of guitars grew rapidly and groups performed on banjos , improvised bass and percussion in church halls , cafes and the flourishing coffee bars of Soho , London . In addition to members of the Beatles , a large number of British rhythm and blues musicians began their careers playing skiffle , including Van Morrison , Ronnie Wood , Mick Jagger and Roger Daltrey . The fashion created a demand for opportunities to play versions of American folk , blues and jazz music that would contribute to the growth of a club scene . 
 = = = Folk = = = 
 Until the mid @-@ 1950s in Britain the blues was seen as a form of folk music . When Broonzy toured England he played a folk blues set to fit British expectations of American blues , rather than his current electric Chicago blues . Skiffle clubs included the ‘ Ballad and Blues ’ club in a pub in Soho , co @-@ founded by Ewan MacColl . In its early stages these clubs saw the playing of British and American folk music that included folk blues . As the skiffle craze subsided from the mid @-@ 1950s many of these clubs , following the lead of MacColl , began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material , partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n ’ roll music , often banning American music from performances and became more exclusively English folk clubs . 
 The more traditional American folk blues continued to provide 1960s British groups with material , particularly after the emergence of Bob Dylan , who also popularised folk blues songs . In 1964 , for example , the song @-@ catalogue of Huddie Ledbetter ( " Leadbelly " ) provided The Animals with " The House of the Rising Sun " , Manfred Mann with " John Hardy " and The Four Pennies with " Black Girl " . British acoustic blues continued to develop as part of the folk scene . In the early 1960s , folk guitar pioneers Bert Jansch , John Renbourn and particularly Davy Graham , played blues , folk and jazz , developing a distinctive guitar style known as folk baroque . It continued with figures like Ian A. Anderson and his Country Blues Band , and Al Jones . Most British acoustic blues players could achieve little commercial success and found it difficult to gain recognition for their " imitations " of the blues in the US , being overshadowed by the rhythm and blues and electric blues that had emerged in the later 1950s .

 Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse public house in London ’ s Soho , which served as a focal point for British skiffle acts . Like guitarist Alexis Korner , he had worked for Chris Barber , playing in the R & B segment Barber introduced to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists . They began to play together as a duo and in 1957 , deciding their central interest was blues , they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and <unk> Club . It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances . The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R & B in general . Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters 's amplified electric blues , but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews . Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival , Davies and Korner , who had supported Waters on tour , now began to play high @-@ powered electric blues , forming the band Blues Incorporated . 
 Blues Incorporated had a fluid line up and became a clearing house for British rhythm and blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s . These included future members of the Rolling Stones , The Yardbirds , Manfred Mann and The Kinks ; beside Graham Bond and Long John Baldry . As well as acting as a mentor to these figures and others , including John Mayall and Jimmy Page , Korner was also a historian , writer and record collector pivotal in the growth of the movement , and often referred to as " the father of British blues " . Blues Incorporated established a regular " Rhythm and Blues Night " at the Ealing Jazz Club and were given a residency at the Marquee Club , from which in 1962 they took the name of the first British blues album , R & B from the Marquee ( Decca ) , but Korner and Davies had split over the issue of including horn sections in the Blues Incorporated sound before its release . Korner continued with various line @-@ ups for Blues Incorporated , while Davies went on to form his R & B All Stars .

 Early British rhythm and blues bands like Blues Incorporated found that folk clubs would not accept amplified blues performances . However , many London trad jazz clubs moved over to the style . In addition to the Roundhouse and the Marquee in central London , these included The Flamingo , the Crawdaddy Club , Richmond , where the Rolling Stones first began to gain attention , <unk> <unk> , The Ealing Club and the Eel Pie Island Hotel . Blues clubs were appearing in the capital at such a rate that in 1963 Melody Maker declared London " The New Chicago ! " . The scene soon began to spread out beyond London , particularly into East Anglia and the Midlands , with clubs in Norwich and Birmingham adopting the genre . Jazz bands also followed suit , with the Mike Cotton Jazz Band becoming the Mike Cotton Sound , Warwick 's Tony and the Talons becoming the Original Roadrunners and Burton on Trent 's <unk> becoming Rhythm and Blues Incorporated . 
 From 1962 demand for blues recordings in Britain and Europe led to new outlets for American recordings , Chicago recordings that were now available included Vee Jay Records through EMI 's Stateside label and Chess Records through Pye International 's R & B series . These records were enthusiastically sought and collected by a new generation of enthusiasts . The increasing appetite for rhythm and blues was reflected in the growing numbers of Afro @-@ American artists visiting the country . From 1962 the American Folk Blues Festival , organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau , brought American blues stars including Waters , Wolf , Sonny Boy Williamson , and John Lee Hooker to the country . In 1964 the American Folk Blues and Gospel Caravan arrived in the UK for an 11 @-@ date tour , including in its line @-@ up Sister Rosetta Tharpe , Blind Gary Davis , Sonny Terry , Muddy Waters and Otis Spann . The original dates sold out rapidly and six more had to be added . Later that year , the first of what was to become the annual National Jazz and Blues Festival was held at Reading in Berkshire . 
 = = = = Peak = = = = 
 1964 was the year of most rapid expansion and the peak of the British R & B boom . It has been estimated that there were 300 rhythm and blues bands in England at the beginning of the year and over 2 @,@ 000 by the end . In June 1964 John Lee Hooker 's 1956 " Dimples " reached number 23 on the UK charts during a stay of 10 weeks . The song was chosen by The Spencer Davis Group as their May 1964 debut single and The Animals covered it on their first album . Howling Wolf 's " Smokestack Lightning " , released in the UK by Pye International Records that year , peaked at number 42 in the singles chart and was covered by The Yardbirds , Manfred Mann , The Animals and The Who . On 5 December 1964 the Rolling Stones version of Willie Dixon 's " Little Red Rooster " , based on Howlin ' Wolf 's 1961 version and recorded at Chess Records in Chicago , topped the UK chart for one week . Willie Dixon @-@ penned songs would continue to be covered by British artists .

 The most commercially successful act in the genre , were the Rolling Stones . Keith Richards and Mick Jagger , who had renewed their childhood association after discovering a shared interest in R & B records , were introduced to guitarist Brian Jones through Alexis Korner , after a Blues Incorporated gig at the Ealing Jazz Club . Blues Incorporated contained two other future members of the Rolling Stones : Ian Stewart and Charlie Watts . Formed in London in 1962 , Jones took their name from a track on the cover of a Muddy Waters album and they abandoned blues purism before their line @-@ up solidified to focus on a wide range of rhythm and blues artists . They debuted at The Marquee and soon gained a residency at the Crawdaddy Club , building up a reputation as a live act . They signed a recording contract with Decca and their first single was a cover of Chuck Berry 's " Come On " released in June 1963 . Despite its being virtually <unk> by the band or the record company , their reputation among R & B fans helped it reached number 21 on the UK singles chart . 
 They produced their first eponymously titled album in 1964 , which largely consisted of rhythm and blues standards . Following in the wake of the Beatles ' national and then international success , the Rolling Stones soon established themselves as the second most popular UK band and joined the British Invasion of the American record charts as leaders of a second wave of R & B oriented bands . In addition to Chicago blues numbers , the Rolling Stones also covered songs by Chuck Berry and Bobby and Shirley Womack , the latter 's , " It 's All Over Now " , giving them their first UK number one in 1964 . After the success of their cover of " Little Red Rooster " in 1964 , the song @-@ writing partnership between Jagger and Richards gradually began to dominate the band 's output , giving them their breakthrough international hit " ( I Can 't Get No ) Satisfaction ( 1965 ) , a song which borrowed phrases and rhythms from R & B standards , and would be covered by both Otis Redding and Aretha Franklin . The importance of the writing partnership contributed to the marginalisation of Jones and marked a shift away from R & B material . They would investigate a series of new musical styles in their long career , but blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones ' music . 
 = = = = Other London bands = = = = 
 Other London @-@ based bands that pursued a similar course to the Rolling Stones included the Yardbirds , the Kinks , the Downliners Sect , the Pretty Things and Pink Floyd . 
 The Yardbirds began as the Metropolis Blues Quartet . By 1963 they had acquired Eric Clapton as a lead guitarist and were acting as the backing band for Sonny Boy Williamson on his British tour . They earned a formidable reputation as a live act , developing frantic improvised guitar – harmonica " rave @-@ ups " , but they enjoyed only modest success with singles based on R & B covers . In 1965 they cut the more pop @-@ oriented single " For Your Love " , which made the top 10 in the UK and US , but the move away from the blues prompted Clapton to quit the band for a stint with John Mayall 's Bluesbreakers and then to form Cream . His replacement Jeff Beck ( and eventually his replacement Jimmy Page ) , saw the band enjoy a series of transatlantic hits and to go on to become pioneers of psychedelic rock . 
 After an early lack of success with R & B standards , the Kinks enjoyed their breakthrough with the single " You Really Got Me " ( 1964 ) . It was written by Ray Davies , provided a model for later riff @-@ based hard rock , and reached number one in the UK and the top 10 in the US . The follow @-@ up " All Day and All of the Night " ( 1964 ) reached number two in the US , while the band also released two full @-@ length albums and several EPs in this period . 
 The Downliners Sect formed in 1963 , and developed a strong reputation in London clubs , but had less commercial success than many of their contemporaries . 
 The Pretty Things had UK hits with " Don 't Bring Me Down " ( 1964 ) and the self penned " Honey I Need " ( 1965 ) , which both reached the top twenty , but they failed to break into the American market and would be chiefly remembered for their later psychedelic work . 
 The Pink Floyd began as rhythm and blues outfit the Tea Set , adopting a new name based on those of blues musicians Floyd Council and Pink Anderson and playing the London blues clubs from 1966 . By the time they began to record they had already moved on to psychedelic compositions and jams that would make them a central feature of the emerging London Underground scene . 
 = = = = Provincial groups = = = = 
 Bands to emerge from other major British cities included The Animals from Newcastle , Them from Belfast and the Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues from Birmingham . None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues , often relying on sources that included Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles , but it remained at the core of their early albums . 
 The Animals ' sound was characterised by the keyboards of Alan Price and the powerful vocals of Eric Burdon . They moved to London in 1964 and released a series of successful singles , beginning with transatlantic hit " House of the Rising Sun " , mixing more commercial folk and soul , while their albums were dominated by blues standards . 
 Them , with their vocalist and multi @-@ instrumentalist Van Morrison , had a series of hits with " Baby , Please Don 't Go " ( 1964 ) , which reached the top 10 in the UK , and " Here Comes the Night " ( 1965 ) , which made the top 40 in the U.S. , but perhaps their most enduring legacy was the B @-@ side " Gloria " , which became a garage rock standard . 
 The Spencer Davis Group had their first UK number one with the Jackie Edwards penned " Keep on Running " ( 1965 ) , but became largely a vehicle for the young keyboard player and vocalist Steve Winwood , who at only 18 co @-@ wrote " Gimme Some Lovin ' " ( 1967 ) and " I 'm a Man " ( 1967 ) , both of which reached the Billboard 100 top 10 and became R & B standards . 
 The Moody Blues had only one major R & B hit with a cover of " Go Now " ( 1964 ) , which reached number one in the UK and number ten in the US . Subsequent singles failed to penetrate the top 20 and hardly broke the top 100 in the US , marking a steep decline in the band 's fortunes . However , they would return after line @-@ up changes to be one of the most important psychedelic rock bands and a major influence on progressive rock . 
 = = = = Mod groups = = = = 
 The British Mod subculture , which was at its height in 1965 and 1966 , was musically centred on rhythm and blues and later soul music , but the artists that performed the original music were not available in small London clubs around which the scene was based . British R & B bands like the Stones , Yardbirds and Kinks had a following among mods but a large number of specifically mod bands also emerged to fill this gap . These included The Small Faces , The Creation , The Action , The Smoke , John 's Children and most successfully The Who . The Who 's early promotional material tagged them as producing " maximum rhythm and blues " , but by about 1966 they moved from attempting to emulate American R & B to producing songs that reflected the Mod lifestyle . Many of these bands were able to enjoy cult and then national success in the UK , but found it difficult to break into the American market . Only the Who managed , after some difficulty , to produce a significant US following , particularly after their appearances at the Monterey Pop Festival ( 1967 ) and Woodstock ( 1969 ) . 
 = = = = Jazz @-@ influenced acts = = = = 
 Among more jazz @-@ influenced acts the Organisation were led by Graham Bond 's organ and saxophone playing and gruff vocals . Their rhythm section of Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker would go on to form Cream with Eric Clapton in 1967 . Manfred Mann had a much smoother sound and one of the most highly rated vocalists in the scene in Paul Jones . They enjoyed their first success with covers of girl group songs " Do Wah Diddy Diddy " ( 1964 ) and " Sha La La " ( 1964 ) , the first of which reached number one in both the UK and the US , but largely stuck to rhythm and blues standards on their albums . Zoot Money , whose Big Roll Band mixed R & B , soul , rock and roll and jazz , and was one of the most popular live acts of the era , made little impact in terms of record sales , but is noted for the later successes of its members , including guitarist Andy Summers , pianist Dave Greenslade , drummer Jon <unk> , bassist Tony Reeves and saxophonist Clive Burrows . Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames mixed jazz , ska and <unk> into his music and had three number one singles in the UK , beginning with " Yeh Yeh " ( 1965 ) .

 A number of visiting black stars became part of the British R & B scene . These included Geno Washington , an American singer stationed in England with the Air Force . He was invited to join what became Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band by guitarist Pete Gage in 1965 and enjoyed top 40 hit singles and two top 10 albums before the band split up in 1969 . Another American GI , Herbie Goins , sang with Blues Incorporated before leading his own band , the <unk> . Jimmy James , born in Jamaica , moved to London after two local number one hits with The Vagabonds in 1960 and built a strong reputation as a live act , releasing a live album and their debut The New Religion in 1966 and achieving moderate success with singles before the original Vagabonds broke up in 1970 . Champion Jack Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie pianist , who toured Europe and settled there from 1960 , living in Switzerland and Denmark , then in Halifax , England in the 1970s and 1980s , before finally settling in Germany . 
 The most significant and successful visiting artist was Jimi Hendrix who in early 1966 , after years on the chitlin circuit as sideman for major R & B acts as well as playing in bands in New York , was invited to England to record as a solo artist by former Animals bassist Chas Chandler . With Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass , the band formed around him as The Jimi Hendrix Experience became major stars in the UK , with three top ten hits in early 1967 @.@ it was followed later that year by the psychedelic album Are You Experienced ? , which became a major hit in the US after Hendrix 's triumphant return at the Monterey Pop Festival and made him one of the major figures of late 60s rock . 
 = = = = Solo artists = = = = 
 A number of solo artists who emerged from the British R & B scene would go on to highly successful careers in the later 1960s and 1970s . These included Long John Baldry , Rod Stewart and Elton John . After the dissolution of Blues Incorporated in 1962 Long John Baldry joined the Cyril Davies R & B All Stars , and after Davies ' death in early 1964 took over leadership of the group , renaming it Long John Baldry and His Hoochie Coochie Men . The band featured Rod Stewart as a second vocalist , with whom Baldry formed short lived proto @-@ supergroup <unk> in 1965 . Baldry moved on to front <unk> , which had originally been formed as an R & B band in 1962 by teenage keyboardist Reggie Dwight , later better known as Elton John . Baldry enjoyed his greatest success with pop ballads , beginning with " Let the Heartaches Begin " ( 1967 ) , which reached number one in Britain , but , despite supporting the Beatles and the Rolling Stones , he remained virtually unknown outside of the UK . After <unk> dissolved in 1966 , Rod Stewart joined blues @-@ rock combo Shotgun Express and then The Jeff Beck Group , and when that broke up in 1969 he moved on to The Small Faces , which became The Faces , and also began to pursue his solo career , mixing R & B with rock and folk , to become one of the most successful British solo artists of the 1970s . Elton John , taking his first name from <unk> saxophonist Elton Dean and his last from John Baldry , formed a partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin in 1968 and after writing hits for major pop artists embarked on a solo career that would be the most commercially successful of the early 1970s and one of the most sustained in pop music . 
 = = = = British blues boom = = = = 
 The wider rhythm and blues boom overlapped , both chronologically and in terms of personnel , with the later and more narrowly focused British blues boom . The blues boom began to come to prominence in the mid @-@ 1960s as the rhythm and blues movement began to peter out leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques . Central to the blues boom were John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , who began to gain national and international attention after the release of Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton ( Beano ) album ( 1966 ) , considered one of the seminal British blues recordings . Peter Green started a " second great epoch of British blues " , as he replaced Clapton in the Bluesbreakers after Clapton 's departure to form Cream . 
 In 1967 , after one record with the Bluesbreakers , Green , with the Bluesbreakers ' rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie , formed Peter Green 's Fleetwood Mac . Mike Vernon , who had produced the " Beano " album set up the Blue Horizon record label and signed Fleetwood Mac and other emerging blues acts . Other major acts included Free , Ten Years After , and Duster Bennett . Fleetwood Mac 's eponymous début album reached the UK top 5 in early 1968 and as the instrumental " Albatross " reached number one in the single charts in early 1969 . Chicken Shack , formed at the peak of the boom in 1965 by Stan Webb , were unusual in having a female vocalist and keyboard player in Christine Perfect . They had a British hit with Etta James ' R & B classic " I 'd Rather Go Blind " in 1969 , before Perfect left to join her husband John McVie in Fleetwood Mac , but remained largely focused on blues standards . The band then suffered a series of line @-@ up changes and , although managing a comeback on the club circuit , they never achieved another mainstream breakthrough and split up in 1973 . The last years of the 1960s were , as Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz put it , " the commercial apex of the British blues boom " . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 By 1967 most of the surviving major British R & B acts had moved away from covers and R & B @-@ inspired music to psychedelic rock , and from there they would shift into new subgenres . Some , like Jethro Tull followed bands like the Moody Blues away from 12 @-@ bar structures and harmonicas into complex , classical @-@ influenced progressive rock . Members of the next generation of blues @-@ based bands , including Led Zeppelin , Deep Purple and Black Sabbath , played a loud form of blues @-@ influenced rock , would lead to the development of hard rock and ultimately heavy metal . Some , like Mayall , continued to play a " pure " form of the blues , but largely outside of mainstream notice . The structure of clubs , venues and festivals that had grown up in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Britain virtually disappeared in the 1970s . By 1970 British rhythm and blues had virtually ceased to exist as an active genre . Rhythm and blues bands began to find it very difficult to achieve serious album sales , even in the UK . Vinegar Joe , formed in 1971 around the vocals of Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer and the instrumental talents of Pete Gage and Steve York , despite popular stage performances , broke up after only three albums with disappointing sales two years later . 
 = = = Revivals = = = 
 British R & B continued to be played in the Northern Soul club scene , where early soul records , particularly those of Motown , were highly prized . There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit . Occasional R & B @-@ based pub rock acts like Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring . They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity ( 1976 ) , but failed to make a significant impact in the US . With the rise of disco music , British soul music became popular in the mid @-@ late 1970s . 
 A handful of pub rock acts managed to achieve mainstream success after the advent of punk rock , often being re @-@ categorised as new wave music , including Graham Parker and the Rumour , Nick Lowe , Squeeze and Elvis Costello . London @-@ based R & B pub rock bands received a major boost when The Jam kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City , which mixed R & B standards with originals modelled on The Who 's early singles . They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons ( 1978 ) , on which Paul Weller 's song @-@ writing drew heavily on the British @-@ focused narratives of the Kinks . Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice , The Little Roosters , The Inmates , Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods , became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London . Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music , often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music , including The <unk> , The Merton <unk> , Squire , and Purple Hearts . These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits , before the revival petered out in the early 80s . Weller broke up The Jam in 1982 and formed The Style Council , who abandoned most of the elements of punk to adopt music much more based in R & B and early soul . Some major figures of the movement , including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood , re @-@ emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s , being as defined as blue @-@ eyed soul singers . 
 In 1979 , Dave Kelly , who had been a member of the John Dummer Blues Band formed The Blues Band with ex @-@ Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones and Gary Fletcher , who continued to tour and record rhythm and blues into the new millennium . Roots music , including rhythm and blues , began to enjoy another resurgence of interest towards the end of the 1980s and in the 1990s . Annual blues festivals were established , including The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival , held at Colne in Lancashire from 1989 , which hosts both US and British R & B acts . In 1994 Jools Holland , former keyboard player with Squeeze and presenter of the highly influential TV show Later ... , reshaped his backing band as Jools Holland 's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra and , as well as supporting him on the show , they embarked on a series of tours . After leaving the Rolling Stones in 1997 Bill Wyman formed the Rhythm Kings , which featured guitarists Peter Frampton and Albert Lee as well former Procol Harum keyboardist Gary Brooker , touring and producing a series of R & B based albums . By 2000 the fanzine Blues Matters ! had managed to become a regular glossy magazine . 
 During the 1980s and 1990s musicians , particularly African Americans , mixed pop with disco like beats and high tech electronic production to produce the new genre of contemporary R & B , adding elements of other genres , including funk , hip hop , and soul music . In the 2000s , British artists began to enjoy success with the genre , including Craig David and Estelle . Much of the music produced by modern British R & B artists tend to incorporate electropop sounds , as exemplified by artists such as Jay Sean and Taio Cruz . In the 2000s ( decade ) there was success in the US for British female artists who mixed soul music with elements of rhythm and blues , including Amy Winehouse , Duffy , Leona Lewis and Adele , leading to talk of another " R & B British invasion " . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Because of the very different circumstances from which they came , and in which they played , the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans , often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy . They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music , but it has also been noted that they both popularised that music , bringing it to British , world and in some cases American audiences , and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists . In order to sustain their careers most British R & B artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music . Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic , and eventually progressive , hard rock and heavy metal , mixing in elements of world , folk and classical music . Others from the 1970s and 1980s , helped shape new wave and post @-@ punk music and had a major impact on later genres , including Britpop . As a result , British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music .

 = Oryzomys nelsoni = 
 Oryzomys nelsoni is an extinct rodent of María Madre Island , Nayarit , Mexico . Within the genus Oryzomys of the family Cricetidae , it may have been most closely related to the mainland species O. albiventer . Since its first description in 1898 , most authors have regarded it as a distinct species , but it has also been classified as a mere subspecies of the marsh rice rat ( O. palustris ) . 
 After its discovery in 1897 , it has never been recorded again and it is now considered extinct ; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction . Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species , distinguished in particular by its long tail , robust skull , and large incisors . It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below . Its diet may have included plant material and small animals . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Oryzomys nelsoni was collected by Edward William Nelson and Edward Goldman in May 1897 and never found again . Their visit for the Biological Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture was one of the first scientific explorations of the islands . Clinton Hart Merriam identified the mammals they obtained , including four specimens of Oryzomys nelsoni , which were deposited in the United States National Museum and remain there . He named it as a species of the genus Oryzomys , Oryzomys nelsoni ; the specific name honors Nelson . Investigators have generally retained it as a species distinct from other Oryzomys , but in 1971 Hershkovitz listed it as one of many subspecies of Oryzomys palustris , which he envisaged as a wide @-@ ranging species encompassing what is now the marsh rice rat ( O. palustris ) of the southern and eastern United States , O. couesi of Central America , and several other species with more limited distributions . 
 In his 1918 revision of North American Oryzomys , Goldman considered O. nelsoni to be most closely related to the nearest mainland subspecies of O. couesi , O. couesi mexicanus . In 2009 , Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo @-@ Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O. nelsoni is a very distinct species . Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico , and they suggested that although O. nelsoni likely represents an old , distinctive lineage , it may have derived from a common ancestor with O. albiventer . 
 Oryzomys nelsoni is one of about eight species in the genus Oryzomys , which occurs from the eastern United States ( O. palustris ) into northwestern South America ( O. gorgasi ) . O. nelsoni is further part of the O. couesi section , which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions . Many aspects of the systematics of the O. couesi section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group . Oryzomys previously included many other species , which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in a contribution by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus . All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ( " rice rats " ) , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents . 
 Common names proposed for this species include Nelson rice rat , Nelson 's rice rat , Nelson 's oryzomys , and Tres Marias Island rice rat . 
 = = Description = = 
 Oryzomys nelsoni was a large and long @-@ tailed Oryzomys ; its tail was longer than that of any other western Mexican Oryzomys . The upperparts were ochraceous to buff , most richly so on the rump , and paler further to the front and low on the flanks . On the head and the back , blackish hairs somewhat darkened the overall color . The underparts were white , with lead @-@ colored underfur that was visible in some places . The ears were covered on both sides with scanty grayish hairs . The large hindfeet were sparsely covered with pale hairs . The tail was largely dark , but the underside of the basal one third to one half was light yellow . 
 Oryzomys nelsoni was distinctive in its large skull with broad , well @-@ developed incisors and a strong front part ( rostrum ) that is strongly curved downwards . In O. albiventer , the rostrum and incisors were not as massive , but the molars are larger . The interparietal bone , part of the roof of the braincase , was broad and the incisive foramina , which perforated the palate between the incisors and the molars , were relatively short . 
 Total length in the four known specimens is 282 to 344 mm ( 11 @.@ 1 to 13 @.@ 5 in ) , averaging 322 mm ( 12 @.@ 7 in ) ; head and body length is 122 to 153 mm ( 4 @.@ 8 to 6 @.@ 0 in ) , averaging 140 @.@ 5 mm ( 5 @.@ 53 in ) ; tail length is 160 to 191 mm ( 6 @.@ 3 to 7 @.@ 5 in ) , averaging 181 @.@ 5 mm ( 7 @.@ 15 in ) ; and hindfoot length is 35 to 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 5 in ) , averaging 37 @.@ 3 mm ( 1 @.@ 47 in ) .

 Nelson and Goldman found the species only in a damp , herbaceous site now known as the " <unk> " near a spring high on María Madre Island , the largest of the Islas Marías off the coast of Nayarit , western Mexico , and Nelson wrote that it was rare . He gave the elevation of this place as 1800 ft , which Álvarez @-@ Castañeda and Méndez converted to 550 m , but in his 1918 paper , Goldman gave 800 ft instead , which Carleton and Arroyo @-@ Cabrales in 2009 converted to 245 m . The next survey of small mammals on the island took place in March 1976 by a team led by Don E. Wilson . They failed to collect O. nelsoni and instead found only the introduced black rat ( Rattus rattus ) at the locality where Nelson and Goldman had collected O. nelsoni ; this species may have contributed to the decline of the indigenous rodent . 
 The species is now considered extinct , although as late as 2002 the Mexican government listed it as " threatened " . Another Islas Marías endemic , the deermouse Peromyscus <unk> , still occurred on María Madre in 1976 . Oryzomys nelsoni is thought to have fed on plant material such as weeds , fruit , and seeds , and more rarely on animals such as fish and invertebrates . 
 = The Volcano ( British Columbia ) = 
 The Volcano , also known as Lava Fork volcano , is a small cinder cone in the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains in northwestern British Columbia , Canada . It is located approximately 60 km ( 40 mi ) northwest of the small community of Stewart near the head of Lava Fork . With a summit elevation of 1 @,@ 656 m ( 5 @,@ 433 ft ) and a topographic prominence of 311 m ( 1 @,@ 020 ft ) , it rises above the surrounding rugged landscape on a remote mountain ridge that represents the northern flank of a glaciated U @-@ shaped valley . 
 Lava Fork volcano is associated with a small group of related volcanoes called the Iskut @-@ Unuk River Cones . This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , which extends from the Alaska – Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert , British Columbia . Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province . Geologic studies have shown that The Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400 years ; this is well after the last glacial period , which ended about 10 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 = = Geology = = 
 The Volcano is the southernmost of 10 volcanoes comprising the Iskut @-@ Unuk River Cones volcanic field , as well as the most recent to erupt . Its structure is poorly formed and has been reduced by erosion from alpine glacial ice found at its elevation and latitude . It represents one of the few historically active volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , with a base elevation estimated to be 100 m ( 330 ft ) . Like most cinder cones , The Volcano consists of a pile of loose volcanic ash , lapilli @-@ sized tephra and volcanic bombs . These were deposited during periods of lava fountain activity . The vent area contains volcanic bombs up to 0 @.@ 5 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) long and small deposits of sulfur precipitated from volcanic gases . 
 Like other Iskut @-@ Unuk River Cones , The Volcano has its origins in continental rifting — a long rupture in the Earth 's crust where the lithosphere is being pulled apart . This incipient rifting has formed as a result of the Pacific Plate sliding northward along the Queen Charlotte Fault , on its way to the Aleutian Trench . As the continental crust stretches , the near surface rocks fracture along steeply dipping cracks parallel to the rift known as faults . Basaltic magma rises along these fractures to create effusive eruptions . The rift zone has existed for at least 14 @.@ 9 million years , and has created the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province . Several dormant volcanoes in the province are potentially active , with The Volcano being one of the three having erupted in the last few hundred years . Tseax Cone , which last erupted in the 18th century , is the southernmost volcano in the province , while Prindle Volcano in easternmost @-@ central Alaska , which erupted more than 10 @,@ 000 years ago , is generally considered the northernmost . 
 = = = Volcanic history = = = 
 At least two phases of volcanic activity have been identified at The Volcano . Each event was followed by the eruption of lengthy basaltic lava flows that flowed down steep granitic flanks of the mountain ridge on which The Volcano lies . After this took place , they travelled through the Lava Fork valley for 5 km ( 3 mi ) . Here , the flows crossed the British Columbia border into the U.S. state of Alaska and blocked the Blue River , a tributary of the Unuk River , forming several lakes . The lava flows in total are about 22 km ( 14 mi ) long and still contain their original features from when they cooled , including pressure ridges and lava channels . A series of large trees were engulfed by the lava flows during eruption . The bases of the trees burned and the upper trunks and branches collapsed into the <unk> lava , leaving the trees embedded on the surface of the lava flows . After the flows solidified , tree molds and lava tubes collapsed to form volcanic pits . At the southern end of one of the lava flows , it spreads into a broad terminal lobe on the flat alluvial plain of the Unuk River . Volcanic ash and lava from The Volcano still linger on small glaciers near Mount Lewis Cass , a 2 @,@ 094 m ( 6 @,@ 870 ft ) high mountain near the Alaska @-@ British Columbia border . 
 At least one lava flow from The Volcano was notified by a surveyor named Fremont Morse in 1905 during a survey for the International Boundary Commission . In 1906 , Morse wrote that the most recently erupted lava flow had " probably occurred within less than fifty years " . Since Morse 's report , tree ring and radiocarbon dating techniques have been used to establish the dates of The Volcano 's two volcanic phases . The first is estimated to have occurred about 360 years ago and the latest possibly took place only 150 years ago . This indicates that The Volcano is the youngest known volcanic mountain in Canada and that its volcanic activity is recent compared to many other volcanoes in British Columbia . In several documents , the last eruption of The Volcano is written to have occurred in 1904 . However , according to the Smithsonian Institution 's Global Volcanism Program , this eruption is considered uncertain . 
 Although The Volcano is estimated to have last erupted 150 years ago , it is one of the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985 . Others include Castle Rock ( two events ) , Hoodoo Mountain ( eight events ) , Crow Lagoon ( four events ) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex ( eight events ) . Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers , indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active , with significant potential hazards . The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada 's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes that have had major explosive activity throughout their history , such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex .

 = = = Naming controversy = = = 
 The name of the peak was suggested by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979 . It was adopted on November 24 , 1980 , and has been its official name since then . However , this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources . Instead , it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork volcano due to its close association with the creek of the same name . The reason for this controversy is because The Volcano is generic . In speech it may not be obvious whether The Volcano or the volcano is intended , leading to confusion . Similar named volcanoes in Canada include Volcano Vent in the Tuya volcanic field of northwestern British Columbia and Volcano Mountain in the Fort Selkirk volcanic field of central Yukon . As of 2009 , the unofficial terms for The Volcano continue to be used by Natural Resources Canada . 
 = = = Protection and monitoring = = = 
 The Volcano , its eruptive products and a large mineral spring are protected in Lava Forks Provincial Park . Founded in 2001 as a Class A provincial park , this highly remote park covers an area of 7 @,@ 000 ha ( 17 @,@ 000 acres ) . Lying within its boundaries are the Lava Lakes , two lakes dammed by lava flows erupted from The Volcano . Located in asserted traditional territory of the Tahltan First Nation , Lava Forks Provincial Park provides a location to study ecological processes associated with primary succession or the establishment of vegetation after a major disturbance . After 150 years of non @-@ eruptive activity , vegetation has grown on the surface of the lava flows , including mosses and lichens . Western Hemlock , Mountain Hemlock and Alpine tundra biogeoclimatic <unk> also occur in the area , which form part of the Boundary Ranges <unk> . 
 Like other Iskut @-@ Unuk River Cones , The Volcano is not monitored closely enough by the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is . This is partly because it is located in a remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years . As a result , volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes , including tsunamis , earthquakes and landslides . However , with the existence of earthquakes , further volcanism is expected and would probably have effects on the surrounding landscape . Because of these concerns , significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of volcanoes in Canada . 
 = = Volcanic hazards = = 
 At least seven eruptions have occurred in the Iskut @-@ Unuk River volcanic field in the past 10 @,@ 000 years . Since around 1600 all eruptions have occurred at The Volcano . Its total eruption volume is estimated to be 2 @.@ 2 km3 ( 0 @.@ 53 cu mi ) . Future eruptions from The Volcano will probably be similar in character to those that have occurred throughout its 360 @-@ year eruptive history . There is a one in 200 chance per year of an eruption occurring in Canada and one in 220 chance per year of an effusive eruption . An eruption in the foreseeable future is probably more likely along the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province than in an unrelated volcanic zone outside the province . This is because the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province , which includes the Iskut @-@ Unuk River Cones , is the most active volcanic zone in Canada . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 A small range of effects are expected from future eruptions at The Volcano . Its remote uninhabited location makes volcanic hazards less extreme and is therefore not very hazardous . Ash and rock fragments ( tephra ) ejected during lava fountain activity are unlikely to be high enough to disrupt regional air traffic . However , they could possibly endanger lower flying aircraft along the northern coastal corridor between Vancouver and Alaska . The closest major air route is about 170 km ( 110 mi ) to the east . Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure , as well as damage to other aircraft systems . 
 Lava flows emitted during future volcanic eruptions would likely be basaltic in nature based on the composition of its lavas produced during past volcanic activity . Basaltic lava flows are low in silica content and can have speeds extending from 15 to 50 km / h ( 10 to 30 mph ) . The last eruption at The Volcano 150 years ago had a large impact on fish , plant and animal inhabitants in the valley the lava flows travelled through to cross the Canada – United States border . Because of these circumstances , future eruptions may again block the flow of local water courses if the volume of the erupted lavas are significant enough . This would again have disastrous consequences for fish habitats and spawning grounds . However , there are neither records of any impacts on people during this eruption , nor evidence that it was even witnessed by people . A repeat of wildfires in the Lava Fork valley is also a possibility due to the existence of vegetation on and around the erupted lavas . 
 = Albert Downing = 
 Albert " Doolan " Joseph Downing ( 12 July 1886 – 8 August 1915 ) was a New Zealand international rugby union player , capped 26 times at lock between 1913 and 1914 . He was born in Napier , and began his playing career for Napier Marist in 1909 , from which he was selected for Hawke 's Bay and for the North Island . He moved at the end of 1912 to Auckland and there joined Auckland Marist , where he was the club 's first All Black , playing his debut match against a touring Australian team in 1913 . He was selected for the highly successful tour of North America in 1913 , playing in 14 of the 16 matches and scoring 6 tries . 
 While the All Blacks were on a tour of Australia in 1914 , the British Empire declared war on Germany and the team collectively decided to enlist . Three of them were killed , Downing the first of the All Blacks in World War I. After enlisting in early 1915 , he took part in the Battle of Chunuk Bair , part of the Gallipoli Campaign , and was killed on 8 August . Henry Dewar , a team mate from the USA tour , died the following day at Anzac Cove . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Albert Downing was born on 12 July 1886 in Port <unk> , Napier , New Zealand , the eldest son of Mr and Mrs John Downing . He attended Napier Boys ' High School until 1904 . He was a farmer before joining Barry Brothers , carriers and coal merchants , choosing to work as a carter outdoors , rather than join the clerical staff . Later , he worked as a storeman for the Ellison and Duncan Company . 
 = = Rugby career = = 
 Downing ’ s rugby career , playing at lock , started with the Napier Old Boys Rugby Club and then Napier Marist Rugby Club ; he represented Hawke 's Bay from 1909 to 1912 . In 1911 , he was selected for a North Island Country team , playing all games of a five match tour . The tour was part of a scheme by the New Zealand Rugby Union to discover talent , which brought Downing to the selectors ' attention . The North Island team played four games , against Auckland , Taranaki Union , Wanganui and Wellington , between 29 July and 9 August , and played a final match against the South Island on 12 August . Reports from the tour show Downing was very involved in the games , scoring a try against Wanganui for a 13 – 0 victory , and nearly scoring in a close game against Auckland , which resulted in a 8 – 8 draw . The North versus South match , which the North won 18 – 6 , was described in the press as lacking in quality : it was an " uninteresting match " , and " play was crude and poor and lacked vigour " . Downing stood out : " The only member of either team who could be said to have played up to inter @-@ island form was Downing – a fine forward in the North Island team . " 
 The following year , Downing 's name was put forward by Hawke 's Bay to play for the North Island in the annual Inter @-@ Island match and he made selection . The North beat the South 12 – 8 in a closely contested , entertaining game in front of a full capacity crowd . The Northern forwards in general played a good game ; it was suggested that Downing 's passing back from the lineout to the halfback was something that other forwards might consider imitating . A tour with the North Island Country team followed , in which Downing played all four games . The last , against South Island Country in Wellington on 4 August , had to be stopped at half time due to the condition of the match ground , and the North won 14 – 3 . His Hawke 's Bay and North Island Country team @-@ mate Norman McKenzie described him as " an outstanding line @-@ out forward with a wonderful pair of hands " . 
 = = = Auckland and the All Blacks = = = 
 Downing relocated to Auckland at the end of 1912 and was recruited by Auckland <unk> on the strength of his playing and the links with the Napier <unk> . He was the club 's first All Black , joined shortly after by Jim " Buster " Barrett . Downing 's debut match was against Australia in Wellington on 6 September , which the All Blacks won easily 30 – 6 , bettering Australia " in every respect " . 
 He was subsequently selected for the tour of North America the same year . On 10 September , the eve of departure , Wellington took on the All Blacks in a " thrilling " game which saw the visitors nearly defeated . With the wind behind them in the first half , the All Blacks gained a 13 @-@ point lead ; but in the second half , Wellington came back strongly ; and with a drop @-@ goal in the final three minutes , closed the lead to just one point , 19 – 18 . There was strong back play on both sides ; amongst the forwards , one player from each side received special mention in the press : Downing for the All Blacks , Miller for Wellington . 
 It is possible that Downing might not have been selected for the tour had he not moved to Auckland . As it was , he played in 14 of the 16 matches , and contributed 6 tries for 18 points towards a total tally of 610 points . There was little interest in the American press about the tour . A single short paragraph in the New York Tribune reports on the 51 – 3 defeat of the All America team on 15 November . In New Zealand , meanwhile , detailed match reports were coming in , and many of these were full of praise for Downing . Of all the players in the USA match , four would die in the Great War : Frank Jacob Gard , the USA captain ( died 29 September 1918 ) ; and three All Blacks : Henry Dewar , George Sellars and Downing himself . 
 In 1914 , Downing was again selected for the Inter @-@ Island match in Wellington on 9 June , which the South won 8 – 0 . Later in the year , four of Downing 's Marist team @-@ mates were with him in the All Black side selected to tour Australia : Barrett , five eighths Jock McKenzie , who had transferred from Wellington , and fullback Jack O ’ Brien , a founding member of the club . The All Blacks played Wellington again on the day before leaving for Australia , this time losing 19 – 14 , Downing contributing a try . Downing played in 10 of the 11 matches , including the 3 tests , and was praised for his line @-@ out ability . In the first test on 18 July , he was , according to The Star , " easily the best forward in the team " , and after the second test , The Southland Times opined that " it is quite possible that before he leaves the lengthy <unk> may prove himself to be included in the star category of New Zealand forwards . " 
 In an obituary , Downing was described as " big , strong , fast , brainy , clever with hands and feet , dashing , and resourceful . " He was best known for his work in the line @-@ out and in the loose , equally good in attack as in defence . He played hard but clean . Such was his devotion to rugby that Downing had a tattoo on his left forearm of the Ranfurly Shield .

 During the All Black tour of Australia , in the game against Metropolitan Union in Sydney on 5 August 1914 , the news was posted on the scoreboard that the British Empire – and therefore New Zealand and Australia – had declared war . On the ship home , the players collectively decided to volunteer for military service . Three of them were killed , including Downing at Gallipoli , Bobby Black at the Somme and Jim <unk> at Messines . 
 Downing enlisted with the Fifth Reinforcements ( Wellington Battalion ) on 2 February 1915 . While doing basic training , he also played two games of rugby for the Trentham Military Forces Team , against Wellington on 1 May and Auckland on 5 June . In the first of these , Downing was reckoned to be the standout forward of the Trentham team , and " played splendidly " . 
 On 13 June , he departed bound for Suez in Egypt , arriving 24 July . His unit took part , beginning on 6 August , in the Battle of Chunuk Bair , in support of the landing at Suvla Bay , which was intended to break the deadlock in the Gallipoli Campaign . The initial assault was successful and early on the morning of 8 August , Downing was with A Company occupying the Turkish trench on the crest of <unk> Bair . The Turks counter @-@ attacked at dawn , forcing back the British battalions and the Wellingtons . The crest was lost and the battle continued for 12 hours on the seaward slopes . By nightfall , Downing , who had earlier distinguished himself in a bayonet charge , was killed , reportedly " blown to pieces " . Downing was the first of 13 All Blacks killed in the war , just a day before Henry Dewar , the second All Black to fall , was killed in action with the Wellington Mounted Rifles at Anzac Cove . 
 Sergeant Doolan Downing is commemorated on panel 17 of the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing on Chunuk Bair , along with his commanding @-@ officer , Lt Col William George Malone , who died aged 56 , and more than 300 other men of his battalion . 
 = Atom = 
 An atom is the smallest constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element . Every solid , liquid , gas , and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms . Atoms are very small ; typical sizes are around 100 pm ( a ten @-@ billionth of a meter , in the short scale ) . However , atoms do not have well @-@ defined boundaries , and there are different ways to define their size that give different but close values . 
 Atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics - as if they were billiard balls , for example - gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects . Through the development of physics , atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior . 
 Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus . The nucleus is made of one or more protons and typically a similar number of neutrons . Protons and neutrons are called nucleons . More than 99 @.@ 94 % of an atom 's mass is in the nucleus . The protons have a positive electric charge , the electrons have a negative electric charge , and the neutrons have no electric charge . If the number of protons and electrons are equal , that atom is electrically neutral . If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons , then it has an overall negative or positive charge , respectively , and it is called an ion . 
 The electrons of an atom are attracted to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force . The protons and neutrons in the nucleus are attracted to each other by a different force , the nuclear force , which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another . Under certain circumstances the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force , and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus , leaving behind a different element : nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation . 
 The number of protons in the nucleus defines to what chemical element the atom belongs : for example , all copper atoms contain 29 protons . The number of neutrons defines the isotope of the element . The number of electrons influences the magnetic properties of an atom . Atoms can attach to one or more other atoms by chemical bonds to form chemical compounds such as molecules . The ability of atoms to associate and dissociate is responsible for most of the physical changes observed in nature , and is the subject of the discipline of chemistry . 
 = = History of atomic theory = = 
 = = = Atoms in philosophy = = = 
 The idea that matter is made up of discrete units is a very old idea , appearing in many ancient cultures such as Greece and India . The word " atom " was coined by ancient Greek philosophers . However , these ideas were founded in philosophical and theological reasoning rather than evidence and experimentation . As a result , their views on what atoms look like and how they behave were incorrect . They also could not convince everybody , so atomism was but one of a number of competing theories on the nature of matter . It was not until the 19th century that the idea was embraced and refined by scientists , when the blossoming science of chemistry produced discoveries that only the concept of atoms could explain . 
 = = = First evidence @-@ based theory = = = 
 In the early 1800s , John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers ( the law of multiple proportions ) . For instance , there are two types of tin oxide : one is 88 @.@ 1 % tin and 11 @.@ 9 % oxygen and the other is 78 @.@ 7 % tin and 21 @.@ 3 % oxygen ( tin ( II ) oxide and tin dioxide respectively ) . This means that 100g of tin will combine either with <unk> or 27g of oxygen . 13 @.@ 5 and 27 form a ratio of 1 : 2 , a ratio of small whole numbers . This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units — in other words , atoms . In the case of tin oxides , one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms . 
 Dalton also believed atomic theory could explain why water absorbs different gases in different proportions . For example , he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen . Dalton hypothesized this was due to the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases ' respective particles , and carbon dioxide molecules ( CO2 ) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules ( N2 ) . 
 = = = Brownian motion = = = 
 In 1827 , botanist Robert Brown used a microscope to look at dust grains floating in water and discovered that they moved about erratically , a phenomenon that became known as " Brownian motion " . This was thought to be caused by water molecules knocking the grains about . In 1905 Albert Einstein proved the reality of these molecules and their motions by producing the first Statistical physics analysis of Brownian motion . French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein 's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms , thereby conclusively verifying Dalton 's atomic theory . 
 = = = Discovery of the electron = = = 
 The physicist J. J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays , showing they were made of particles , but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom , hydrogen . Therefore , they were not atoms , but a new particle , the first subatomic particle to be discovered , which he originally called " corpuscle " but was later named electron , after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874 . He also showed they were identical to particles given off by photoelectric and radioactive materials . It was quickly recognized that they are the particles that carry electric currents in metal wires , and carry the negative electric charge within atoms . Thomson was given the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physics for this work . Thus he overturned the belief that atoms are the indivisible , ultimate particles of matter . Thomson also incorrectly postulated that the low mass , negatively charged electrons were distributed throughout the atom in a uniform sea of positive charge . This became known as the plum pudding model . 
 = = = Discovery of the nucleus = = = 
 In 1909 , Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden , under the direction of Ernest Rutherford , bombarded a metal foil with alpha particles to observe how they scattered . They expected all the alpha particles to pass straight through with little deflection , because Thomson 's model said that the charges in the atom are so diffuse that their electric fields could not affect the alpha particles much . However , Geiger and Marsden spotted alpha particles being deflected by angles greater than 90 ° , which was supposed to be impossible according to Thomson 's model . To explain this , Rutherford proposed that the positive charge of the atom is concentrated in a tiny nucleus at the center of the atom . 
 = = = Discovery of isotopes = = = 
 While experimenting with the products of radioactive decay , in 1913 radiochemist Frederick Soddy discovered that there appeared to be more than one type of atom at each position on the periodic table . The term isotope was coined by Margaret Todd as a suitable name for different atoms that belong to the same element . J.J. Thomson created a technique for separating atom types through his work on ionized gases , which subsequently led to the discovery of stable isotopes . 
 = = = Bohr model = = = 
 In 1913 the physicist Niels Bohr proposed a model in which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only do so in a finite set of orbits , and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon . This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable ( given that normally , charges in acceleration , including circular motion , lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation , see synchrotron radiation ) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra . 
 Later in the same year Henry Moseley provided additional experimental evidence in favor of Niels Bohr 's theory . These results refined Ernest Rutherford 's and Antonius Van den Broek 's model , which proposed that the atom contains in its nucleus a number of positive nuclear charges that is equal to its ( atomic ) number in the periodic table . Until these experiments , atomic number was not known to be a physical and experimental quantity . That it is equal to the atomic nuclear charge remains the accepted atomic model today . 
 = = = Chemical bonding explained = = = 
 Chemical bonds between atoms were now explained , by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916 , as the interactions between their constituent electrons . As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law , in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested that this could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner . Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus . 
 = = = Further developments in quantum physics = = = 
 The Stern – Gerlach experiment of 1922 provided further evidence of the quantum nature of the atom . When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field , the beam was split based on the direction of an atom 's angular momentum , or spin . As this direction is random , the beam could be expected to spread into a line . Instead , the beam was split into two parts , depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down . 
 In 1924 , Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles behave to an extent like waves . In 1926 , Erwin Schrödinger used this idea to develop a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three @-@ dimensional waveforms rather than point particles . A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at a given point in time ; this became known as the uncertainty principle , formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926 . In this concept , for a given accuracy in measuring a position one could only obtain a range of probable values for momentum , and vice versa . This model was able to explain observations of atomic behavior that previous models could not , such as certain structural and spectral patterns of atoms larger than hydrogen . Thus , the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed . 
 = = = Discovery of the neutron = = = 
 The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy . The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions , and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom 's mass to its charge . The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses . The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts , called the whole number rule . The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron , an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton , by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932 . Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons , but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus . 
 = = = Fission , high @-@ energy physics and condensed matter = = = 
 In 1938 , the German chemist Otto Hahn , a student of Rutherford , directed neutrons onto uranium atoms expecting to get transuranium elements . Instead , his chemical experiments showed barium as a product . A year later , Lise Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch verified that Hahn 's result were the first experimental nuclear fission . In 1944 , Hahn received the Nobel prize in chemistry . Despite Hahn 's efforts , the contributions of Meitner and Frisch were not recognized . 
 In the 1950s , the development of improved particle accelerators and particle detectors allowed scientists to study the impacts of atoms moving at high energies . Neutrons and protons were found to be hadrons , or composites of smaller particles called quarks . The standard model of particle physics was developed that so far has successfully explained the properties of the nucleus in terms of these sub @-@ atomic particles and the forces that govern their interactions .

 = = = Subatomic particles = = = 
 Though the word atom originally denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles , in modern scientific usage the atom is composed of various subatomic particles . The constituent particles of an atom are the electron , the proton and the neutron ; all three are fermions . However , the hydrogen @-@ 1 atom has no neutrons and the hydron ion has no electrons . 
 The electron is by far the least massive of these particles at 9 @.@ 11 × 10 − 31 kg , with a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques . It is the lightest particle with a positive rest mass measured . Under ordinary conditions , electrons are bound to the positively charged nucleus by the attraction created from opposite electric charges . If an atom has more or fewer electrons than its atomic number , then it becomes respectively negatively or positively charged as a whole ; a charged atom is called an ion . Electrons have been known since the late 19th century , mostly thanks to J.J. Thomson ; see history of subatomic physics for details . 
 Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1 @,@ 836 times that of the electron , at 1 @.@ 6726 × 10 − 27 kg . The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number . Ernest Rutherford ( 1919 ) observed that nitrogen under alpha @-@ particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei . By 1920 he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton . 
 Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1 @,@ 839 times the mass of the electron , or 1 @.@ <unk> × 10 − 27 kg , the heaviest of the three constituent particles , but it can be reduced by the nuclear binding energy . Neutrons and protons ( collectively known as nucleons ) have comparable dimensions — on the order of 2 @.@ 5 × 10 − 15 m — although the ' surface ' of these particles is not sharply defined . The neutron was discovered in 1932 by the English physicist James Chadwick . 
 In the Standard Model of physics , electrons are truly elementary particles with no internal structure . However , both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks . There are two types of quarks in atoms , each having a fractional electric charge . Protons are composed of two up quarks ( each with charge + 2 / 3 ) and one down quark ( with a charge of − 1 / 3 ) . Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks . This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles . 
 The quarks are held together by the strong interaction ( or strong force ) , which is mediated by gluons . The protons and neutrons , in turn , are held to each other in the nucleus by the nuclear force , which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range @-@ properties ( see the article on the nuclear force for more ) . The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons , which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces .

 All the bound protons and neutrons in an atom make up a tiny atomic nucleus , and are collectively called nucleons . The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1 @.@ 07 3 √ A fm , where A is the total number of nucleons . This is much smaller than the radius of the atom , which is on the order of 105 fm . The nucleons are bound together by a short @-@ ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force . At distances smaller than 2 @.@ 5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other . 
 Atoms of the same element have the same number of protons , called the atomic number . Within a single element , the number of neutrons may vary , determining the isotope of that element . The total number of protons and neutrons determine the nuclide . The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus , with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay . 
 The proton , the electron , and the neutron are classified as fermions . <unk> obey the Pauli exclusion principle which prohibits identical fermions , such as multiple protons , from occupying the same quantum state at the same time . Thus , every proton in the nucleus must occupy a quantum state different from all other protons , and the same applies to all neutrons of the nucleus and to all electrons of the electron cloud . However , a proton and a neutron are allowed to occupy the same quantum state . 
 For atoms with low atomic numbers , a nucleus that has more neutrons than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron – proton ratio is closer to one . However , as the atomic number increases , a higher proportion of neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons . Thus , there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z 
 = 20 ( calcium ) and as Z increases , the neutron – proton ratio of stable isotopes increases . The stable isotope with the highest proton – neutron ratio is lead @-@ 208 ( about 1 @.@ 5 ) . 
 The number of protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus can be modified , although this can require very high energies because of the strong force . Nuclear fusion occurs when multiple atomic particles join to form a heavier nucleus , such as through the energetic collision of two nuclei . For example , at the core of the Sun protons require energies of 3 – 10 keV to overcome their mutual repulsion — the coulomb barrier — and fuse together into a single nucleus . Nuclear fission is the opposite process , causing a nucleus to split into two smaller nuclei — usually through radioactive decay . The nucleus can also be modified through bombardment by high energy subatomic particles or photons . If this modifies the number of protons in a nucleus , the atom changes to a different chemical element . 
 If the mass of the nucleus following a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles , then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy ( such as a gamma ray , or the kinetic energy of a beta particle ) , as described by Albert Einstein 's mass – energy equivalence formula , E = 
 mc2 , where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light . This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus , and it is the non @-@ recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate . 
 The fusion of two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel — a total nucleon number of about 60 — is usually an exothermic process that releases more energy than is required to bring them together . It is this energy @-@ releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self @-@ sustaining reaction . For heavier nuclei , the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease . That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26 , and atomic masses higher than about 60 , is an endothermic process . These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy @-@ producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star . 
 = = = Electron cloud = = = 
 The electrons in an atom are attracted to the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force . This force binds the electrons inside an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus , which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape . The closer an electron is to the nucleus , the greater the attractive force . Hence electrons bound near the center of the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations . 
 Electrons , like other particles , have properties of both a particle and a wave . The electron cloud is a region inside the potential well where each electron forms a type of three @-@ dimensional standing wave — a wave form that does not move relative to the nucleus . This behavior is defined by an atomic orbital , a mathematical function that characterises the probability that an electron appears to be at a particular location when its position is measured . Only a discrete ( or quantized ) set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus , as other possible wave patterns rapidly decay into a more stable form . Orbitals can have one or more ring or node structures , and differ from each other in size , shape and orientation . 
 Each atomic orbital corresponds to a particular energy level of the electron . The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state . Likewise , through spontaneous emission , an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon . These characteristic energy values , defined by the differences in the energies of the quantum states , are responsible for atomic spectral lines . 
 The amount of energy needed to remove or add an electron — the electron binding energy — is far less than the binding energy of nucleons . For example , it requires only 13 @.@ 6 eV to strip a ground @-@ state electron from a hydrogen atom , compared to 2 @.@ 23 million eV for splitting a deuterium nucleus . Atoms are electrically neutral if they have an equal number of protons and electrons . Atoms that have either a deficit or a surplus of electrons are called ions . Electrons that are farthest from the nucleus may be transferred to other nearby atoms or shared between atoms . By this mechanism , atoms are able to bond into molecules and other types of chemical compounds like ionic and covalent network crystals .
