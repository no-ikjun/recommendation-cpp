 To bring their music to the public before the album 's release , the group played together a few times before the release . On 17 March 2007 the band played a 2 ½ hour set streamed live to the internet from veteran musician Peter Gabriel 's studio ( Real World Studios ) in England . In this performance , there were eight new songs featured , beginning with Finn 's co @-@ written piece with the Dixie Chicks " Silent House " and also included " Pour le monde " ( " For the world " ) , " Transit Lounge " , " She Called Up " and " Don 't Stop Now " . 
 Prior to the album 's release , a single was released . The song " Don 't Stop Now " was selected , as it featured the new line @-@ up of the band . The single received moderate success in the charts . The follow @-@ up single , " She Called Up " , released in September 2007 , was not as successful as " Don 't Stop Now " . 
 The album had a staggered release internationally across a fortnight , beginning in Australia , while the final location of its release was with the United States . Following the Australian release , the group performed at Live Earth in Australia , performing many of the album 's songs , and also on various television programs , along with many interviews , such as on Rove and Enough Rope with Andrew Denton . A special live version of Crowded House performing " Silent House " was made available for Australian and UK purchasers of the album by inserting the disc into their computer and downloading the song from the internet . The song features the advertised album line @-@ up , including new drummer Matt Sherrod and returning member of Crowded House Mark Hart , neither of whom were on the studio version .

 The album has been very well received by critics , with Hal Horowitz of Amazon.com praising the album as " a worthy successor to Crowded House 's existing catalog " . Liam Gowing of A.V. Club indicated that in " Text , context and subtext , Hester 's passing seems to color every line , even those generic enough to be about anything . " 
 = = Cover art = = 
 As he did for the first four Crowded House albums , Nick Seymour , also an artist , created the cover art for Time on Earth . The group 's name " Crowded House " appears with jumbled case , some lower and some upper case , appearing as " <unk> <unk> " . Similarly , the album title is also in a partial jumble with all but the last two letters in upper case , appearing as " TIME ON <unk> . " 
 The cover also features a blue dragon eating a human , the design of which was a direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus 's book History of the Northern Peoples . The use of a dragon eating a man is to symbolise former member Hester being consumed by depression , symbolised by the dragon being blue , and this brought his time on earth to an early end . The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings <unk> together , even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto . Only the tree on the right , and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings . The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005 . 
 In November 2007 , a special edition of Time on Earth was released featuring a colour altered cover . The cover 's main background area , which was previously a sandy @-@ wheat colour , was converted into an aqua @-@ teal colour , while the tree in the image had a bird in a nest added to it .

 According to Neil Finn , " It ( Time on Earth ) doesn 't sound like any one particular Crowded House album , but it has elements of Crowded House ... in as much as Nick and I make a sound together when we play and always did . I think there 's a lot of heart and spirit in the album which is connected with the loss of our dear friend Paul but also an attempt to try and make sense of it and move forward . And as such , it seemed the most obvious and best way to do that was to be playing music again with each other , Nick and I. I want to be in a band and what other band could it be . " Crowded House 's leader , Neil Finn has indicated that , as the album began life as a solo project , its sound is generally different from Crowded House , though similar in parts , indicating that no one album by the group sounds like this one . As the album is dedicated to Hester and attends to his death , much of the album has a mournful tone , however this has been received well by critics , with some indicating that " fortunately , Finn is a master at expressing ambiguity , ( both ) lyrically and musically " . Finn has said of the song " People Are Like Suns " , that " Part of it is the idea that people burn brightly and then they fade out . Also , when I wrote it , I was reading Ian McEwan 's novel Saturday , which begins with a man on his balcony watching his plane go down , so the first lines borrow something from that image . " 
 The song " Pour le monde " ( " For the World " in French ) was inspired when Finn was in Paris and observed a demonstration march protesting against the war on terror , with the chant " Pour le monde pas pour la guerre " , which translates to " For the world , not for the war " ( which is then sung in English directly after the French on the song ) . Seymour adds that the song contains " a lot of nobility and integrity " and that when they have performed the song it " really does stand upright " . The last song recorded for the album , " Transit Lounge " , is written about time spent in various transit lounges around the world , particularly Singapore and Bangkok . 
 Lyrically , Andy Strickland of Yahoo ! Music asserts that the album 's song " English Trees " shows Finn 's " brilliant weaving of a tale of loss and yearning marks him out as up there with the very best songwriters working today " and of the album 's musical structure as a whole , comments that it is a " collection of songs that reflect Finn 's usual palette of singalong pop ( " She Called Up " ) , achingly fine ballads ( " Pour le monde " ) , and darker , more ambient sounds ( " A Sigh " ) " . Jessica Letkemann of Billboard points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn 's solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work would be surprised , insisting that " Gone are the more overtly ' 80s top 40 flourishes " . Bud Scoppa writes in Uncut Magazine that the album 's extremes are portrayed in its first two songs , " Nobody Wants To " , which he describes as " [ setting ] the prevailing melancholy mood , as Finn 's slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret " , and " Don 't Stop Now " , in which " Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS , seeking " something I can write about … something I can cry about " " .

 In April 2007 , the band 's website went live and included a confirmation of the track listing of Time on Earth . Notably , the album has 14 tracks , only the second studio album by Crowded House to have as many , the previous being <unk> . The album features the guitar work of Johnny Marr , guitarist and songwriter of The Smiths , on " Even a Child " and lead single " Don 't Stop Now ; " Marr co @-@ wrote the former song with Finn . The album also includes the song " Silent House " , which Finn co @-@ wrote with the Dixie Chicks ( which also appeared on their 2006 Grammy @-@ winning album Taking the Long Way ) . With the Australian and UK release , the CD unlocks an online exclusive download of a live version of the song " Silent House " . Early releases of the album in the UK included an additional DVD . Following touring , on 3 November 2007 , a special edition was released in Australia featuring a colour @-@ altered cover and an extra CD featuring eleven songs from the 8 September 2007 performance at Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , for the North American leg of the Time on Earth tour . 
 The tracks " Lost Island " and " Stare Me Out " are available on the vinyl version of this album . They are also available as b @-@ sides to " Don 't Stop Now " , and as bonus tracks via digital music providers .

 Time on Earth entered the Australian ARIA Albums Chart on 8 July at # 2 , just behind Michael Bublé 's Call Me Irresponsible , however in its second week , it rose to the # 1 position , swapping with Call Me Irresponsible which then moved to # 2 . It entered the RIANZ albums chart in New Zealand on 9 July 2007 also at # 2 , though slipped to # 3 in its second week , instead of rising as it did in Australia . Crowded House 's place of origin is held in contention due to the band being led by Neil Finn of New Zealand , however the band has always resided in , and was formed in , Australia . Due to this constant confusion , both ARIA and RIANZ consider the group to be native to their respective countries , as they 're indicated as " local artists " in the album listings , on ARIA as a " red spot " and on RIANZ with the item highlighted in green . On the U.S. Billboard 200 , the album debuted at number 46 , with about 16 @,@ 000 copies sold in its first week . The album entered the charts in the United Kingdom at # 3 with sales of over 27 @,@ 000 , being Crowded House 's highest charting studio album in the UK , only being superseded by Recurring Dream which achieved a # 1 position and sold over a million copies . It also entered the Canadian Albums Chart # 38 , its Canadian peak position . 
 = Plastic Brit = 
 Plastic Brit , or Plastic Briton , is a pejorative term used to describe athletes who choose to represent Great Britain in international sport despite having personal connections to another country . Some media critics believe it undermines the purpose of international sport for the purpose of medals . The term came into popular use in 2012 when it was reported that 61 out of 542 ( 11 % ) of the British Olympic team had been born abroad . 
 = = History and use = = 
 The term " Plastic Brit " is derived from Plastic Paddy , which is used to describe people who claim to be Irish despite not residing in that country . While the concept gained the British media 's attention in the run @-@ up to the 2012 Summer Olympics , it had also been used in describing members of other British sporting teams . England 's cricket team had a perceived problem of having too many foreign @-@ born players . The England and Wales Cricket Board responded to the issue by lengthening the residency period before a foreign player can be accepted to play for England to seven years . 
 The term was popularised in the United Kingdom through its usage in the Daily Mail newspaper to describe athletes born outside the UK who had been selected to represent Great Britain at the London 2012 Summer Olympics . The term originally had foundations from South African @-@ born Zola Budd having her British citizenship application fast tracked in order to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . 
 Several athletes have been described by the press as " Plastic Brits " . Tiffany Porter was selected as the captain of Great Britain 's athletics team at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships despite being born in the United States . She was described as a " Plastic Brit " in the media for refusing to recite the words of the British national anthem , " God Save the Queen " , at a press conference . After Porter broke the British record for the 100 metres hurdles , the previous record holder Angela Thorp said that she felt " devastated " that Porter had broken her record because she had expected Jessica Ennis to break it . 
 The term was used to describe a number of amateur wrestlers such as <unk> <unk> and Yana <unk> who had not been born in the UK and had been given British citizenship . Only one wrestler had competed for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics , Ukrainian @-@ born Olga <unk> . British Wrestling had the majority of its host nation berths removed by the British Olympic Association because of British Wrestling 's failing to reach set performance targets . The term " Plastic Brit " was also used when there were calls for Arsenal 's Spanish goalkeeper Manuel Almunia to play for the England national football team in 2009 . 
 It was argued by some newspaper reporters that selecting athletes born outside of the UK was discriminatory against British @-@ born athletes and was against the spirit of the Olympics . In 2012 , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) imposed a mandatory three @-@ year waiting period before athletes could compete in the Olympics for another country . In response , International Olympic Committee chairman Jacques Rogge said , " Then there are cases where there is support [ for athletes competing for other countries ] but they go because there is a bigger gain [ for the athlete ] in another country . Legally we can 't stop it but it doesn 't mean we love it . " In 2015 , the term was also erroneously levelled at sprinter <unk> Hughes by some newspapers despite Hughes having British citizenship by virtue of being born in Anguilla , a British Overseas Territory without IOC recognition . 
 = = Criticism = = 
 The term " Plastic Brit " has been criticised in British media . The Daily Telegraph suggested that fans overlook athletes ' places of birth if they perform well for Great Britain or England . The Guardian newspaper criticised the Daily Mail 's usage of the term , saying that the definition of a " Plastic Brit " was inconsistent and that under some definitions , some British @-@ born athletes such as Ryan Giggs would be classed as " Plastic Brits " for failing to sing " God Save the Queen " . The Daily Mirror newspaper also said that the Daily Mail , along with other newspapers , had supported the selection of Zola Budd to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Olympic Games . The Independent newspaper said that a third of Great Britain 's gold medal winners at the Olympics and Paralympic games had a non @-@ British parent or had been born outside of the UK . 
 A number of athletes were also critical of the term . Triple jumper <unk> <unk> , who had been described as a " Plastic Brit " , openly criticised the term in an article in The Guardian newspaper . She said , " I have lived in this country for 11 years , I am married to a British man , I have British children , I train under a British coach , at a British club . This is my home . What are they talking about ? " . She also said that a number of other athletes , including Farah and Kevin Pietersen — who had represented Great Britain and the England cricket team respectively — had not been born in the United Kingdom but were not branded as " Plastic Brits " . Marathon runner Paula Radcliffe also criticised the term , asking for Great Britain supporters at the Olympics to support every athlete representing Great Britain , regardless of their countries of origin . Long @-@ distance runner Mo Farah , when asked by a journalist if he should run for Somalia , said , " Look mate , this is my country . This is where I grew up , this is where I started life . This is my country and when I put on my Great Britain vest I 'm proud . I 'm very proud . Was the Mail listening ? " Fijian @-@ born Paralympic discus thrower Derek <unk> said in the Evening Standard that he was a " Titanium Brit " after he lost his legs in an explosion while serving with the British Army . 
 = Birbhum district = 
 Birbhum district ( Bengali : <unk> <unk> ) ( pron : <unk> ) is an administrative unit in the Indian state of West Bengal . It is the northernmost district of Burdwan division — one of the three administrative divisions of West Bengal . The district headquarters is in Suri . <unk> , Dumka and <unk> districts of the state of Jharkhand lie at the western border of this district ; the border in other directions is covered by the districts of Bardhaman and Murshidabad of West Bengal . 
 Often called " the land of red soil , " Birbhum is noted for its topography and its cultural heritage which is unique and is somewhat different from the other districts in West Bengal . The western part of Birbhum is a bushy region , a part of the Chhota Nagpur Plateau . This region gradually merges with the fertile alluvial farmlands in the east . 
 This district saw many cultural and religious movements in history . The Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan , established by Rabindranath Tagore , is one of the places Birbhum is internationally renowned for . Many festivals are celebrated in this culturally rich district , including the notable Poush Mela . 
 Birbhum is primarily an agricultural district with around 75 % of the population being dependent on agriculture . Principal industries of the district include cotton and silk harvesting and weaving , rice and oilseed milling , lac harvesting , stone mining and metalware and pottery manufacture . Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station is the only heavy industry in the district . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Birbhum comes probably from the term ' land ' ( ' <unk> ' ) of the ' brave ' ( ' <unk> ' ) . Another theory says that the district bears the name of Bir kings , who ruled in the area . Bir in the <unk> language means forests ; therefore , Birbhum could also mean a land of forests . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Situated between 23 ° 32 ' 30 " ( right above the tropic of cancer ) and 24 ° 35 ' 0 " north latitude and 87 ° 5 ' 25 " and 88 ° 1 ' 40 " east longitudes , and about 4 @,@ 545 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 755 sq mi ) in area , this district is triangular . River Ajay forms the southern base and the apex of the triangle points north . The river forms the boundary between the districts of Birbhum and Bardhaman . The state of Jharkhand is at the northern and the western border of Birbhum and Murshidabad is at the east . 
 Geographically , this area lies at the northeastern end of the Chota Nagpur Plateau , as it slopes down and merges with the alluvial plains of the Ganges . The western portion of the district is historically known as Vajjabhumi or <unk> . It is an undulating upland that is generally barren . The comparatively more fertile eastern portion , constituting the northeastern Rarh region , merges with the Gangetic plain . Vajjabhumi is included in the Rarh region , and the rest of Rarh is called <unk> to differentiate it from Vajjabhumi . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 The climate on the western side is dry and extreme but is relatively milder on the eastern side . During summer , the temperature can shoot well above 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) and in winters it can drop to around 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . Rainfall is higher in the western areas as compared to the eastern areas . The annual average rainfall in Rajnagar is 1 @,@ 405 millimetres ( 55 @.@ 3 in ) and in Nanoor it is 1 @,@ 212 millimetres ( 47 @.@ 7 in ) , mostly in the monsoon months ( June to October ) .

 = = = Rivers = = = 
 Several rivers flow across Birbhum . Some of these are Ajay , Mayurakshi ( Mor ) , <unk> , Bakreshwar , Brahmani , Dwarka , <unk> , Chapala , <unk> , Pagla etc . A project on the Mayurakshi that includes the <unk> Barrage ( near Suri ) , provides irrigation for about 2 @,@ 428 square kilometres ( 937 sq mi ) . Almost all the rivers originate higher up on the Chota Nagpur plateau and flow across Birbhum in a west – east direction . These rivers are furious during the monsoons but shrink during the dry summer months . The cyclical rotation of drought and floods of the rivers destroy lives and property , and adds to the difficulties of life in the district .

 = = = Prehistory = = = 
 The area now known as Birbhum was inhabited from pre @-@ historic times . Some of the archaeological sites related to Pandu <unk> <unk> of <unk> remains are located in Birbhum . Stone age implements have been found at several places in the district . 
 According to the old Jain book Acaranga Sutra , the last ( 24th ) great Tirthankara Mahavira had wandered through this land , referred to as the " pathless country of <unk> in Vajjabhumi and <unk> ( probably <unk> ) " in the 5th century , B.C. According to some historians , the spread of Jainism and Buddhism in the Rarh region was part of the process of <unk> of the area . Based on <unk> , a Buddhist text , Dr. Atul Sur has inferred that Gautam Buddha probably traversed this area to go to <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Rarh region , once a part of the Maurya empire was later included in the empires of the imperial Guptas , Shashanka and Harshavardhana . After dismemberment of Harshavardhana ’ s empire , the region was ruled by the Palas till 12th century AD , when overlordship of the area passed into the hands of the <unk> . During the rule of the Pala dynasty Buddhism , particularly the Vajrayana cult , flourished here . In 7th century A.D. , the Chinese traveller Xuanzang described some of the monasteries he visited . 
 = = = Medieval age = = = 
 The 13th century witnessed the advent of Muslim rule in the region . However , control over the western parts of the district appears to have been nominal , and the area was ruled by the local Hindu chiefs , known as the Bir Rajas . The three towns of Hetampur , <unk> and Rajnagar contain their relics . Hetampur and Rajnagar Kingdoms ruled most of Birbhum and parts of Burdwan , <unk> and Jharkhand from Dubrajpur ( meaning two kingdoms - Hetampur & Rajnagar ) . Minhaj @-@ i @-@ Siraj , the author of the <unk> @-@ i @-@ Nasiri , mentions <unk> as the <unk> ( headquarters ) of the Rarh wing of the Muslim rule and an important frontier post . The location of <unk> , though not yet identified , falls in Birbhum . 
 Mythology has it that the forests of Vajjabhumi ( west Birbhum ) were hot @-@ spots of Hindu and tantric activities . Some authors have called Birbhum by the name <unk> which relates to its tantric heritage . Tantrics , including the Vajrayana , the Shaktas , and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship . Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith , Bakreshwar , <unk> , <unk> near Labhpur , Sainthia and Nalhati . One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was <unk> , popularly known as Bama <unk> .

 During the time of British East India Company , the administrative unit by the name Birbhum was formed in 1787 . Before that , it was administratively a part of Murshidabad district . In 1787 , when the official " District <unk> " was established , the district was much bigger than it is now . Till 1793 , it included " <unk> " or <unk> , which is now part of the <unk> district . Till the 1857 Sepoy Mutiny , the Santhal Parganas was part of Birbhum ; the district thus sprawled up to <unk> in the west . The immediate reason then for separating the western tribal majority areas was the Santhal rebellion of 1855 – 56 , which was quelled . Sidhu and Kanu are remembered in Birbhum as martyrs of this uprising .

 = Timetoget = 
 Timetoget <unk> AS , trading as Timetoget ( " the Hourly Train " ) , is a defunct railway company that tried to start operating passenger trains on the Bratsberg Line in Norway . The concept was launched in 1998 , and in 1999 an agreement was made with the incumbent , Norwegian State Railways ( NSB ) , to start operation in 2000 . The founders were <unk> Jamtveit and Halvor Grene , while NSB owned a third of the company . The company bought three used Y1 railcars from Sweden . 
 NSB soon bought all the shares of the company , and also made an agreement that operations on the Arendal Line would be taken over by Timetoget . However , the new company tried to take a short @-@ cut in giving engineers only a six @-@ week training program , instead of the usual 18 months . This made NSB want to discontinue operations . They bought out the rest of the shareholders , and liquidated the company . Timetoget never ran anything but trials on the Bratsberg Line . 
 = = Establishment = = 
 The company was owned by NSB ( 34 % ) , two individuals from Notodden , <unk> Jamtveit and Halvor Grene ( 51 % ) , Telemark County Municipality and some municipalities ( 15 % ) . The trains would operate with a one @-@ hour headway , twenty @-@ four hours a day . It was the first private company allowed to operate passenger trains since the amalgamation of operations into the Norwegian State Railways . The concept was based on <unk> , an hourly coach service between Notodden and Oslo , that was operated by the Jamtveit and Grene @-@ owned <unk> @-@ Telemark <unk> . The company bought three used Y1 diesel railcars from SJ of Sweden , despite that the Bratsberg Line is electrified . The trains cost NOK 6 million each , and have a capacity of 70 passengers . 
 Initial plans called for operations to commence on 1 January 2000 , but this soon proved difficult . In November , NSB paid out the other major shareholders , and were left with an 89 % ownership of the company . The company needed dispensation from the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority to allow temporary employments of engineers . When the company had announced the positions , only one engineer had applied for the twelve jobs . Instead an agreement was made with NSB to rent personnel , thus delaying the start until 3 September . But because the engineers needed to be recertified , the start was delayed again , to 5 November . In the end , Timetoget was forced to recruit and train new drivers . It received criticism for not having as extensive training as NSB , but the company stated that this would not affect safety . The labor union recommended its members not to apply for jobs with Timetoget , since they did not provide a pension agreement , collective bargaining or guarantees to return to NSB , should the concept fail . 
 In August , twelve engineers were hired on contract with Baneservice , at the time a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration . The engineers were subsequently re @-@ certified for the Y1 class , as well as being given a service course . While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18 @-@ month course , Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six @-@ week course . Arne Wam , chief executive officer of NSB , stated that he could not permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in such a way , and announced he would stop operations . 
 In August 2000 , Timetoget offered Telemark County Municipality to take over the transport of school children between <unk> Station and <unk> Station . In September , the company also started negotiations with NSB to take over services on the Arendal Line , but it was stated that this was not excepted by NSB . 
 = = Disestablishment = = 
 The first trial with the Y1 railcars was performed on 1 August 2000 . The one unit was not able to complete the route due to technical problems , but the other train was able to . Terje <unk> , the CEO of Timetoget , stated that he was aiming for 140 @,@ 000 passengers in 2001 , but was worried because NSB , due to lack of engineers , was driving passengers with by taxi between Notodden Station and <unk> . On 5 October , Vidar <unk> , vice president in NSB and chairman of Timetoget , announced that NSB , due to lack of engineers , would have to reduce the production of train services . He indicated that the least profitable routes , including the Bratsberg Line , would be closed . At the same time , NSB said one possibility could be that they sold their 89 % stake in the company , thereby bypassing NSB 's rules for engineer training . Five days later , the engineers in NSB stated that they would not operate trains between Larvik Station and Skien , and Kongsberg Station and Bø Station , if Timetoget was allowed to operate . These sections of the Vestfold Line and Sørlandet Line , respectively , are shared with the Bratsberg Line . The engineers considered lack of sufficient training such a safety risk that it would not be secure to operate on the lines . At the same time , NSB announced that they would stop operating trains on the Bratsberg Line from 20 October . 
 Timetoget started negotiations with the Swedish company BK Tåg to try to establish a cooperation that would allow Swedish engineers to be used . At the same time , the minority shareholders , who owned 11 % of the company , demanded that they could take over NSB 's shares without compensation , and that all debt to NSB be deleted . Arne Wam responded by stating that NSB wanted to liquidate the company . NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value , despite the company not having any net assets . 
 By 2 November , all owners , except the two environmental organizations the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth , had sold their shares to NSB . The two environmental organizations owned 7 of 40 @,@ 000 shares of the company . At the general meeting the same day , the company was liquidated , even though the two organizations opposed . Prior to the meeting , the other minority owners had held a tactics meeting to discuss what to do . Several municipalities were concerned that they would lose even more money if they did not sell . The other minority owners agreed to cover the costs of the two environmental organizations , and let them make the principal stand to oppose the liquidation . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By 14 November , the concept had been approved by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate . Following the announcement , Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service , and use the Timetoget concept . An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with the labor unions , and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy the labor unions . Minister of Transport , Terje Moe <unk> from the Labour Party , stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark , that he would allow a new private company , without NSB ownership , to operate the line . 
 In January 2001 , Connex Norge offered to purchase Timetoget from NSB , and start operations . However , by February , Connex had changed their mind , and no longer wanted to purchase the company . Terje <unk> admitted that Timetoget had a very good agreement for operating the Arendal Line , and that a fourth Y1 railcar had been bought from Sweden for this route . However , when NSB had tried to sell Timetoget , this agreement was not part of the estate . By April , NSB estimated that they had lost NOK 10 million on their engagement in Timetoget . However , they had three Y1 trains , and would be able to start using them on the Bratsberg Line and the Arendal Line .

 Mathers was born on October 17 , 1972 , in St. Joseph , Missouri . He is the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers , Jr . ( born June 30 , 1951 , known as Bruce ) and Deborah Rae Nelson ( born January 6 , 1955 , and known as Debbie ) . Eminem is of English , German , Scottish and Swiss descent . Debbie was 14 when she met 18 @-@ year @-@ old Bruce ; at age 17 , she nearly died during her 73 @-@ hour labor . Eminem 's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks , playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas @-@ Montana border before their separation . Bruce left the family , moving to California and having two other children : Michael and Sarah ( born c . 1982 ) . Debbie later had a son , Nathan Kane Samara , born February 3 , 1986 also known as Nate . During his childhood Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Missouri and Michigan , rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members . In Missouri they lived in several places , including Saint Joseph , Savannah and Kansas City . As a teenager , Eminem wrote letters to his father ; according to Debbie , all came back marked " Return to sender . " Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child , but " a bit of a loner " who was often bullied . One bully , De 'Angelo Bailey , severely injured Eminem in the head ; Debbie Nelson filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982 , which was dismissed the following year . 
 Eminem spent much of his youth in a lower @-@ middle @-@ class , primarily black Detroit neighborhood . He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block , and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times . As a child he was interested in storytelling , aspiring to be a comic @-@ book artist before discovering hip hop . Eminem heard his first rap song ( " Reckless " , featuring Ice @-@ T ) on the Breakin ' soundtrack , a gift from Debbie 's half @-@ brother Ronnie <unk> , who later became a music mentor to him . When <unk> committed suicide in 1991 , Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral . 
 Eminem 's home life was seldom stable ; he frequently fought with his mother , whom a social worker described as having a " very suspicious , almost paranoid personality " . When her son became famous , Debbie bristled at suggestions that she was a less @-@ than @-@ ideal mother contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success . In 1987 , Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann " Kim " Scott to stay at their home ; several years later , Eminem began an on @-@ and @-@ off relationship with Scott . After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades , he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17 . Although he was interested in English , he never explored literature ( preferring comic books ) and disliked math and social studies . Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills , later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway . When she left to play bingo , he would blast the stereo and write songs . 
 At age 14 , he began rapping with high @-@ school friend Mike Ruby ; they adopted the names " <unk> " and " M & M , " the latter of which evolved into " Eminem " . Eminem snuck into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles . On Saturdays they attended open @-@ mic contests at the Hip @-@ Hop Shop on West 7 Mile , considered ground @-@ zero for the Detroit rap scene . Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry , Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences . When he wrote verses , he wanted most of the words to rhyme ; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and , underneath , worked on rhymes for each syllable . Although the words often made little sense , the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes . 
 = = = 1992 – 99 : Early career , Infinite , and The Slim Shady LP = = = 
 As Eminem 's reputation grew , he was recruited by several rap groups ; the first was the New Jacks . After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent , who released a single on their 1995 self @-@ titled EP featuring Proof . Eminem and Proof then teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen ( D12 ) , who released their first album Devil 's Night in 2001 . Eminem had his first run @-@ in with the law at age 20 , when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive @-@ by shooting with a paintball gun . The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court . 
 Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass 's <unk> Productions , and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label . One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter , Hailie Jade Scott Mathers , on little money . During this period Eminem 's rhyming style , primarily inspired by rappers Nas , Esham and AZ , lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known . Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite , and the feedback Eminem did receive ( " Why don 't you go into rock and roll ? " ) led him to craft angrier , moodier tracks . At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime @-@ ridden neighborhood , and their house was robbed several times . Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert 's Lodge , a family @-@ style restaurant at St. Clair Shores . His former boss described him as becoming a model employee , as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie 's birth . He was fired shortly before Christmas , and later said , " It was , like , five days before Christmas , which is Hailie 's birthday . I had , like , forty dollars to get her something . " After the release of Infinite , his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt . By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert 's Lodge for the last time , and lived in his mother 's mobile home with Kim and Hailie . 
 Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady , a sadistic , violent alter ego . The character , " a drug @-@ dealing , bloodthirsty thug who spits furious rhymes about murder , rape , drugs and living by the law of the urban jungle " , allowed him to express his anger . In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP , the Slim Shady EP , which was released that winter by Web Entertainment . The EP , with frequent references to drug use , sexual acts , mental instability and violence , also explored the more @-@ serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct , self @-@ deprecating response to criticism . Hip @-@ hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its " Unsigned Hype " column in March 1998 . 
 After he was evicted from his home , Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics , an annual , nationwide battle rap competition . He placed second , and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine . Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre , founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip @-@ hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled , " In my entire career in the music industry , I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD . When Jimmy played this , I said , ' Find him . Now . ' " Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper , he was confident in his decision : " I don 't give a fuck if you 're purple ; if you can kick it , I 'm working with you . " Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A as a teenager , and was nervous about working with him on an album : " I didn 't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I 'm just a little white boy from Detroit . I had never seen stars , let alone Dr. Dre . " He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions . 
 Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999 . Although it was one of the year 's most popular albums ( certified triple platinum by the end of the year ) , he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage . The album 's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics ; in " ' 97 Bonnie and Clyde " Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife 's body , and in " Guilty Conscience " which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover . Guilty Conscience marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem . The label @-@ mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs ( " Forgot About Dre " and " What 's the Difference " from Dr. Dre 's album 2001 , " Bitch Please II " from The Marshall Mathers LP , " Say What You Say " from The Eminem Show , " Encore / Curtains Down " from Encore , and " Old Time 's Sake " and " Crack a Bottle " from Relapse ) , and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem 's Aftermath albums . The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA .

 The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000 . It sold 1 @,@ 760 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg 's Doggystyle for fastest @-@ selling hip hop album and Britney Spears ' ... Baby One More Time for fastest @-@ selling solo album . The first single from the album , " The Real Slim Shady " , was a success despite controversies about Eminem 's insults and dubious claims about celebrities ( for example , that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly ) . In his second single , " The Way I Am " , he reveals the pressure from his record company to top " My Name Is " . Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for " My Name Is " , they are reportedly on good terms ; Manson is mentioned in " The Way I Am " , appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem . In the third single , " Stan " ( which samples Dido 's " Thank You " ) Eminem tries to deal with his new fame , assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend ( mirroring " ' 97 Bonnie & Clyde " from The Slim Shady LP ) . Q magazine called " Stan " the third @-@ greatest rap song of all time , and it was ranked tenth in a <unk> @-@ <unk> survey . The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone magazine 's " 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " list . In July 2000 , Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source magazine . The Marshall Mathers LP has been certified 11 × platinum by the RIAA . 
 Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001 , with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD , an organization which considered Eminem 's lyrics homophobic ) condemning John 's decision to perform with Eminem . Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end @-@ of @-@ decade " best @-@ of " list : " It was the hug heard ' round the world . Eminem , under fire for homophobic lyrics , shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of " Stan " that would have been memorable in any context . " On February 21 , the day of the awards ceremony , GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center ( the ceremony 's venue ) . In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre , Snoop Dogg , Xzibit and Ice Cube and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit , headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach , Ludacris and Xzibit . 
 The Eminem Show was released in May 2002 . It was another success , reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1 @.@ 332 million copies during its first full week . The album 's single , " Without Me " , denigrates boy bands , Limp Bizkit , Dick and Lynne Cheney , Moby and others . The Eminem Show ( certified 10 × platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ) examines the effects of the rapper 's rise to fame , his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip @-@ hop community , addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000 . Although several tracks are clearly angry , Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP . L. Brent Bozell III , who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics , noted The Eminem Show 's extensive use of obscenity and called the rapper " <unk> " for the prevalence of the word " motherfucker " on the album . The Eminem Show was the best @-@ selling album of 2002 .

 On December 8 , 2003 , the United States Secret Service said that it was " looking into " allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States . The cause for concern was the lyrics of " We As Americans " ( " Fuck money / I don 't rap for dead presidents / I 'd rather see the president dead / It 's never been said , but I set precedents " ) , which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore . 
 Encore , released in 2004 , was another success . Its sales were partially driven by the first single , " Just Lose It " , which contained slurs about Michael Jackson . On October 12 , 2004 , a week after the release of " Just Lose It " , Jackson phoned the Los Angeles @-@ based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video ( which parodies Jackson 's child molestation trial , plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson 's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial ) . In the song Eminem says , " That 's not a stab at Michael / That 's just a metaphor / I 'm just psycho " . Many of Jackson 's friends and supporters spoke out against the video , including Stevie Wonder ( who described it as " kicking a man while he 's down " and " bullshit " ) and Steve Harvey ( who said , " Eminem has lost his ghetto pass . We want the pass back " ) . The video also parodied Pee @-@ wee Herman , MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period . " Weird Al " Yankovic , who parodied the Eminem song " Lose Yourself " on " Couch Potato " for his 2003 album Poodle Hat , told the Chicago Sun @-@ Times about Jackson 's protest : " Last year , Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my ' Lose Yourself ' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career . So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me . " Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video , MTV announced that it would continue to air it . The Source , through CEO Raymond " <unk> " Scott , called for the video to be pulled , the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson . In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom , giving him the rights to songs by Eminem , Shakira , Beck and others . 
 Despite its lead single 's humorous theme , Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti @-@ war song " Mosh " . The song criticized President George W. Bush as " This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president " , with lyrics including " Fuck Bush " . On October 25 , 2004 , a week before the 2004 US Presidential election , Eminem released the video for " Mosh " on the Internet . In it , Eminem gathers an army ( including rapper Lloyd Banks ) of Bush @-@ administration victims and leads them to the White House . When they break in , it is learned that they are there to register to vote ; the video ends with " <unk> Tuesday November 2 " . After Bush 's reelection , the video 's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president . 
 In 2005 , industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several multi @-@ platinum albums . Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year , entitled The Funeral ; the greatest hits album , entitled Curtain Call : The Hits , was released in December . In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer , quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive . The day of Curtain Call : The Hits 's release , Eminem appeared on <unk> 's " Mojo in the Morning " show . Denying that he was retiring , he suggested he would take a break as an artist : " I 'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don 't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it ' Curtain Call ' , because this could be the final thing . We don 't know . " The following year , Eminem released Eminem Presents : The Re @-@ Up on Shady Records . 
 In 2005 the rapper was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg 's book , 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America . Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times , in which Herbert wrote " In Eminem 's world , all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them " , and the song " No One 's Iller " from the Slim Shady EP as examples of the rapper 's misogyny . That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years , with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent , G @-@ Unit , Lil Jon , D12 , Obie Trice and The Alchemist . In August he canceled the European leg of the tour , later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a " dependency on sleep medication " . Curtain Call : The Hits was released December 6 , 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment . During its first week it sold nearly 441 @,@ 000 copies in the US , and was Eminem 's fourth consecutive number @-@ one album on the Billboard Hot 200 . The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA . 
 In September 2007 Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent , saying that he was " in limbo " and " debating " about when ( or if ) he would release another album : " I 'm always working – I 'm always in the studio . It feels good right now , the energy of the label . For a while , I didn 't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things . I 'm coming out of those personal things [ and ] it feels good . "

 Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008 , saying : " Right now I 'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff , for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff . You know , the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get ' cause I just start knowing stuff . " Interscope confirmed that a new album would be released in spring 2009 . In December 2008 the rapper provided a few more details about the album , entitled Relapse : " Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days , man . Dre will end up producing the majority of the tracks on ' Relapse ' . We are up to our old mischievous ways ... let 's just leave it at that . " 
 According to a March 5 , 2009 press release , Eminem would release two new albums that year . Relapse , the first , was released on May 19 ; its first single and music video , " We Made You " , had been released on April 7 . Although Relapse did not sell as well as the rapper 's previous albums , it was a commercial success which received positive reviews and re @-@ established his presence in the hip @-@ hop world . Relapse was named one of the top albums of 2009 , and has sold more than five million copies worldwide . During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards , Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume . He landed buttocks @-@ first on Eminem , who stormed out of the ceremony ; three days later , the rapper said that the stunt had been staged . On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans , his first full performance of the year . Eminem 's act included several songs from Relapse , many of his older hits and an appearance by D12 . On November 19 , he announced on his website that Relapse : Refill would be released on December 21 . The album was a re @-@ release of Relapse with seven bonus tracks , including " Forever " and " Taking My Ball " . Eminem described the CD : 
 I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers , including Just Blaze , and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch . The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2 , but I still want the other stuff to be heard . 
 = = = 2010 – 11 : Recovery and Bad Meets Evil reunion = = = 
 On April 14 , 2010 , Eminem tweeted : " There is no Relapse 2 " . Although his followers thought he was not releasing an album , he had changed its title to Recovery and confirmed this by tweeting " <unk> " with a link to his website . According to the rapper : 
 I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year . But as I kept recording and working with new producers , the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me , and I wanted to make a completely new album . The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse , and I think it deserves its own title . 
 His seventh album was released on June 18 . In the US Recovery sold 741 @,@ 000 copies during its first week , topping the Billboard 200 chart .

While he was recording Infinite , Eminem , Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12 , short for " Detroit Twelve " or " Dirty Dozen " , who performed in a style similar to Wu @-@ Tang Clan . In 2001 D12 's debut album , Devil 's Night , was released . The first single from the album was " Shit on You " , followed by " Purple Pills " ( an ode to recreational drug use ) and " Fight Music " .

In this persona his songs are violent and dark , with a comic twist . Eminem downplayed Slim Shady on Recovery because he felt it did not fit the album 's theme . Another character is Ken Kaniff , a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem 's songs . Ken was created and originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle on the Slim Shady LP , where Kaniff makes a prank call to Eminem .

 Eminem is considered unusual in structuring his songs around the lyrics , rather than writing to beats . One exception was " Stan " , which came from an idea and scratch track produced by the 45 King . After doing little production on Relapse and Recovery , Eminem produced a significant portion of The Marshall Mathers LP 2 . He said about producing his own music , " Sometimes , I may get something in my head , like an idea or the mood of something that I would want , and I 'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made . They don 't know what 's in my head . I think maybe it helps , a little bit , with diversity , the sound of it , but also , I would get something in my head and want to be able to lay down that idea from scratch . "

In November 2013 , Hotstylz released a diss track towards Eminem titled " Rap Fraud " , where they sample several of his songs and criticize him for not crediting them . In January 2015 , TMZ reported Hotstylz were suing the rapper and his label , Shady Records , for the amount of $ 8 million , for using the 25 second sample of " Lookin ' Boy " on his song " Rap God " , without their permission .

 Eminem has spoken about his addiction to prescription drugs , including Vicodin , Ambien and Valium . According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof , Eminem first " sobered up " in 2002 . During the production of 8 Mile , the rapper , working 16 hours a day , developed insomnia . An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which " knocked [ him ] out " , encouraging him to obtain a prescription . This was Eminem 's first experience of drug addiction , which would affect him for several years . Near the end of production on Encore , he would " just go into the studio and goof off [ with ] a <unk> of pills " . Eminem began taking the drugs to " feel normal " , taking a " ridiculous amount [ ... ] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [ in a day ] . Vicodin , maybe 30 " . The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours , after which he would take more . The rapper 's weight increased to 230 pounds ( 100 kg ) , and he was regularly eating fast food : " The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn 't even faze them . Or I 'd sit up at Denny 's or Big Boy and just eat by myself . It was sad " . Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain , and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was he : " Eminem ain 't fat . " 
 His struggle with drugs climaxed with a December 2007 methadone overdose . Eminem had first bought methadone from a dealer who had told him it was " just like Vicodin , and easier on [ your ] liver " . The rapper continued to buy more , until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital . Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was " about two hours from dying " . After missing Christmas with his children , Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully <unk> . When he tore his meniscus " after falling asleep for literally 10 minutes , " he had surgery ; after he came home he had a seizure and relapsed within three weeks . Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean , but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor . He began an exercise program which emphasized running , and became sober on April 20 , 2008 . Elton John was a mentor during this period , calling Eminem once a week to check on him .

 Some of Eminem 's lyrics have been considered homophobic , and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country . Eminem denies the charge , saying that when he was growing up words such as " faggot " and " queer " were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals . During a 60 Minutes interview , journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue : 
 Cooper : Some of the lyrics , like , you know , in the song " Criminal " you say " My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge , That 'll stab you in the head , whether you 're a fag or lez , Or the <unk> , <unk> or a trans @-@ a @-@ vest , Pants or dress — hate fags ? The answer 's ' yes ' " . 
 Eminem : Yeah , this scene I came up in . That word was thrown around so much , you know , " faggot " was like thrown around constantly to each other , like in battling . 
 Cooper : Do you not like gay people ? 
 Eminem : No , I don 't have any problem with nobody . You know what I mean ? I 'm just like whatever . 
 The rapper is a friend of Elton John . When asked his opinion in a New York Times interview of the legalization of same @-@ sex marriage in Michigan , Eminem replied : " I think if two people love each other , then what the hell ? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable , if they want " , adding that his " overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be " . 
 Several years later , Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics , and explained " I don 't know how to say this without saying it how I 've said it a million times . But that word , those kind of words , when I came up battle @-@ <unk> ' or whatever , I never really equated those words ... "

 = The Entombment ( Bouts ) = 
 The Entombment is a glue @-@ size painting on linen attributed to the Early Netherlandish painter Dieric Bouts . It shows a scene from the biblical entombment of Christ , and was probably completed between 1440 and 1455 as a wing panel for a large hinged polyptych altarpiece . The now @-@ lost altarpiece is thought to have contained a central crucifixion scene flanked by four wing panel works half its height – two on either side – depicting scenes from the Life of Christ . The smaller panels would have been paired in a format similar to Bouts ' 1464 – 67 Altar of the Holy Sacrament . The larger work was probably commissioned for export to Italy , possibly to a Venetian patron whose identity is lost . The Entombment was first recorded in a mid @-@ 19th century Milan inventory and has been in the National Gallery , London since its purchase on the gallery 's behalf by Charles Lock Eastlake in 1861 . 
 The painting is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief . It shows four female and three male mourners grieving over the body of Christ . They are , from left to right , Nicodemus , Mary Salome , Mary of Clopas , Mary , the mother of Jesus , John the Evangelist , Mary Magdalene and Joseph of Arimathea . 
 It is one of the few surviving 15th @-@ century paintings created using glue @-@ size , an extremely fragile medium lacking durability . The Entombment is in relatively poor condition compared to panel paintings of similar age . Its colours are now far duller than when it was painted ; they would , however , always have appeared as less intense and brilliant than those of comparable oil or tempera paintings on panel . The painting is covered by accumulated layers of grey dirt and cannot be cleaned without damaging the surface and removing large amounts of pigment as its glue @-@ size medium is water @-@ soluble . A strip at the top has been less affected than the rest because it was protected by a frame . 
 = = Painting = = 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The Entombment shows Christ 's body , wrapped in a white linen shroud and still wearing a crown of thorns , as it is lowered into a deep stone tomb . He is attended by seven mourners dressed in contemporary clothing . Among the group of mourners standing at Christ 's side , the three female figures are shown with downcast eyes while the two men look directly at Christ ; these gazes are reversed with the couple kneeling at his feet . The background contains a wide landscape with a winding pathway and a broad river before a more distant vista of trees and hills . Bouts is considered an innovative painter of landscapes , even in his portrait work where they are included as distant views seen through open windows . The vista in The Entombment is regarded as one of his finest , and is typically composed of distant brown and green hills against a blue sky . 
 The Pharisee Nicodemus supports Christ as he is lowered , and can be identified by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts , Christ in the House of Simon . The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle , and holds Christ 's arm just above his wrist as if afraid to let go of her dead son . She is supported by John the Evangelist , who wears a red robe . Dressed in green robes , Mary Salome stands to the Virgin 's left , wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress . Mary of Clopas is behind them , holding a red cloth over her mouth , while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ 's feet , dressed in a heavily folded cloak . The man in the brown – green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea , who , according to Gospel , brought Christ 's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate . 
 The Entombment is painted on linen tightly woven with 20 to 22 vertical and between 19 and 22 horizontal threads per centimetre . The cloth is Z @-@ spun ( tightly spun ) and tabby woven with flax perhaps combined with cotton . The cloth support is lined , unusually , with similar but more finely woven linen mounted on a wooden stretcher . Before the paint was applied , the linen was first mounted on a temporary stretcher and outlined with a brown border – now visible on the lower border – which was used as a guide to cut the picture down before framing . Glue @-@ sizing consists of creating a distemper by mixing pigments in water and then using a glue @-@ base derived from boiled animal skin and other tissues as a binder . The pigments were applied to a linen cloth , treated with the same glue sizing , fixed in turn to its frame by glue . The paint saturated the cloth , often leaving an image on the reverse side , which was lined with an additional cloth . 
 Pigments bound in glue had an optical quality that rendered them opaque in appearance and unusually vivid . Unlike oil , which makes chalk appear translucent , chalk mixed in glue is rendered as stark white . Similarly , more expensive pigments assume brilliant opacity in a glue medium . The whites are chalk in areas mixed with lead white , especially in the Magdalen 's mantle and veil , Christ 's shroud and the Virgin 's veil . The artist used four blue pigments , an unusual number for paintings of the period , with indigo predominating . As a plant @-@ derived pigment , indigo it has a tendency to fade over time . Azurite and lead @-@ white line the under @-@ paint , while the landscape contains indigo mixed with lead @-@ tin yellow . The sky and Nicodemus ' collar are painted with lighter and less intense azurite , while the Virgin 's dress is azurite mixed with ultramarine and smalt , a blue ground @-@ glass pigment . The Entombment is one of the earliest Western pictorial works of art in which the use of smalt could be ascertained and its presence proves that the pigment was not invented during the sixteenth century , as had previously been believed . 
 The greens are mostly verdigris , although those predominant in the landscape are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments , and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake . The browns are blends of reds and blacks . John 's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from <unk> and insect dyes . Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible to the effects of light , and have thus survived close to their original appearance . The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal . The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas , producing a red to brownish ' earthy ' appearance . 
 The cloth support is visible in areas where the paint was thinly applied . Rusty nail holes can be seen in the lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was initially covered by frame . They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended ; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional <unk> who worked independently of the painter . The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light ; they are preserved as first laid down . The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails ; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame . 
 = = = Condition = = = 
 Painting on linen cloth using glue size as a binder was at the time a relatively inexpensive alternative to oil , and a large number of works were produced in the 15th century . Glue size does not saturate the pigments as much as oil , allowing them to show as matt and opaque , giving – especially with reds and blues – an intense appearance when applied to cloth . Cloth is fragile and perishes easily , and this work is one of the best preserved of the few surviving examples of the technique from the period ; the majority extant today were executed on wood using oil or egg tempera . Curtains or glass were often used to protect glue @-@ sized works . 
 The colours would have first appeared bright and crisp , but over five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half centuries the painting has acquired layers of grey dirt which darken the tone and render the colours faint and pallid . Normally these layers of dirt would be removed by restorers , but given the delicate and fragile nature of a work painted in a water @-@ soluble medium , it is impossible to do so without removing large amounts of pigment . The colours as they appear today have faded from their original hues . The Virgin 's mantle is now brown but would have been painted as blue . Joseph 's tabard , once blue , now appears as green . The original <unk> of the landscape are lost , while the azurite in Nicodemus 's collar has darkened . 
 It is possible to see the degree to which the technique allowed Bouts , in the words of art historian Susan Jones , to " [ achieve such ] sophistication ... to create both fine linear detail and subtle tonal transitions . " Jones notes that the sky would have appeared with the same clear and pale blue that is still intact in a narrow strip along the top of the work , which has been protected from light and dirt by a frame . In its current condition the muted landscape appears to echo the sorrow of the mourning figures . 
 X @-@ ray analysis shows that there were a few preparatory drawings made with chalk before the paint was applied . This is left exposed in some areas , most noticeably in the Virgin 's veil and mantle and in Christ 's shroud . Infrared photography reveals little underdrawing but shows that the canvas underwent several changes before it was completed ; Mary Salome was repositioned slightly to the left , the sizes of Nicodemus ' arm and shoulder were reduced , and the Magdalen 's face was painted over the Virgin 's mantle . 
 The cloth on which the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and <unk> , probably by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece . It was placed under glass , probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery ( Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858 ) . The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron . The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support . The row of rust @-@ stained nail holes running along the top of the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field , at a point far lower than Bouts had intended . This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Charles Eastlake saw the work in 1858 and again in 1860 during visits to Milan to purchase Northern Renaissance art on behalf of the National Gallery . He also viewed three companion pieces but was told they were not on sale . His notes described each of these other works , which he titled : Annunciation ( now in the J. Paul Getty Museum ) , Adoration of the Kings ( now in a private collection in Germany ) and Presentation ( or Resurrection ; now in the Norton Simon Museum , Pasadena , California ) . These works are the same size as The Entombment , have similar colouring and pigmentation and are painted using the same glue @-@ size technique , but are not as well preserved . It is probable that all were re @-@ lined and stretched at the same time by the same restorer , indicating that they were kept together until shortly before The Entombment was acquired by the National Gallery . 
 Art historian Robert Koch remarked in 1988 on the similarity of provenance , material , technique , tone and colour of the four works described by Eastlake . He proposed that they were intended as wings of a five @-@ part polyptych altarpiece . Based on the format of Bouts ' 1464 – 67 Altar of Holy Sacrament , whose four wing panels are the same length as The Entombment , he believes the altarpiece would have comprised a large central panel with four works half its length and width positioned two at either side . His speculative reconstruction places The Entombment on the upper right @-@ hand wing , above the Adoration . 
 The large centre canvas has not been positively identified . However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion , now in the Musées <unk> des Beaux @-@ Arts , Brussels , was probably the centrepiece . Its size ( 181 × 153 @.@ 5 cm ) is exactly double that of the four wing panels . Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export , most likely to Venice . The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works had fallen out of fashion by the 17th century , and would have had more value as single panels . 
 = = Provenance and attribution = = 
 Bouts did not inscribe any of his paintings , which makes attribution and dating difficult . His developing skill with perspective and unified vanishing points is used by art historians to date his works from the period . Although its colourisation is among the best of his work , the perspective is clumsy in areas , thus the painting can be assumed to date no later than 1460 . Bouts often quoted visual passages from artists and paintings that influenced his work , so the influences are well established and datable . Along with the companion Resurrection , British art historian Martin Davies believes the work shows influences from Rogier van der Weyden 's Descent ( c . 1435 ) and Miraflores Altarpiece ( 1440s ) , which places it after 1440 . Robert Koch dates it to between 1450 and 1455 . 
 During a period of aggressive acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of Britain 's collection , it was acquired for the National Gallery in 1860 in Milan from the <unk> family by Charles Lock Eastlake for just over £ 120 , along with a number of other Netherlandish works . Eastlake 's notes mention that the works were " originally in the possession of the Foscari family " . The <unk> were a wealthy Venetian family which included Francesco Foscari who was Doge of Venice at the time the work was painted ; the dramatic story of him and his son is told in Lord Byron 's play The Two Foscari , and Verdi 's opera I due Foscari . There is no documentary evidence to substantiate the claim that the painting came from the Foscari collection , and some art historians believe that representatives of the <unk> invented this provenance to impress Eastlake . Lorne Campbell considers the provenance " probable " , noting that a descendant , <unk> Foscari ( 1732 – 1811 ) , an ambassador to Saint Petersburg , squandered his fortune and may have been forced into selling pictures belonging to the family . Campbell speculates that the painting was produced on commission for export to Venice , noting that unrolled linen would have been easier to transport than canvas , and that the row of holes just below the upper border could be explained if it had been stretched , mounted and framed by someone other than Bouts or a member of his workshop . 
 The companion pieces in the <unk> collection ( Annunciation , Adoration of the Kings , and Resurrection ) were similar works in glue @-@ size , though of lesser quality ; Eastlake 's notebooks mention that they were " not so good ( not so well preserved ) " . Their style and size are similar to The Entombment , suggesting that they were probably pieces that would have formed part of the larger polyptych . The Entombment was attributed to Lucas van Leyden at the time , though Eastlake thought that , given its emotional power , it might be a van der Weyden . Bouts studied under van der Weyden , and was strongly influenced by his work . Davies proposed in 1953 that the figuration and pose in The Entombment may have been informed by a small grisaille relief in the arch of the central panel of van der Weyden 's Miraflores Altarpiece . 
 The painting arrived in London from Milan in 1861 , but was not attributed to Bouts until 1911 . Two known copies exist : an unsophisticated panel sold in Munich to a private collector in 1934 , and an oak panel attributed to a follower which is in Kreuzlingen , Switzerland . 
 The influence of Netherlandish painting spread to central Europe in the late 15th century , and many copies or designs based on the work of the Netherlandish masters were produced . The influence of Bouts ' Entombment can be seen in the German artist Martin Schongauer 's c . 1480 engraving of the same name ; it not only has compositional similarity but echoes Bouts ' use of emotive gesture , posture and expression .

 Wipeout Pure ( stylised as wipE 'out <unk> ) is a futuristic racing video game developed by Sony Studio Liverpool and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable . It was first released on 24 March 2005 in North America , on 7 April 2005 in Japan and on 1 September 2005 in Europe . It is the sixth instalment of the Wipeout series and was released simultaneously with the launch of the PlayStation Portable . The game takes place in the year 2197 , exactly 100 years after Wipeout 2097 , and revolves around players competing in the <unk> anti @-@ gravity racing league . 
 Developed by Liverpudlian Sony Studio Liverpool ( formerly known as Psygnosis ) , production of Wipeout Pure started in August 2003 and lasted until early 2005 . Throughout development , the team created entirely new user interfaces and other algorithms which sped up the development process in time for the PlayStation Portable 's launch in March 2005 . The game received positive reviews from critics upon release . Reviewers unanimously praised the graphics , track designs and general aesthetics ; however , some noticed occasional framerate fluctuations .

 Wipeout Pure is a racing game which is set in the year 2197 , exactly 100 years after the events of Wipeout 2097 , and revolves around players competing in the <unk> anti @-@ gravity racing league . Players control anti @-@ gravity ships which are owned racing corporations ( effectively referred to as ' teams ' in @-@ game ) . There are a total of eight teams featured in the game , with one ship available for each . Every ship has different characteristics , for example each ship has variations in handling , thrust , maximum speed and shield strength . Each craft is equipped with an energy shield which absorbs damage sustained during a race ; energy is lost whenever the player 's ship collides or is hit by weapons fire . If the shield runs out , the player 's ship will explode and is consequently eliminated from the race . However , the player may replenish energy by absorbing weapon pick @-@ ups . 
 In addition to shielding , each ship has air brakes which can be utilised for navigating through difficult corners at high speed . The game also features several weapons which can be used against opponents , although some weapons have defensive purposes . For example , an auto pilot will give control of the player 's ship over to the computer for a short period of time , and shields can be used to protect the player 's ship from all damage , albeit temporarily . Offensive weapons include rockets , missiles , plasma bolts and mines . Game modes include a single race , tournament , time trail and an exclusive " Zone " mode , which revolves around survival as the player 's ship increasingly accelerates to extreme speeds . The game also features an online multiplayer in addition to downloadable content , which features new ships , tracks and music . 
 = = Development = = 
 Wipeout Pure was developed by Liverpudlian developer Sony Studio Liverpool ( formerly known as Psygnosis ) . Pre @-@ production of the game began in August 2003 and full production occurred in October of that year , with only two staff members working on the game at that time . The team received development kits for the PlayStation Portable in August 2004 ; by this time the development team had grown to twenty people . Dave Burrows , one of the original two staff members who conceptualised the game , reflected in a retrospective " post @-@ mortem " that the studio had to learn from their previous mistakes with their predecessor , Wipeout Fusion . Burrows cited that one of the principal difficulties the development team faced was that the team 's artists and designers were " fighting almost all of the time " ; designers would first design a track for the game , then pass it over to the artists whilst the former were still making adjustments to it . Burrows also recalled that the developer 's editing kits required many hours worth of " tweaking " , which ultimately did not result in a smooth workflow . 
 During development , the team set out to make the game playable for testing as soon as possible . Burrows explained that Studio Liverpool were forced to create an user interface " entirely from scratch " , along with dynamics , artificial intelligence and core elements before testing could commence . Development of each of these aspects were split into six @-@ week cycles ; Burrows stated that instead of the team spending six weeks designing and perfecting all the weapons in @-@ game , the team spent three days designing weapons individually rather than simultaneously . Burrows recalled that whilst developing Wipeout Fusion , Studio Liverpool found that half of their time was being " soaked up " by building a user interface for their editor . As the team knew that Wipeout Pure would have to be shipped out in time for the PlayStation Portable 's release , the decision was made to create create new plugins for their software , Autodesk Maya , in order to save time during development . 
 After creating custom plugins for the 3D computer graphics software , Burrows claimed that the team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes . The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file , which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence , effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes . In order to the play the game as soon as possible , the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language , which allowed revisions to be made for the content at any time . However , Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable 's Universal Media Disc . The game 's cover art was designed by <unk> , who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports . 
 In order to showcase the PlayStation Portable 's capabilities , the team had to develop a download system that could provide the game with future downloadable content , which included new tracks , music and ships . In addition , Burrows realised that new downloadable content had the potential to bring in more revenue for Studio Liverpool . In order to achieve this , the team had to find a way to bypass the problems involved in getting the PlayStation Portable to recognise download files . The solution required the use of piggybacking game data to a valid format recognised by the PlayStation Portable ; in which a dummy file would be used on a web @-@ based Java application .

 Wipeout Pure received positive reviews upon release . It holds an aggregate score of 88 % from both Metacritic based on 53 reviews . 
 The graphics were the most praised aspect of the game . Ryan Davis of GameSpot said that the visuals were " gorgeous " and breathtaking to look at , both in ship designs and details of the tracks . However , Davis noted that the game never remains at a " solid " 60 frames per second , which can cause occasional fluctuation . A reviewer of GamePro similarly praised the visuals as breathtaking , stating that the " beautiful " panoramic scenery defied the notion of usual graphics displayed on a handheld console . Ryan O 'Donnell of IGN considered the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game , saying that its courses , weapon detail and ship designs were " beautiful " . However , O 'Donnell found that occasional framerate issues kept it from " perfection " . Daniel Chang of GameSpy opinionated that the visuals were " well @-@ crafted as any video game or feature film " . John Davison of 1UP stated that both the game 's presentation and graphics were stunning and " absolutely beautiful " . A reviewer from Edge similarly praised the aesthetics as " beautiful " and dynamic .

 Critics also viewed various aspects of the gameplay favourably . Davis stated that the high @-@ speed gameplay was " incredibly engaging " and artistic on both a visual and technical level .

 Adam Charles Clayton ( born 13 March 1960 ) is an English @-@ born Irish musician best known as the bass guitarist of the Irish rock band U2 . He has resided in County Dublin since the time his family moved to Malahide when he was five years old in 1965 . Clayton is well known for his bass playing on songs such as " Gloria " , " New Year 's Day " , " Bullet the Blue Sky " , " With or Without You " , " Mysterious Ways " , " Get on Your Boots " , and " Magnificent " . He has worked on several solo projects throughout his career , such as his work with fellow band member Larry Mullen , Jr. on the theme of 1996 's Mission : Impossible . Clayton , as a part of U2 , has won 22 Grammy Awards . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Adam Charles Clayton is the oldest child of Brian and Jo Clayton , born on 13 March 1960 in <unk> , Oxfordshire , England . His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force , who moved into civil aviation , and his mother was a former airline stewardess . When he was 4 years old his father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways , the family being resident in Nairobi ( Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood ) . In 1965 the family moved to Malahide , County Dublin in the Republic of Ireland , where Clayton 's brother Sebastian was born . The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family ( including their son David Evans , who would later become a fellow band @-@ member with Clayton in U2 ) . 
 When he was eight years old he was sent to the private junior boarding Castle Park School in Dalkey , Dublin . He did not enjoy or respond well to its ethos not being particularly sports orientated , and found it difficult to settle socially there , and although he was interested in music the pupils were not allowed to listen to pop music or watch television . He joined the School 's ' <unk> Society ' , which met to listen to classical music . He also took piano lessons for a short time . His introduction to the world of popular music was around the age of 10 , listening to rock operas such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair , and other material that was midway between classical and popular music . 
 At age 13 he entered the private St. Columba 's College secondary school in Rathfarnham , Dublin . Here he made friends with other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop / rock music acts of the period , including The Who , The Beatles , The Grateful Dead , and Carole King . In response he bought a £ 5 acoustic guitar from a junk @-@ shop near the Dublin quays , and began learning elementary chords and songs . John Leslie , who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba 's , persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the bass guitar for the first time . His mother purchased a bass for him when he was 14 years old on the basis of a given promise that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument . 
 He later changed school to Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin , where he met future bandmates , Paul Hewson ( aka " Bono ) " and Larry Mullen Jr . , who were also pupils there , and was reunited with his childhood friend Dave Evans ( aka " The Edge " ) . In September 1976 Mullen put an advert onto the school 's bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band ; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practise , so did David Evans with his older brother Richard ( " Dik " ) , Paul Hewson , and Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin who were two of Mullen 's friends . McCormick and Martin left the band soon after its inception . 
 While the band was a five @-@ piece ( consisting of Bono , The Edge , Mullen , Dik Evans , and Clayton ) it was known as " Feedback " . The name was subsequently changed to " The Hype " , but changed to " U2 " soon after Dik Evans left . Clayton stood in as the nearest thing that the band had to a manager in its early life , handing over the duties to Paul McGuinness in May 1978 . 
 = = U2 = = 
 In 1981 , around the time of U2 's second , spiritually charged album , October , a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness , and the three other band members . Bono , The Edge , and Mullen had joined a Christian group , and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality . However , Clayton , with his more ambiguous religious views , was less concerned , and so was more of an outsider , until Bono 's wedding to Alison Hewson ( née Stewart ) , in which Clayton was the best man . 
 Clayton made international headlines in August 1989 when he was arrested in Dublin for carrying a small amount of marijuana . However , he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity , and has later been regretful , saying " It was my own fault . And I 'm sure I was out of my head – emotionally apart from anything else . But it is serious because it is illegal . " Clayton has also had alcohol problems , which came to a head on 26 November 1993 when he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night 's show in Sydney , the dress rehearsal for their Zoo TV concert film . Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton 's technician Stuart Morgan . After that incident , however , he gave up alcohol . 
 In 1995 , after the Zoo TV Tour and Zooropa album , Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass ; until then Clayton had been entirely self @-@ taught . During that period , he worked on U2 's experimental album , released under the pseudonym " Passengers " , entitled Original Soundtracks 1 . That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist ; he spoke the last verse of " Your Blue Room " , the album 's second single . Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as " Out of Control " , " I Will Follow " , " Twilight " and " Bullet the Blue Sky " . Since 1997 's <unk> tour Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band . In 1996 , while still in New York , Clayton collaborated with Mullen to re @-@ record the Mission : Impossible theme . 
 Clayton remained a bachelor for several decades until his marriage in 2013 . During the early 1990s , he dated British supermodel Naomi Campbell . He also had a long @-@ standing relationship with Suzanne " Susie " Smith , a former assistant to Paul McGuinness ; they were engaged in 2006 , but the pair broke up in February 2007 . According to the Sunday Independent , he fathered a son in 2010 . This was confirmed by Bono while introducing his bandmate during their 360 tour . On 4 September 2013 , Clayton married former human rights lawyer Mariana Teixeira de Carvalho in a ceremony in Dublin . Originally from Brazil , Mariana now works as a director at a leading contemporary art gallery , Michael Werner in London and New York . 
 In 2009 the High Court ordered the assets of Clayton 's former housekeeper and PA be frozen after it was reported that she misappropriated funds of € 1 @.@ 8 million . At the subsequent trial that figure was stated to be € 2 @.@ 8 million . The PA denied the charges but in 2012 was convicted by a jury of 181 counts of theft and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment .

 As a bass player , Adam Clayton 's most recognizable basslines include " New Year 's Day " , which evolved out of an attempt to play Visage 's song " Fade to Grey " , and " With or Without You " . His style includes Motown and reggae influences , and cites artists such as Paul Simonon of The Clash as influences on his musical style . When Clayton first joined the fledgling U2 , he did not have formal training in the bass . In the band 's early years , he generally played simple parts in 4 / 4 time . Bono said of Clayton 's early bass playing , " Adam used to pretend he could play bass . He came round and started using words like ' action ' and ' fret ' and he had us baffled . He had the only amplifier , so we never argued with him . We thought this guy must be a musician ; he knows what he 's talking about . And then one day , we discovered he wasn 't playing the right notes . That 's what 's wrong , y 'know ? " 
 Clayton has sung on several occasion , including on the song " Endless Deep " , the B @-@ side to the single " Two Hearts Beat As One " from 1983 . Clayton also sang backup vocals on " I Will Follow " during live performances in 1983 and 1984 . He also spoke the last verse of " Your Blue Room " . Clayton can be heard speaking on " Tomorrow ( ' 96 Version ) " ( a rerecording of " Tomorrow " that he arranged ) a song from U2 's 1981 album October . He plays the guitar on a few occasions , most notably the song " 40 " , where he and guitarist The Edge switch instruments . He also plays the keyboards on " City of Blinding Lights " and " Iris ( Hold Me Close ) " .

 Throughout his career , Clayton has used both Fender Precision and Jazz basses . His first bass , however , was a dark brown Ibanez . Two years later , at the age of 16 , Clayton got his first Precision , as he felt he needed a better guitar to master the instrument , and asked his father to purchase a second @-@ hand Precision for him when Brian Clayton travelled to New York . He previously used Ashdown amplifiers before switching to Aguilar Amplifiers . Clayton 's Precision basses are modified with a Fender Jazz neck ; in an interview with Bass Player magazine , he said that he prefers the Jazz bass neck because it is more " lady @-@ like " and is a better fit in his left hand . In 2011 the Fender Custom Shop produced a limited @-@ edition signature Precision Bass built to his own specifications in a limited run of 60 pieces , featuring an alder body and a gold sparkle finish .

 = Atomic line filter = 
 An atomic line filter ( ALF ) is an advanced optical band @-@ pass filter used in the physical sciences for filtering electromagnetic radiation with precision , accuracy , and minimal signal strength loss . Atomic line filters work via the absorption or resonance lines of atomic vapors and so may also be designated an atomic resonance filter ( ARF ) . 
 The three major types of atomic line filters are absorption @-@ re @-@ emission ALFs , Faraday filters and Voigt filters . Absorption @-@ re @-@ emission filters were the first type developed , and so are commonly called simply " atomic line filters " ; the other two types are usually referred to specifically as " Faraday filters " or " Voigt filters " . Atomic line filters use different mechanisms and designs for different applications , but the same basic strategy is always employed : by taking advantage of the narrow lines of absorption or resonance in a metallic vapor , a specific frequency of light bypasses a series of filters that block all other light . 
 Atomic line filters can be considered the optical equivalent of lock @-@ in amplifiers ; they are used in scientific applications requiring the effective detection of a narrowband signal ( almost always laser light ) that would otherwise be obscured by broadband sources , such as daylight . They are used regularly in Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging ( LIDAR ) and are being studied for their potential use in laser communication systems . Atomic line filters are superior to conventional dielectric optical filters such as interference filters and Lyot filters , but their greater complexity makes them practical only in background @-@ limited detection , where a weak signal is detected while suppressing a strong background . Compared to etalons , another high @-@ end optical filter , Faraday filters are significantly sturdier and may be six times cheaper at around US $ 15 @,@ 000 per unit . 
 = = History = = 
 The predecessor of the atomic line filter was the infrared quantum counter , designed in the 1950s by Nicolaas <unk> . This was a quantum mechanical amplifier theorized by Joseph Weber to detect infrared radiation with very little noise . Zero spontaneous emission was already possible for x @-@ ray and gamma ray amplifiers and Weber thought to bring this technology to the infrared spectrum . <unk> described such a device in detail and dubbed it the " infrared quantum counter " . 
 The media of these devices were crystals with transition metal ion impurities , absorbing low @-@ energy light and re @-@ emitting it in the visible range . By the 1970s , atomic vapors were used in atomic vapor quantum counters for detection of infrared electromagnetic radiation , as they were found to be superior to the metallic salts and crystals that had been used . 
 The principles hitherto employed in infrared amplification were put together into a passive sodium ALF . This design and those that immediately followed it were primitive and suffered from low quantum efficiency and slow response time . As this was the original design for ALFs , many references use only the designation " atomic line filter " to describe specifically the absorption @-@ re @-@ emission construction . In 1977 , <unk> , Klein and Wessel created the first active atomic line filter . 
 Faraday filters , developed sometime before 1978 , were " a substantial improvement " over absorption @-@ re @-@ emission atomic line filters of the time . The Voigt filter , patented by James H. <unk> and Eric J. <unk> on August 26 , 1992 , was more advanced . Voigt filters were more compact and " [ could ] be easily designed for use with a permanent magnet " . By 1996 , Faraday filters were being used for LIDAR . 
 = = Properties = = 
 A technical definition of an atomic line filter is as an " ultra @-@ narrow @-@ band , large @-@ acceptance @-@ angle , isotropic optical filter " . " Ultra @-@ narrow @-@ band " defines the thin range of frequencies that an ALF may accept ; an ALF generally has a passband on the order of 0 @.@ 001 nanometer . That atomic line filters also have wide acceptance angles ( near 180 ° ) is another important characteristic of the devices ; conventional dielectric filters based on the spacing of reflective or refractive layers change their effective spacing when light enters at an angle . 
 The exact parameters ( temperature , magnetic field strength , length , etc . ) of any filter may be tuned to a specific application . These values are calculated by computers due to the extreme complexity of the systems . 
 = = = Input / output = = = 
 Atomic line filters may operate in the ultraviolet , visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum . In absorption @-@ re @-@ emission ALFs , the frequency of light must be shifted in order for the filter to operate , and in a passive device , this shift must be to a lower frequency ( i.e. red shifted ) simply because of energy conservation . This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light , because the output frequency would be impractically low . If photomultiplier tubes ( <unk> ) are used then the " output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a spectral region in which commercial , large @-@ area , long @-@ lived PMT 's [ sic ] possess maximum sensitivity " . In such a case , active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily , " generate output wavelengths in the near UV , the spectral region in which well @-@ developed <unk> possess their highest sensitivity " . 
 In a passive ALF , the input frequency must correspond almost exactly to the natural absorption lines of the vapor cell . Active <unk> are much more flexible , however , as the vapor may be stimulated so that it will absorb other frequencies of light . 
 Faraday and Voigt filters do not shift the frequency or wavelength of the signal light . 
 = = = Response time and transmission rate = = = 
 The response time of an absorption @-@ re @-@ emission atomic line filter directly affects the rate information is transmitted from the light source to the receiver . Therefore , a minimal response time is an important property of these ALFs . The response time of such an ALF , is largely dependent on the spontaneous decay of the excited atoms in the vapor cell . In 1988 , Jerry <unk> cited , " typical rapid spontaneous emission times are ~ 30 ns , which suggests that the upper limit on the information rate is approximately 30 MHz " . 
 Many methods of decreasing the response time of ALFs have been developed . Even in the late 1980s , certain gases were used to catalyze the decay of the electrons of the vapor cell . In 1989 , Eric <unk> had developed his Fast ALF design which detected emitted fluorescence without photosensitive plates . With such methods employed , gigahertz frequencies are easily attainable . 
 = = = Effectiveness = = = 
 = = = = Efficiency = = = = 
 Atomic line filters are inherently very efficient filters , generally classified as " ultra @-@ high @-@ Q " as their Q factor is in the 105 to 106 range . This is partially because the , " crossed polarizers ... serve to block out background light with a rejection ratio better than 10 − 5 " . The passband of a typical Faraday filter may be a few GHz . The total output of a Faraday filter may be around 50 % of the total input light intensity . The light lost is reflected or absorbed by imperfect lenses , filters and windows . 
 = = = = Band @-@ pass = = = = 
 The band @-@ pass of an atomic line filter is usually equal to the Doppler profile of the vapor cell , the natural range of frequencies at which a vapor cell will be excited by a pure light source . The Doppler profile is the width of the spectrum of Doppler shifted radiation emitted by the vapor cell due to its thermal motion . This value is less for larger atoms at lower temperatures , a system considered more ideal . 
 There are some circumstances where this is not the case , and it is desirable to make the width of the transition line larger than the Doppler profile . For instance , when tracking a quickly accelerating object , the band @-@ pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light . The accepted method for increasing the band @-@ pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell . This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter . 
 = = = = Relevant phenomena = = = = 
 Radiation trapping in an atomic line filter may seriously affect the performance and therefore tuning of an ALF . In the original studies of atomic line filters in the 1970s and early 1980s , there was a " large overestimation of the [ signal bandwidth ] " . Later , radiation trapping was studied , analyzed and ALFs were optimized to account for it . 
 In all atomic line filters , the position and widths of the vapor cell resonance lines are among the most important properties . By the Stark effect and Zeeman splitting , the base absorption lines may be split into finer lines . " Stark and Zeeman tuning ... can be used to tune the detector . " Consequently , manipulation of electric and magnetic fields may alter other properties of the filter ( i.e. shifting the passband ) . 
 = = Types = = 
 = = = Absorption @-@ re @-@ emission = = = 
 An absorption @-@ re @-@ emission atomic line filter absorbs the desired wavelength of light and emits light that bypasses broadband filters . In passive absorption @-@ re @-@ emission ALFs , a high @-@ pass filter blocks all low @-@ energy incoming light . The vapor cell absorbs the signal , which coincides with the vapor 's thin absorption line , and the cell 's atoms become excited . The vapor cell then re @-@ emits the signal light by undergoing fluorescence at a lower frequency . A low @-@ pass filter blocks radiation above the frequency of the fluorescent light . In an active ALF , optical or electrical pumping is used for exciting these atoms so they absorb or emit light of different wavelengths . For active ALFs , other systems of conventional filters may be needed . 
 = = = Faraday filter = = = 
 A Faraday filter , magneto @-@ optical filter , FADOF or <unk> ( Excited Faraday <unk> Optical Filter ) works by rotating the polarization of the light passing through the vapor cell . This rotation occurs near its atomic absorption lines by the Faraday effect and anomalous dispersion . Only light at the resonant frequency of the vapor is rotated and the polarized plates block other electromagnetic radiation . This effect is related to and enhanced by the Zeeman Effect , or the splitting of atomic absorption lines in the presence of the magnetic field . Light at the resonant frequency of the vapor exits a FADOF near its original strength but with an orthogonal polarization . 
 Following the laws which govern the Faraday effect , the rotation of the targeted radiation is directly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field , the width of the vapor cell and the <unk> constant ( which is dependent on the temperature of the cell , wavelength of the light and sometimes intensity of the field ) of the vapor in the cell . This relationship is represented the following equation : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Voigt filter = = = 
 A Voigt filter is a Faraday filter with its magnetic field shifted to be perpendicular to the direction of the light and at 45 ° to the polarization of the polarized plates . In a Voigt filter , the vapor cell acts as a half wave plate , retarding one polarization by 180 ° per the Voigt effect . 
 = = Common components = = 
 Preceding an atomic line filter may be a collimator , which straightens incident light rays for passing through the rest of the filter consistently ; however , collimated light is not always necessary . After the collimator , a high @-@ pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light ( that of too long a wavelength ) . In Faraday and Voigt filters , the first polarizing plate is used here to block light . 
 The next component in an atomic line filter is the vapor cell ; this is common to all atomic line filters . It either absorbs and re @-@ emits the incident light , or rotates its polarization by the Faraday or Voigt effect . Following the vapor cell is a low @-@ pass filter , designed to block all of the light that the first filter did not , except the designated frequency of light which came from the fluorescence . In Faraday and Voigt filters , a second polarizing plate is used here . 
 Other systems may be used in conjunction with the rest of an atomic line filter for practicality . For instance , the polarizers used in the actual Faraday filter don 't block most radiation , " because these polarizers only work over a limited wavelength region ... a broad band interference filter is used in conjunction with the Faraday filter " . The passband of the interference filter may be 200 times that of the actual filter . <unk> tubes , too , are often used for increasing the intensity of the output signal to a usable level . Avalanche photomultipliers , which are more efficient , may be used instead of a PMT . 
 = = = Vapor cell = = = 
 While every implementation of each kind of ALF is different , the vapor cell in each is relatively similar . The thermodynamic properties of vapor cells in filters are carefully controlled because they determine important qualities of the filter , for instance the necessary strength of the magnetic field . Light is let into and out of this vapor chamber by way of two low @-@ reflection windows made of a material such as magnesium fluoride . The other sides of the cell may be of any opaque material , though generally a heat @-@ resistant metal or ceramic is used as the vapor is usually kept at temperatures upwards of 100 ° C. 
 Most ALF vapor cells use alkali metals because of their high vapor pressures ; many alkali metals also have absorption lines and resonance in the desired spectra . Common vapor cell materials are sodium , potassium and caesium . Note that non @-@ metallic vapors such as neon may be used . As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals , it is conceivable that such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today . This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Atomic line filters are most often used in LIDAR and other exercises in laser tracking and detection , for their ability to filter daylight and effectively discern weak , narrowband signals ; however , they may be used for filtering out the earth 's thermal background , measuring the efficiencies of antibiotics and general filtering applications . 
 = = = Laser tracking and communication = = = 
 Without an atomic line filter , laser tracking and communication may be difficult . Usually , intensified charge @-@ coupled device cameras must be used in conjunction with simple dielectric optical filters ( e.g. interference filters ) to detect laser emissions at a distance . Intensified CCDs are inefficient and necessitate the use of a pulsed laser transmission within the visible spectrum . With the superior filtering system of an ALF , a non @-@ intensified CCD may be used with a continuous wave laser more efficiently . " [ Atomic line filters ] with passbands of about 0 @.@ 001 nm have been developed to improve the background rejection of conventionally filtered laser receivers " . The total energy consumption of the latter system is " 30 to 35 times less " than that of the former , so space @-@ based , underwater and agile laser communications with ALFs have been proposed and developed . 
 = = = LIDAR = = = 
 LIDAR comprises firing lasers at relevant portions of the atmosphere where light is <unk> . By analyzing the reflected laser beam for Doppler shifts , wind speeds and wind directions in the target region may be calculated . The thermal structure , diurnal / semi @-@ diurnal tides , and seasonal variations in the mesopause region may thus be studied . This is a valuable faculty for meteorologists and climatologists , as these properties can be significant . 
 However , without the ability to effectively track weak laser signals , collection of atmospheric data would be relegated to times of day where the sun 's electromagnetic emissions did not drown out the laser 's signal . The addition of an atomic line filter to the LIDAR equipment effectively filters interference to the laser 's signal to the point where LIDAR data can be collected at any time of the day . For the past decade , Faraday filters have been used to do this . Consequently , scientists know significantly more today about the Earth 's middle atmosphere than they did before the advent of the FADOF .

 = Washington Monument = 
 The Washington Monument is an obelisk on the National Mall in Washington , D.C. , built to commemorate George Washington , once commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Continental Army and the first American president . Standing almost due east of the Reflecting Pool and the Lincoln Memorial , the monument , made of marble , granite , and bluestone gneiss , is both the world 's tallest stone structure and the world 's tallest obelisk , standing 554 feet 7 11 ⁄ 32 inches ( 169 @.@ 046 m ) tall . It is the tallest monumental column in the world if all are measured above their pedestrian entrances , but two are taller when measured above ground , though they are neither all stone nor true obelisks . 
 Construction of the monument began in 1848 , and was halted from 1854 to 1877 due to a lack of funds , a struggle for control over the Washington National Monument Society , and the intervention of the American Civil War . Although the stone structure was completed in 1884 , internal ironwork , the knoll , and other finishing touches were not completed until 1888 . A difference in shading of the marble , visible approximately 150 feet ( 46 m ) or 27 % up , shows where construction was halted and later resumed with marble from a different source . The original design was by Robert Mills , but he did not include his proposed colonnade due to a lack of funds , proceeding only with a bare obelisk . Despite many proposals to embellish the obelisk , only its original flat top was altered to a pointed marble pyramidion , in 1884 . The cornerstone was laid on July 4 , 1848 ; the first stone was laid atop the unfinished stump on August 7 , 1880 ; the capstone was set on December 6 , 1884 ; and the completed monument was dedicated on February 21 , 1885 . It officially opened October 9 , 1888 . Upon completion , it became the world 's tallest structure , a title previously held by the Cologne Cathedral . The monument held this designation until 1889 , when the Eiffel Tower was completed in Paris , France . 
 The monument was damaged during the 2011 Virginia earthquake and Hurricane Irene in the same year and remained closed to the public while the structure was assessed and repaired . After 32 months of repairs , the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall reopened the Washington Monument to visitors on May 12 , 2014 .

 George Washington ( 1732 – 99 ) , hailed as the father of his country , and as the leader who was " first in war , first in peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen " ( in eulogy by Maj. Gen. ' Light @-@ Horse Harry ' Lee at Washington 's funeral , December 26 , 1799 ) , was the dominant military and political leader of the new United States of America from 1775 to 1799 . Even his erstwhile enemy King George III called him " the greatest character of the age . " 
 At his death in 1799 he left a critical legacy ; he exemplified the core ideals of the American Revolution and the new nation : republican virtue and devotion to civic duty . Washington was the unchallenged public icon of American military and civic patriotism . He was also identified with the Federalist Party , which lost control of the national government in 1800 to the Jeffersonian Republicans , who were reluctant to celebrate the hero of the opposition party . 
 = = = Proposals for a memorial = = = 
 Starting with victory in the Revolution , there were many proposals to build a monument to Washington . After his death , Congress authorized a suitable memorial in the national capital , but the decision was reversed when the Democratic @-@ Republican Party ( Jeffersonian Republicans ) took control of Congress in 1801 . The Republicans were dismayed that Washington had become the symbol of the Federalist Party ; furthermore the values of Republicanism seemed hostile to the idea of building monuments to powerful men . They also blocked his image on coins or the celebration of his birthday . Further political squabbling , along with the North @-@ South division on the Civil War , blocked the completion of the Washington Monument until the late 19th century . By that time , Washington had the image of a national hero who could be celebrated by both North and South , and memorials to him were no longer controversial . 
 As early as 1783 , the Continental Congress had resolved " That an equestrian statue of George Washington be erected at the place where the residence of Congress shall be established . " The proposal called for engraving on the statue which explained it had been erected " in honor of George Washington , the illustrious Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Armies of the United States of America during the war which vindicated and secured their liberty , sovereignty , and independence . " Currently , there are two equestrian statues of President Washington in Washington , D.C. One is located in Washington Circle at the intersection of the Foggy Bottom and West End neighborhoods at the north end of the George Washington University , and the other is in the gardens of the National Cathedral . 
 Ten days after Washington 's death , a Congressional committee recommended a different type of monument . John Marshall , a Representative from Virginia ( who later became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ) proposed that a tomb be erected within the Capitol . However , a lack of funds , disagreement over what type of memorial would best honor the country 's first president , and the Washington family 's reluctance to move his body prevented progress on any project . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Progress toward a memorial finally began in 1832 . That year , which marked the 100th anniversary of Washington 's birth , a large group of concerned citizens formed the Washington National Monument Society . In 1836 , after they had raised $ 28 @,@ 000 in donations ( $ 17 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , they announced a competition for the design of the memorial . 
 On September 23 , 1835 , the board of managers of the society described their expectations : 
 It is proposed that the contemplated monument shall be like him in whose honor it is to be constructed , unparalleled in the world , and commensurate with the gratitude , liberality , and patriotism of the people by whom it is to be erected ... [ It ] should blend <unk> with elegance , and be of such magnitude and beauty as to be an object of pride to the American people , and of admiration to all who see it . Its material is intended to be wholly American , and to be of marble and granite brought from each state , that each state may participate in the glory of contributing material as well as in funds to its construction . 
 The society held a competition for designs in 1836 . The winner was architect Robert Mills . The citizens of Baltimore had chosen him to build a monument to Washington , and he had designed a tall Greek column surmounted by a statue of the President . Mills also knew the capital well , having just been chosen Architect of Public Buildings for Washington . His design called for a tall obelisk — an upright , four @-@ sided pillar that tapers as it rises — with a nearly flat top . He surrounded the obelisk with a circular colonnade , the top of which would feature Washington standing in a chariot . Inside the colonnade would be statues of 30 prominent Revolutionary War heroes . 
 One part of Mills ' elaborate design that was built was the doorway surmounted by an Egyptian @-@ style winged sun . It was removed in 1885 , after the monument was dedicated . A photo can be seen in The Egyptian Revival by Richard G. Carrot . 
 Criticism of Mills ' design and its estimated price tag of more than $ 1 million ( $ 620 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) caused the society to hesitate . Its members decided to start building the obelisk , and to leave the question of the colonnade for later . They believed that if they used the $ 87 @,@ 000 they had already collected to start work , the appearance of the monument would spur further donations that would allow them to complete the project . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 The Washington Monument was originally intended to be located at the point at which a line running directly south from the center of the White House crossed a line running directly west from the center of the Capitol . Pierre ( Peter ) Charles L 'Enfant 's 1791 " Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States ... " designated this point as the location of the equestrian statue of George Washington that the Continental Congress had voted for in 1783 . The ground at the intended location proved to be too unstable to support a structure as heavy as the planned obelisk . At that originally intended site , which is 390 feet ( 119 m ) WNW from the current monument , there now stands a small monolith called the Jefferson Pier . 
 = = = = Excavation and initial construction = = = = 
 In early 1848 , workers started to build the Washington Monument 's foundation . On July 4 , 1848 , the Freemasons , an organization to which Washington belonged , laid the cornerstone ( symbolically , not physically ) . According to Joseph R. Chandler : 
 No more Washingtons shall come in our time ... But his virtues are stamped on the heart of mankind . He who is great in the battlefield looks upward to the generalship of Washington . He who grows wise in counsel feels that he is imitating Washington . He who can resign power against the wishes of a people , has in his eye the bright example of Washington . 
 Two years later , on a torrid July 4 , 1850 , George Washington Parke Custis , the adopted son of George Washington and grandson of Martha Washington , dedicated a stone from the people of the District of Columbia to the Monument at a ceremony that President Zachary Taylor attended five days before he died from food poisoning . 
 = = = = Donations run out = = = = 
 Construction continued until 1854 , when donations ran out and the monument had reached a height of 152 feet ( 46 @.@ 3 m ) . At that time a memorial stone that was contributed by Pope Pius IX , called the Pope 's Stone , was destroyed by members of the anti @-@ Catholic , nativist American Party , better known as the " Know @-@ Nothings " , during the early morning hours of March 6 , 1854 ( a priest replaced it in 1982 ) . This caused public contributions to the Washington National Monument Society to cease , so they appealed to Congress for money . 
 The request had just reached the floor of the House of Representatives when the Know @-@ Nothing Party seized control of the Society on February 22 , 1855 . Congress immediately tabled its expected contribution of $ 200 @,@ 000 to the Society , effectively halting the appropriation . During its tenure , the Know @-@ Nothing Society added only two courses of masonry , or four feet , to the monument using rejected masonry it found on site , increasing the height of the shaft to 156 feet . The original Society refused to recognize the illegal takeover , so two Societies existed side by side until 1858 . With the Know @-@ Nothing Party disintegrating and its inability to secure contributions toward building the monument , it surrendered its possession of the monument to the original Society on October 20 , 1858 . To prevent future takeovers , Congress incorporated the Society on February 22 , 1859 . 
 = = = = Post – Civil War = = = = 
 Interest in the monument grew after the Civil War . Engineers studied the foundation several times to determine if it was strong enough . In 1876 , the Centennial of the Declaration of Independence , Congress agreed to appropriate another $ 200 @,@ 000 to resume construction . 
 Before work could begin again , arguments about the most appropriate design resumed . Many people thought a simple obelisk , one without the colonnade , would be too bare . Architect Mills was reputed to have said omitting the colonnade would make the monument look like " a stalk of asparagus " ; another critic said it offered " little ... to be proud of . " 
 This attitude led people to submit alternative designs . Both the Washington National Monument Society and Congress held discussions about how the monument should be finished . The society considered five new designs , concluding that the one by William Wetmore Story seemed " vastly superior in artistic taste and beauty . " Congress deliberated over those five as well as Mills ' original . While it was deciding , it ordered work on the obelisk to continue . Finally , the members of the society agreed to abandon the colonnade and alter the obelisk so it conformed to classical Egyptian proportions . 
 = = = = Resumption = = = = 
 Construction resumed in 1879 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers . Casey redesigned the foundation , strengthening it so it could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40 @,@ 000 tons . He then followed the society 's orders and figured out what to do with the memorial stones that had accumulated . Though many people ridiculed them , Casey managed to install most of the stones in the interior walls — one stone was found at the bottom of the elevator shaft in 1951 . The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade than the rest of the construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries . 
 The building of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding . In four years , it was completed , with the 100 @-@ ounce ( 2 @.@ 83 kg ) aluminum apex / lightning @-@ rod being put in place on December 6 , 1884 . The apex was the largest single piece of aluminum cast at the time , when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver . Two years later , the Hall – Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce and the price of aluminum plummeted , making the once @-@ valuable apex more ordinary , though it still provided a lustrous , non @-@ rusting apex that served as the original lightning rod . The monument opened to the public on October 9 , 1888 . 
 = = = Dedication = = = 
 The Monument was dedicated on February 21 , 1885 . Over 800 people were present on the monument grounds to hear speeches during a frigid day by Ohio Senator John Sherman , the Rev. Henderson Suter , William Wilson Corcoran ( of the Washington National Monument Society ) read by Dr. James C. Welling because Corcoran was unable to attend , Freemason Myron M. Parker , Col. Thomas Lincoln Casey of the Army Corps of Engineers , and President Chester A. Arthur . President Arthur proclaimed : 
 I do now .... in behalf of the people , receive this monument .... and declare it dedicated from this time forth to the immortal name and memory of George Washington . 
 After the speeches Lieutenant @-@ General Philip Sheridan led a procession , which included the dignitaries and the crowd , past the Executive Mansion , now the White House , then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol , where President Arthur received passing troops . Then , in the House Chamber , the president , his Cabinet , diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long read a speech written a few months earlier by Robert C. Winthrop , formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier , but now too ill to personally deliver his speech . A final speech was given by John W. Daniel of Virginia . The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks , both aerial and ground displays .

 At the time of its completion , it was the tallest building in the world , a title it retained until the Eiffel Tower was completed in 1889 ; however , the Washington Monument is still the tallest stone structure in the world . It is the tallest building in Washington , D.C. The Heights of Buildings Act of 1910 restricts new building heights to no more than 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) greater than the width of the adjacent street . This monument is vastly taller than the obelisks around the capitals of Europe and in Egypt and Ethiopia , but ordinary antique obelisks were quarried as a monolithic block of stone , and were therefore seldom taller than approximately 100 feet ( 30 m ) . 
 The Washington Monument attracted enormous crowds before it officially opened . For six months after its dedication , 10 @,@ 041 people climbed the 898 steps and 50 landings to the top . After the elevator that had been used to raise building materials was altered to carry passengers , the number of visitors grew rapidly , and an average of 55 @,@ 000 people per month were going to the top by 1888 . The annual visitor count peaked between 1979 – 97 , where an average of 1 @.@ 1 million visitors visited annually ; however , from 2005 – 10 , the Washington Monument has had an average of only 631 @,@ 000 visitors each year . As with all historic areas administered by the National Park Service , the national memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15 , 1966 . 
 In the early 1900s , material started oozing out between the outer stones of the first construction period below the 150 @-@ foot mark , and was referred to by tourists as " geological tuberculosis " . This was caused by the weathering of the cement and rubble filler between the outer and inner walls . As the lower section of the monument was exposed to cold and hot and damp and dry weather conditions , the material dissolved and worked its way through the cracks between the stones of the outer wall , solidifying as it dripped down their outer surface . 
 For ten hours in December 1982 , the Washington Monument and eight tourists were held hostage by a nuclear arms protester , Norman Mayer , claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument 's base . U.S. Park Police shot and killed Mayer . The monument was undamaged in the incident , and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives . After this incident , the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles . 
 The monument underwent an extensive restoration project between 1998 and 2001 . During this time it was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves ( who was also responsible for the interior changes ) . The project included cleaning , repairing and repointing the monument 's exterior and interior stonework . The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism , while new windows with narrower frames were installed ( to increase the viewing space ) . New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington , and the monument 's place in history , were also added . 
 A temporary interactive visitors center , dubbed the " Discovery Channel Center " was also constructed during the project . The center provided a simulated ride to the top of the monument , and shared information with visitors during phases in which the monument was closed . The majority of the project 's phases were completed by summer 2000 , allowing the monument to reopen July 31 , 2000 . The monument temporarily closed again on December 4 , 2000 to allow a new elevator cab to be installed , completing the final phase of the restoration project . The new cab included glass windows , allowing visitors to see some of the 194 memorial stones embedded in the monument 's walls . The installation of the cab took much longer than anticipated , and the monument did not reopen until February 22 , 2002 . The final cost of the restoration project was $ 10 @.@ 5 million . 
 On September 7 , 2004 the monument closed for a $ 15 million renovation , which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of the monument grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin . The renovations were due partly to security concerns following the September 11 attacks and the start of the War on Terror . The monument reopened April 1 , 2005 , while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer . 
 = = = = 2011 earthquake damage = = = = 
 On August 23 , 2011 , the Washington Monument sustained damage during the 5 @.@ 8 magnitude 2011 Virginia earthquake ; over 150 cracks were found in the monument . A National Park Service spokesperson reported that inspectors discovered a crack near the top of the structure , and announced that the monument would be closed indefinitely . A block in the pyramidion also was partially dislodged , and pieces of stone , stone chips , mortar , and paint chips came free of the monument and " littered " the interior stairs and observation deck . The Park Service said it was bringing in two structural engineering firms ( Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates , Inc. and Tipping Mar Associates ) with extensive experience in historic buildings and earthquake @-@ damaged structures to assess the monument . 
 Officials said an examination of the monument 's exterior revealed a " debris field " of mortar and pieces of stone around the base of the monument , and several " substantial " pieces of stone had fallen inside the memorial . A crack in the central stone of the west face of the pyramidion was 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) wide and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) long . Park Service inspectors also discovered that the elevator system had been damaged , and was operating only to the 250 @-@ foot ( 76 m ) level , but was soon repaired . 
 On September 27 , 2011 , Denali National Park ranger Brandon Latham arrived to assist four climbers belonging to a " difficult access " team from Wiss , Janney , Elstner Associates . The reason for the inspection was the park agency 's suspicion that there were more cracks on the monument 's upper section not visible from the inside . The agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on August 23 . After Hurricane Irene hit the area on August 27 , water was discovered inside the memorial , leading the Park Service to suspect there was more undiscovered damage . The <unk> used radios to report what they found to engineering experts on the ground . Wiss , Janney , Elstner climber Dave <unk> took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument 's lightning rod system atop the pyramidion ; it was the first time the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since 2000 . 
 The external inspection of the monument was completed October 5 , 2011 . In addition to the 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) long west crack , the inspection found several corner cracks and surface spalls ( pieces of stone broken loose ) at or near the top of the monument , and more loss of joint mortar lower down the monument . The full report was issued December 2011 . Bob Vogel , Superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks , emphasized that the monument was not in danger of collapse . " It 's structurally sound and not going anywhere " , he told the national media at a press conference on September 26 , 2011 . 
 More than $ 200 @,@ 000 was spent between August 24 and September 26 inspecting the structure . The National Park Service said that it would soon begin sealing the exterior cracks on the monument to protect it from rain and snow . 
 On July 9 , 2012 , the National Park Service announced that the monument would be closed for repairs until 2014 . The National Park Service hired construction management firm Hill International in conjunction with joint @-@ venture partner Louis Berger Group to provide coordination between the designer , Wiss , Janney , and Elstner Associates , the general contractor Perini , and numerous stakeholders . NPS said a portion of the plaza at the base of the monument would be removed and scaffolding constructed around the exterior . In July 2013 , lighting was added to the scaffolding . Some stone pieces saved during the 2011 inspection will be <unk> to the monument , while " Dutchman patches " will be used in other places . Several of the stone lips that help hold the pyramidion 's 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 910 kg ) exterior slabs in place were also damaged , so engineers will install metal brackets to more securely fasten them to the monument . 
 The National Park Service reopened the Washington Monument to visitors on May 12 , 2014 , eight days ahead of schedule . Repairs to the monument cost US $ 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , with taxpayers funding $ 7 @.@ 5 million of the cost and David Rubenstein funding the other $ 7 @.@ 5 million . At the reopening Interior Secretary Sally Jewell , Today show weatherman Al Roker , and American Idol Season 12 winner Candice Glover were present .

 = = = Cornerstone = = = 
 The cornerstone was laid with great ceremony at the northeast corner of the lowest course or step of the old foundation on July 4 , 1848 . Robert Mills , the architect of the monument , stated in September 1848 , " The foundations are now brought up nearly to the surface of the ground ; the second step being nearly completed , which covers up the corner stone . " Therefore , the cornerstone was laid below the 1848 ground level . In 1880 , the ground level was raised 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) to the base of the shaft by the addition of a 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) wide earthen embankment encircling the reinforced foundation , widened another 30 feet in 1881 , and then the knoll was constructed in 1887 – 88 . If the cornerstone was not moved during the strengthening of the foundation in 1879 – 80 , its upper surface would now be 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) below the pavement just outside the northeast corner of the shaft . It would now be sandwiched between the concrete slab under the old foundation and the concrete buttress completely encircling what remains of the old foundation . During the strengthening process , about half ( by volume ) of the periphery of the lowest seven of eight courses or steps of the old foundation ( gneiss slabs ) was removed to provide good footing for the buttress . Although a few diagrams , pictures and descriptions of this process exist , the fate of the cornerstone is not mentioned . 
 The cornerstone was a 24 @,@ 500 @-@ pound ( 11 @,@ 100 kg ) marble block 2 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) high and 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) square with a large hole for a zinc case filled with memorabilia . The hole was covered by a copper plate inscribed with the date of the Declaration of Independence ( July 4 , 1776 ) , the date the cornerstone was laid ( July 4 , 1848 ) , and the names of the managers of the Washington National Monument Society . The memorabilia in the zinc case included items associated with the monument , the city of Washington , the national government , state governments , benevolent societies , and George Washington , plus miscellaneous publications , both governmental and commercial , a coin set , and a bible , totaling 73 items or collections of items , as well as 71 newspapers containing articles relating to George Washington or the monument . 
 The ceremony began with a parade of dignitaries in carriages , marching troops , fire companies , and benevolent societies . A long oration was delivered by the Speaker of the House of Representatives Robert C. Winthrop . Then , the cornerstone was pronounced sound after a Masonic ceremony using George Washington 's Masonic gavel , apron and sash , as well as other Masonic symbols . In attendance were President James K. Polk and other federal , state and local government officials , Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton , Mrs. Dolley Madison , Mrs. John Quincy Adams , and George Washington Parke Custis , among 15 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 others , including a bald eagle . The ceremony ended with fireworks that evening . 
 = = = Memorial stones = = = 
 States , cities , foreign countries , benevolent societies , other organizations , and individuals have contributed 194 memorial stones , all inserted into the east and west interior walls above stair landings or levels for easy viewing , except one on the south interior wall between stairs that is difficult to view . The sources disagree on the number of stones for two reasons : whether one or both " height stones " are included , and stones not yet on display at the time of a source 's publication cannot be included . The " height stones " refer to two stones that indicate height : during the first phase of construction a stone with an inscription that includes the phrase " from the foundation to this height 100 feet " was installed just below the 80 – 90 @-@ foot stairway and high above the 60 – 70 @-@ foot stairway ; during the second phase of construction a stone with a horizontal line and the phrase " top of statue on Capitol " was installed on the 330 @-@ foot level . 
 The Historic Structure Report ( HSR , 2004 ) named 194 " memorial stones " by level , including both height stones . Jacob ( 2005 ) described in detail and pictured 193 " commemorative stones " , including the 100 @-@ foot stone but not the Capitol stone . The Historic American Buildings Survey ( HABS , 1994 ) showed the location of 193 " memorial stones " , but did not describe or name any . HABS showed both height stones , but did not show one stone not yet installed in 1994 . Olszewski ( 1971 ) named 190 " memorial stones " by level , including the Capitol stone but not the 100 @-@ foot stone . Olszewski did not include three stones not yet installed in 1971 . An inscription not regarded as a memorial stone by any source is incised in printed letters on a rib in the pyramidion with the same wording as the inscription on the south face of the aluminum apex . 
 Of 194 stones , 95 are marble , 41 are granite , 30 are limestone , 9 are sandstone , with 19 miscellaneous types , including combinations of the aforesaid and those whose materials are not identified . Unusual materials include native copper ( Michigan ) , <unk> ( Minnesota ) , petrified wood ( Arizona ) , and <unk> ( Alaska ) . The stones vary in size from about 1 @.@ 5 feet ( 0 @.@ 46 m ) square ( Carthage ) to about 6 by 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m × 2 @.@ 4 m ) ( Philadelphia and New York City ) . 
 Utah contributed one stone as a territory and another as a state , both with inscriptions that include its pre @-@ territorial name , Deseret , both located on the 220 @-@ foot level . 
 A stone at the 240 @-@ foot level of the monument is inscribed in Welsh : Fy <unk> , fy <unk> , fy <unk> Cymru – Cymru am <unk> ( My language , my land , my nation of Wales – Wales for ever ) . The stone , imported from Wales , was donated by Welsh citizens of New York . Two other stones presented by the Sunday Schools of the Methodist Episcopal Church in New York and from the Sabbath School children of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Philadelphia , quote the Bible verses Proverbs 10 : 7 , Proverbs 22 : 6 , and Luke 17 : 6 . 
 Another inscription , this one sent by the Ottoman government , combines the works of two eminent calligraphers : an imperial tughra by Mustafa <unk> 's student <unk> Efendi , and an inscription in <unk> ta <unk> script by <unk> Mustafa <unk> Efendi , the calligrapher who wrote the giant medallions at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul . 
 One stone was donated by the Ryukyu Kingdom and brought back by Commodore Matthew C. Perry , but never arrived in Washington ( it was replaced in 1989 ) . Many of the stones donated for the monument carried inscriptions which did not commemorate George Washington . For example , one from the Templars of Honor and Temperance stated " We will not make , buy , sell , or use as a beverage , any <unk> or malt liquors , Wine , Cider , or any other Alcoholic Liquor . " ( George Washington himself had owned a whiskey distillery which operated at Mount Vernon after he left the presidency . ) 
 = = = Aluminum apex = = = 
 The aluminum apex , at the time a rare metal as valuable as silver , was cast by William <unk> of Philadelphia . Before the installation it was put on public display at Tiffany 's in New York City and stepped over by visitors who could say they had " stepped over the top of the Washington Monument " . It was 8 @.@ 9 inches ( 23 cm ) tall before 3 ⁄ 8 inch was removed from its tip by lightning strikes during 1885 – 1934 , when it was protected from further damage by tall lightning rods surrounding it . Its base is 5 @.@ 6 inches ( 14 cm ) square . The angle between opposite sides at its tip is 34 ° 48 ' . It weighed 100 ounces ( 2 @.@ 83 kg ) before lightning strikes removed a small amount of aluminum from its tip and sides . Spectral analysis in 1934 showed that it was composed of 97 @.@ 87 % aluminum with the rest impurities . It has a shallow depression in its base to match a slightly raised area atop the small upper surface of the marble capstone , which aligns the sides of the apex with those of the capstone , and the downward protruding lip around that area prevents water from entering the joint . It has a large hole in the center of its base to receive a threaded 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 3 @.@ 8 cm ) diameter copper rod which attaches it to the monument and used to form part of the lightning protection system . 
 The four faces of the external aluminum apex all bear inscriptions in cursive writing ( Snell Round hand ) , which are incised into the aluminum . Most inscriptions are the original 1884 inscriptions , except for the top three lines on the east face which were added in 1934 . A wide gold @-@ plated copper band that held eight lightning rods covered most of the inscriptions from 1885 until it was removed and discarded in 2013 . The inscriptions that it covered were damaged and are now illegible . Only the top four and bottom two lines of the north face , the first and last lines of the west face , the top four lines of the south face , and the top three lines of the east face are still legible . Even though the inscriptions are no longer covered , no attempt was made to repair them when the apex was accessible in 2013 . The following table shows legible inscriptions in blue and illegible inscriptions in red . No colors appear on the actual apex . 
 Although most printed sources , Harvey ( 1903 ) , Olszewski ( 1971 ) , Torres ( 1984 ) , and the Historic Structure Report ( 2004 ) , refer to the original 1884 inscriptions , the National Geodetic Survey ( 2015 ) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions . All sources print them according to their own editorial rules , resulting in excessive capitalization ( Harvey , Olszewski , and NGS ) and inappropriate line breaks . No printed source uses cursive writing , although pictures of the apex clearly show that it was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions . 
 A replica displayed on the 490 @-@ foot level uses totally different line breaks than those on the external apex — it also omits the 1934 inscriptions . In October 2007 , it was discovered that the display of this replica was positioned so that the Laus Deo ( Latin for " praise be to God " ) inscription could not be seen and Laus Deo was omitted from the placard describing the apex . The National Park Service rectified the omission by creating a new display . 
 = = = Lightning protection = = = 
 The pyramidion , the pointed top 55 feet ( 17 m ) of the monument , was originally designed with an 8 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 23 cm ) tall inscribed aluminum apex which served as a single lightning rod , installed December 6 , 1884 . Six months later on June 5 , 1885 lightning damaged the marble blocks of the pyramidion , so a net of gold @-@ plated copper rods supporting 200 3 @-@ inch ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) gold @-@ plated , platinum @-@ tipped copper points spaced every 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) was installed over the entire pyramidion . The original net included a gold @-@ plated copper band attached to the aluminum apex by four large set screws which supported eight closely spaced vertical points that did not protrude above the apex . In 1934 these eight short points were lengthened to extend them above the apex by 6 inches ( 15 cm ) . In 2013 this original system was removed and discarded . It was replaced by only two thick solid aluminum lightning rods protruding above the tip of the apex by about one foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) attached to the east and west sides of the marble capstone just below the apex . 
 Until it was removed , the original lightning protection system was connected to the tops of the four iron columns supporting the elevator with large copper rods . Even though the aluminum apex is still connected to the columns with large copper rods , it is no longer part of the lightning protection system because it is now disconnected from the present lightning rods which shield it . The two lightning rods present since 2013 are connected to the iron columns with two large braided aluminum cables leading down the surface of the pyramidion near its southeast and northwest corners . They enter the pyramidion at its base , where they are tied together ( electrically shorted ) via large braided aluminum cables encircling the pyramidion two feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) above its base . The bottom of the iron columns are connected to ground water below the monument via four large copper rods that pass through a 2 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) square well half filled with sand in the center of the foundation . The effectiveness of the lightning protection system has not been affected by a significant draw down of the water table since 1884 because the soil 's water content remains roughly 20 % both above and below the height of the water table . 
 = = = Flags = = = 
 Fifty American flags ( not state flags ) , one for each state , are now flown 24 hours a day around a large circle centered on the monument . Forty eight American flags ( one for each state then in existence ) were flown on wooden flag poles on Washington 's birthday since 1920 and later on Independence Day , Memorial Day , and other special occasions until early 1958 . Both the flags and flag poles were removed and stored between these days . In 1958 fifty 25 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall aluminum flag poles ( anticipating Alaska and Hawaii ) were installed , evenly spaced around a 260 @-@ foot ( 79 m ) diameter circle . During 2004 – 05 , the diameter of the circle was reduced to 240 feet ( 73 m ) . Since Washington 's birthday 1958 , 48 American flags were flown on a daily basis , increasing to 49 flags on July 4 , 1959 , and then to 50 flags since July 4 , 1960 . When 48 and 49 flags were flown , only 48 and 49 flag poles of the available 50 were placed into base receptacles . All flags were removed and stored overnight . Since July 4 , 1971 , 50 American flags have flown 24 hours a day . 
 = = = Security = = = 
 In 2001 , a temporary visitor security screening center was added to the east entrance of the Washington Monument in the wake of the September 11 attacks . The one @-@ story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument , or an attempt to seize and hold it . Visitors obtained their timed @-@ entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial , and passed through metal detectors and bomb @-@ sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument . After exiting the monument , they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re @-@ entering . This facility , a one @-@ story cube of wood around a metal frame , was intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed . 
 On March 6 , 2014 , the National Capital Planning Commission approved a new visitor screening facility to replace the temporary one . The 785 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 72 @.@ 9 m2 ) facility will be two stories high and contain space for screening 20 to 25 visitors at a time . The exterior walls ( which will be slightly frosted to prevent viewing of the security screening process ) will consist of an outer sheet of bulletproof glass or polycarbonate , a metal mesh insert , and another sheet of bulletproof glass . The inner sheet will consist of two sheets ( slightly separated ) of laminated glass . A 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 3 cm ) airspace will exist between the inner and outer glass walls to help insulate the facility . Two ( possibly three ) geothermal heat pumps will be built on the north side of the monument to provide heating and cooling of the facility . The new facility will also provide an office for National Park Service and United States Park Police staff . The structure is designed so that it may be removed without damaging the monument . The United States Commission of Fine Arts approved the aesthetic design of the screening facility in June 2013 . 
 A recessed trench wall known as a ha @-@ ha has been built to minimize the visual impact of a security barrier surrounding the monument . After the September 11 attacks and another unrelated terror threat at the monument , authorities had put up a circle of temporary Jersey barriers to prevent large motor vehicles from approaching . The unsightly barrier was replaced by a less @-@ obtrusive low 30 @-@ inch ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) granite stone wall that doubles as a seating bench and also incorporates lighting . The installation received the 2005 Park / Landscape Award of Merit from the American Society of Landscape Architects .

 = Battle of Carillon = 
 The Battle of Carillon , also known as the 1758 Battle of Ticonderoga , was fought on July 8 , 1758 , during the French and Indian War ( which was part of the global Seven Years ' War ) . It was fought near Fort Carillon ( now known as Fort Ticonderoga ) on the shore of Lake Champlain in the frontier area between the British colony of New York and the French colony of New France . 
 In the battle , which took place primarily on a rise about three @-@ quarters of a mile ( one km ) from the fort itself , a French army of about 3 @,@ 600 men under General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm and the Chevalier de Levis decisively defeated an overwhelmingly numerically superior force of British troops under General James Abercrombie , which frontally assaulted an entrenched French position without using field artillery , a lack that left the British and its allies vulnerable and allowed the French to win a decisive victory . The battle was the bloodiest of the war , with over 3 @,@ 000 casualties suffered . French losses were about 400 , while more than 2 @,@ 000 were British . 
 American historian Lawrence Henry Gipson wrote of Abercrombie 's campaign that " no military campaign was ever launched on American soil that involved a greater number of errors of judgment on the part of those in positions of responsibility " . Many military historians have cited the Battle of Carillon as a classic example of tactical military incompetence . Abercrombie , confident of a quick victory , ignored several viable military options , such as flanking the French breastworks , waiting for his artillery , or laying siege to the fort . Instead , relying on a flawed report from a young military engineer , and ignoring some of that engineer 's recommendations , he decided in favor of a direct frontal assault on the thoroughly entrenched French , without the benefit of artillery . Montcalm , while concerned about the weak military position of the fort , conducted the defense with spirit . However , due in part to a lack of time , he committed strategic errors in preparing the area 's defenses that a competent attacker could have exploited , and he made tactical errors that made the attacker 's job easier . 
 The fort , abandoned by its garrison , was captured by the British the following year , and it has been known as Fort Ticonderoga ( after its location ) ever since . This battle gave the fort a reputation for impregnability that had an effect on future military operations in the area . Despite several large @-@ scale military movements through the area , in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War , this was the only major battle fought near the fort 's location . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Fort Carillon is situated on a point of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George , at a natural point of conflict between French forces moving south from Canada and the St. Lawrence River Valley across the lake toward the Hudson Valley , and British forces moving up the Hudson from Albany . The fort was sited with Lake Champlain to the east , with Mount Independence rising on the far side . Immediately to the south of the fort lay the mouth of the La Chute River , which drains Lake George . The river was largely non @-@ navigable , and there was a portage trail from the northern end of Lake George to the location of a sawmill the French had built to assist in the fort 's construction . The trail crossed the La Chute twice ; once about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from Lake George , and again at the sawmill , which was about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the fort . 
 To the north of the fort was a road going to Fort St. Frédéric . To the west was a low rise of land , beyond which lay Mount Hope , a rise that commanded part of the portage trail , but was too far from the fort to pose it any danger . The most serious geographic defect in the fort 's location was Mount Defiance ( known at the time of this battle as Rattlesnake Hill , and in the 1770s as Sugar Bush ) , which lay to the south of the fort , across the La Chute River . This 900 foot ( 270 m ) hill , which was steep and densely forested , provided an excellent firing position for cannon aimed at the fort . Nicolas <unk> de Pontleroy , Montcalm 's chief engineer , said of the fort 's site , " Were I to be entrusted with the siege of it , I should require only six mortars and two cannon . " 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to 1758 , the French and Indian War had gone very poorly for the British , whose military met few of its objectives . Following a string of French victories in 1757 in North America , coupled with military setbacks in Europe , William Pitt gained full control of the direction of British military efforts in the Seven Years ' War . Embarking on a strategy that emphasized defense in Europe , where France was strong , and offense in North America , where France was weak , he resolved to attack New France ( the colonial holdings of France in North America ) in three strategic campaigns . Large @-@ scale campaigns were planned to capture Fort Duquesne on the Pennsylvania frontier and the fortress at Louisbourg ( on Île @-@ Royale , now known as Cape Breton Island ) . The third campaign , assigned to General James Abercrombie , was to launch an attack against Canada through the Champlain Valley . Pitt probably would have preferred to have George Howe , a skilled tactician and a dynamic leader , lead this expedition , but seniority and political considerations led him to appoint the relatively undistinguished Abercrombie instead . Howe was appointed a brigadier general , and placed as Abercrombie 's second in command . 
 The French , who had started construction on Fort Carillon in 1755 , used it as a launching point for the successful siege of Fort William Henry in 1757 . Despite that and other successes in North America in 1757 , the situation did not look good for them in 1758 . As early as March , Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm , the commanding general responsible of the French forces in North America , and the Marquis de Vaudreuil , New France 's governor , were aware that the British were planning to send large numbers of troops against them , and that they would have relatively little support from King Louis XV of France . The lack of support from France was in large part due to an unwillingness of the French military to risk the movement of significant military forces across the Atlantic Ocean , which was dominated by Britain 's Royal Navy . This situation was further exacerbated by Canada 's poor harvest in 1757 , which resulted in food shortages as the winter progressed . 
 Montcalm and Vaudreuil , who did not get along with each other , differed on how to deal with the British threat . They had fewer than 5 @,@ 000 regular troops , an estimated six thousand militia men , and a limited number of Indian allies , to bring against British forces reported to number 50 @,@ 000 . Vaudreuil , who had limited combat experience , wanted to divide the French forces , with about 5 @,@ 000 each at Carillon and Louisbourg , and then send a picked force of about 3 @,@ 500 men against the British in the Mohawk River on the northwestern frontiers of the Province of New York . Montcalm believed this to be folly , as the plan would enable the British to easily divert some of their forces to fend off the French attack . Vaudreuil prevailed , and in June 1758 Montcalm left Quebec for Carillon . 
 = = British preparations = = 
 The British amassed their army , under the command of General James Abercrombie , near the remains of Fort William Henry , which lay at the southern end of Lake George but had been destroyed following its capture by the French the previous year . The army numbered fully 16 @,@ 000 men , making it the largest single force ever deployed in North America at the time . Its complement of 6 @,@ 000 regular troops included Lord John Murray 's Highlanders of the 42nd Highland Regiment ( 1st Battalion ) the 27th , 44th , 46th , and 55th regiments , and the 1st and 4th battalions of the 60th , while the provinces providing militia support included Connecticut , Massachusetts , New York , New Jersey , and Rhode Island . On July 5 , 1758 , these troops embarked on boats , which unloaded them at the north end of Lake George on July 6 . 
 = = French defensive preparations = = 
 Colonel François @-@ Charles de Bourlamaque , in command of Fort Carillon prior to Montcalm 's arrival , knew by June 23 that a major British offensive was about to begin . He had sent a messenger bearing a letter from Vaudreuil to Abercrombie ( part of a conventional exchange of pleasantries between opposing commanders ) on June 10 , expecting him to return ; the fact that the British held him was an indication that the messenger had probably learned too much just by being in the British camp . Bourlamaque increased scouting activities , and learned from captured British scouts the approximate size of the British force . 
 Montcalm arrived at Fort Carillon on June 30 , and found there a significantly under @-@ staffed garrison , with only 3 @,@ 500 men , and food sufficient for only nine days . Bourlamaque 's scouts reported that the British had 20 @,@ 000 or more troops massing near the remains of Fort William Henry . Given the large force facing him and the defects of the fort 's site , Montcalm opted for a strategy of defending the likely approaches to the fort . He immediately detached Bourlamaque and three battalions to occupy and fortify the river crossing on the portage trail about two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the northern end of Lake George , about 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the fort . Montcalm himself took two battalions and occupied and fortified an advance camp at the sawmill , while remaining troops were put to work preparing additional defenses outside the fort . He also sent word back to Montreal of the situation , requesting that , if possible , the Chevalier de Lévis and his men , be sent as reinforcement ; these were troops that Vaudreuil intended for duty at the western frontier forts . Lévis had not yet left Montreal , so Vaudreuil instead ordered him and 400 troops to Carillon . They departed Montreal on July 2 . 
 When word reached Bourlamaque on July 5 that the British fleet was coming , he sent Captain Trépezet and about 350 men to observe the fleet , and , if possible , to prevent their landing . On learning the size of the British fleet , which was reportedly " large enough to cover the face of [ Lake George ] " , Montcalm ordered Bourlamaque to retreat . Bourlamaque , who was satisfied with his defensive situation , resisted , not withdrawing until Montcalm repeated the orders three times . Montcalm , now aware of the scope of the movement , ordered all of the troops back to Carillon , and had both bridges on the portage trail destroyed . These withdrawals isolated Trépezet and his men from the main body , a situation made worse for Trépezet when his Indian guides , alarmed by the size of the British fleet , abandoned him . 
 Beginning on the evening of July 6 , the French began to lay out entrenchments on the rise northwest of the fort , about 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) away , that commanded the land routes to the fort . On July 7 , they constructed a lengthy series of abatis ( felled trees with sharpened branches pointed outward ) below these entrenchments . By the end of that day , they had also constructed a wooden breastwork above the trenches . These hastily erected defenses , while proof against small arms fire , would have been ineffective if the British had used cannons against them . 
 = = <unk> Brook = = 
 The British army began an unopposed landing at the north end of Lake George on the morning of July 6 . Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark , and found it recently deserted ; some supplies and equipment had been left behind by the French in their hasty departure . The bulk of the army landed , formed into columns , and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain , rather than along the portage trail , whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed . However , the wood was very thick , and the columns could not be maintained . 
 Near the area where <unk> Brook enters the La Chute , Captain Trépezet and his troop , who were attempting to return to the French lines , encountered Phineas Lyman 's Connecticut regiment , sparking a skirmish in the woods . General Howe 's column was near the action , so he led it in that direction . As they approached the battle scene , General Howe was hit and instantly killed by a musket ball . A column of Massachusetts provincials , also drawn to the battle , cut off the French patrol 's rear . In desperate fighting , about 150 of Trepézet 's men were killed , and another 150 were captured . Fifty men , including Trepézet , escaped by swimming across the La Chute . Trepézet died the next day of wounds suffered in the battle . 
 Sources disagree on the number of casualties suffered . William Nester claims British casualties were light , only ten dead and six wounded , while Rene Chartrand claims that there were about 100 killed and wounded , including the loss of General Howe . The British , frustrated by the difficult woods , demoralized by Howe 's death , and exhausted from the overnight boat ride , camped in the woods , and returned to the landing point early the next morning . 
 = = Portage road = = 
 On July 7 Abercrombie sent Lieutenant Colonel John Bradstreet and a sizable force down the portage path . On reaching the first crossing , where Bourlamaque had camped , they rebuilt the bridge there , and proceeded on to the sawmill crossing . The army then followed , and set up its camp there . Scouts and prisoners reported to Abercrombie that Montcalm had 6 @,@ 000 men and was expecting the Chevalier de Lévis to arrive at any moment with 3 @,@ 000 reinforcements . Abercrombie ordered his engineer , Lieutenant Matthew Clerk , and one of his aides , Captain James Abercrombie ( it is uncertain if the <unk> were related or not ) to reconnoiter the French defenses . After ascending Rattlesnake Hill ( as Mount Defiance was then known ) , they reported that the French position appeared to be incomplete , and could be " easily forced , even without cannon " . They were unaware that the French had disguised much of the works with shrubs and trees , and that they were in fact largely complete . Clerk 's report included recommendations to fortify both the summit and the base of Rattlesnake Hill . Abercrombie decided that they had to attack the next morning , hopefully before Lévis and his supposed 3 @,@ 000 arrived . Lévis arrived at the fort on the evening of July 7 with his troop of 400 regulars . 
 Abercrombie held a war council that evening . The options he presented to his staff were limited to asking if the next day 's attack should be in three ranks or four ; the council opted for three . Abercrombie 's plan of attack omitted Clerk 's recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill ; in addition to the frontal assault , 4 six @-@ pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill , with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort . 
 Early on the morning of July 8 , Clerk went out once again to the base of Rattlesnake Hill to observe the French defenses ; his report indicated that he still felt the French lines could be taken by assault . 
 = = Battle lines form = = 
 The battle began on the morning of July 8 with Rogers ' Rangers and light infantry from Colonel Thomas Gage 's 80th Regiment of Light @-@ Armed Foot pushing the few remaining French scouts behind the entrenchments . They were followed by provincials from New York and Massachusetts , and then three columns of regulars , who made their way through the provincial formations to begin the attack . The 27th and 60th made up the right column , under the command of the 27th 's Lt. Col. William Haviland , the 44th and 55th under Lt. Col. John Donaldson made the center , and the 42nd and 46th under the 42nd 's Lt. Col. Francis Grant formed the left column . Each column was preceded by the regimental light infantry companies . Held in reserve were provincial regiments from Connecticut and New Jersey . 
 Montcalm had organized the French forces into three brigades and a reserve . He commanded the Royal Roussillon and Berry battalions in the center of the entrenchments , while Lévis commanded the Béarn , Guyenne , and la Reine battalions on the right , and Bourlamaque led the La Sarre and Languedoc battalions on the left . Each battalion was given roughly 100 yards ( 91 m ) of the entrenchment to defend . Redoubts with cannon protected the flanks of the entrenchments , although the one on the right had not been completed . The low ground between the left flank and the La Chute River was guarded by militia and marines , who had also constructed abatis to help protect their position . Reserve forces were either in the fort itself , or on the grounds between the fort and the entrenchments on Mount Hope . Portions of each battalion were also held in reserve , to assist in areas where they might be needed . 
 = = Battle = = 
 While Abercrombie had expected the battle to begin at 1 pm , by 12 : 30 elements of the New York regiments on the left began engaging the French defenders . The sounds of battle led Haviland to believe that the French line might have been penetrated , so he ordered his men forward , even though not all of the regulars were in place , and Abercrombie had not given an order to advance . The result , rather than an orderly , coordinated advance on the French position , was a piecemeal entry of the regulars into the battle . As companies of the regulars came forward , they arranged themselves into lines as instructed , and then began to advance . The right column , with a shorter distance to travel , attacked first , followed by the center , and then the left . The 42nd had initially been held in reserve , but after insisting on being allowed to participate , they joined the action . 
 The French position was such that they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced , and the abatis ( a word that shares derivation with abattoir , or slaughterhouse ) rapidly became a killing field . By about 2 pm , it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed . Montcalm was active on the battlefield , having removed his coat , and was moving among his men , giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met . Abercrombie , who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill ( and thus well away from the action ) , was reported by his aide , James Abercrombie , to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle , and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle . It is uncertain why , after the first wave of attack failed , Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks . Writing in his own defense , he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk 's assessment that the works could be easily taken ; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge . 
 Around 2 pm , the British barges carrying artillery floated down the La Chute River , and , contrary to plan , came down a channel between an island in the La Chute and the shore . This brought them within range of the French left and some of the fort 's guns . Fire from cannons on the fort 's southwest bastion 's sank two of the barges , spurring the remaining vessels to retreat . 
 Abercrombie ordered his reserves , the Connecticut and New Jersey provincials , into the battle around 2 , but by 2 : 30 it was clear their attack also failed . Abercrombie then tried to recall the troops , but a significant number , notably the 42nd and 46th regiments on the British left , persisted in the attack . Around 5 pm the 42nd made a desperate advance that actually succeeded in reaching the base of the French wall ; those that actually managed to scale the breastwork were bayoneted . One British observer noted that " Our Forces Fell Exceeding Fast " , while another wrote that they were " Cut Down Like Grass " . The slaughter went on until nightfall , with a great many men retreating behind a breastwork that had been erected at the back of the battlefield . 
 Finally realizing the scope of the disaster , Abercrombie ordered the troops to muster and march down to the landing on Lake George . The retreat in the dark woods became somewhat panicked and disorganized , as rumors of French attacks swirled among the troops . By dawn the next morning , the army was rowing back up Lake George , reaching its base at the southern end around sunset . The humiliating nature of the retreat was immediately apparent to some of its participants ; Lieutenant Colonel Artemas Ward wrote that they " shamefully retreated " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Montcalm , wary of a British counterattack , and concerned about the fatigue of his troops after a long day of battle , had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines . The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses in anticipation of a renewed attack . 
 News of the battle was received in England shortly after news of the fall of Louisbourg , putting a damper on the celebrations marking that victory . The full scope of British victories in 1758 did not reach English shores until later in the year , when Pitt learned of the successes at Forts Duquesne and Frontenac , key steps in completing the conquest of New France . Had Carillon also fallen in 1758 , the conquest might have been completed in 1758 or 1759 ; as it happened , Montreal ( the last point of resistance ) did not surrender until 1760 , with campaigns launched from Fort Oswego , Quebec , and Carillon , which was captured and renamed Ticonderoga in 1759 by forces under the command of Jeffrey Amherst , the victor at Louisbourg . 
 Abercrombie never led another military campaign . Although he was active at Lake George , he did little more than provide support for John Bradstreet 's successful attack on Fort Frontenac , which was authorized in a war council on July 13 . Bradstreet left with 3 @,@ 000 men on July 23 , and Abercrombie then refused to engage in further offensive acts , alleging a shortage of manpower . William Pitt , the British Secretary of State who had designed the British military strategy and received word of the defeat in August , wrote to Abercrombie on September 18 that the " King has judged proper that you should return to England . " Abercrombie continued to be promoted , eventually reaching the rank of full General in 1772 . 
 The fact that Indians allied to the British witnessed the debacle first hand complicated future relations with them . News of the defeat circulated widely in their communities , which had a significant effect on the ability of British agents to recruit Indians to their side for future operations . 
 = = Casualties = = 
 The battle was the bloodiest of the war , with over 3 @,@ 000 casualties suffered . French casualties are normally considered to be comparatively light : 104 killed and 273 wounded in the main battle . Combined with the effective elimination of Trépezet 's force on July 6 , there were about 550 casualties , about 13 percent of the French force , a percentage similar to the losses of the British ( who Chartrand calculates as having lost 11 @.@ 5 to 15 percent ) . 
 General Abercrombie reported 547 killed , 1 @,@ 356 wounded , and 77 missing . Lévis in one report claimed that the French recovered 800 British bodies , implying that Abercrombie may have underreported the actual death toll . Chartrand estimates the number of British killed ( or died of their wounds ) at about 1 @,@ 000 for the main battle , with about 1 @,@ 500 wounded . The skirmish on July 6 cost the British about 100 killed and wounded , and the loss of General Howe . 
 The 42nd Regiment , known as the Black Watch , paid dearly with the loss of many lives and many severely wounded . More than 300 men ( including 8 officers ) were killed , and a similar number were wounded , representing a significant fraction of the total casualties suffered by the British . King George III , later in July 1758 , designated the 42nd a " Royal " regiment , due to its gallantry in earlier battles , and issued letters of service for adding a second battalion " as a testimony of his Majesty 's satisfaction and approbation of the extraordinary courage , loyalty , and exemplary conduct of the Highland regiment . " However , the king did not learn of the regiment 's loss of almost half its strength in this battle until August . 
 A legend has long circulated concerning the death of the Black Watch 's Major Duncan Campbell . In 1742 , the ghost of Campbell 's dead brother is said to have appeared to him in a dream with a promise to meet him again at " Ticonderoga " , a place name that was unknown to him at the time . Campbell died of wounds sustained during the battle . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The actions of both commanders have been extensively analyzed in this action . While Montcalm performed well during the battle , some tactical options escaped his notice , and some of his actions in preparing the defenses at Carillon are open to question . In contrast , almost everything Abercrombie did has been questioned . It is widely held among historians that he was an incompetent commander . 
 = = = Montcalm = = = 
 Both commanders were a product of the environment of European warfare , which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility , and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare . Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers ' Rangers , but saw them as a necessary evil , given the operating environment . Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war , Indian forces were quite low in this battle , and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices . 
 Montcalm in particular would have benefited from practicing a more irregular form of warfare . He apparently never inspected the landing area at the north end of Lake George , which was a location from which he could contest the British landing . Furthermore , the French could then have used the confined woodlands to blunt the numerical advantage of the British , and contested the entire portage road . The fact that fortifications were built along the portage road but then abandoned by the French is one indication of this failure of strategic thinking . Nester estimates that contesting the first crossing on the portage road would have gained Montcalm an additional day for defensive preparations .

Reports reached him that the French strength at Carillon was 6 @,@ 000 , and that a further 3 @,@ 000 were expected . Many of these reports were from French deserters or captives , and Abercrombie should have investigated them by sending out scouts or light infantry . Even if the reports were accurate , Abercrombie 's army still significantly outnumbered that of Montcalm . The same sources must also have reported the shortage of provisions at the fort , a sign that a siege would have ended quickly . 
 Abercrombie 's next error was an apparent over @-@ reliance on the analysis of Matthew Clerk . His lack of experienced engineers caused the state of French defences to be repeatedly misread . What is clear is that Abercrombie , in his stated desire for haste , did not want to act on Clerk 's recommendation to fortify Rattlesnake Hill , and then sought to blame Clerk , claiming he was merely acting on the engineer 's advice . Clerk was one of the battle 's casualties , so he was unavailable to defend himself against assignment of some of the blame . Captain Charles Lee of the 44th Foot wrote , on the prospect of using cannon on Rattlesnake Hill , " There was one hill in particular , which seem 'd to offer itself as an ally to us , it immediately commanded the lines from hence two small cannon well planted must have drove the French in a very short time from their breast work [ ... ] this was never thought of , which ( one <unk> 'd imagine ) must have occur 'd to any blockhead who was not absolutely so far sunk into <unk> as to be <unk> 'd to wear a bib and bells . " 
 The tactical decision not to bring cannons forward was probably one of Abercrombie 's most significant errors . The use of cannon against the French works would have cleared paths through the abatis and breached the breastworks . 
 Abercrombie also had the option to avoid a pitched battle , instead beginning siege operations against the French position . His force was large enough that he could have fully invested the French position and fended off any arriving reinforcements . 
 = = = = Tactics = = = = 
 Abercrombie made two notable errors of judgment during the battle . One was a failure to recognize after the first wave of attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work . Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter , he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions . The second failure was that he apparently never considered ordering a flanking maneuver against the French right . At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses , allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points . In fact , the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers .

 The disorganized nature of the British retreat demonstrated a loss of effective command . An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing , taken stock of the situation , and begun siege operations against the French . Abercrombie , to the surprise of some in his army , ordered a retreat all the way back to the south end of Lake George . Nester , unable to find other rational reasons for this , claims that the general must have panicked .

 While the fort itself was never endangered by the British assault , Ticonderoga became a byword for impregnability . Even though the fort was effectively handed to the British by a retreating French army in 1759 , future defenders of the fort and their superior officers , who may not have been familiar with the site 's shortcomings , fell under the spell of this idea . In 1777 , when General John Burgoyne advanced down Lake Champlain at the beginning of the Saratoga campaign , General George Washington , who had never seen the fort , thought highly of its defensive value . Anthony Wayne , who was at Fort Ticonderoga preparing its defenses before Burgoyne 's arrival , wrote to Washington that the fort " can never be carried , without much loss of blood " . Fort Ticonderoga was surrendered by the Americans without much of a fight in July 1777 . 
 The modern flag of Quebec is based upon a banner reputedly carried by the victorious French forces at Carillon . The banner , now known as the flag of Carillon , dates back to the 17th century , confirmed by textile expert Jean @-@ Michel Tuchscherer : " The flag is without doubt an exceptional piece of document from the 17th century " . As for the coat of arm under the madonna now erased , they were most probably that of Charles , Marquis of Beauharnois ( 1671 – 1749 ) , Governor of New France from 1726 to 1747 : Silver on one side with a saber , <unk> on three <unk> . Only the governor had the right to inscribe his personal crest on a banner with the arms of France , and only Beauharnois had the eagles to support his crest . The flag was probably fabricated around 1726 , date of the arrival of Marquis de Beauharnois , and May 29 , 1732 , date when it was flown for the order of Saint Louis , with its motto : <unk> <unk> <unk> . However , historian Alistair Fraser is of the opinion that stories of the flag 's presence on the battlefield appear to be a 19th @-@ century fabrication , as there is no evidence that the large religious banner ( 2 by 3 meters , or 6 by 10 feet ) on which the flag design was based was actually used as a standard at the battle . 
 = Sestina = 
 A sestina ( Old Occitan : <unk> [ <unk> ] ; also known as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each , normally followed by a three @-@ line envoi . The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas , rotated in a set pattern . 
 The invention of the form is usually attributed to 12th @-@ century troubadour Arnaut Daniel ; after spreading to continental Europe , it first appeared in English in 1579 , though sestinas were rarely written in Britain until the end of the 19th century . It remains a popular poetic form , and many continue to be written by contemporary poets . 
 = = History = = 
 The oldest @-@ known sestina is " Lo <unk> <unk> qu 'el cor m <unk> " , written around 1200 by Arnaut Daniel , a troubadour of Aquitanian origin ; he refers to it as " <unk> " , meaning , more or less , " interlock " . Hence , Daniel is generally considered the form 's inventor , though it has been suggested that he may only have innovated an already existing form . Nevertheless , two other original <unk> sestinas are known , the best known being " Eras , pus vey mon <unk> " by Guilhem <unk> <unk> de <unk> ; there are also two <unk> built on the same end @-@ words , the best known being Ben gran <unk> intra by Bertran de Born . These early sestinas were written in Old Occitan ; the form started spilling into Italian with Dante in the 13th century ; by the 15th , it was used in Portuguese by Luís de Camões . 
 The involvement of Dante and Petrarch in establishing the sestina form , together with the contributions of others in the country , account for its classification as an Italian verse form — despite not originating there . The result was that the sestina was re @-@ imported into France from Italy in the 16th century . Pontus de <unk> was the first poet to attempt the form in French , and the only one to do so prior to the 19th century ; he introduced a partial rhyme scheme in his sestina . 
 = = = English = = = 
 The first appearance of the sestina in English print is " Ye <unk> <unk> " , comprising lines 151 – 89 of the August <unk> in Edmund Spenser 's Shepherd 's Calendar , published in 1579 . It is in unrhymed iambic pentameter , but the order of end @-@ words in each stanza is non @-@ standard – ending <unk> , <unk> , etc . – each stanza promoting the previous final end @-@ word to the first line , but otherwise leaving the order intact ; the envoi order is ( 1 ) 2 / ( 3 ) 4 / ( 5 ) 6 . This scheme was set by the Spaniard <unk> de Cetina . 
 Although they appeared in print later , Philip Sidney 's three sestinas may have been written earlier , and are often credited as the first in English . The first published ( toward the end of Book I of The Countess of Pembroke 's Arcadia , 1590 ) is the double sestina " Ye Goatherd Gods " . In this variant the standard end @-@ word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas , ending with a three @-@ line envoi , resulting in a poem of 75 lines . Two others were published in subsequent editions of the Arcadia . The second , " Since wailing is a bud of <unk> sorrow " , is in the " standard " form . Like " Ye Goatherd Gods " it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings , reflecting the Italian <unk> . The third , " Farewell , O sun , Arcadia 's clearest light " , is the first rhyming sestina in English : it is in iambic <unk> and follows the standard end @-@ word scheme , but rhymes <unk> in the first stanza ( the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza , a consequence of which is that the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets ) . Sidney uses the same envoi structure as Spenser . William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas ( which he called " <unk> " ) in 1616 , which copy the form of Sidney 's rhyming sestina . After this , there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years , with John Frederick Nims noting that , " ... there is not a single sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth , eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . " 
 In the 1870s , there was a revival of interest in French forms , led by Andrew Lang , Austin Dobson , Edmund Gosse , W. E. Henley , John Payne , and others . The earliest sestina of this period is Algernon Charles Swinburne 's " Sestina " . It is in iambic pentameter rhyming <unk> in the first stanza ; each stanza begins by repeating the previous end @-@ words 6 then 1 , but the following 4 lines repeat the remaining end @-@ words ad lib ; the envoi is ( 1 ) 4 / ( 2 ) 3 / ( 5 ) 6 . In the same volume ( Poems and Ballads , Second Series , 1878 ) Swinburne introduces a " double sestina " ( " The Complaint of Lisa " ) that is unlike Sidney 's : it comprises 12 stanzas of 12 iambic pentameter lines each , the first stanza rhyming <unk> . Similar to his " Sestina " , each stanza first repeats end @-@ words 12 then 1 of the previous stanza ; the rest are ad lib . The envoi is ( 12 ) 10 / ( 8 ) 9 / ( 7 ) 4 / ( 3 ) 6 / ( 2 ) 1 / ( 11 ) 5 . 
 From the 1930s , a revival of the form took place across the English @-@ speaking world , led by poets such as W. H. Auden , and the 1950s were described as the " age of the sestina " by James E. B. Breslin . " Sestina : <unk> " by Ezra Pound and " <unk> <unk> " by W. H. Auden are distinguished modern examples of the sestina . The sestina remains a popular closed verse form , and many sestinas continue to be written by contemporary poets ; notable examples include " The Guest Ellen at the Supper for Street People " by David Ferry and " IVF " by Kona Macphee . 
 = = Form = = 
 Although the sestina has been subject to many revisions throughout its development there remain several features that define the form . The sestina is composed of six stanzas of six lines ( <unk> ) , followed by a stanza of three lines ( a tercet ) . There is no rhyme within the stanzas ; instead the sestina is structured through a recurrent pattern of the words that end each line , a technique known as " lexical repetition " . 
 In the original form composed by Daniel , each line is of ten syllables , except the first of each stanza which are of seven . The established form , as developed by Petrarch and Dante , was in <unk> . Since then , changes to the line length have been a relatively common variant , such that Stephen Burt has written : " sestinas , as the form exists today , [ do not ] require expertise with inherited meter ... " . 
 The pattern that the line @-@ ending words follow is often explained if the numbers 1 to 6 are allowed to stand for the end @-@ words of the first stanza . Each successive stanza takes its pattern based upon a bottom @-@ up pairing of the lines of the preceding stanza ( i.e. , last and first , then second @-@ from @-@ last and second , then third @-@ from @-@ last and third ) . Given that the pattern for the first stanza is <unk> , this produces <unk> in the second stanza . 
 Another way of visualising the pattern of line @-@ ending words for each stanza is by the procedure known as <unk> cruciata , which may be rendered as " backward crossing " . The second stanza can be seen to have been formed from three sets of pairs ( 6 – 1 , 5 – 2 , 4 – 3 ) , or two triads ( 1 – 2 – 3 , 4 – 5 – 6 ) . The 1 – 2 – 3 triad appears in its original order , but the 4 – 5 – 6 triad is reversed and superimposed upon it . 
 The pattern of the line @-@ ending words in a sestina is represented both numerically and alphabetically in the following table : 
 The sixth stanza is followed by a tercet that is known variably by the French term envoi , the Occitan term tornada , or , with reference to its size in relation to the preceding stanzas , a " half @-@ stanza " . It consists of three lines that include all six of the line @-@ endings words of the preceding stanzas . This should take the pattern of 2 – 5 , 4 – 3 , 6 – 1 ( numbers relative to the first stanza ) ; the first end @-@ word of each pair can occur anywhere in the line , while the second must end the line . However , the end @-@ word order of the envoi is no longer strictly enforced . 
 The sestina has been subject to some variations , with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas , and also to individual line length . A " double sestina " is the name given to either : two sets of six six @-@ line stanzas , with a three @-@ line envoy ( for a total of 75 lines ) , or twelve twelve @-@ line stanzas , with a six @-@ line envoy ( for a total of 150 lines ) . Examples of either variation are rare ; " Ye Goatherd Gods " by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation , while " The Complaint of Lisa " by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation . In the former variation , the original pattern of line @-@ ending words , i.e. that of the first stanza , recurs in the seventh stanza , and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout . In the second variation , the pattern of line @-@ ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza ; thus it does not , unlike the " single " sestina , allow for every end @-@ word to occupy each of the stanza ends ; end @-@ words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas . 
 A " <unk> " is a contraction of the sestina to three stanzas of three lines ( tercets ) , with a one @-@ line envoy . The order of the line @-@ ending words follows the same pattern as that of the sestina , so that they appear : 123 , 312 , 231 with the envoy as 123 . 
 = = Effect = = 
 The structure of the sestina , which demands adherence to a strict and arbitrary order , produces several effects within a poem . Stephen Burt notes that , " The sestina has served , historically , as a complaint " , its harsh demands acting as " signs for deprivation or duress " . The structure can enhance the subject matter that it orders ; in reference to Elizabeth Bishop 's A Miracle for Breakfast , David Caplan suggests that the form 's " harshly arbitrary demands echo its subject 's " . Nevertheless , the form 's structure has been criticised ; Paul Fussell considers the sestina to be of " dubious structural expressiveness " when composed in English and , irrespective of how it is used , " would seem to be [ a form ] that gives more structural pleasure to the <unk> than to the <unk> . " 
 Margaret Spanos highlights " a number of corresponding levels of tension and resolution " resulting from the structural form , including : structural , semantic and aesthetic tensions . She believes that the aesthetic tension , which results from the " conception of its mathematical completeness and perfection " , set against the " experiences of its labyrinthine complexities " can be resolved in the apprehension of the " harmony of the whole . " 
 The strength of the sestina , according to Stephen Fry , is the " repetition and recycling of elusive patterns that cannot be quite held in the mind all at once " . For Shanna Compton , these patterns are easily discernible by newcomers to the form ; she says that : " Even someone unfamiliar with the form 's rules can tell by the end of the second stanza ... what 's going on ... " . 
 = Honey ( Mariah Carey song ) = 
 " Honey " is a hit song by American singer Mariah Carey from her sixth studio album , Butterfly . It was released as the lead single from the album on August 26 , 1997 . The song was written and produced by Carey , Puff Daddy , Q @-@ Tip and Stevie J. It samples " Hey DJ " by the World 's Famous Supreme Team , and " The Body Rock " by the Treacherous Three . " Honey " was a re @-@ defining song in Carey 's career , pushing her further into the hip @-@ hop music world . 
 The song was acclaimed by music critics , who called Carey 's musical transition " genuine . " " Honey " was successful in the United States , becoming Carey 's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 , a feat that has yet to be duplicated . The song stayed at number one for three weeks . " Honey " also reached number one in Canada , and hit the top ten in Australia , New Zealand , Spain , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . " Honey " was nominated in two categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards , for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . Carey included the song in the set @-@ list of various live shows and future tours , where she would sing both the original and remix versions . 
 " Honey " is well known for its accompanying music video , which presented a more sexual and less conservative image of Carey than had been previously seen . The video features Carey being held hostage in a mansion , which she escapes in a James Bond @-@ themed plot . Subsequent scenes see Carey escaping her assailants on a watercraft , dancing aboard a ship with sailors , and frolicking on a beautiful island with her lover . The video garnered much coverage , as many comparisons were made between the video and the rumors of Carey 's failing marriage . While Carey denied the comparisons were anything more than coincidence , many close friends including Walter Afanasieff , Carey 's writing partner , felt they were more than obvious . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 After the success of her urban crossover album Daydream , Carey began exerting more control over the creative aspects of her career . In doing so , she began pursuing a more hip @-@ hop oriented sound , something very different from anything she had recorded previously . However , she was still writing ballads with Afanasieff , but began looking for more hip @-@ hop / R & B producers to helm part of her new project . The song was recorded in February 1997 . After Carey began working on the song with Q @-@ Tip , they brought the lyrics , samples and melody over to Puff Daddy , who as a producer , had just earned his second number one single on the Hot 100 with " Mo Money Mo Problems . " Due to rumors of Puffy 's overbearing nature , Carey recorded her vocals separately , until she gave him a few demos to choose from . Puffy explained why Carey recorded her vocals separately , and his feelings regarding having worked with her : 
 A lot of people feel I 'm overbearing , so I wasn 't allowed in the studio when she did her vocals . I 'm trying to work on that , I 'm such a perfectionist , sometimes I don 't give people the chance to breathe . So I 've been banned from a lot of studios . Mariah [ recorded " Honey " ] until she thought it was perfect , like a hundred times . She gave me like a hundred tracks to choose from . 
 Puffy expressed his respect for Mariah and her craft , mentioning that she re @-@ did her vocals many times until she felt they were perfect . After they had the vocals , Carey and Puffy began working on the song 's hook and incorporating the music samples and blending them into the bridge and chorus . After the song was completed , Combs was very confident with the song , calling it " slammin ' , " but because of its heavy hip @-@ hop influence , he felt only cautiously optimistic about the song 's commercial success . On a more personal note , " Honey " served as Carey 's first single after her separation from estranged husband , Tommy Mottola , who also lead her current record label , Columbia . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Honey " is an up @-@ tempo song , that blends hip hop and contemporary R & B genres . The song is set in the signature common time , and is written in the key of E ♭ major . It features a basic chord progression of A ♭ -F ♭ -1 . Carey 's vocal range in the song spans from the note of C3 to the high note of B ♭ 5 ; with the piano and guitar pieces range from G ♭ 3 to G ♭ 5 . The song 's remix featured rap leads from The Lox and Mase , with some vocals rapped by Combs himself . The track was very different from anything Carey had ever recorded , and was described as " street Hip @-@ Hop music , with a booming bass . " The song 's melody was driven by Q @-@ Tip 's drum programming and Stevie J 's keyboard notes . Combs 's production gave the song a " light and airy " effect , further distancing it from Carey 's contemporary sound . " Honey " featured musical samples from Treacherous Three 's " The Body Rock , " and " Hey DJ " from the World 's Famous Supreme Team . The track united hip @-@ hop and R & B with traces of pop music and was described as a " [ song with a ] catchy chorus , combining hip @-@ hop and R & B into something that simply wasn 't going to be denied by anyone , and offering a powerful start to a record . " According to author Chris Nickson , " Honey " revealed a more confident and independent side to Carey that had never been presented in her previous work . The song truly embodied a more mature and confident woman , with sultrier lyrics and a thumping hip @-@ hop beat to accompany it . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Honey " garnered acclaimed response from contemporary music critics . David Browne from Entertainment Weekly described the importance the song held for Carey 's musical transition . He wrote " You 're prepared for a song on which Carey finally breaks free of her adult @-@ contemporary chains and gets down . " He felt " Honey " sounded as " anyone striking out on his or her own — caught between old and new habits and taking cautious baby steps into the future . " Browne also commented that Carey showed a commendable vocal restraint in the song , " showing some admirable restraint , she nestles herself into the downy @-@ soft beats of " Honey . " Author Chris Nickson felt the single 's importance was " well beyond its chart placing " and that the single was one of the most important songs in Carey 's career , enabling her to transition into R & B and hip @-@ hop . Nickson commented that before , Carey was seen as a pop singer with R & B tendencies , but " Honey " changed that idea , giving the singer " hip @-@ hop credibility " , and forced naysayers to " take another look . " Rich Juzwiak from Slant complimented the song , calling it " awakening , both sensually and musically . " Juzwiak concluded the review writing " Honey exemplifies the abrupt gear shifting that appreciating Mariah the artist requires . Its new pop brilliance doesn 't always come easy , where detecting it depends on the audience 's newfound ability to apply Carey 's pop life to her pop music . " " Honey " was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremony , for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . The song did not win either nomination , a typical trend of Carey 's nominations at the Grammys . 
 " Honey " won many prestigious awards throughout the music industry in 1997 and 1998 . The song was nominated at the 1998 Grammy Awards for Best Female R & B Vocal Performance and Best R & B Song . Additionally , the song won the BMI Pop Award for " Songwriter . "

 " Honey " became Carey 's third single to debut atop the Billboard Hot 100 ; the most number one debuts of any artist to this day . Additionally , the song became her 12th chart topper , breaking the fifth place record she had shared with Whitney Houston and tying Madonna . It replaced " Mo Money Mo Problems " by The Notorious B.I.G. featuring Puff Daddy and Mase , and it was replaced by Boyz II Men 's " 4 Seasons of Loneliness . " At this point , Carey was tied with The Supremes for fourth most US number ones , behind Michael Jackson with thirteen , and Elvis Presley and The Beatles with 17 and 20 , respectively . " Honey " was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of over one million units . The song stalled at number two on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs , spending 22 weeks in the chart . " Honey " finished number 32 on the Billboard end of year chart for 1997 .

 Aside from the attention surrounding the song , the music video garnered much speculation . For the first time in her career , Carey was featured provocatively dressed , giving viewers a " taste of the freer Mariah . " The Puerto Rico @-@ filmed video 's concept was created by Carey with Paul Hunter filling in as the director . Serving a James Bond theme , Carey was cast as " the very sexy agent M " , a woman who escapes a large mansion in which she has been held captive . Carey said of the video that " I don 't really think the video is overtly sexual , but for me @-@ I mean people used to think I was the nineties version of Mary Poppins ! " 
 The video premiered on MTV and BET in September 1997 and was shot in Puerto Rico on July 26 , 1997 . The video begins with Carey , playing as " Agent M , " being held hostage in a large mansion . The captors are played by Eddie Griffin , Frank <unk> , and Johnny Brennan of The Jerky Boys , who continue to taunt Carey over her capture and eventual death . " Agent M " speaks in Spanish to the captors , saying she can not understand them . After a series of dialogue , Carey escapes her Griffin 's character and dives into a swimming pool from the mansion 's roof . After an ensemble change , Carey dons a swimsuit and escapes the island via a watercraft . The video 's antagonists continue their pursuit of Carey throughout a large body of water , until she arrives aboard a large ship . It is unclear if both scenes are happening separately or side by side . Throughout most of the video , Carey is seen posing on a large sailboat , while wearing a white bikini . After boarding the ship , Carey begins dancing and is soon joined by a group of male sailors . After a sequence of dance light dance routines , Carey is seen on an island with her lover , male model David <unk> , and her real life dog , Jack . They frolic together on the island , while Carey happily enjoys her romance . 
 During the time of the video 's release , Carey and Mottola were in the midst of their divorce and this led to many speculation on the video 's message . Tabloids and critics were linking the video 's theme to Carey 's marriage , writing how Mottola would lock Carey in their mansion . While Carey denied the allegations , many found it to be very obvious . Carey 's writing partner of six years , Afanasieff , felt the video was undeniably about Mottola . While speculation about the video grew , Carey continued to deny any intention of portraying her marriage in the video . In an interview , Carey said that " Tommy loves the video , he says it 's my best video yet . " 
 The song 's Bad Boy remix featured a different music video as well . It features the same concept , however not emphasizing on the kidnapping and escape . The video begins with Carey diving into the pool , and driving a watercraft . As she reaches a point far into the body of water , she is offered a rope lift from a helicopter . After she accepts and ascends the line , Carey boards the aircraft alongside its pilots , Puffy and the members of Bad Boy Entertainment . Other scenes sequence Carey dancing with Puffy in a golden indoor tunnel . As the video concludes , more staff from the helicopter join Carey in the golden entryway , as they dance and enjoy themselves . 
 = = Remixes = = 
 Several remixes were commissioned for " Honey , " most notably the Bad Boy remix and the Classic mix , the latter of which appears on Carey 's remix compilation The Remixes ( 2003 ) . The former is similar to the original version , with the addition of a new spoken intro from Carey in which she states , " I thought I told you , we won 't stop . " The string chords present in the original " Honey " are entirely excised from the Bad Boy remix , and it features rapping verses by The Lox and Mase ( who did the bridge on the original version ) . The rap from Mase entirely replaces the second chorus of the song , while the Lox 's parts replaces a section of the song 's bridge . The song 's main remix , " Honey " ( Bad Boy remix ) , has an accompanying music video , with additional sequences directed by Paul Hunter . Much of the footage from the video is from the original , with few new scenes featuring Carey with Puffy , Mase and the Lox in a long golden tunnel flowing with water ( " The Honey Tunnel " ) . During Mase 's rap , Carey is rescued by them ( rather than joining the sailors on the boat ) when he lowers a rope into the ocean from his helicopter . 
 Another major hip @-@ hop mix of the song was released : " Honey " ( So So Def mix ) , produced by Jermaine Dupri and featuring rap verses from him and Da Brat . Carey re @-@ recorded some of her vocals , but most lyrical and melodic structures were kept similar to the album version . The song uses a new sample from " It 's Great to Be Here " ( originally performed by The Jackson 5 ) , but it does not use " The Body Rock " melody from the album version and Bad Boy remix . The So So Def remix does use the sample of " Hey DJ , " but in a different manner : both the album and Bad Boy remixes use the piano riff from " Hey DJ , " while the So So Def remix uses the line " Hey JD , won 't you play that song , keep them dancing , dancing all night . " David Morales created several dance remixes of the song , the most notable being " Honey " ( Classic mix ) , and variations of this include " Honey " ( Def Club mix ) , " Honey " ( Rascal dub ) , and " Honey " ( Boss Anthem mix ) . These give songwriting credit to the writers of " The Body Rock , " although this is not sampled . Morales is also credited as a songwriter for the remixes , although they are close to the original melodic and lyrical structure of the original song . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 " Honey " was performed on various live television appearances as well as most of Carey 's tours . Carey first performed a mash @-@ up of the song and the Bad Boy remix live on the British music chart program Top of the Pops in 1997 . The performance incorporated themes from both videos , in which Carey was dressed in the same white bikini from the music video . Additionally , the stage was set up to resemble the deck of a ship . Dancers similar to the video joined Carey on stage as she performed the song . Carey performed " Honey " at the 1998 World Music Awards . The performance garnered her a standing ovation , and featured many male dancers , all donning sailor costumes . After the second verse , a large projection of the Bad Boy remix video played while pre @-@ recorded rap verses from Puffy played . A live performance of the song was taped via satellite and aired live in Japan , featuring similar costumes and themes as the others . Carey performed the song throughout her Butterfly World Tour ( 1998 ) , which served as the accompanying tour for Butterfly .
