 The crew are granted shore leave on an alien planet . Lt. Cmdr Chakotay ( Robert Beltran ) and Lt. B 'Elanna Torres ( Roxann Dawson ) attend a mixed martial arts ring sport called " Tsunkatse " . While Captain Kathryn Janeway ( Kate Mulgrew ) visits a neighboring system in the Delta Flyer . Following the match , Seven of Nine ( Jeri Ryan ) and Lt. Cmdr Tuvok ( Tim Russ ) ask Chakotay if they can study a micro @-@ nebula on an away mission . He grants them permission , telling them that they can spend their shore leave in whatever manner they choose . Seven and Tuvok depart in a shuttle , but are captured by an alien vessel en route and Tuvok is injured . Seven is brought to Penk ( Jeffrey Combs ) who blackmails her into fighting in the Tsunkatse matches or else Tuvok will be refused medical treatment . 
 Chakotay invites other crew members to join him at the next Tsunkatse match . These include Neelix ( Ethan Phillips ) , who is forced to restrict his activities following an allergic reaction to a homeopathic medical treatment . They arrive at the bout and Chakotay explains the rules of the fight to Neelix . The first challenger walks out , a Pendari man ( Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson ) , and the Voyager crew are surprised when he is followed by Seven . As the two circle each other , Chakotay contacts Torres on the ship and updates her on the match , ordering her to transport Seven back to Voyager . Torres discovers that Seven is not on the planet 's surface , and the fight is actually a holographic projection . Seven is defeated by the Pendari and later wakes up in the fighter 's barracks where a Hirogen ( J. G. Hertzler ) is healing her with a device . Penk visits the duo and informs Seven that her next match will be to the death . After he leaves , the Hirogen promises to train her . Seven accepts his training , realizing that even if Voyager can rescue them , she and Tuvok must still survive until then . 
 On Voyager , the crew track down the source of the holographic transmission – a much larger ship . Seven is led out for the next Tsunkatse match , and discovers that the Hirogen himself is her opponent . As they start to fight , Voyager attacks the Tsunkatse vessel and destroys a localized shield generator . Torres transports Tuvok off the ship , but Seven isn 't in the unshielded area of the ship . The Hirogen takes the advantage in the match , and Voyager 's weapons are taken offline . Janeway arrives in the Delta Flyer and destroys the <unk> ship 's signal generators which broadcast the matches . Penk reroutes power to another transmitter , thus weakening his shields . As Seven takes her position to reluctantly kill the Hirogen , both are transported onto Voyager . Afterwards , Chakotay tells the Hirogen that they are en route to transfer him to a vessel of his species . The Hirogen thanks the crew and tells them that he plans to look for his son . 
 = = Production = = 
 An early version of the script had Tuvok involved in the fighting , but it was decided that it would be more dramatic if there was a character involved who was not as adept at fighting . Instead , it was decided to have the character of Seven of Nine featured in this way which Tim Russ later described as a " clever marketing ploy " as UPN promoted that character heavily at the time . The episode was originally entitled " Arena " , but was subsequently renamed to " Tsunkatse " . 
 WWE wrestler and actor Dwayne " The Rock " Johnson appeared as the Pendari Champion in a guest role . Johnson performed his own stunts in the episode , although the other actors were represented in the fight scenes by stunt doubles . He used one of his signature moves , the " Rock Bottom " , during the fight scenes against Ryan 's Seven of Nine as well as other wrestling moves . Despite the use of stunt doubles and the choreography of the fight scenes , Ryan was still reportedly quite sore after the first day 's shooting completed . 
 The episode also featured guest appearances by actors J. G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Combs best known to Star Trek fans from the series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine where they respectively played Martok and the double role of Weyoun and Brunt . Combs described his character as the " Don King of my quadrant " , but was a little uneasy about appearing on Voyager after 35 episodes of Deep Space Nine as some of the sets from his former show had been re @-@ used in a different manner , saying " It felt like how an old person might feel going home , but things are not quite the same . " 
 Hertzler said in an interview that he based his character on the role played by Morgan Freeman in the film The Shawshank Redemption ( 1994 ) . He said that " Freeman plays a <unk> . A guy that 's been a <unk> in prison has a different attitude toward life and death . " Other influences included Tony Todd , who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode " Prey " , and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles , saying " The frustrating thing for me was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads , a huge chest piece , a fabulous helmet . I didn 't get any of that . I was in a skintight rubber suit . Had I been 23 , I would have been much happier , but at 49 ? " 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Tsunkatse " was first aired on February 9 , 2000 on the UPN network during the sweeps month . It received a Nielsen rating of 4 @.@ 1 / 6 percent , meaning that it was seen by 4 @.@ 1 percent of all households , and 6 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . This placed it in sixth place during the timeslot , but was the most watched episode of the sixth season . It was a slight increase in ratings compared to the previous year 's episode " Bliss " , which received ratings of 3 @.@ 9 percent . However , it was the only episode broadcast in 2000 which saw an improvement from the same sweeps month during the previous year . The episode suffered from a negative fan reaction upon release , with it seen as an attempt to crossover between Voyager and UPN 's other show , WWF SmackDown . 
 Michelle Erica Green , in her review for TrekNation , described the episode as the opposite of Gene Roddenberry 's original ideals for Star Trek but enjoyed the performances of Combs and Hertzler . She thought that Chakotay was poorly characterized in the episode , and predicted that the events portrayed would typically be forgotten by the next episode . Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " said that he thought that the episode would be a " ratings @-@ stunt disaster " but that it turned out to be " surprisingly okay " . However , he thought that the plot was absent but the episode was carried by strong guest stars and gave it a score of two and a half out of four , calling it " entertainingly assembled trash " . 
 Peter Franks reviewed the VHS release of the episode for Dreamwatch magazine , saying that it was " below average " and could have been a plot used on Star Trek : The Next Generation with Data replacing Seven of Nine . In the season six review by Dreamwatch , " Tsunkatse " was given a rating of three out of five . The fight scenes in the episode were reviewed by Robert W. Young for Black Belt magazine . Young described it as being " uncharacteristically cool from a martial arts perspective " and that " it was nice to see a value @-@ judgement @-@ free depiction of no @-@ holds @-@ barred competition on such a respected TV series . " He thought that the combat itself was believable and that Seven may have been using moves taken from Jeet Kune Do , a style founded by Bruce Lee . He summed it up by saying that in this episode " The martial arts of Star Trek have finally gone where no one has gone before . " 
 " Tsunkatse " was first released as a two episode VHS cassette alongside " Collective " in the United Kingdom on October 2 , 2000 . It was included in the season six DVD set , released in the United States and Canada on December 7 , 2004 .

 Manchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford , Greater Manchester , England , that competes in the Premier League , the top flight of English football . Nicknamed " the Red Devils " , the club was founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878 , changed its name to Manchester United in 1902 and moved to its current stadium , Old Trafford , in 1910 . 
 Manchester United have won a record 20 league titles , a joint @-@ record 12 FA Cups , four League Cups and a record 20 FA Community Shields . The club has also won three European Cups , one UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , one UEFA Super Cup , one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup . In 1998 – 99 , the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the treble of the Premier League , the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League . 
 The 1958 Munich air disaster claimed the lives of eight players . In 1968 , under the management of Matt Busby , Manchester United became the first English football club to win the European Cup . Alex Ferguson won 38 trophies , including 13 Premier League titles , 5 FA Cups and 2 UEFA Champions Leagues , between 1986 and 2013 , when he announced his retirement . José Mourinho is the club 's current manager , having been appointed on 27 May 2016 . 
 Manchester United was the second highest @-@ earning football club in the world for 2013 – 14 , with an annual revenue of € 518 million , and the world 's third most valuable football club in 2015 , valued at $ 1 @.@ 98 billion . As of June 2015 , it is the world 's most valuable football brand , estimated to be worth $ 1 @.@ 2 billion . It is one of the most widely supported football teams in the world . After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 , the club was purchased by Malcolm Glazer in May 2005 in a deal valuing the club at almost £ 800 million , after which the company was taken private again . In August 2012 , Manchester United made an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange . The club holds several rivalries , most notably with Liverpool , Manchester City and Leeds United , and more recently with Arsenal .

 Manchester United was formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway ( LYR ) depot at Newton Heath . The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies , but on 20 November 1880 , they competed in their first recorded match ; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6 – 0 by Bolton Wanderers ' reserve team . By 1888 , the club had become a founding member of The Combination , a regional football league . Following the league 's dissolution after only one season , Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance , which ran for three seasons before being merged with the Football League . This resulted in the club starting the 1892 – 93 season in the First Division , by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the " LYR " from its name . After two seasons , the club was relegated to the Second Division . 
 In January 1902 , with debts of £ 2 @,@ 670 – equivalent to £ 260 @,@ 000 in 2016 – the club was served with a winding @-@ up order . Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen , including John Henry Davies ( who became club president ) , each willing to invest £ 500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name ; on 24 April 1902 , Manchester United was officially born . Under Ernest Mangnall , who assumed managerial duties in 1903 , the team finished as Second Division runners @-@ up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division , which they won in 1908 – the club 's first league title . The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield and ended with the club 's first FA Cup title . Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911 , but at the end of the following season , Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City . 
 In 1922 , three years after the resumption of football following the First World War , the club was relegated to the Second Division , where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925 . Relegated again in 1931 , Manchester United became a yo @-@ yo club , achieving its all @-@ time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934 . Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927 , the club 's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson , who , in December 1931 , invested £ 2 @,@ 000 and assumed control of the club . In the 1938 – 39 season , the last year of football before the Second World War , the club finished 14th in the First Division . 
 = = = Busby years ( 1945 – 1969 ) = = = 
 In October 1945 , the impending resumption of football led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby , who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection , player transfers and training sessions . Busby led the team to second @-@ place league finishes in 1947 , 1948 and 1949 , and to FA Cup victory in 1948 . In 1952 , the club won the First Division , its first league title for 41 years . With an average age of 22 , the back @-@ to @-@ back title winning side of 1956 were labelled " the Busby Babes " by the media , a testament to Busby 's faith in his youth players . In 1957 , Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup , despite objections from The Football League , who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season . En route to the semi @-@ final , which they lost to Real Madrid , the team recorded a 10 – 0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht , which remains the club 's biggest victory on record . 
 The following season , on the way home from a European Cup quarter @-@ final victory against Red Star Belgrade , the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players , officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich , Germany . The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives , including those of eight players – Geoff Bent , Roger Byrne , Eddie Colman , Duncan Edwards , Mark Jones , David Pegg , Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more . 
 Reserve team manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club 's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final , which they lost to Bolton Wanderers . In recognition of the team 's tragedy , UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958 – 59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers . Despite approval from the FA , the Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition , since it had not qualified . Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand , who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963 . The following season , they finished second in the league , then won the title in 1965 and 1967 . In 1968 , Manchester United became the first English ( and second British ) club to win the European Cup , beating Benfica 4 – 1 in the final with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year : Bobby Charlton , Denis Law and George Best . Matt Busby resigned as manager in 1969 and was replaced by the reserve team coach , former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness . 
 = = = 1969 – 1986 = = = 
 Following an eighth @-@ place finish in the 1969 – 70 season and a poor start to the 1970 – 71 season , Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties , and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach . In June 1971 , Frank O 'Farrell was appointed as manager , but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972 . Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season , only to see them relegated in 1974 ; by that time the trio of Best , Law , and Charlton had left the club . The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976 , but were beaten by Southampton . They reached the final again in 1977 , beating Liverpool 2 – 1 . Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards , following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist 's wife . 
 Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977 . Despite major signings , including Joe Jordan , Gordon McQueen , Gary Bailey , and Ray Wilkins , the team failed to achieve any significant results ; they finished in the top two in 1979 – 80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup Final . Sexton was dismissed in 1981 , even though the team won the last seven games under his direction . He was replaced by Ron Atkinson , who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion . Under Atkinson , Manchester United won the FA Cup twice in three years – in 1983 and 1985 . In 1985 – 86 , after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches , the club was favourite to win the league , but finished in fourth place . The following season , with the club in danger of relegation by November , Atkinson was dismissed . 
 = = = Ferguson years ( 1986 – 2013 ) = = = 
 Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson 's dismissal , and guided the club to an 11th @-@ place finish in the league . Despite a second @-@ place finish in 1987 – 88 , the club was back in 11th place the following season . Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed , victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay ( after a 3 – 3 draw ) saved Ferguson 's career . The following season , Manchester United claimed its first Cup Winners ' Cup title and competed in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup , beating European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1 – 0 in the final at Old Trafford . A second consecutive League Cup final appearance followed in 1992 , in which the team beat Nottingham Forest 1 – 0 at Wembley . In 1993 , the club won its first league title since 1967 , and a year later , for the first time since 1957 , it won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first " Double " in the club 's history . 
 In the 1998 – 99 season , Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League , FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – " The Treble " – in the same season . Losing 1 – 0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final , Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich , in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time . The club also won the Intercontinental Cup after beating Palmeiras 1 – 0 in Tokyo . Ferguson was subsequently knighted for his services to football . 
 Manchester United won the league again in the 1999 – 2000 and 2000 – 01 seasons . The team finished third in 2001 – 02 , before regaining the title in 2002 – 03 . They won the 2003 – 04 FA Cup , beating Millwall 3 – 0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . In the 2005 – 06 season , Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade , but recovered to secure a second @-@ place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final . The club regained the Premier League in the 2006 – 07 and 2007 – 08 seasons , and completed the European double by beating Chelsea 6 – 5 on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final in Moscow 's Luzhniki Stadium . Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in this game , overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton . In December 2008 , the club won the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup and followed this with the 2008 – 09 Football League Cup , and its third successive Premier League title . That summer , Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £ 80 million . In 2010 , Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2 – 1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup , its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition . 
 After finishing as runner @-@ up to Chelsea in the 2009 – 10 season , United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010 – 11 , securing the championship with a 1 – 1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011 . This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012 – 13 , securing the championship with a 3 – 0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013 . 
 = = = 2013 – present = = = 
 On 8 May 2013 , Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season , but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador . The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July , having signed a six @-@ year contract . Ryan Giggs took over as interim player @-@ manager 10 months later , on 22 April 2014 , when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995 – 96 . They also failed to qualify for the Europa League , meaning that it was the first time Manchester United hadn 't qualified for a European competition since 1990 . On 19 May 2014 , it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three @-@ year deal , with Giggs as his assistant . Malcolm Glazer , the patriarch of the Glazer family that owns the club , died on 28 May 2014 . 
 Although Van Gaal 's first season saw United once again qualify for the Champions League through a fourth @-@ place finish in the Premier League , his second season saw United go out of the same tournament in the group stage . United also fell behind in the title race for the third consecutive season , finishing in 5th place , in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal 's tenure . However , that same season , Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time , putting them on par with Arsenal in total FA Cup wins . Despite this victory , Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later , with José Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May , signing a three @-@ year contract . 
 = = Crest and colours = = 
 The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms , although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail . The devil stems from the club 's nickname " The Red Devils " ; it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s , and incorporated into the club crest in 1970 , although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971 ( unless the team was playing in a Cup Final ) . 
 Newton Heath 's uniform in 1879 , four years before the club played its first competitive match , has been documented as ' white with blue cord ' . A photograph of the Newton Heath team , taken in 1892 , is believed to show the players wearing red @-@ and @-@ white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers . Between 1894 – 96 , the players wore distinctive green and gold jerseys which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts , which were worn with navy blue shorts . 
 After the name change in 1902 , the club colours were changed to red shirts , white shorts , and black socks , which has become the standard Manchester United home kit . Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red " V " around the neck , similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup Final . They remained part of their home kits until 1927 . For a period in 1934 , the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours , but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club 's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change . The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965 , where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 , when the club reverted to black . Black shorts and / or white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip , most often in away games , if there is a clash with the opponent 's kit . The current home kit is a red shirt with a white v @-@ neck collar with black and red trim , the trademark Adidas three stripes going along the shoulders and sleeves with a space to accommodate sleeve patches , and white cuffs . 
 The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt , black shorts and white socks , but there have been several exceptions . These include an all @-@ black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995 , the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999 – 2000 season , and the 2011 – 12 away kit , which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes , with black shorts and blue socks . An all @-@ grey away kit worn during the 1995 – 96 season was dropped after just five games , most notoriously against Southampton where Alex Ferguson forced the team to change into the third kit during half @-@ time of its final outing . The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their team @-@ mates against the crowd , United failed to win a competitive game in the kit . In 2001 , to celebrate 100 years as " Manchester United " , a reversible white / gold away kit was released , although the actual match day shirts were not reversible . 
 The club 's third kit is often all @-@ blue , this was most recently the case during the 2014 – 15 season . Exceptions include a green @-@ and @-@ gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994 , a blue @-@ and @-@ white striped shirt worn during the 1994 – 95 and 1995 – 96 seasons and once in 1996 – 97 , an all @-@ black kit worn during the Treble @-@ winning 1998 – 99 season , and a white shirt with black @-@ and @-@ red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003 and 2005 . Since 2006 – 07 , the third kit has usually been the previous season 's away kit , the exceptions being the 2008 – 09 and 2014 – 15 seasons .

 Notes

 Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road , close to the railway yard ; the original capacity was about 12 @,@ 000 , but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League . Some expansion took place in 1887 , and in 1891 , Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands , each able to hold 1 @,@ 000 spectators . Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road , the highest documented attendance was approximately 15 @,@ 000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893 . A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889 . 
 In June 1893 , after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners , Manchester Deans and Canons , who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground , secretary A. H. <unk> procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton . It initially had no stands , by the start of the 1893 – 94 season , two had been built ; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the " Bradford end " . At the opposite end , the " Clayton end " , the ground had been " built up , thousands thus being provided for " . Newton Heath 's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893 , when 10 @,@ 000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat @-@ trick , Newton Heath 's only goals in a 3 – 2 win . The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later . In October 1895 , before the visit of Manchester City , the club purchased a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club , and put up another stand on the " reserved side " ( as distinct from the " popular side " ) . However , weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12 @,@ 000 . 
 When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902 , club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club 's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham . Following financial investment , new club president John Henry Davies paid £ 500 for the erection of a new 1 @,@ 000 @-@ seat stand at Bank Street . Within four years , the stadium had cover on all four sides , as well as the ability to hold approximately 50 @,@ 000 spectators , some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand . 
 However , following Manchester United 's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later , it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies ' ambition ; in February 1909 , six weeks before the club 's first FA Cup title , Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United , following the purchase of land for around £ 60 @,@ 000 . Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £ 30 @,@ 000 for construction ; original plans called for seating capacity of 100 @,@ 000 , though budget constraints forced a revision to 77 @,@ 000 . The building was constructed by Messrs <unk> and Smith of Manchester . The stadium 's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939 , when an FA Cup semi @-@ final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76 @,@ 962 spectators . 
 Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium ; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter . After the war , the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £ 22 @,@ 278 . While reconstruction took place , the team played its " home " games at Manchester City 's Maine Road ground ; Manchester United was charged £ 5 @,@ 000 per year , plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts . Later improvements included the addition of roofs , first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands . The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans ' views , and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure . The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof , completed in time for the 1993 – 94 season . First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £ 40 @,@ 000 , four 180 @-@ foot ( 55 m ) pylons were erected , each housing 54 individual floodlights . These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand , which remains in use today . 
 The Taylor Report 's requirement for an all @-@ seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44 @,@ 000 by 1993 . In 1995 , the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers , restoring capacity to approximately 55 @,@ 000 . At the end of the 1998 – 99 season , second tiers were added to the East and West Stands , raising capacity to around 67 @,@ 000 , and between July 2005 and May 2006 , 8 @,@ 000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north @-@ west and north @-@ east quadrants . Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006 , when an attendance of 69 @,@ 070 became a new Premier League record . The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007 , when 76 @,@ 098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4 – 1 , with just 114 seats ( 0 @.@ 15 per cent of the total capacity of 76 @,@ 212 ) unoccupied . In 2009 , reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75 @,@ 957 . Manchester United has the second highest average attendance of European football clubs only behind Borussia Dortmund .

The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club ( MUSC ) , in at least 24 countries . The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours . Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide , while other estimates put this figure closer to 333 million . The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams ( after Barcelona and Real Madrid ) , with over 67 million Facebook fans as of November 2015 . A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League . 
 Supporters are represented by two independent bodies ; the Independent Manchester United Supporters ' Association ( IMUSA ) , which maintains close links to the club through the <unk> Fans Forum , and the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust ( MUST ) . After the Glazer family 's takeover in 2005 , a group of fans formed a splinter club , F.C. United of Manchester . The West Stand of Old Trafford – the " Stretford End " – is the home end and the traditional source of the club 's most vocal support . 
 = = = Rivalries = = = 
 Manchester United has rivalries with Arsenal , Leeds United , Liverpool , and Manchester City , against whom they contest the Manchester derby . 
 The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port . Manchester United and Liverpool are also the two most successful teams in England and , at many points in their history , they have battled each other for the league title ( most recently in the 2008 – 09 season ) . Their matches are usually considered by the players and their fans as the biggest in any given season . 
 The " Roses Rivalry " with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses , fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York , with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire . 
 The rivalry with Arsenal arises from the numerous times the two teams , as well as managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger , have battled for the Premier League title . With 33 titles between them ( 20 for Manchester United , 13 for Arsenal ) this fixture has become known as one of the finest Premier League match @-@ ups in history . 
 = = Global brand = = 
 Manchester United has been described as a global brand ; a 2011 report by Brand Finance , valued the club 's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £ 412 million – an increase of £ 39 million on the previous year , valuing it at £ 11 million more than the second best brand , Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA ( Extremely Strong ) . In July 2012 , Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands , valuing the Manchester United brand at $ 2 @.@ 23 billion . The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League ( behind Real Madrid and Barcelona ) . In January 2013 , the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $ 3 billion . Forbes Magazine valued the club at $ 3 @.@ 3 billion – $ 1 @.@ 2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team . 
 The core strength of Manchester United 's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby 's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster , which drew worldwide acclaim . The " iconic " team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles ( members of England 's World Cup winning team ) , Denis Law and George Best . The attacking style of play adopted by this team ( in contrast to the defensive @-@ minded " catenaccio " approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era ) " captured the imagination of the English footballing public " . Busby 's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s ; George Best , known as the " fifth Beatle " for his iconic haircut , was the first footballer to significantly develop an off @-@ the @-@ field media profile . 
 As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991 , the club raised significant capital , with which it further developed its commercial strategy . The club 's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses . The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off @-@ the @-@ field media attention to individual players , most notably David Beckham ( who quickly developed his own global brand ) . This attention often generates greater interest in on @-@ the @-@ field activities , and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure . During his time with the club , Beckham 's popularity across Asia was integral to the club 's commercial success in that part of the world . 
 Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights , success on the field generates greater income for the club . Since the inception of the Premier League , Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal . Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club ; in 2005 – 06 , the club 's commercial arm generated £ 51 million , compared to £ 42 @.@ 5 million at Chelsea , £ 39 @.@ 3 million at Liverpool , £ 34 million at Arsenal and £ 27 @.@ 9 million at Newcastle United . A key sponsorship relationship is with sportswear company Nike , who manage the club 's merchandising operation as part of a £ 303 million 13 @-@ year partnership established in 2002 . Through Manchester United Finance and the club 's membership scheme , One United , those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services . Additionally , Manchester United @-@ branded media services – such as the club 's dedicated television channel , MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium . 
 = = = Sponsorship = = = 
 In an initial five @-@ year deal worth £ 500 @,@ 000 , Sharp Electronics became the club 's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982 – 83 season , a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999 – 2000 season , when Vodafone agreed a four @-@ year , £ 30 million deal . Vodafone agreed to pay £ 36 million to extend the deal by four years , but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League . 
 To commence at the start of the 2006 – 07 season , American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four @-@ year £ 56 @.@ 5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world . At the beginning of the 2010 – 11 season , American reinsurance company Aon became the club 's principal sponsor in a four @-@ year deal reputed to be worth approximately £ 80 million , making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history . Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011 , agreeing a four @-@ year deal with DHL reported to be worth £ 40 million ; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football . The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012 , although they remained the club 's official logistics partner . The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £ 180 million over eight years , which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre . 
 The club 's first kit manufacturer was Umbro , until a five @-@ year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975 . Adidas received the contract in 1980 , before Umbro started a second spell in 1992 . Umbro 's sponsorship lasted for ten years , followed by Nike 's record @-@ breaking £ 302 @.@ 9 million deal that lasted until 2015 ; 3 @.@ 8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company . In addition to Nike and Chevrolet , the club also has several lower @-@ level " platinum " sponsors , including Aon and Budweiser . 
 On 30 July 2012 , United signed a seven @-@ year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors , which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014 – 15 season . The new $ 80m @-@ a @-@ year shirt deal is worth $ <unk> over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet . Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014 – 15 season , citing rising costs . Since the start of the 2015 – 16 season , Adidas has manufactured Manchester United 's kit as part of a world @-@ record 10 @-@ year deal worth a minimum of £ 750 million . 
 = = Ownership and finances = = 
 Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company , the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £ 1 via an application form . In 1902 , majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £ 500 to save the club from bankruptcy , including future club president John Henry Davies . After his death in 1927 , the club faced bankruptcy yet again , but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson , who assumed control of the club after an investment of £ 2 @,@ 000 . Gibson promoted his son , Alan , to the board in 1948 , but died three years later ; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James ' wife , Lillian , but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman . 
 Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster , Louis Edwards , a friend of Matt Busby , began acquiring shares in the club ; for an investment of approximately £ 40 @,@ 000 , he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964 . When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971 , her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards ' son , Martin , in 1978 ; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father 's death in 1980 . Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984 , but did not meet Edwards ' asking price . In 1989 , chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £ 20 million , but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the Board of Directors instead . 
 Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 ( raising £ 6 @.@ 7 million ) , and received yet another takeover bid in 1998 , this time from Rupert Murdoch 's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation . This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover . The Manchester United board accepted a £ 623 million offer , but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999 . A few years later , a power struggle emerged between the club 's manager , Alex Ferguson , and his horse @-@ racing partners , John Magnier and J. P. McManus , who had gradually become the majority shareholders . In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar , Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager , and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen 's majority . 
 In May 2005 , Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28 @.@ 7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier , thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £ 800 million ( then approx . $ 1 @.@ 5 billion ) . Once the purchase was complete , the club was taken off the stock exchange . In July 2006 , the club announced a £ 660 million debt refinancing package , resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £ 62 million a year . In January 2010 , with debts of £ 716 @.@ 5 million ( $ 1 @.@ 17 billion ) , Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £ 504 million , enabling them to pay off most of the £ 509 million owed to international banks . The annual interest payable on the bonds – which mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £ 45 million per annum . Despite restructuring , the club 's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010 , at Old Trafford and the club 's Trafford Training Centre . Supporter groups encouraged match @-@ going fans to wear green and gold , the colours of Newton Heath . On 30 January , reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters ' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans , dubbed the " Red Knights " , with plans to buying out the Glazers ' controlling interest . 
 In August 2011 , the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $ 1 billion ( approx . £ 600 million ) initial public offering ( IPO ) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £ 2 billion . However , in July 2012 , the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead . Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $ 16 and $ 20 each , but the price was cut to $ 14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August , following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook 's disappointing stock market debut in May . Even after the cut , Manchester United was valued at $ 2 @.@ 3 billion , making it the most valuable football club in the world .

 = New York State Route 83 = 
 New York State Route 83 ( NY 83 ) is a state route located entirely in Chautauqua County , New York in the United States . It extends from an intersection with U.S. Route 62 ( US 62 ) in the hamlet of Conewango Valley ( at the Cattaraugus County border ) to NY 60 in the hamlet of Laona , near Fredonia . Along the way , NY 83 intersects with NY 322 at Balcom Corners and serves the village of Cherry Creek . 
 NY 83 initially extended south to Frewsburg when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering . The portion of the route between Frewsburg and Conewango Valley became part of US 62 c . 1932 , resulting in the truncation of NY 83 to its current southern terminus in the 1940s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 83 begins at US 62 in the hamlet of Conewango Valley , located in the northeastern corner of the town of Ellington . The route heads north @-@ northwestward , paralleling a pair of train tracks , and shortly after enters the village of Cherry Creek , where it intersects County Route 70 ( CR 70 ) and CR 68 , respectively . Known as Main Street , it bows out to the east slightly , and subsequently takes on a due north path as it heads through the town of Cherry Creek . A couple miles later , it reaches the hamlet of Balcom Corners ( located in the town of Villenova ) , a community situated at the junction of NY 83 and the western terminus of NY 322 . Here , NY 83 turns westward toward the community of Hamlet , where it intersects with CR 72 . 
 NY 83 begins a more erratic routing , passing between West Mud Lake and Black Pond as it enters the town of Arkwright . For a short distance it is concurrent with CR 85 , and takes on the name Black Corner Street , so named because it is located within the hamlet of Black Corners . Although this portion of NY 83 is cosigned with CR 85 , it is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation . An intersection with CR 79 is not far off , as it passes just north of the town of Arkwright . NY 83 proceeds west @-@ northwest until it reaches its ending terminus at NY 60 in the community of Laona , located just west of the Arkwright town line in Pomfret . 
 = = History = = 
 NY 83 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an alignment extending from Frewsburg in the south to Laona in the north . US 62 was extended into New York c . 1932 , overlapping NY 83 from Frewsburg to Conewango Valley . The overlap was eliminated in the 1940s when NY 83 was truncated to its junction with US 62 in Conewango Valley .

 " 7 Things " is a song by American singer @-@ songwriter and actress Miley Cyrus . The song was written by Cyrus and co @-@ written by Antonina Armato , and Tim James and produced by John Fields . It was released on June 17 , 2008 by Hollywood Records as the lead single from the first studio album released by Cyrus with no ties to her character Hannah Montana from the Disney Channel comedy series of the same name . Also registered as " Seven Things I Hate About You " , Cyrus developed the song during the Best of Both Worlds Tour while feeling numerous emotions for an ex @-@ boyfriend , mainly being furious . The song 's release brought allegations that it was about Nick Jonas of the Jonas Brothers , which Cyrus neither confirmed nor denied . Musically , " 7 Things " bears aspects of both country and pop punk , while the lyrics in the song 's refrain list seven traits Cyrus hates about an ex @-@ boyfriend . 
 " 7 Things " received mixed to positive reviews from music critics and enjoyed worldwide commercial success , becoming a top ten hit on charts in Australia , Japan , Norway , and the United States . The single was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) , while its appearance on the Japan Hot 100 made " 7 Things " Cyrus ' first song to chart in an Asian country . The song 's accompanying music video was directed by Brett Ratner and features Cyrus performing the song with a back @-@ up band as many teenage girls lipsync along . The girls clutch a variety of props , such as love letters and snow globes , inspired by personal items Cyrus ' ex had given her . The video was nominated for an MTV Video Music Award at both the 2008 and 2009 award shows . Cyrus promoted the song through several venues including her world tours , the Wonder World Tour and the Gypsy Heart Tour . 
 = = Background = = 
 " 7 Things " is also under the legal title of " Seven Things I Hate About You " , as registered by Broadcast Music Incorporated ( BMI ) . Like most of the songs on Breakout , Cyrus conceived " 7 Things " while traveling on the Best of Both Worlds Tour from October 2007 to January 2008 . 
 " I was locked up in the bus the entire time . And it was , like , such a great time for me to have a minute for myself , which I never get . So it was awesome to get to do that and just kinda go through all the different stages of what 's been going on the last couple of years . And I just thought it 'd be fun to just kinda . I didn 't even mean for it to be for , you know , the record or for anything . It was just like ' just start writing this ' . I got into it and I played some of it for my sister and she was like , ' dude , that 's awesome ' . And it was just so much fun to have , like , a good , little therapy moment for me , just to be able to go through everything . It was awesome . It was so much fun to write . " 
 Cyrus says " 7 Things " was inspired by an ex @-@ boyfriend . In an interview with Ryan Seacrest , Cyrus said that she was " going through [ ... ] nine @-@ hundred different emotions while trying to write [ the ] song " and that her use of the word " hate " demonstrated how furious she was . When Seacrest asked if she was worried the song 's subject would hear it and be upset , Cyrus responded that while she was slightly worried , " I want him to be upset . That was my point . " She showed her draft to co @-@ songwriters and producers Tim James and Antonia Armato , who suggested adding it to Breakout . Originally , " 7 Things " was more " soft and nice " but Cyrus says she " went nuts " during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound . Cyrus had initially chosen " Fly on the Wall " as the lead single from Breakout , but replaced it with " 7 Things " because she felt it was a " better introduction " to the album . 
 = = = Nick Jonas allegations = = = 
 Allegations that " 7 Things " was about Nick Jonas , lead singer of the Jonas Brothers , sprouted soon after the song 's premiere on the May 13 , 2008 broadcast of the Elvis Duran and the Morning Show . Cyrus and Jonas had dated for two @-@ and a half years before breaking up in late 2008 . Cyrus claimed , " Nick and I loved each other " and that after the breakup she " bawled for a month straight " while trying to rebel " against everything Nick wanted [ her ] to be " . 
 Henry Freeland of Paste described " 7 Things " as " the list of reasons she hates an ex @-@ boyfriend ( who just might be lead Jonas Brother , Nick ) " and her " concern [ ... ] that all of this hatred only leads them to love Maybe @-@ Nick [ ... ] all the more " . Blogger Molly Lambert , quoted in The New York Times said , " [ Cyrus ] had recently broken up with her first serious boyfriend — a fellow Disney celebrity , Nick Jonas , of the Jonas Brothers , who was also her arena @-@ concert tour mate during their secret two @-@ year affair . In the video for ' 7 Things ' she wears Nick ’ s diabetes dog tags while singing about how his vanity and insecurity undermined their relationship . " Jessica Herndon of People similarly points out the necklace and the fact that Jonas , " who split with Cyrus in late 2008 after two @-@ and a half years of dating – has Type 1 diabetes and is a spokesperson for awareness of the disease . " When asked if the allegations were true , Cyrus said , 
 " [ W ] ith ' 7 Things , ' I think a lot of people do , you know , think it ’ s about Nick Jonas , and if they think it is , that ’ s fine , or whoever they think it ’ s about . But mostly that song is about who , um , they want it to be to . Like mostly , it ’ s if a girl hates her current , or ex @-@ boyfriend — for me it ’ s an ex @-@ boyfriend — so I think , you know , like , Nick is someone that was really important in my life , but I don ’ t hate him . It ’ s a good song and it ’ s fun . " 
 While Jonas responded the allegations with , " I think it ’ s funny . Honestly , I ’ m not insecure , my friends are cool — so it can ’ t be about me ! " According to Tiger Beat magazine , when Cyrus ' best friend Mandy <unk> was asked if " 7 Things " was about Jonas ; she responded , " yes " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " 7 Things " is a pop punk song with a length of three minutes and 33 seconds . According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine , the song 's verses are tinged with country while its refrains bear pop punk aspects . The song is set in common time and has moderate rock tempo of 108 beats per minute . It is written in the key of E major while Cyrus ' vocals span one octave , ranging from G # 3 to G # 4 . Fraser McAlpine of the BBC called the song " a three @-@ tempo patchwork quilt " . In the song 's introduction , the band begins to strum acoustic guitars at a moderate tempo while Cyrus chants " sha " . The tempo continues as Cyrus begins the first verse in the song 's fourth bar . At each chorus , " 7 Things " speeds up dramatically and Cyrus ' vocals become aggressive and forceful ; Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly described the transition as " from sensitive breakup song in the strummy verses to punky @-@ pop kiss @-@ off in the double @-@ time choruses . " McAlpine noted the stress Cyrus places on vowels in the song : " ' <unk> ' instead of ' you ' , ' <unk> ' instead of ' oh ' , and so on ... " . 
 The song 's lyrics are written in second person , a message from the singer to her ex @-@ boyfriend detailing the hurt he caused her while they were dating . The refrain is a list of the seven traits the singer " hates " most about her ex , with the seventh item being her frustration that despite his flaws , he makes her love him . Ben Ratliff of The New York Times noted that the list actually " runs to 8 to 11 things , depending on how you parse it " . Henry Freedland of Paste magazine compared it to a similar list featured as a poem in the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You . In one verse , Cyrus asks for a sincere apology and states , " If you text it , I 'll delete it " , which Molly Lambert of The New York Times said " perfectly captur [ es ] our confusing age of technologically mediated courtship . " The song concludes with a variation of the refrain , in which Cyrus names the seven things she likes the most about her ex , again concluding with " you make me love you " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " 7 Things " received mixed reviews from critics . Fraser McAlpine of the BBC called the song " smashing " , complimenting Cyrus ' " <unk> attitude all wrapped up in an immaculate gloss " . Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times wrote that while he wished the song had played up Cyrus ' frustration rather than concluding with the kind final verse , " the winning , full @-@ on chorus -- and Miley 's exuberance -- are enough to make it a success . " Ben Ratliff of The New York Times said " 7 Things " " lists with talky insecurity what she hates about a guy " and calls " the seven things she likes [ ... ] a shameless Disney ending " . Heather Phares of Allmusic contended , " 7 Things " is a twangy , clever piece of love @-@ hate pop that feels descended from Shania Twain 's flirty mix of rock and country " and marked it as one of the best tracks on Breakout . Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly called it one of Breakout 's " best tunes " because it " let Cyrus be feisty without graduating to Avril @-@ like levels of petulance " while Josh Timmermann of PopMatters finds it " appealing " . 
 Mordechai Shinefield of The Village Voice described the song as " hooky and catchy enough " , but warned that " it 's only a step away from warmed @-@ over emo platitudes " . Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe claimed " [ Avril ] Lavigne 's brand of pop @-@ punk snarl creeps into ' 7 Things ' .

 Cyrus invited Brett Ratner , director of the " 7 Things " music video , to her home to tell him how much the song meant to her and what it was about . After proposing numerous ideas to each other , they decided to make the video " simple with a white backdrop " . Cyrus said that neither she nor Ratner wanted the video to be " all about [ her ] " because the song 's message was universal ; " almost every girl in America could say they hate their ex or current boyfriend , " claimed Cyrus . As a result , the video features numerous adolescent girls including actresses Nicola Peltz , Liana <unk> , and Maiara Walsh . During the planning session , Cyrus showed Ratner a collection of personal items her ex had given her , such as photographs and his dirty socks , which she had stowed away beneath her bed . They decided to include some of these items as props in the music video . For example , the necklace Cyrus wears in the video was her ex @-@ boyfriend 's medical identification tag , which he received because of his diabetes mellitus . 
 The video was shot on May 30 , 2008 in Los Angeles , California . Unexpectedly , several girls began crying during the shoot ; Cyrus attributed this to the emotions in the song . Ratner was impressed with Cyrus ' instinct and ability to address emotional issues while making them " fun at the same time " . Ratner compared her to Madonna , saying , " she can be hanging out and laughing , and then you put the camera on her and it 's like , ' Holy shit ! ' " The effervescence made editing more difficult for the director . He said , " It was the hardest video I 've ever edited because every moment was great . Every moment that she was on camera , she was amazing . She 's got an incredible quality about her . She gets the camera , and that 's what it takes to make a great music video . " Cyrus commented that she felt the video was " more honest than [ the ] song " and that she was " singing out to [ ... ] that special person " . 
 The video commences with a close @-@ up shots of Cyrus ' face as she counts in the backup band behind her . For a moment , she is replaced by a different girl holding a small stuffed monkey . Cyrus then reappears , holding onto her necklace and wearing a multicolored sequin sundress designed by Sass & <unk> , black Chuck Taylor All @-@ Stars , and leg warmers . Her wavy hair styled loose and in front of her shoulders . As Cyrus continues to sing , she is replaced by more girls holding different items , including teddy bears , stuffed animals , snow globes , and love letters . As the song approaches its chorus , Cyrus and the girls start dancing and jumping . Cyrus continues singing as she holds a white rose and a girl deletes a text message from her boyfriend . At one point , Cyrus holds a photograph of her and an ex @-@ boyfriend with black curly hair , his face obscured by a doodle on a piece of notebook paper . At the end of the video , Cyrus blows the camera a kiss , mouths " I love you , " and turns away .

Todd Martens of The Los Angeles Times was disappointed with the video 's special effects and production values , adding that it looked " as if it were filmed with one camera on a tripod in a single @-@ bulb basement " . However , he complimented how they " show [ ed ] off Miley 's universal appeal " . Henry Freeland of Paste magazine said , " Cyrus wiggles to and fro , mugging for the camera like her face is fighting gravity and barely winning .

The review continued that it was mildly angry , comparing Cyrus to " a watered @-@ down version of Avril Lavigne 's kid sister , and Lindsay Lohan 's pseudo @-@ rebellious character in Freaky Friday — minus the eyeliner " . Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian commented , " Miley 's new music vid , reminds me , creepily enough , of early Britney . " Molly Lambert of the New York Times described Cyrus as the video 's " charismatic center " and writes , " When she flashes Nick ’ s dog tags and a picture of the two of them together , she seems so vindictive and so embarrassingly vulnerable , just like . . . a 15 @-@ year @-@ old suffering her first serious heartbreak , basically .

 = Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal = 
 The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal was a canal and tramroad system in Carmarthenshire , Wales , built to carry anthracite coal to the coast for onward transportation by coastal ships . It began life as Kymer 's Canal in 1766 , which linked pits at Pwll y Llygod to a dock near Kidwelly . Access to the dock gradually became more difficult as the estuary silted up , and an extension to Llanelli was authorised in 1812 . Progress was slow , and the new canal was linked to a harbour at Pembury built by Thomas Gaunt in the 1820s , until the company 's own harbour at Burry Port was completed in 1832 . Tramways served a number of collieries to the east of Burry Port . 
 In 1832 engineer James Green advised on extending the system , and suggested a line with three inclined planes to reach Cwmmawr , further up the Gwendraeth Valley . Although Green had experience with inclined planes on other canals , he underestimated the cost and could not complete the work . He was sacked in 1836 , but the canal company finished the new route the following year . The canal was moderately successful , and shareholders received dividends from 1858 . In 1865 the company changed its name to become the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway , amalgamated with the company running Burry Port in the following year , and the canal became the Burry Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in 1869 . 
 Kymer 's dock at Kidwelly continued to be used for the export of coal by coasters for another 50 years . It was used as a rubbish dump during the 1950s , but together with a short section of the canal was restored in the 1980s . A few of the structures of the canal can still be traced in the landscape , and the route of the now closed railway can be followed for most of its length . 
 = = History = = 
 The area around Kidwelly is rich in coal reserves and contains ironstone . It was to exploit these reserves that the canal and tramway system was built . Much of the coal was good quality anthracite , although other grades were also mined . 
 = = = Kymer 's Canal = = = 
 Thomas Kymer began mining at Pwll y Llygod and Great Forest ( near <unk> ) in 1760 , and sought parliamentary approval to construct a canal at his own expense in early 1766 . The Act of Parliament was granted on 19 February 1766 . The canal was to run from his coal pits at Pwll y Llygod on the banks of the Gwendraeth Fawr river to <unk> <unk> , about half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) to the west of Kidwelly , where he built a dock on the southern bank of the Gwendraeth Fach river . The Act included powers to divert the course of the Gwendraeth Fawr from Pwll y Llygod to Pont <unk> , where the Kidwelly to Llanelli turnpike road crossed the river . The canal was operational by May 1768 . 
 As built , the canal was about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) long , and the channel was approximately 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) wide . Wider sections were constructed at Morfa and at <unk> , to allow barges to pass one another , and there was also a wider section below the terminal wharf at Pwll y Llygod , to allow the barges to be turned . From the wharf , a tramway crossed the Gwendraeth Fawr to connect with the coal pits . 
 The canal served the mines well for almost 30 years , but the dock and river were affected by silting . A new channel across the sands was created in 1797 , but this too was affected by silting , and by 1809 navigation to Kymer 's dock was becoming dangerous . 
 = = = Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal = = = 
 A series of meetings took place in 1811 to consider how the situation could be improved . Two engineers , Edward Martin and David Davies , proposed an extension of the canal to the top of the Gwendraeth valley , and another which would cross <unk> marsh and would terminate at Llanelli . This would pass through Pembrey , providing improved access to the harbour . The proposal was adopted , and an Act of Parliament passed on 20 June 1812 created The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal and Tramroad Company . The Act envisaged an upper terminus beyond Cwmmawr at Cwm y Glo , and a series of feeder canals or tramroads to connect to the pits and levels where extraction of coal was taking place . It listed a total of 13 collieries which would be served in this way . <unk> at the Llanelli terminus would be built next to the dock owned by the Carmarthenshire Railroad Company . Special provision , including the construction of a lock and weir , was made for the point where the new canal would cross the existing Ashburnham Canal . 
 The newly formed company was required to complete the extension from Pwll y Llygod to Pontyates and the first section of the Llanelly branch to the point where it crossed the Ashburnham Canal within six years . Anthony Bower was the engineer , and construction was contracted to Pinkerton and Allen . The canal reached the new aqueduct across the Gwendraeth Fawr in 1815 , but little progress was made between then and 1817 . Much of the limited capital raised had been spent on attempts to re @-@ open the harbour , with little success . A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 28 May 1818 , which extended the time limit for building the canal and removed the requirement to clear the river channels to the harbour . Pinkerton and Allen pressed on with construction , completing the routes to Pontyates and the Ashburnham Canal crossing in 1824 , while the company directors asked the engineers John Rennie and Edward Bankes to examine the issue of a suitable harbour . Rennie suggested extending the canal towards what is now Burry Port , and the construction of a new harbour on the sands at Tywyn Bach . 
 = = = Pembrey Canal = = = 
 While Pinkerton and Allen were building the southern extension , Thomas Gaunt had been active in the area . He was extracting iron ore to be processed in new furnaces at Pembrey , had obtained <unk> colliery , and had constructed a harbour on the sands at Pembrey . Rennie and Bankes had dismissed the idea of a connection to Gaunt 's harbour , as it was not felt to be adequate for the likely volumes of coal traffic , but Gaunt was keen for a canal link . Between late 1823 and April 1824 he built two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of canal , including a lock at Cross Lane cottage . At its northern end it joined the Kidwelly and Llanelly canal at Ty Gwyn , just to the north of the disused Ashburnham Canal , and at its southern end , a short tramway linked its terminus to Gaunt 's harbour . The Cambrian newspaper carried reports of a ceremonial opening on 30 April 1824 , and a formal opening on 26 May . By 1843 , the canal had become disused , with traffic going to the new harbour at Pembrey instead . 
 = = = Pembrey New Harbour = = = 
 An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 created the New Harbour Company , with powers to build the harbour at Tywyn Bach , on the sands near Pembrey . The Act included powers to build a short section of canal to link with the line of the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal . The new harbour was completed in 1832 . The community of Burry Port did not exist in 1825 , and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the Burry Port Company by another Act of Parliament . 
 = = = James Green 's extensions = = = 
 Once the construction of a new harbour had begun , the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery . Another tramway was built from Burry Port to the coal levels at New Lodge , with a branch to <unk> . The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course , so that there would be a tramway link from Burry Port harbour to Llanelli ; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837 . 
 In 1832 , the canal company asked the engineer James Green to advise on further extensions to the system . His first report was critical of much of the work completed by Pinkerton , and recommended completing the link from the Ashburnham Canal to the new Pembrey harbour . This would require a lock at Ty Mawr , with water supplied by the <unk> brook and a new reservoir to be constructed at Cwm Capel in the <unk> valley . A second report , supplied three months later , recommended an extension along the Gwendraeth valley , and the construction of three inclined planes to reach a terminus just above Cwmmawr . Water supply for the upper sections would be from a new reservoir to be built above Cwm y Glo . 
 The idea of using inclined planes was an innovation that Green had pioneered elsewhere . He had been the engineer for the Bude Canal , which included six planes , five powered by water wheels and one by a descending bucket mechanism . He was at the time the engineer for the Grand Western Canal , which included seven vertical boat lifts and an inclined plane at Wellisford , again to be powered by a descending bucket mechanism . The rise on the final section of the canal to Cwmmawr was 190 feet ( 58 m ) , and three inclined planes would be much quicker and use much less water than the alternative of 20 or more locks . 
 The wooden <unk> aqueduct , which was prone to the river flowing over its top , was replaced by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it . Pinkerton 's two locks were rebuilt , and the banks of the Kymer canal were raised by 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) , to allow the water level to be raised . This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised . At the southern end , access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed , and this was completed by March 1835 . 
 Above Pontyates , two more locks were built , followed by an inclined plane with a rise of 52 feet ( 16 m ) at Capel Ifan , one with a rise of 53 feet ( 16 m ) at Pont Henry , and a third with a rise of 85 feet ( 26 m ) at Hirwaunissa , with level sections of canal in between . The upper terminus consisted of a walled basin , 200 by 50 feet ( 61 by 15 m ) , reached by another aqueduct over the Gwendraeth Fawr . In October 1835 Green announced that he was unable to complete the inclined planes because of cost overruns . The company raised more capital to finish the work by calling on shareholders , and on 30 January 1836 dismissed Green as engineer . The Grand Western Canal Company had taken a similar action three days earlier , when the Wellisford inclined plane had failed to work because of a design fault in the sizing of the descending bucket . All construction was completed by 1837 . 
 = = = Inclines = = = 
 Details of the inclined planes have been the subject of some speculation , largely because contemporary documents from the time of their construction are unknown . A local writer called Ap Huw stated that " the inclined planes were manipulated by hydraulic pumps which were considered to be great discoveries " . He also noted that only two of the inclines were used , but whether this was because Hirwaunissa was unfinished or because there was no traffic on the upper section is not clear . The railway engineer W. Robinson described " balance caissons with hydraulic brakes apparatus to check the barges in their descent and to arrange that the full ones coming down pull the empty ones up " . The Colliery Guardian carried an eye @-@ witness report of their operation , in which they were described as self @-@ acting inclines , and it is stated that all three were in operation at the time . 
 The other main sources of information are maps , particularly those published at the time the canal was to be converted into a railway . These clearly show twin @-@ track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry , and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction , a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed , although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent . The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two , and only included a single track . Recent research has suggested that the incline was powered by a water wheel , with the waste water running down the incline in a side channel , in order to supply the lower levels of the canal . 
 = = Subsequent development = = 
 No further changes were made to the canal after the extensions were completed , and satisfactory levels of traffic were carried . Fifty @-@ two barges were operational in 1835 , although their size is unknown . The canal was dredged in 1858 , and shareholders began to receive dividends on their investments that same year . Most of the traffic was anthracite coal , which was shipped through Burry Port . Some culm was still shipped through Kidwelly . Major users in 1863 consisted of two collieries at Pwll y Llygod and one at Pontyberem . Success was short @-@ lived , however , as railways started to appear in the region . Faced with the threat of the Carmarthenshire Railway building a branch to Pontyberem , the Canal Company obtained a new Act of Parliament , and became the Kidwelly and Burry Port Railway Company in 1865 . The following year , the Burry Port and <unk> Valley Railway company was formed , by amalgamating with the Burry Port Harbour Company . ( The spelling of Gwendraeth was wrong in the Act of Parliament . ) The new company built a railway from Burry Port to Pontyberem , along the towpath over <unk> marsh , and on the bed of the canal elsewhere . This opened in July 1869 . An extension to Kidwelly harbour followed in June 1873 , and one to Cwmmawr in June 1886 . 
 Although the main canal was replaced by the railway , Kymer 's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years . Principal destinations included Laugharne , Carmarthen , St Clears and <unk> . The Kidwelly Corporation took out a lease on the dock in 1872 , and the railway built a branch to it in 1873 , which ran alongside the old canal . Most of the traffic had transferred to the railway by 1914 , but some coasters continued to transport coal ; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s , and was bound for <unk> . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Kymer 's dock was used as a refuse tip in the 1950s . In 1988 , a two @-@ year scheme funded by the Manpower Services Commission excavated and restored both the dock and 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 1 km ) of the canal , from the dock to the point where its course is cut by the South Wales Railway . The Gwendraeth Fawr aqueduct is still in situ , as are parts of the Hirwaunissa inclined plane and the final aqueduct below Cwmmawr .

 Tome of the Unknown , the full title of which is Tome of the Unknown : Harvest Melody , is a 2013 animated short film created by Patrick McHale . In the film , Wirt ( Elijah Wood ) , his brother Gregory ( Collin Dean ) , and Beatrice , a bluebird , head to the big city in search of an arcane book of all known things , meeting a vegetable man along the way . 
 Originally imagined as a three @-@ season television show , Cartoon Network asked for it to be a feature film . During production , the miniseries format that eventually became that for Over the Garden Wall was decided on . The film serves as the inspiration and pilot for the aforementioned miniseries , which premiered in 2014 . The network , whose animation studio produced the film , also served as distributor . Released in 2013 to multiple film festivals , Tome of the Unknown has received several accolades . 
 = = Plot synopsis = = 
 In a large forest simply called the " Unknown , " Wirt ( Elijah Wood ) and his brother Gregory ( Collin Dean ) walk with Beatrice ( Natasha <unk> ; later voiced by Melanie Lynskey in the miniseries ) , a bluebird who has gained the ability to speak . The three are on their way to the big city , in search of a book titled The Tome of the Unknown , which – according to legend – contains every forgotten thing . When their legs tire , Greg suggests they ride a goose , but Wirt doubts they could find one big enough to carry them , thus Greg wanders off and discovers a car that is made from vegetables , which both fascinates and confuses Wirt . The car 's owner , John Crops ( C. W. <unk> ) , is likewise a vegetable humanoid . Crops wallows over his loneliness , wishing like the others to go the metropolitan area . Wirt offers , in exchange for Crops letting them keep the car , to drive Crops to the city , where he can hopefully find a soulmate . 
 A murder of giant crows attacks the vegetable car during the drive , forcing Wirt to veer off into a cornfield and crash into a scarecrow pole , which scares off the crows . Crops then reveals that they have arrived at the " big city , " which turns out to be an old @-@ fashioned small farm community in the middle of the cornfield . While Wirt and Beatrice try to repair the car , Greg wanders off with Crops and they explore the city 's gazebo garden party . Crops then bumps into a woman made of cabbage . Crops apologizes and there 's a sudden announcement that the party 's scheduled entertainment has been cancelled . Greg tells Crops that he could fill in for the party with his guitar and singing abilities , and the woman finds herself flattered after learning that Crops is a musician . Back at the car , Wirt , who can 't figure out how to fix the vehicle as all it is to him is a cluster of vegetables , and Beatrice , who recommends that all he had to do was turn the crank on the car 's front bumper to start the engine , knock over the scarecrow as they leave with the car working . This summons the giant crows , as well as giant turkeys , who terrorize the city and its vegetable inhabitants . Wirt and Beatrice drive up and pick up Greg , while Crops continues to woo the woman with his music , unaware of the chaos around him , even as a crow attacks one of the members of the band he 's performing with and as Wirt tries to get his attention . As Wirt , Greg , and Beatrice attempt to escape without Crops , they are set upon by the giant animals , who start to devour the vegetable car . As Wirt tries to fend them off , Greg suddenly jumps out of the car unnoticed . Suddenly , they hear Greg 's screams from the cornfield . The screams continue , until Wirt and Beatrice finally find Greg in the cornfield , unharmed and yelling with joy as he had finally found a goose big enough for them to ride . The city becomes peaceful once more , as Greg 's screams had scared the birds off forever , and John Crops goes back to his countryside home with his soulmate , the cabbage woman . Wirt , Gregory , Beatrice , and their new companion Goose , continue to travel onwards , deeper and deeper , into the Unknown .

 Tome of the Unknown is a short film directed by Patrick McHale , who also wrote and storyboarded it . Not long after he graduated college , McHale pitched the idea for the film , among other concepts , to Cartoon Network . At the time , the network was considering the creation of a department for feature films , though this never came to fruition . McHale was asked if it was possible to adapt the idea for Tome of the Unknown to feature length . This proved unsuccessful as he felt it needed to be episodic , laying out plans for a full television series consisting of three seasons . 
 After working as a creative director and a writer for Adventure Time – another Cartoon Network production – on top of a new house and the birth of his child , the network again gave McHale an opportunity to pitch an idea . Having worked in animation for other people as well as on the short animated works of his own , but with nothing for him to call a " professional " piece , McHale did not anticipate the network to have it go further than the short . During production , reformatting the film to a miniseries and not as a traditional television adaptation was proposed by McHale and the network , tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek . Following its release , they both found the format more than suitable . Retitled as Over the Garden Wall , the miniseries was announced in May 2014 . Nick Cross , who worked as a background painter with layout designer Chris Tsirgiotis on Tome of the Unknown , was hired as the art director for the series . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Cartoon Network released Tome of the Unknown to several film festivals starting in 2013 , including the 20th anniversary of the Austin Film Festival on October 24 , 2013 , and the International Children 's Film Festival at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston in May 2014 . At the Ottawa International Animation Festival , the film won an honorable mention as one of the best short animations for children on September 21 , 2013 . A Bruce Corwin Award for animation was given to the film at the 29th annual Santa Barbara International Film Festival in February 2014 , where it was screened in the previous month . Regarding its screening in Boston , Ethan Gilsdorf of The Boston Globe called the film marked by the presence of connections by celebrities , particularly Wood , while noting McHale for his work on Adventure Time . 
 The film saw digital distribution as part of the DVD release of the miniseries on September 8 , 2015 . The network previously released the film on their official website in May 2015 . Róbert Kovács @-@ <unk> of the Hungarian IGN gave it a high recommendation , calling the story beautiful as it occurs over the backgrounds . For their work on these backgrounds , Cross and Tsirgiotis earned juried Emmy Awards , as part of the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards .

 = Battle of Ostrach = 
 The Battle of Ostrach , also called the Battle by Ostrach , occurred on 20 – 21 March 1799 . It was the first battle of the War of the Second Coalition . The battle resulted in the victory of the Austrian forces , under the command of Archduke Charles , over the French forces , commanded by Jean Baptiste Jourdan . 
 The battle occurred during Holy Week , 1799 , amid rain and dense fog . Initially , the French were able to take , and hold , Ostrach and the nearby hamlet of Hoßkirch plus several strategic points on the Ostrach marsh . As the engagement began , Habsburg numerical superiority overwhelmed French defenses . By evening , the French left wing was flanked and Jourdan 's men retreated from Ostrach to the Pfullendorf heights . On the next morning , as Jourdan considered a counter @-@ attack , the weather broke , and he could look down on the Austrian battle array . The numbers and dispositions of the Austrians convinced him that any attack would be useless , and that he could not hope to maintain his position in the heights . As he withdrew , a portion of his right flank was cut off from the main force . 
 Although casualties appeared even on both sides , the Austrians had a significantly larger fighting force , both on the field at Ostrach , and stretched along a line between Lake Constance and Ulm . French casualties amounted to eight percent of the force and Austrian , approximately four percent . The French withdrew to Engen and Stockach , where a few days later the armies engaged again , this time with greater losses on both sides , and an Austrian victory . 
 = = Background = = 
 Initially , the rulers of Europe , such as Joseph II , Holy Roman Emperor , viewed the revolution in France as an event between the French king and his subjects , and not something in which they should interfere . As the rhetoric grew more strident , however , the other monarchies started to view events with alarm . In 1790 , Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791 , he considered the situation surrounding his sister , Marie Antoinette , and her children , with greater and greater alarm . In August 1791 , in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia , he issued the Declaration of Pilnitz , in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis and his family . They threatened ambiguous , but quite serious , consequences if anything should happen to the royal family . 
 The French Republican position became increasingly difficult . Compounding problems in international relations , French émigrés continued to agitate for support of a counter @-@ revolution abroad . Chief among them were the Prince Condé , his son , the Duke de Bourbon , and his grandson , the Duke d 'Enghien . From their base in Koblenz , immediately over the French border , they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe , and raised an army . 
 On 20 April 1792 , the French National Convention declared war on Austria . In this War of the First Coalition ( 1792 – 1798 ) , France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her , plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire . Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun , Kaiserslautern , Neerwinden , Mainz , Amberg and Würzburg , the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben ( 17 April 1797 ) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio ( October 1797 ) . 
 The treaty called for meetings between the involved parties to work out the exact territorial and remunerative details , to be convened at Rastatt . The French demand for more territory than originally agreed upon stalled negotiations . Despite their agreement at Campo Formio and the ongoing meetings at Rastatt , the two primary combatants of the First Coalition , France and Austria , were highly suspicious of the other 's motives . Several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement . The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories and the Rastatt delegates could not , or would not , orchestrate the transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses . Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay tribute to France , followed by the Neapolitan rebellion , invasion by France , and the subsequent establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic . Republican uprising in the Swiss cantons , encouraged by the French Republic with military support , led to the establishment of the Helvetic Republic . 
 Other factors contributed to the rising tensions as well . On his way to Egypt in 1798 , Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and forcibly removed the Hospitallers from their possessions . This angered Paul , Tsar of Russia , who was the honorary head of the Order . The French Directory , furthermore , was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war . Indeed , the weaker the French Republic seemed , the more seriously the Austrians , the Neapolitans , the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Archduke Charles of Austria had taken command of the army in late January . Although he was unhappy with the strategy set forward by his brother , the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II , he had acquiesced to the less ambitious plan to which Francis and the Aulic council had agreed : Austria would fight a defensive war and would maintain a continuous defensive line from the Danube to northern Italy . The archduke had stationed himself at Friedberg for the winter , 4 @.@ 7 miles ( 8 km ) east @-@ south @-@ east of Augsburg . The army was already settled into cantonments in the environs of Augsburg , extending south along the Lech river . 
 As winter broke in 1799 , on 1 March , General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25 @,@ 000 , the so @-@ called Army of the Danube , crossed the Rhine at Kehl . Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes , the Army of the Danube would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy , and prevent them from assisting one another ; furthermore , if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland , they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters . The Army of the Danube , meeting little resistance , advanced through the Black Forest in three columns , through the Höllental ( Hölle valley ) , via Oberkirch , and Freudenstadt , and a fourth column advanced along the north shore of the Rhine . Although Jourdan might have been better advised to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains , he did not . Instead , he pushed across the Danube plain and took up position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen , and eventually pushing toward the imperial city of Pfullendorf in Upper Swabia . 
 News of the French advance across the Rhine took three days to reach Charles at Augsburg . The Austrian <unk> ( advance guard ) , 17 @,@ 000 men under the command of Field marshal Friedrich Joseph , Count of Nauendorf , crossed the Lech in three columns , the first at <unk> , marching in the direction of Biberach , the second , and strongest , at Memmingen , marching in the direction of Waldsee , and the third at <unk> , heading in the direction of Ravensburg . The main force of 53 @,@ 000 men , under the command of the Archduke , crossed the Lech by Augsburg , Landsberg and <unk> , and six battalions of 6 @,@ 600 men crossed the Danube at Ulm . An additional force of 13 @,@ 000 troops under the command of Lieutenant Field Marshal Anton Sztáray marched toward Neumarkt in the direction of <unk> . Eventually , 10 @,@ 000 men under the command of General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze marched north from Feldkirch in Switzerland , but they did not arrive in time to participate at either the battle at Ostrach , or for the subsequent battle at Stockach . 
 = = = Locale = = = 
 Ostrach was a small village , with a population of 300 . The village belonged to the Cistercian Imperial Abbey of Salem , an influential and wealthy ecclesiastical territory on Lake Constance . The village was largely dedicated to farming , although a stretch of the imperial post road connected it and Pfullendorf . A wide , flat plain , marshy in places , stretched between the base of the Pfullendorf heights and the village ; low lying hills ringed the valley , which was creased by a small stream from which the village takes its name . Ostrach itself lies almost at the northern end of this plain , but slightly south of the Danube itself . The two armies faced each other across this small and , at that time of that year , very soggy valley . 
 = = = Dispositions = = = 
 By 7 March , the first Austrian soldiers arrived in Ostrach . The French advance guard arrived by the 9th , under command of General François Joseph Lefebvre ; in the forward line , the 25th Demi @-@ brigade and Light Infantry positioned themselves between Ostrach and Hoßkirch ; Lefebvre also had three battalions each of the 53rd and 67th Demi @-@ Brigades of light infantry , twenty squadrons of hussars , chasseurs , and dragoons , and field artillery pieces . By 12 March , the village and the surrounding farms were filled with Lancers ( <unk> ) and Hussars ( <unk> ) and by the 17th , the Austrian advance guard had established forward posts at <unk> , Altshausen and Waldsee . The remainder of Charles ' army , at this point nearly 110 @,@ 000 strong , had established itself along a line from Ulm to Lake Constance . 
 By 18 March , Jourdan had formed his headquarters at Pfullendorf , on the heights above Ostrach . In front of him stood the largest part of his cavalry and half of his infantry . The center , including the 4th Regiment of Hussars , the 1st of Chasseurs à Cheval , and two squadrons of the 17th Dragoons , lay behind Ostrach , under command of General Klein . Jourdan distributed them in three columns , the strongest on the post road by Saulgau , another on the road in the direction of Altshausen , and a third at the hamlet of Friedberg . 
 The flank of Lefebvre 's division , with 7 @,@ 000 men , commanded by Laurent Saint @-@ Cyr extended to the Danube ; by the time skirmishing began , Vandamme was still in the environs of Stuttgart , with 3 @,@ 000 men , looking in vain for Austrian forces that might be stationed there , and he played no part in the battle . The far right , under command of Ferino , angled south from Pfullendorf to Lake Constance , or the Bodensee . The cavalry reserve of 3 @,@ 000 under General Jean @-@ Joseph Ange d 'Hautpoul included a battalion of the 53rd Demi @-@ Brigade , and waited in close column in the environs of Pfullendorf . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Jourdan considered his position superior to the Austrian 's , protected as he was by the marshy plain between his positions and the Austrian front , and he thought he had another three days to consolidate his positions . His forces occupied Hoßkirch , and a couple of other points he considered strategic : the causeway ( post road ) that passed Saulgau ( today Bad Saulgau ) , the village of Altshausen 11 kilometers ( 7 mi ) east , and the hamlet of Friedberg , 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) to the north @-@ north @-@ east of Ostrach . These positions created a perimeter around Ostrach . He was unaware that the Archduke had arrived by forced marches from Augsburg to the vicinity of Ostrach ; Jourdan thought the main force of Charles ' army was still at least three days ' march away . By the middle of Holy Week in 1799 , more than a third of Charles ' army , 48 @,@ 000 mixed troops , was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan 's , and his 72 @,@ 000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten , the center near Memmingen , and the right flank extended to Ulm . 
 = = = Skirmishing = = = 
 As the armies assembled in their positions , the flanks and forward outposts encountered one another in several skirmishes ; indeed , they had been skirmishing for seven days , until 19 March , when the outposts of both armies nearly overlapped . On the right wing , General Ferino 's men encountered an Austrian column of volunteer infantry and some light cavalry from one of the border Hussar regiments , and took 70 and 80 prisoners , respectively , including several officers . All of this happened without the Austrians knowing that there was an official declaration of war . On the 20 March , a French emissary arrived at camp of Prince Schwarzenberg , a major general commanding a brigade of the advanced guard . The emissary asked if he possessed a declaration of war from Vienna , and upon being informed that Schwarzenberg had received no such declaration , informed him that the armistice established at Campo Formio was ended , and there existed between France and Austria a state of war . General Jourdan reportedly began a general attack when the emissary left , although other sources do not bear out the scale of the attack . 
 Initially , the strength of the French advance guard pushed the most forward of the Austrian right to Saulgau and <unk> , 6 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 4 mi ) east of Ostrach , backing the Austrian main army against the <unk> river . Jean Victor Tharreau 's mixed brigade of infantry , light infantry and cavalry encountered the Austrians at <unk> , and forced them to give up the ground ; immediately , Charles sent reinforcements , and the Austrians regained what they had lost . 
 At the center of the French line , at Hoßkirch , 3 kilometers ( 2 mi ) east @-@ south @-@ east of Ostrach , General Lefebvre 's column attacked the Austrians in an action that lasted most of the day . The Austrian line included several seasoned Grenzer ( border ) regiments , the <unk> Hussars , and some lancers ; although Lefebvre 's initial assault caused confusion in the Austrian ranks , the Lancers counter @-@ attacked with ferocity and , joined by the Grenzers and the Hussars , pursued the French along the Ostrach river valley , and cut up four squadrons of the 8th Regiment of Chasseurs à Cheval . Lefebvre 's column was forced out of the hamlet by the Austrians , who had four battalions , 1200 horse , and six cannons . After bringing up additional reinforcements — several light artillery , Chasseurs à Cheval , Hussars , and the 17th Regiment of Dragoons , Lefebvre was able to take the village again . By 0500 of 21 March , however , he sent word to Jourdan that he was being attacked on all posts by the Austrians , and they must soon expect a general engagement . 
 = = = General engagement = = = 
 Charles had divided his force into columns , and at close to 1000 , the Austrians attacked in force , with simultaneous assaults upon multiple positions . With Nauendorf 's advance force moved with 11 battalions and 20 squadrons on Saint Cyr 's position . Following behind with the main force of the right column , Fürstenberg had little difficulty pushing the French out of <unk> and advanced on <unk> an Einhard 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) to the northwest . His force pressured elements of Saint Cyr 's thinly manned line , and the entire line fell back slowly , to maintain contact with its flanks . Maximilian , Count of Merveldt 's force , attacking on Saint Cyr 's far left flank , continued to pressure the line , which started to crumble . Further south , Olivier , Count of Wallis took a column of 18 battalions and 42 squadrons and attacked the Adjutant General François @-@ Xavier Octavie Fontaine 's French line at <unk> , between Ostrach and Ferino 's column at Salem . In the maneuvering , the cross @-@ fire trapped French forces ; at <unk> , unable to take cover , they were cut down from both sides . 
 Charles himself took a main column along the high road , a causeway that passed by Saulgau , to attack Lefebvre on points between Hoßkirch and Ostrach . In this deployment of his force , Charles sought to dislodge the center of the French line from its position in Ostrach , separating the wings from the main body of force and overcoming both separately . 
 The convergence of the two columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated the advantage of the superiority of Austrian numbers . From every angle , the Austrians threatened to overwhelm the French . Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared under a cloud of red coats . Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw themselves against the French defenses . By late morning , Charles ' troops pushed the French out of Hoßkirch , and into Ostrach , which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements . The fighting remained fierce until about 1600 , when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf , encouraged by Austrian cavalry . Once out of Ostrach , and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf , the French formed a new perimeter , reinforced by reserves of Soulham , and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians . Despite the punishing musket fire , Charles ' strategy worked . The far right wing ( Ferino 's force ) , which had not been attacked yet , fell back to Salem Abbey , to maintain communication with the French center . 
 At the Pfullendorf heights , the fight began anew . Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream . The French poured fire on the Austrians , who took heavy losses , but did not give up the ground . In the night , Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard , flanking Jourdan 's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr . Further south , Wallis threatened to do the same to Fontaine and Ferino . As darkness fell , so ended the first day of fighting . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 As Jourdan was deciding whether or not to attempt another foray , the fog lifted and revealed the scene below him . He wrote later , 
 " ... [ W ] e discovered an immense line of cavalry and infantry . It may be said , without exaggeration , that the troops which engaged our advanced guard amounted to twenty @-@ five thousand men . I now perceived the absolute impossibility of making any further resistance against such a superior force , as well as the danger that threatened the division , from the advantage which the enemy had gained on the left . I therefore ordered General Soult to fall back with the division to the post before <unk> [ sic ] . " 
 He was wrong ; the Austrians engaged with the French advance guard numbered closer to 50 @,@ 000 , and constituted the main body of Charles ' army , not its advance guard . In the night , Charles also had moved additional troops to renew the attack on the Pfullendorf heights at daybreak . 
 On 21 March , at 2200 , Jourdan ordered the wounded to be transported to Schaffhausen in Switzerland , via Stockach . The main army then began its own retreat in the early morning of 22 March . The reserve division of d 'Hautpoul left first , and pulled back via Stockach to <unk> ob Egg . According to Jourdan , the retreat occurred in perfect order , and was supported in particular by a company of sappers , who blew up the bridges in the face of enemy fire , and then fought like grenadiers . The Austrians outflanked Saint Cyr 's forces on the right flank and General Ferino , at the southern @-@ most point , retreated to Salem , to maintain the line with the remainder of the French force . When the first division pulled back to Bodman , on the northern tip of the Überlingen @-@ finger of Lake Constance , a portion of the force was encircled and cut off by the 2nd Lancers of Karl Philipp , Prince Schwarzenberg 's brigade , and more than 500 were taken prisoner . 
 Other sources are less sanguine in their assessment of Jourdan 's retreat . Jourdan 's forces , especially his left flank , were severely pressed ; the French line collapsed upon itself at both ends as the soldiers fell back . A dispatch to Paris , later reported in the Times , claimed that the French intent had been betrayed to the Austrians by a deserter , but there is some evidence that this was Jourdan 's mendacious attempt to explain the apparent surprise with which the Austrians attacked . A British report claimed that the French commander had two horses shot from under him , but Jourdan himself reported that only one horse was shot , and he was thrown , stunned , to the ground . Lefebvre received a musket ball in the wrist and had to be carried from the field ; command of his division was given to the rising star Jean @-@ de @-@ Dieu Soult . Furthermore , a sizable portion — sources are not clear on how many — of the French right wing ( Ferino 's force ) had been cut off from its main force , and made prisoner . Finally , General Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze was quickly making his way north with 10 @,@ 000 men from Feldkirch and prepared to attack Jourdan 's army from the south . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Eventually , Jourdan withdrew first to Messkirch ( sometimes spelled <unk> or <unk> ) , and when that city was no longer defensible , fell back to Stockach , and then again Engen , but he wrote that the armies had been well @-@ matched ; French valor , he wrote , overcame servitude . His men had taken many Austrian prisoners , and he knew also that many Austrians lay dead or wounded on the field of battle . His army itself had losses , but their valor in death matched the ambitious tyranny of the Austrians : Charles had driven his army hard , he wrote , and the Austrians would not pursue the gallant , liberty @-@ loving French ; Charles ' failure to pursue the French affirmed Jourdan 's perception that his had not been a defeat followed by retreat , but rather a strategic withdrawal . Jourdan probably did not know that Charles had been ordered to maintain a continuous and orderly defensive line with troops to the south . 
 Jourdan 's own assessment did not match that of his superiors in Paris , who recognized that the loss of twelve percent of the fighting force , versus less than four percent for the adversary , did not amount to a draw . Furthermore , this first attempt to cut the Austrians off from access to the upper Rhine and Lake Constance had not succeeded . There were other considerations , primarily that Jourdan simply did not have enough men to fight not only this battle but the subsequent ones as well . 
 For his own part , the Archduke did not push his troops to pursue and capture the enemy , or even harass their retreat . Charles ' slow pursuit might have been due to his own disgruntlement with Vienna 's overarching defensive strategy and the undoubted difficulty of the battle itself , conducted with troops wearied by a forced march of 30 miles ( 48 km ) , fighting in rain , fog , and on normally boggy terrain made more soggy by the heavy spring rains and snow melt . Regardless , he more than made up for these shortcomings within the week . Five days after Jourdan 's departure from Ostrach and Pfullendorf , the French and Austrian armies continued the fight at Stockach . This time , the decision could not be argued : The Army of the Danube could not hold the territory and withdrew into the Black Forest . 
 The battle at Ostrach had been difficult , as Jourdan pointed out , due largely to the dense fog and terrible weather that hampered his observation of his enemy 's movements , yet the same fog that blinded him to the Austrian movements did not seem to hamper Charles . The fog and rainy weather did play a role , however . On a local level , in the damp night of the 20th , which was <unk> , ( German : Green Thursday , or Maundy Thursday ) , the Danube overflowed , backing up into the Ostrach , and causing it to burst its own banks . The flood trapped 300 civilians between the two armies intent on destruction ; suspecting what was to come , <unk> huddled in their cellars , and hoped for the best and gasping for breath as the battle thundered overhead . Amazingly , none were killed , although they spent Easter Sunday caring for the wounded , and helping to bury the 4 @,@ 000 or so soldiers who died in the battle . 
 = = Battle monument = = 
 Prior to 1903 , a simple wooden cross commemorated the battle site , located on the so @-@ called <unk> , a hill overlooking the village , and the plains to the southeast , where much of the fighting occurred . In 1903 , a monument was erected to honor the battle . In 1945 , when French troops arrived in the region , they closed the monument ; the local pastor encouraged them to reopen it , calling it a chapel .

 = Typhoon Sarah ( 1989 ) = 
 Typhoon Sarah , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Openg , was a powerful typhoon that caused extensive damage along an erratic path across the Western Pacific in September 1989 . Originating from a disturbance within a monsoon trough in early September , Sarah was first classified as a tropical depression near the Mariana Islands on September 5 . Moving quickly westward , the depression soon strengthened into Tropical Storm Sarah . On September 8 , the storm abruptly turned southward and temporarily attained typhoon status . Following a series of interactions with secondary areas of low pressure , the storm turned northward the following day . By September 11 , Sarah entered a region favoring development and underwent a period of explosive intensification . At the end of this phase , the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 – equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . The typhoon subsequently weakened rapidly and made two landfalls in Taiwan by September 12 . After moving over the Taiwan Strait , Sarah made its final landfall in Eastern China on September 13 before dissipating the following day . 
 While the typhoon meandered near the Philippines , it brought several days of heavy rain to much of Luzon , triggering extensive flash flooding . At least 44 people perished across the country and another 200 @,@ 000 were left homeless . Striking Taiwan as a strong typhoon , Sarah caused widespread wind damage that left approximately 840 @,@ 000 residents without power . Excessive rainfall associated with the storm triggered flooding that washed away highways and inundated about 40 @,@ 500 hectares ( 100 @,@ 000 acres ) of farmland . Throughout the island , Sarah was responsible for 19 fatalities and at least $ 171 million USD ( 4 @.@ 38 billion New Taiwan dollars ) in damage . Four deaths also took place on the Gotō Islands . Additionally , four deaths took place offshore and another seventeen people were listed as missing .

 In early September 1989 , a monsoon trough became established across the western Pacific . By September 3 , a disturbance formed within the trough approximately 1 @,@ 100 km ( 685 mi ) southeast of the Japanese island of Minamitorishima . Initially , a tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) to the northwest inhibited convective development ; however , " complex interactions " , according to Lt. Cdr . Nicholas D. <unk> , later occurred between the TUTT cell , the initial disturbance , and a second disturbance , which resulted in favorable conditions for tropical cyclogenesis . Due to the improved environment , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued two Tropical Cyclone Formation Alerts on the system on September 5 . By this time , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression . Ultimately , the JTWC issued their first advisory on Tropical Depression 22W early on September 6 , at which time the depression was situated northwest of the Mariana Islands . 
 Initially , the depression tracked west @-@ southwestwards and gradually intensified ; however , after being upgraded to Tropical Storm Sarah late on September 6 , the system turned northwestward and accelerated towards Okinawa . By September 8 , Sarah decelerated as it underwent a binary interaction with a secondary area of convection to the southwest . This interaction caused the cyclone to abruptly turn southwestward towards the Philippines before nearly stalling on September 9 . During this time , the storm temporarily attained typhoon status , having estimated winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Coinciding with Sarah 's time as a typhoon , a new area of low pressure , classified as a " lee side low " , developed along the west coast of Luzon . Due to the cyclone 's proximity to the Philippines , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Openg . 
 Later on September 9 , Sarah turned sharply northward as the lee side low rapidly tracked northeast . Reintensification gradually took place as the storm moved away from the Philippines , with the storm reaching typhoon status by September 10 . Tracking generally towards the north @-@ northwest , Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September 11 . Over a six @-@ hour span , the storm 's winds increased from 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) to 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . A powerful typhoon , Sarah featured a well @-@ defined eye and multiple outflow channels . The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category 4 – equivalent typhoon on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker , estimating peak ten @-@ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) along with a barometric pressure of 950 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 05 inHg ) . 
 Forecasters at the JTWC initially projected the storm to track north of Taiwan on September 12 and merge with an approaching frontal system . Contrary to this , Sarah moved south of the expected path and quickly weakened as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan . The storm eventually struck the island with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) late on September 11 . Unexpectedly , the typhoon executed a counterclockwise loop and briefly moved offshore before making a second landfall 12 hours later along the northeastern coast of Taiwan as a tropical storm . Sarah failed to reorganize as it moved over the Taiwan Strait and later made its final landfall in Zhejiang , China as a minimal tropical storm on September 13 . The storm was last noted the following day as dissipating over Eastern China .

 = = = Philippines = = = 
 Although the storm did not make landfall in the Philippines , its close proximity brought several days of heavy rain to Luzon , leading to widespread flash floods and mudslides . Landslides across the region isolated many cities , including Baguio . Rivers began exceeding their banks on September 10 and flooded surrounding areas . In the province of Ilocos Sur , ten people were killed in a single town after flood waters swept away many homes overnight . In many areas , waters were waist @-@ deep and officials advised residents in low @-@ lying areas to move to higher ground . Tropical storm force winds , recorded up to 88 km / h ( 55 mph ) at the John Hay Air Base , also impacted the country . In Zambales Province , a tornado spawned by the typhoon injured three people and caused approximately $ 90 @,@ 000 worth of damage . Another tornado struck the Clark Air Base , uprooting trees and damaging buildings . Losses from this tornado reached $ 150 @,@ 000 . 
 At least 44 people were killed in various incidents related to Typhoon Sarah in the Philippines while another three were reported missing . A total of 1 @,@ 157 homes were destroyed and another 24 @,@ 638 sustained damage , leaving approximately 200 @,@ 000 people homeless . Damage from the storm was placed at $ 4 @.@ 3 million . In light of the severity of damage caused by Sarah , a state of calamity was declared for northern provinces . Less than a week after the storm , additional rains in areas affected by Sarah triggered landslides that killed at least 16 people . Officials blamed the landslides on rocks loosened by the typhoon 's rains . 
 = = = Taiwan = = = 
 On September 10 , meteorologists across Taiwan warned residents of torrential rain across the country , especially in mountainous areas where more than 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) could fall . The Central Weather Bureau also advised vessels in the Bashi Channel to be cautious or rough seas associated with the typhoon . Most flights to and from the island were canceled by September 11 for the duration of the storm ; however , rail service continued for another day . Approximately 10 @,@ 000 volunteer firefighters were placed on alert and city police were called in to organize evacuation centers . 
 Striking Taiwan as a powerful typhoon , destructive winds battered coastal areas near where the center moved ashore . According to officials in Taiwan , winds were recorded up to 174 km / h ( 108 mph ) with gusts to 208 km / h ( 129 mph ) . These winds downed thousands of trees and power lines , leaving an estimated 840 @,@ 000 residents without electricity . A total of 272 @,@ 000 telephone lines were damaged or destroyed by the storm .

 = Back to Basics ( Christina Aguilera album ) = 
 Back to Basics is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Christina Aguilera . It was released on August 9 , 2006 by RCA Records as a double album . Serving as executive producer , she enlisted a wide range of producers including DJ Premier , Rich Harrison , Rob Lewis , Mark Ronson , and Linda Perry . Recording sessions began in January 2005 and ended in April 2006 , taking place at Chalice Recording Studios and Record Plant . 
 Inspired by Aguilera 's 1920s – 1940s idols , including Billie Holiday , Otis Redding , Etta James , and Ella Fitzgerald , Back to Basics was described by Aguilera herself as a fusion of old @-@ school jazz and soul inspirations with a modernized style . Primarily a pop and R & B record , the first disc juxtaposes rhythm and blues with hip hop and urban elements with most songs employing samples , while the second contains all original tracks with the exception of " Candyman " , which samples " Tarzan & Jane Swingin ' on a Vine " . Lyrically , the album is inspired by Aguilera 's previous life events including her marriage with Jordan Bratman in 2005 . 
 To portray a new persona , Aguilera adopted her new alter ego , Baby Jane , and made several changes to her public appearance , inspired by classic Hollywood movie stars . She promoted the album by performing at concerts from mid @-@ 2006 to early @-@ 2007 , including the 2006 MTV Movie Awards and the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards . The album 's supporting tour Back to Basics Tour , which visited countries in North America , Asia , Europe , Australia and Middle East , lasted from late @-@ 2006 until late @-@ 2008 . Back to Basic spawned three international singles : " Ain 't No Other Man " , " Hurt " and " Candyman " . 
 Back to Basics received positive reviews from music critics who complimented its musical diversity from Aguilera 's previous albums while there were others who criticized its length . The record received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album , and its lead single " Ain 't No Other Man " won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards in 2007 . In its first week of release , the album debuted atop the US Billboard 200 chart with first @-@ week sales of 346 @,@ 000 copies . Back to Basics achieved similar success internationally , reaching the top spot in over fifteen countries including Australia , Canada , Germany , Ireland , Switzerland and United Kingdom . The album has sold 1 @.@ 7 million copies in the US , and 5 million units worldwide as of November 2013 . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards in 2004 , Aguilera announced that she was going to work on a follow @-@ up album to Stripped ( 2002 ) . She stated her main idea for the project was to " evolve as an artist and a visionary " , which was taken from a poem she wrote during The Stripped Tour ( 2003 ) . In an interview with Billboard magazine , Aguilera expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary music , as technology " has advanced itself so anybody can be a singer " . Thus , Aguilera took musical inspirations from old @-@ school jazz , blues and soul records performed by her 1920s @-@ 1940s idols including Billie Holiday , Otis Redding , Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald , which she viewed as " music that really had heart " . 
 To create a " throwback " with elements of old @-@ school genres combined with " a modern @-@ day twist " , Aguilera sent letters to different producers that she hoped could help her with the direction she was taking for the project , encouraging them to experiment , re @-@ invent and create a modern soul feel . She initially planned to condense the album into a single , more " affordable " disc , however she expanded Back to Basics as a double album . For the first disc , Aguilera collaborated with hip hop producers including DJ Premier , Rich Harrison , <unk> , and Mark Ronson for the first time . Most songs from the first half incorporate horn samples to create " gritty and old " sounds . DJ Premier questioned if Aguilera was familiar with his work , though she had known of his jazz @-@ influenced work with Gang Starr in late @-@ 1980s and early @-@ 1990s . In response , Aguilera wanted her album to draw inspirations from Premier 's song " Jazz Thing " and noted that their collaboration became his first time " venturing into the ' pop ' world " . 
 For the " 1920s and 1930s @-@ era vibe " -influenced second disc , Aguilera teamed up with longtime producer Linda Perry , who produced Aguilera 's previous album Stripped . In contrast to the first half disc , the second one consists of all live recordings without using samples ( with the exception of " Candyman " featuring a sample of " Tarzan & Jane Swingin ' on a Vine " ) . Recording sessions of the project began in January 2005 and ended in April 2006 , taking place at Chalice Recording Studios and The Record Plant in Hollywood , California . All songs from Back to Basics were recorded using Pro Tools <unk> program and done with a SSL <unk> console with 96 inputs . Aguilera 's vocals were recorded using a Telefunken <unk> 251 microphone , possibly in conjunction with an Avalon M @-@ 5 pre @-@ amp . Producer Scott Storch , who contributed to Aguilera 's previous album Stripped , was asked to return for the production of Back to Basics . However , he refused the offer when Aguilera declined to pay airfare for him and his entourage to fly out to Los Angeles , which led to a breakdown of their relationship . Subsequently , Aguilera included the song " F.U.S.S. " ( " Fuck You Scott Storch " ) on the album , which Storch viewed as " pathetic " . 
 = = Music = = 
 According to Aguilera and the production team , Back to Basics draws influences from 1920s @-@ 1940s jazz , blues and soul genres . However , music critics identified the record as a pop and R & B album with similarities to 1960s , 1970s and 1980s albums . Dorian Lyskey writing for The Guardian thought that the album 's concept " is so wide as to be meaningless " , while Serene Dominic from Phoenix New Times compared Back to Basics ' musical style to rock band The Beatles ' 1968 self @-@ titled album . 
 The first half disc incorporates strong elements from hip hop , urban , blending old @-@ school and modern R & B. It features horn samples and gospel choirs , making it sound like " a dusty old vinyl album " , according to Jenny Eliscu from Rolling Stone . Most songs from the disc employ samples , with the exception of " Without You " , " Still Dirrty " and " F.U.S.S. " " Makes Me Wanna Pray " featuring Steve Winwood features a gospel choir in its arrangement , while the pop / R & B and funk number " Ain 't No Other Man " features " aerobic oomph " that is similar to Beyoncé 's " Crazy in Love " . " Understand " is an R & B ballad , featuring soul influences that are similar to ballads done by Gladys Knight , while " Slow Down Baby " blends old @-@ school and modern R & B with hip hop and soul elements . The three follow @-@ ups " Oh Mother " , " On Our Way " , and " Without You " are the three piano ballads from disc one . " Still Dirrty " was described as a " filthy ghetto strut " with hip hop elements . 
 The second disc of Back to Basics opens with " Enter the Circus " , described as a " carnival @-@ creepy orchestration that sounds like Danny Elfman <unk> Cabaret " by Tampa Bay Times , and followed by the soft rock @-@ inspired " Welcome " . " Candyman " draws inspirations from jazz , blues and swing , and was musically inspired by The Andrews Sisters ' 1941 hit " Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy " . Similarly , " Nasty Naughty Boy " also contains elements of jazz and blues and features " blaring horn section " in its arrangement . On " I Got Trouble " , Aguilera sings over a blues @-@ inspired theme that is reminiscent of songs by Bessie Smith . " Mercy on Me " features gospel elements , while the acoustic track " Save Me from Myself " is inspired by country rock genre , different from any other tracks on Back to Basics . 
 = = Lyrics = = 
 Most songs from Back to Basics were inspired by real @-@ life events that Aguilera had experienced . The track " Oh Mother " talks about Aguilera 's childhood with her abusive father ; its lyrical theme was compared to Madonna 's " Oh Father " ( 1989 ) . Her marriage with Jordan Bratman was the main theme of the album , with tracks inspired by the event including " Makes Me Wanna Pray " , " Ain 't No Other Man " , " On Our Way " , " Without You " , " Mercy on Me " , " Save Me from Myself " and " The Right Man " . On " The Right Man " , Aguilera expresses that she has found " the right man " for her imagined daughter as she hopes that the child would not have to experience an abusive childhood like her , " One day , My little girl will reach out her hand and she 'll know I found the right man " . 
 Aguilera expresses excitement toward old @-@ school music on " Back in the Day " , where she names classic artists including Etta James , Marvin Gaye , Coltrane and Aretha Franklin . " F.U.S.S. " ( which stands for " Fuck You Scott Storch " ) , is directly toward producer Scott Storch , who didn 't accept Aguilera 's offer to produce Back to Basics : " Looks like I didn 't need you / Still got the album out " . In the lyrics of " Slow Down Baby " , Aguilera tells a " lusty " man to leave her alone as she sings , " If you knew anything you 'd realise I 'm wearing a ring " . " Still Dirrty " was described as a sequel to Aguilera 's 2002 single " Dirrty " , in which Aguilera sings about her " sexual independence " , " Why is a woman 's sexuality always under so much scrutiny / Why can 't she do exactly as she please " and claims that she 's " still got the nasty " in her . " Here to Stay " tells how Aguilera is " not just a flash in the pan pop starlet " , while " Thank You ( Dedication to Fans ... ) " features voice mails from Aguilera 's fans , such as " You 're so amazing " or " You inspired me to carry on living ... "

 = Geography of Croatia = 
 The geography of Croatia is defined by its location — it is described as a part of Central and Southeast Europe , a part of the Balkans and Mitteleuropa . Croatia 's territory covers 56 @,@ 594 km2 ( 21 @,@ 851 sq mi ) , making it the 127th largest country in the world . Bordered by Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia in the east , Slovenia in the west , Hungary in the north and Montenegro and the Adriatic Sea in the south , it lies mostly between latitudes 42 ° and 47 ° N and longitudes 13 ° and 20 ° E. Croatia 's territorial waters encompass 18 @,@ 981 square kilometres ( 7 @,@ 329 sq mi ) in a 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) wide zone , and its internal waters located within the baseline cover an additional 12 @,@ 498 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 826 sq mi ) . 
 The Pannonian Basin and the Dinaric Alps , along with the Adriatic Basin , represent major geomorphological parts of Croatia . Lowlands make up the bulk of Croatia , with elevations of less than 200 metres ( 660 ft ) above sea level recorded in 53 @.@ 42 % of the country . Most of the lowlands are found in the northern regions , especially in Slavonia , itself a part of the Pannonian Basin plain . The plains are interspersed with horst and graben structures , believed to have broken the Pliocene Pannonian Sea 's surface as islands . The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in the Lika and Gorski Kotar areas in the Dinaric Alps , but high areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent . The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia — 1 @,@ 831 @-@ metre ( 6 @,@ 007 ft ) Dinara — as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . Croatia 's Adriatic Sea mainland coast is 1 @,@ 777 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 104 @.@ 4 mi ) long , while its 1 @,@ 246 islands and islets encompass a further 4 @,@ 058 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 522 mi ) of coastline — the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean . Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps , as well as throughout the coastal areas and the islands . 
 62 % of Croatia 's territory is encompassed by the Black Sea drainage basin . The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country : the Danube , Sava , Drava , Mur and Kupa . The remainder belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin , where the largest river by far is the Neretva . Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate as defined by the Köppen climate classification . The mean monthly temperature ranges between − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) and 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) . Croatia has a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology , and the country is consequently among the most biodiverse in Europe . There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia : Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland ; Alpine in the elevated Lika and Gorski Kotar ; Pannonian along the Drava and Danube ; and Continental in the remaining areas . There are 444 protected natural areas in Croatia , encompassing 8 @.@ 5 % of the country ; there are about 37 @,@ 000 known species in Croatia , and the total number of species is estimated to be between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 . 
 The permanent population of Croatia by the 2011 census reached 4 @.@ 29 million . The population density was 75 @.@ 8 inhabitants per square kilometre , and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 75 @.@ 7 years . The country is inhabited mostly by Croats ( 89 @.@ 6 % ) , while minorities include Serbs ( 4 @.@ 5 % ) , and 21 other ethnicities ( less than 1 % each ) recognised by the constitution . Since the counties were re @-@ established in 1992 , Croatia is divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb . The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities . The average urbanisation rate in Croatia stands at 56 % , with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population . The largest city and the nation 's capital is Zagreb , with an urban population of 686 @,@ 568 in the city itself and a metropolitan area population of 978 @,@ 161 . The populations of Split and Rijeka exceed 100 @,@ 000 , and five more cities in Croatia have populations over 50 @,@ 000 .

 Croatia 's territory covers 56 @,@ 594 square kilometres ( 21 @,@ 851 square miles ) , making it the 127th largest country in the world . The physical geography of Croatia is defined by its location — it is described as a part of Central Europe and Southeast Europe , a part of the Balkans and Mitteleuropa . Croatia borders Bosnia – Herzegovina ( for 1 @,@ 009 @.@ 1 km ) and Serbia ( for 317 @.@ 6 km ) in the east , Slovenia for 667 @.@ 8 km in the west , Hungary for 355 @.@ 5 km in the north and Montenegro for 22 @.@ 6 km and the Adriatic Sea in the south . It lies mostly between latitudes 42 ° and 47 ° N and longitudes 13 ° and 20 ° E. Part of the extreme south of Croatia is separated from the rest of the mainland by a short coastline strip around Neum belonging to Bosnia – Herzegovina . 
 Croatia 's 348 @-@ kilometre ( 216 mi ) border with Hungary was inherited from Yugoslavia . Much of the border with Hungary follows the Drava River or its former river bed ; that part of the border dates from the Middle Ages . The border in Međimurje and Baranya was defined as a border between the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats , and Slovenes , later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , pursuant to the Treaty of Trianon of 1920 . The present outline of the 956 @-@ kilometre ( 594 mi ) border with Bosnia – Herzegovina and 19 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) border with Montenegro is largely the result of the Ottoman conquest and subsequent recapture of territories in the Great Turkish War of 1667 – 1698 formally ending with the Treaty of Karlowitz , as well as the Fifth and Seventh Ottoman – Venetian Wars . This border had minor modifications in 1947 when all borders of the former Yugoslav constituent republics were defined by demarcation commissions implementing the AVNOJ decisions of 1943 and 1945 regarding the federal organisation of Yugoslavia . The commissions also defined Baranya and Međimurje as Croatian territories , and moreover set up the present @-@ day 314 @-@ kilometre ( 195 mi ) border between Serbia and Croatia in Syrmia and along the Danube River between Ilok and the Drava river 's mouth and further north to the Hungarian border ; the Ilok / Drava section matched the border between the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia and Bács @-@ Bodrog County that existed until 1918 ( the end of World War I ) . Most of the 600 @-@ kilometre ( 370 mi ) border with Slovenia was also defined by the commissions , matching the northwestern border of the Kingdom of Croatia @-@ Slavonia , and establishing a new section of Croatian border north of the Istrian peninsula according to the ethnic composition of the territory previously belonging to the Kingdom of Italy . 
 Pursuant to the 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy the islands of Cres , Lastovo and Palagruža and the cities of Zadar and Rijeka and most of Istria went to communist Yugoslavia and Croatia , while carving out the Free Territory of Trieste ( FTT ) as a city @-@ state . The FTT was partitioned in 1954 as Trieste itself and the area to the north of it were placed under Italian control , and the rest under Yugoslav control . The arrangement was made permanent by the Treaty of Osimo in 1975 . The former FTT 's Yugoslav part was partitioned between Croatia and Slovenia , largely conforming to the area population 's ethnic composition . 
 In the late 19th century , Austria @-@ Hungary established a geodetic network , for which the elevation benchmark was determined by the Adriatic Sea 's average level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste . This benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria , adopted by Yugoslavia , and kept by the states that emerged after its dissolution , including Croatia .

 The geographical extreme points of Croatia are <unk> in Međimurje County as the northernmost point , <unk> near Ilok in Vukovar @-@ Syrmia County as the easternmost point , Cape <unk> near <unk> in Istria County as the westernmost point and the islet of <unk> in Palagruža archipelago in Split @-@ Dalmatia County as the southernmost point . On the mainland , Cape <unk> of the Prevlaka peninsula in Dubrovnik @-@ Neretva County is the southernmost point .

 Italy and Yugoslavia defined their delineation of the continental shelf in the Adriatic Sea in 1968 , with an additional agreement on the boundary in the Gulf of Trieste signed in 1975 in accordance with the Treaty of Osimo . All the successor states of former Yugoslavia accepted the agreements . Prior to Yugoslavia 's breakup , Albania , Italy and Yugoslavia initially proclaimed 15 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 28 km ; 17 mi ) territorial waters , subsequently reduced to the international @-@ standard 12 nautical miles ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) ; all sides adopted baseline systems . Croatia also declared its Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone ( ZERP ) — a part of its Exclusive Economic Zone — as extending to the continental shelf boundary . Croatia 's territorial waters encompass 18 @,@ 981 square kilometres ( 7 @,@ 329 sq mi ) ; its internal waters located within the baseline cover an additional 12 @,@ 498 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 826 sq mi ) . 
 = = = Border disputes = = = 
 = = = = Maritime border disputes = = = = 
 Croatia and Slovenia started negotiations to define maritime borders in the Gulf of Piran in 1992 but failed to agree , resulting in a dispute . Both countries also declared their economic zones , which partially overlap . Croatia 's application to become an EU member state was initially suspended pending resolution of its border disputes with Slovenia . These were eventually settled with an agreement to accept the decision of an international arbitration commission set up via the UN , enabling Croatia to progress towards EU membership . The dispute has caused no major practical problems in areas other than the EU membership negotiations progress , even before the arbitration agreement . 
 The maritime boundary between Bosnia – Herzegovina and Croatia was formally settled in 1999 , but a few issues are still contested — the <unk> peninsula and two islets in the border area . The Croatia – Montenegro maritime boundary is disputed in the Bay of Kotor , at the Prevlaka peninsula . The situation was exacerbated by the peninsula 's occupation by the Yugoslav People 's Army and later by the Serbian @-@ Montenegrin army , which in turn was replaced by a United Nations observer mission that lasted until 2002 . Croatia took over the area with an agreement that allowed Montenegrin presence in Croatian waters in the bay , and the dispute has become far less contentious since the independence of Montenegro in 2006 . 
 = = = = Land border disputes = = = = 
 The land border disputes pertain to comparatively small strips of land . The Croatia – Slovenia border disputes are : along the Dragonja River 's lower course where Slovenia claims three hamlets on the river 's left bank ; the Sveta Gera peak of Žumberak where exact territorial claims were never made and appear to be limited to a military barracks on the peak itself ; and along the Mura River where Slovenia wants the border to be along the current river bed instead of along a former one and claims a ( largely if not completely uninhabited ) piece of land near <unk> . These claims are likewise in the process of being settled by binding arbitration . 
 There are also land border disputes between Croatia and Serbia . The two countries presently control one bank of the present @-@ day river each , but Croatia claims that the border line should follow the cadastral borders between the former municipalities of SR Croatia and SR Serbia along the Danube , as defined by a Yugoslav commission in 1947 ( effectively following a former river bed ) ; borders claimed by Croatia also include the Vukovar and Šarengrad islands in the Danube as its territory . There is also a border dispute with Bosnia – Herzegovina , specifically Croatia claims <unk> channel on the right bank of Una as the border at Hrvatska Kostajnica , while Bosnia and Herzegovina claims Una River course as the border there . 
 = = Physical geography = = 
 = = = Topography = = = 
 Most of Croatia is lowlands , with elevations of less than 200 metres ( 660 ft ) above sea level recorded in 53 @.@ 42 % of the country . Most of the lowlands are found in the country 's northern regions , especially in Slavonia , representing a part of the Pannonian Basin . Areas with elevations of 200 to 500 metres ( 660 to 1 @,@ 640 ft ) above sea level encompass 25 @.@ 61 % of Croatia 's territory , and the areas between 500 and 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 and 3 @,@ 300 ft ) above sea level cover 17 @.@ 11 % of the country . A further 3 @.@ 71 % of the land is 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 to 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level , and only 0 @.@ 15 % of Croatia 's territory is elevated greater than 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) above sea level . The greatest concentration of ground at relatively high elevations is found in the Lika and Gorski Kotar areas in the Dinaric Alps , but such areas are found in all regions of Croatia to some extent . The Pannonian Basin and the Dinaric Alps , along with the Adriatic Basin , represent major geomorphological parts of Croatia . 
 = = = = Adriatic Basin = = = = 
 Croatia 's Adriatic Sea mainland coast is 1 @,@ 777 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 104 @.@ 4 mi ) long , while its 1 @,@ 246 islands and islets have a further 4 @,@ 058 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 522 mi ) of coastline . The distance between the extreme points of Croatia 's coastline is 526 kilometres ( 327 mi ) . The number of islands includes all islands , islets , and rocks of all sizes , including ones emerging only at low tide . The largest islands in the Adriatic are Cres and Krk , each covering 405 @.@ 78 square kilometres ( 156 @.@ 67 sq mi ) ; the tallest is Brač , reaching 780 metres ( 2 @,@ 560 ft ) above sea level . The islands include 47 permanently inhabited ones , the most populous among them being Krk and Korčula . 
 The shore is the most indented coastline in the Mediterranean . The majority of the coast is characterised by a karst topography , developed from the Adriatic Carbonate Platform . Karstification there largely began after the final raising of the Dinarides in the Oligocene and Miocene epochs , when carbonate rock was exposed to atmospheric effects such as rain ; this extended to 120 metres ( 390 ft ) below the present sea level , exposed during the Last Glacial Maximum 's sea level drop . It is estimated that some karst formations are related to earlier drops of sea level , most notably the Messinian salinity crisis . The eastern coast 's largest part consists of carbonate rocks , while flysch rock is significantly represented in the Gulf of Trieste coast , on the Kvarner Gulf coast opposite Krk , and in Dalmatia north of Split . There are comparably small alluvial areas of the Adriatic coast in Croatia — most notably the Neretva river delta . Western Istria is gradually subsiding , having sunk about 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 ft 11 in ) in the past 2 @,@ 000 years . 
 In the Middle Adriatic Basin , there is evidence of Permian volcanism in the area of <unk> on the island of Vis , in addition to the volcanic islands of Jabuka and <unk> . Earthquakes are frequent in the area around the Adriatic Sea , although most are too faint to be felt ; an earthquake doing significant damage happens every few decades , with major earthquakes every few centuries . 
 = = = = Dinaric Alps = = = = 
 The Dinaric Alps are linked to a Late Jurassic to recent times fold and thrust belt , itself part of the Alpine orogeny , extending southeast from the southern Alps . The Dinaric Alps in Croatia encompass the entire Gorski Kotar and Lika regions , as well as considerable parts of Dalmatia , with their northeastern edge running from 1 @,@ 181 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 875 ft ) Žumberak to the Banovina region , along the Sava River , and their westernmost landforms being 1 @,@ 272 @-@ metre ( 4 @,@ 173 ft ) <unk> and 1 @,@ 396 @-@ metre ( 4 @,@ 580 ft ) Učka mountains in Istria . The Dinaric Alps contain the highest mountain in Croatia — 1 @,@ 831 @-@ metre ( 6 @,@ 007 ft ) Dinara — as well as all other mountains in Croatia higher than 1 @,@ 500 metres ( 4 @,@ 900 feet ) : Biokovo , Velebit , <unk> , Velika Kapela , Risnjak , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Karst topography makes up about half of Croatia and is especially prominent in the Dinaric Alps . There are numerous caves in Croatia ; 49 of these are deeper than 250 metres ( 820 @.@ 21 ft ) , 14 deeper than 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 640 @.@ 42 ft ) and 3 deeper than 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 280 @.@ 84 ft ) . The longest cave in Croatia , Kita <unk> , is at the same time the longest cave in the Dinaric Alps at 20 @,@ 656 metres ( 67 @,@ 769 ft ) . 
 = = = = Pannonian Basin = = = = 
 The Pannonian Basin took shape through Miocenian thinning and subsidence of crust structures formed during the Late Paleozoic Variscan orogeny . The Paleozoic and Mesozoic structures are visible in Papuk and other Slavonian mountains . The processes also led to the formation of a stratovolcanic chain in the basin 12 – 17 Mya ; intensified subsidence was observed until 5 Mya as well as flood basalts at about 7 @.@ 5 Mya . The contemporary tectonic uplift of the Carpathian Mountains severed water flow to the Black Sea and the Pannonian Sea formed in the basin . Sediments were transported to the basin from the uplifting Carpathian and Dinaric mountains , with particularly deep fluvial sediments being deposited in the Pleistocene epoch during the Transdanubian Mountains ' formation . Ultimately , up to 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) of sediment was deposited in the basin , and the sea eventually drained through the Iron Gate gorge . 
 The results are large plains in eastern Slavonia 's Baranya and Syrmia regions , as well as in river valleys , especially along the Sava , Drava and Kupa . The plains are interspersed by horst and graben structures , believed to have broken the Pannonian Sea 's surface as islands . The tallest among such landforms are 1 @,@ 059 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 474 ft ) <unk> and 1 @,@ 035 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 396 ft ) Medvednica north of Zagreb — both are also at least partially in Hrvatsko Zagorje — as well as 984 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 228 ft ) Psunj and 953 @-@ metre ( 3 @,@ 127 ft ) Papuk that are the tallest among the Slavonian mountains surrounding Požega . Psunj , Papuk and adjacent Krndija consist mostly of Paleozoic rocks from 300 – 350 Mya . Požeška gora , adjacent to Psunj , consists of much more recent Neogene rocks , but there are also Upper Cretaceous sediments and igneous rocks forming the main , 30 @-@ kilometre ( 19 mi ) ridge of the hill ; these represent the largest igneous landform in Croatia . A smaller piece of igneous terrain is also present on Papuk , near Voćin . The two , as well as the Moslavačka gora mountains , are possibly remnants of a volcanic arc from the same tectonic plate collision that caused the Dinaric Alps .

 The largest part of Croatia — 62 % of its territory — is encompassed by the Black Sea drainage basin . The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country : the Danube , Sava , Drava , Mura and Kupa . The rest belongs to the Adriatic Sea drainage basin , where the largest river by far is the Neretva . The longest rivers in Croatia are the 562 @-@ kilometre ( 349 mi ) Sava , 505 @-@ kilometre ( 314 mi ) Drava , 296 @-@ kilometre ( 184 mi ) Kupa and a 188 @-@ kilometre ( 117 mi ) section of the Danube . The longest rivers emptying into the Adriatic Sea are the 101 @-@ kilometre ( 63 mi ) Cetina and an only 20 @-@ kilometre ( 12 mi ) section of the Neretva . 
 The largest lakes in Croatia are 30 @.@ 7 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 11 @.@ 9 sq mi ) Lake Vrana located in the northern Dalmatia , 17 @.@ 1 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 6 @.@ 6 sq mi ) Lake Dubrava near Varaždin , 13 @.@ 0 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 5 @.@ 0 sq mi ) <unk> Lake ( reservoir ) on the Cetina River , 11 @.@ 1 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 3 sq mi ) Lake <unk> near <unk> and 10 @.@ 1 @-@ square @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 9 sq mi ) Lake Varaždin reservoir through which the Drava River flows near Varaždin . Croatia 's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes , a system of 16 lakes with waterfalls connecting them over dolomite and limestone cascades . The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colours , ranging from turquoise to mint green , grey or blue . Croatia has a remarkable wealth in terms of wetlands . Four of those are included in the Ramsar list of internationally @-@ important wetlands : Lonjsko Polje along the Sava and Lonja rivers near Sisak , <unk> Rit at the confluence of the Drava and Danube , the Neretva Delta and Crna <unk> near Jastrebarsko . 
 Average annual precipitation and evaporation rates are 1 @,@ 162 millimetres ( 45 @.@ 7 in ) and 700 millimetres ( 28 in ) , respectively . Taking into consideration the overall water balance , the total Croatian water resources amount to 25 @,@ 163 cubic metres ( 888 @,@ 600 cu ft ) per year per capita , including 5 @,@ 877 cubic metres ( 207 @,@ 500 cu ft ) per year per capita from sources inside Croatia . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate ( Dfb ) as defined by the Köppen climate classification . Mean monthly temperatures range between − 3 ° C ( 27 ° F ) ( in January ) and 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) ( in July ) . The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar where a snowy forested climate is found at elevations above 1 @,@ 200 metres ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) . The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland , which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate since temperatures are moderated by the sea . Consequently , temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas : the lowest temperature of − 36 @.@ 0 ° C ( − 32 @.@ 8 ° F ) was recorded on 4 February 1929 in Gospić , and the highest temperature of 42 @.@ 8 ° C ( 109 @.@ 0 ° F ) was recorded on 5 August 1981 in Ploče . 
 The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 3 @,@ 500 millimetres ( 24 to 138 in ) depending on the geographic region and prevailing climate type . The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands ( Vis , Lastovo , <unk> , and <unk> ) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia ; however , in the latter case it is mostly during the growing season . The most precipitation is observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski Kotar , where some of the highest annual precipitation totals in Europe occur . 
 The prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest ; in the coastal area , the prevailing winds are determined by local area features . Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast , generally as <unk> or less frequently as <unk> . The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands , Hvar and Korčula , where more than 2 @,@ 700 hours of sunshine are recorded per year , followed by the southern Adriatic Sea area in general , northern Adriatic coast , and Slavonia , all with more than 2 @,@ 000 hours of sunshine per year . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 Croatia can be subdivided between a number of ecoregions because of its climate and geomorphology , and the country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity . There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia : Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland , Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar , Pannonian along the Drava and Danube , and continental in the remaining areas . Among the most significant are karst habitats ; these include submerged karst , such as Zrmanja and Krka canyons and tufa barriers , as well as underground habitats . The karst geology has produced approximately 7 @,@ 000 caves and pits , many of which are inhabited by troglobitic ( exclusively cave @-@ dwelling ) animals such as the olm , a cave salamander and the only European troglobitic vertebrate . Forests are also significant in the country , as they cover 26 @,@ 487 @.@ 6 square kilometres ( 10 @,@ 226 @.@ 9 sq mi ) representing 46 @.@ 8 % of Croatia 's land surface . The other habitat types include wetlands , grasslands , bogs , fens , scrub habitats , coastal and marine habitats . In terms of phytogeography , Croatia is part of the Boreal Kingdom ; specifically , it is part of the Illyrian and Central European provinces of the Circumboreal Region and the Adriatic province of the Mediterranean Region . The World Wide Fund for Nature divides land in Croatia into three ecoregions — Pannonian mixed forests , Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian deciduous forests . Biomes in Croatia include temperate broadleaf / mixed forest and Mediterranean forests , woodlands and scrub ; all are in the Palearctic ecozone . 
 Croatia has 38 @,@ 226 known taxa , 2 @.@ 8 % of which are endemic ; the actual number ( including undiscovered species ) is estimated to be between 50 @,@ 000 and 100 @,@ 000 . The estimate is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of invertebrates discovered in Croatia in 2000 – 2005 alone . There are more than a thousand endemic species , especially in the Velebit and Biokovo mountains , Adriatic islands and karst rivers . Legislation protects 1 @,@ 131 species . Indigenous cultivars of plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous ; they include five breeds of horses , five breeds of cattle , eight breeds of sheep , two breeds of pigs and a poultry breed . Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones . 
 There are 444 Croatian protected areas , encompassing 8 @.@ 5 % of the country . These include 8 national parks , 2 strict reserves and 11 nature parks , accounting for 78 % of the total protected area . The most famous protected area and the oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme . The strict and special reserves , as well as the national and nature parks , are managed and protected by the central government , while other protected areas are managed by counties . In 2005 , the National Ecological Network was set up as the first step in preparation for EU membership and joining the Natura 2000 network . 
 Habitat destruction represents a threat to biodiversity in Croatia , as developed and agricultural land is expanded into previous natural habitats , while habitat fragmentation occurs as roads are created or expanded . A further threat to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species , with Caulerpa racemosa and C. taxifolia identified as especially problematic ones . The invasive algae are monitored and regularly removed to protect the benthic habitat . Agricultural <unk> have also been identified as a threat to biodiversity . 
 = = = Ecology = = = 
 The ecological footprint of Croatia 's population and industry varies significantly between the country 's regions since 50 % of the population resides in 26 @.@ 8 % of the nation 's territory , with a particularly high impact made by the city of Zagreb and Zagreb County areas — their combined area comprises 6 @.@ 6 % of Croatia 's territory while encompassing 25 % of the population . The ecological footprint is most notably from the increased development of settlements and the sea coast leading to habitat fragmentation . Between 1998 and 2008 , the greatest changes of land use pertained to artificially developed areas , but the scale of development is negligible compared to EU member states . 
 The Croatian Environment Agency ( CEA ) , a public institution established by the Government of Croatia to collect and analyse information on the environment , has identified further ecological problems as well as various degrees of progress in terms of curbing their environmental impact . These problems include inadequate legal landfills as well as the presence of illegal landfills ; between 2005 and 2008 , 62 authorized and 423 illegal landfills were rehabilitated . In the same period , the number of issued waste management licenses doubled , while the annual municipal solid waste volume increased by 23 % , reaching 403 kilograms ( 888 pounds ) per capita . The processes of soil acidification and organic matter degradation are present throughout Croatia , with increasing soil salinity levels in the Neretva river plain and spreading areas of alkali soil in Slavonia . 
 Croatian air pollution levels reflect the drop in industrial production recorded in 1991 at the onset of the Croatian War of Independence — pre @-@ war emission levels were only reached in 1997 . The use of <unk> fuels has led to a 25 % reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004 , and a further 7 @.@ 2 % drop by 2007 . The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008 . The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91 @.@ 5 % between 1997 and 2004 . Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean , and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements . The most significant sources of greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions in Croatia are energy production ( 72 % ) , industry ( 13 % ) and agriculture ( 11 % ) . The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3 % , remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits . Between 1990 and 2007 , the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92 % ; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015 . 
 Even though Croatia has sufficient water resources at its disposal , these are not uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high — estimated at 44 % . Between 2004 and 2008 , the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20 % ; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period . At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly , which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants ; their number increased 20 % , reaching a total of 101 . Nearly all of Croatia 's groundwater aquifers are top quality , unlike the available surface water ; the latter 's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results . As of 2008 , 80 % of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system , but only 44 % of the population have access to the public sewerage network , with septic systems in use . Adriatic Sea water quality monitoring between 2004 and 2008 indicated very good , oligotrophic conditions along most of the coast , while areas of increased eutrophication were identified in the Bay of Bakar , the Bay of Kaštela , the Port of Šibenik and near Ploče ; other areas of localized pollution were identified near the larger coastal cities . In the period between 2004 and 2008 , the CEA identified 283 cases of marine pollution ( including 128 from vessels ) , which was a drop of 15 % relative to the period encompassed by the previous report , 1997 to August 2005 .

 Croatia is traditionally divided into numerous , often overlapping geographic regions , whose borders are not always clearly defined . The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia ( also described as the Zagreb macro @-@ region ) , Eastern Croatia ( largely corresponding with Slavonia ) , and Mountainous Croatia ( Lika and Gorski Kotar ; to the west of Central Croatia ) . These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia . Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions : Dalmatia or the southern littoral , between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country ; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia , encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria . The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions , and all of them encompass further , more specific , geographic regions .

 = = = Demographics = = = 
 The demographic features of the Croatian population are known through censuses , normally conducted in ten @-@ year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s . The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s . The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011 . The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4 @.@ 29 million . The population density was 75 @.@ 8 inhabitants per square kilometre , and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth is 75 @.@ 7 years . The population rose steadily ( with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars ) from 2 @.@ 1 million in 1857 until 1991 , when it peaked at 4 @.@ 7 million . Since 1991 , Croatia 's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate ; the natural growth rate of the population is thus currently negative . Croatia is currently in the demographic transition 's fourth or fifth stage . In terms of age structure , the population is dominated by the 15 ‑ to 64 ‑ year ‑ old segment .

 Croatia is inhabited mostly by Croats ( 89 @.@ 6 % ) , while minorities include Serbs ( 4 @.@ 5 % ) and 21 other ethnicities ( less than 1 % each ) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia . The demographic history of Croatia is marked by significant migrations , including : the Croats ' arrival in the area ; the growth of the Hungarian and German speaking population after the personal union of Croatia and Hungary ; joining of the Habsburg Empire ; migrations set off by the Ottoman conquests ; and the growth of the Italian @-@ speaking population in Istria and Dalmatia during the Venetian rule there . After Austria @-@ Hungary 's collapse , the Hungarian population declined , while the German @-@ speaking population was forced out or fled during the last part of and after World War II , and a similar fate was suffered by the Italian population . The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad . The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia , as well as by urbanisation . The most recent significant migrations came as a result of the Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced . 
 The Croatian language is Croatia 's official language , but the languages of constitutionally @-@ recognised minorities are officially used in some local government units . Croatian is the native language identified by 96 % of the population . A 2009 survey revealed that 78 % of Croatians claim knowledge of at least one foreign language — most often English . The largest religions of Croatia are Roman Catholicism ( 86 @.@ 3 % ) , Orthodox Christianity ( 4 @.@ 4 % ) and Islam ( 1 @.@ 5 % ) . Literacy in Croatia stands at 98 @.@ 1 % . The proportion of the population aged 15 and over attaining academic degrees has grown rapidly since 2001 , doubling and reaching 16 @.@ 7 % by 2008 . An estimated 4 @.@ 5 % of GDP is spent for education . Primary and secondary education are available in Croatian and in the languages of recognised minorities . Croatia has a universal health care system and in 2010 , the nation spent 6 @.@ 9 % of its GDP on healthcare . The net monthly income in September 2011 averaged 5 @,@ 397 kuna ( c . € 729 ) . The most significant sources of employment in 2008 were wholesale and retail trade , the manufacturing industry and construction . In October 2011 , the unemployment rate was 17 @.@ 4 % . Croatia 's median equivalent household income tops the average Purchasing Power Standard of the ten countries which joined the EU in 2004 , while trailing the EU average . The 2011 census recorded a total of 1 @.@ 5 million private households ; most owned their own housing . 
 = = = Political geography = = = 
 Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the Middle Ages . The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory , in addition to changes in the political status of Dalmatia , Dubrovnik and Istria . The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s , when the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced oblasts and banovinas respectively . Communist @-@ ruled Croatia , as a constituent part of post @-@ WWII Yugoslavia , abolished earlier divisions and introduced ( mostly rural ) municipalities , subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities . Counties were reintroduced in 1992 by legislation , significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre @-@ 1920s subdivisions — for instance , in 1918 the Transleithanian part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in Bjelovar , Gospić , Ogulin , Požega , Vukovar , Varaždin , Osijek and Zagreb , while the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory . Međimurje County was established in the eponymous region acquired through the 1920 Treaty of Trianon . ( The 1990 Croatian Constitution provided for a Chamber of the Counties as part of the government , and for counties themselves without specifying their names or number . However , the counties were not actually re @-@ established until 1992 , and the first Chamber of the Counties was elected in 1993 . ) 
 Since the counties were re @-@ established in 1992 , Croatia has been divided into 20 counties and the capital city of Zagreb , the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time ( Zagreb County outside the city is administratively separate as of 1997 ) . The county borders have changed in some instances since ( for reasons such as historical ties and requests by cities ) , with the latest revision taking place in 2006 . The counties subdivide into 127 cities and 429 municipalities . 
 The EU Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics ( NUTS ) division of Croatia is performed in several tiers . NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit , while there are three NUTS 2 regions ; these are Central and Eastern ( Pannonian ) Croatia , Northwest Croatia and Adriatic Croatia . The last encompasses all counties along the Adriatic coast . Northwest Croatia includes the city of Zagreb and Krapina @-@ Zagorje , Varaždin , Koprivnica @-@ Križevci , Međimurje and Zagreb counties , and the Central and Eastern ( Pannonian ) Croatia includes the remaining areas — Bjelovar @-@ Bilogora , Virovitica @-@ Podravina , Požega @-@ Slavonia , Brod @-@ Posavina , Osijek @-@ Baranja , Vukovar @-@ Syrmia , Karlovac and Sisak @-@ Moslavina counties . Individual counties and the city of Zagreb represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia . The NUTS Local administrative unit divisions are two @-@ tiered . The LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb — in effect making these the same as NUTS 3 units — while the LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia .

 The average urbanisation rate in Croatia stands at 56 % , with a growing urban population and shrinking rural population . The largest city and the nation 's capital is Zagreb , with an urban population of 686 @,@ 568 in the city itself . Zagreb 's metropolitan area encompasses 341 additional settlements and , by the year 2001 , the population of the area had reached 978 @,@ 161 ; approximately 60 % of Zagreb County 's residents live in Zagreb 's metropolitan area , as does about 41 % of Croatia 's urban population .

 = Cleveland = 
 Cleveland ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County , the most populous county in the state . The city is located in northeastern Ohio on the southern shore of Lake Erie , approximately 60 miles ( 100 kilometers ) west of the Pennsylvania border . It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River , and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore , as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines . Cleveland 's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing , financial services , healthcare , and biomedical . Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 
 As of the 2013 Census Estimate , the city proper had a total population of 390 @,@ 113 , making Cleveland the 48th largest city in the United States , and the second largest city in Ohio after Columbus . Greater Cleveland , the Cleveland @-@ Elyria @-@ Mentor , OH Metropolitan Statistical Area , ranked 29th largest in the United States , and second largest in Ohio after Cincinnati with 2 @,@ 064 @,@ 725 people in 2013 . Cleveland is part of the larger Cleveland @-@ Akron @-@ Canton , OH Combined Statistical Area , which in 2013 had a population of 3 @,@ 501 @,@ 538 , and ranked as the country 's 15th largest CSA . Residents of Cleveland are called " Clevelanders " . Cleveland has many nicknames , the oldest of which in contemporary use being " The Forest City " . 
 = = History = = 
 Cleveland obtained its name on July 22 , 1796 when surveyors of the Connecticut Land Company laid out Connecticut 's Western Reserve into townships and a capital city they named " Cleaveland " after their leader , General Moses Cleaveland . Cleaveland oversaw the plan for what would become the modern downtown area , centered on Public Square , before returning home , never again to visit Ohio . The first settler in Cleaveland was Lorenzo Carter , who built a cabin on the banks of the Cuyahoga River . The Village of Cleaveland was incorporated on December 23 , 1814 . In spite of the nearby swampy lowlands and harsh winters , its waterfront location proved to be an advantage . The area began rapid growth after the 1832 completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal . This key link between the Ohio River and the Great Lakes connected the city to the Atlantic Ocean via the Erie Canal and later via the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Gulf of Mexico via the Mississippi River . Growth continued with added railroad links . Cleveland incorporated as a city in 1836 . 
 In 1836 , the city , then located only on the eastern banks of the Cuyahoga River , nearly erupted into open warfare with neighboring Ohio City over a bridge connecting the two . Ohio City remained an independent municipality until its annexation by Cleveland in 1854 . 
 The city 's prime geographic location as transportation hub on the Great Lakes has played an important role in its development as a commercial center . Cleveland serves as a destination point for iron ore shipped from Minnesota , along with coal transported by rail . In 1870 , John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil in Cleveland , and moved its headquarters to New York City in 1885 . Cleveland emerged in the early 20th Century as an important American manufacturing center , which included automotive companies such as Peerless , People 's , Jordan , Chandler , and Winton , maker of the first car driven across the U.S. Other manufacturers located in Cleveland produced steam @-@ powered cars , which included White and <unk> , as well as the electric car company Baker . Because of the significant growth , Cleveland was known as the " Sixth City " during this period . 
 By 1920 , due in large part to the city 's economic prosperity , Cleveland became the nation 's fifth largest city . The city counted Progressive Era politicians such as the populist Mayor Tom L. Johnson among its leaders . Many prominent Clevelanders from this era are buried in the historic Lake View Cemetery , including President James A. Garfield , and John D. Rockefeller . 
 In commemoration of the centennial of Cleveland 's incorporation as a city , the Great Lakes Exposition debuted in June 1936 along the Lake Erie shore north of downtown . Conceived as a way to energize a city after the Great Depression , it drew four million visitors in its first season , and seven million by the end of its second and final season in September 1937 . The exposition was housed on grounds that are now used by the Great Lakes Science Center , the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Burke Lakefront Airport , among others . Following World War II , the city experienced a prosperous economy . In sports , the Indians won the 1948 World Series and the Browns dominated professional football in the 1950s . Businesses proclaimed that Cleveland was the " best location in the nation " . In 1940 , non @-@ Hispanic whites represented 90 @.@ 2 % of Cleveland 's population . The city 's population reached its peak of 914 @,@ 808 , and in 1949 Cleveland was named an All @-@ America City for the first time . By the 1960s , the economy slowed , and residents sought new housing in the suburbs , reflecting the national trends of urban flight and suburban growth . 
 In the 1950s and 1960s , social and racial unrest occurred in Cleveland , resulting in the Hough Riots from July 18 to 23 , 1966 and the Glenville Shootout from July 23 to 25 , 1968 . In November 1967 , Cleveland became the first major American city to elect a black mayor , Carl Stokes ( who served from 1968 to 1971 ) . 
 Suburbanization changed the city in the late 1960s and 1970s , when financial difficulties and a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River challenged the city . This , along with the city 's struggling professional sports teams , drew negative national press . As a result , Cleveland was often derided as " The Mistake on the Lake " . 
 In December 1978 , Cleveland became the first major American city to enter into a financial default on federal loans since the Great Depression . By the beginning of the 1980s , several factors , including changes in international free trade policies , inflation and the Savings and Loans Crisis contributed to the recession that impacted cities like Cleveland . While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983 , Cleveland 's rate of 13 @.@ 8 % was higher than the national average due to the closure of several production centers . 
 The metropolitan area began a gradual economic recovery under mayors George Voinovich and Michael R. White . Redevelopment within the city limits has been strongest in the downtown area near the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex — consisting of Progressive Field and Quicken Loans Arena — and near North Coast Harbor , including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , FirstEnergy Stadium , and the Great Lakes Science Center . Cleveland has been hailed by local media as the " Comeback City " , while economic development of the inner @-@ city neighborhoods and improvement of the school systems are municipal priorities . In 1999 , Cleveland was identified as an emerging global city . 
 In the 21st century , the city has improved infrastructure , is more diversified , and has invested in the arts . Cleveland is generally considered an example of revitalization . The city 's goals include additional neighborhood revitalization and increased funding for public education . In 2009 , it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to host the 2014 Gay Games , the fourth city in the United States to host this international event . On July 8 , 2014 , it was announced that Cleveland was chosen to be the host city of the 2016 Republican National Convention .

 According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 82 @.@ 47 square miles ( 213 @.@ 60 km2 ) , of which 77 @.@ 70 square miles ( 201 @.@ 24 km2 ) is land and 4 @.@ 77 square miles ( 12 @.@ 35 km2 ) is water . The shore of Lake Erie is 569 feet ( 173 m ) above sea level ; however , the city lies on a series of irregular bluffs lying roughly perpendicular to the lake . In Cleveland these bluffs are cut principally by the Cuyahoga River , Big Creek , and Euclid Creek . The land rises quickly from the lakeshore . Public Square , less than one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) inland , sits at an elevation of 650 feet ( 198 m ) , and Hopkins Airport , 5 miles ( 8 km ) inland from the lake , is at an elevation of 791 feet ( 241 m ) .

 Cleveland 's downtown architecture is diverse . Many of the city 's government and civic buildings , including City Hall , the Cuyahoga County Courthouse , the Cleveland Public Library , and Public Auditorium , are clustered around an open mall and share a common neoclassical architecture . Built in the early 20th century , they are the result of the 1903 Group Plan , and constitute one of the most complete examples of City Beautiful design in the United States . The Terminal Tower , dedicated in 1930 , was the tallest building in North America outside New York City until 1964 and the tallest in the city until 1991 . It is a prototypical Beaux @-@ Arts skyscraper . The two newer skyscrapers on Public Square , Key Tower ( currently the tallest building in Ohio ) and the 200 Public Square , combine elements of Art Deco architecture with postmodern designs . Another of Cleveland 's architectural treasures is The Arcade ( sometimes called the Old Arcade ) , a five @-@ story arcade built in 1890 and renovated in 2001 as a Hyatt Regency Hotel . Cleveland 's landmark ecclesiastical architecture includes the historic Old Stone Church in downtown Cleveland and the onion domed St. Theodosius Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Tremont , along with myriad ethnically inspired Roman Catholic churches . Running east from Public Square through University Circle is Euclid Avenue , which was known for its prestige and elegance . In the late 1880s , writer Bayard Taylor described it as " the most beautiful street in the world " . Known as " Millionaire 's Row " , Euclid Avenue was world @-@ renowned as the home of such internationally known names as Rockefeller , Hanna , and Hay .

 Downtown Cleveland is centered on Public Square and includes a wide range of diversified districts . Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center , as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District , which is home to Playhouse Square Center . Mixed @-@ use neighborhoods such as the Flats and the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars . The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums , lofts , and apartments has been on the increase since 2000 . Recent developments include the revival of the Flats , the Euclid Corridor Project , and the developments along East 4th Street . Cleveland residents geographically define themselves in terms of whether they live on the east or west side of the Cuyahoga River . The east side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye @-@ Shaker , Central , Collinwood , Corlett , Euclid @-@ Green , Fairfax , Forest Hills , Glenville , Payne / Goodrich @-@ Kirtland Park , Hough , Kinsman , Lee Harvard / Seville @-@ Miles , Mount Pleasant , Nottingham , St. Clair @-@ Superior , Union @-@ Miles Park , University Circle , Little Italy , and Woodland Hills . The west side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre , Clark @-@ Fulton , Detroit @-@ Shoreway , <unk> , Edgewater , Ohio City , Tremont , Old Brooklyn , Stockyards , West Boulevard , and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park : Kamm 's Corners , Jefferson , <unk> @-@ <unk> , and Riverside . Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side : Industrial Valley / Duck Island , Slavic Village ( North and South Broadway ) , and Tremont . 
 Several inner @-@ city neighborhoods have begun to <unk> in recent years . Areas on both the west side ( Ohio City , Tremont , Detroit @-@ Shoreway , and Edgewater ) and the east side ( Collinwood , Hough , Fairfax , and Little Italy ) have been successful in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members , which in turn is spurring new residential development . Furthermore , a live @-@ work zoning overlay for the city 's near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists .

 = = = Climate = = = 
 Typical of the Great Lakes region , Cleveland exhibits a continental climate with four distinct seasons , which lies in the humid continental ( Köppen Dfa ) zone . Summers are warm to hot and humid while winters are cold and snowy . The Lake Erie shoreline is very close to due east @-@ west from the mouth of the Cuyahoga west to Sandusky , but at the mouth of the Cuyahoga it turns sharply northeast . This feature is the principal contributor to the lake effect snow that is typical in Cleveland ( especially on the city 's East Side ) from mid @-@ November until the surface of Lake Erie freezes , usually in late January or early February . The lake effect also causes a relative differential in geographical snowfall totals across the city : while Hopkins Airport , on the city 's far West Side , has only reached 100 inches ( 254 cm ) of snowfall in a season three times since record @-@ keeping for snow began in 1893 , seasonal totals approaching or exceeding 100 inches ( 254 cm ) are not uncommon as the city ascends into the Heights on the east , where the region known as the ' Snow Belt ' begins . Extending from the city 's East Side and its suburbs , the Snow Belt reaches up the Lake Erie shore as far as Buffalo . 
 The all @-@ time record high in Cleveland of 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) was established on June 25 , 1988 , and the all @-@ time record low of − 20 ° F ( − 29 ° C ) was set on January 19 , 1994 .

 Cleveland 's geographic location on the Cuyahoga River and Lake Erie has been key to its growth . The Ohio and Erie Canal coupled with rail links helped establish the city as an important business center . Steel and many other manufactured goods emerged as leading industries . 
 The city diversified its economy in addition to its manufacturing sector . Cleveland is home to the corporate headquarters of many large companies such as Applied Industrial Technologies , Cliffs Natural Resources , Forest City Enterprises , <unk> Industries , Sherwin @-@ Williams Company and <unk> . NASA maintains a facility in Cleveland , the Glenn Research Center . Jones Day , one of the largest law firms in the US , began in Cleveland . In 2007 , Cleveland 's commercial real estate market experienced rebound with a record pace of purchases , with a housing vacancy of 10 % . 
 The Cleveland Clinic is the city 's largest private employer with a workforce of over 37 @,@ 000 as of 2008 . It carries the distinction as being among America 's best hospitals with top ratings published in U.S. News & World Report .

Cleveland is also noted in the fields of biotechnology and fuel cell research , led by Case Western Reserve University , the Cleveland Clinic , and University Hospitals of Cleveland . Cleveland is among the top recipients of investment for biotech start @-@ ups and research . Case Western Reserve , the Clinic , and University Hospitals have recently announced plans to build a large biotechnology research center and incubator on the site of the former Mt . Sinai Medical Center , creating a research campus to stimulate biotech startup companies that can be spun off from research conducted in the city . 
 City leaders promoted growth of the technology sector in the first decade of the 21st century . Mayor Jane L. Campbell appointed a " tech czar " to recruit technology companies to the downtown office market , offering connections to the high @-@ speed fiber networks that run underneath downtown streets in several " high @-@ tech offices " focused on the Euclid Avenue area . Cleveland State University hired a technology transfer officer to cultivate technology transfers from CSU research to marketable ideas and companies in the Cleveland area , and appointed a vice president for economic development . Case Western Reserve University participated in technology initiatives such as the OneCommunity project , a high @-@ speed fiber optic network linking the area 's research centers intended to stimulate growth . In mid @-@ 2005 , Cleveland was named an Intel " Worldwide Digital Community " along with Corpus Christi , Texas , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , and Taipei .

 = = History = = 
 The first bishop of Manchester , Denis Mary Bradley , invited the Benedictine monks of St. Mary 's Abbey in Newark , New Jersey , to form a college and preparatory school in his diocese . The monks that came to Manchester from Saint Mary 's were primarily of German descent . This is due to the fact that Manchester was heavily populated with French Canadian and Irish immigrant mill workers , and Bradley was unable to find a suitable religious community that would not stir up ethnic tensions . The German monks accepted , and founded the third Catholic college in New England . On August 1 , 1889 , the New Hampshire legislature approved the incorporation of the Order of Saint Benedict of New Hampshire “ for religious and charitable purposes , for the education of youth , for establishing churches and conducting services therein . ” This historic date marked the founding of Saint Anselm College . A six @-@ year curriculum in philosophy and theology was developed . In 1892 , as Alumni Hall neared completion , a fire destroyed the college on a cold winter night in February . The fire was most likely caused from an ember from the heating stove 's gate as it was not closed properly . Thankfully , no one was seriously hurt because of the fire . The monks were forced to rebuild the college , spending considerably less money on the construction , as they had received only $ 55 @,@ 000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire . To save money , many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad . In 1893 , the current building that remains the center of campus was completed ; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year . The monks rebuilt the college , and on October 11 , 1893 the college was officially rededicated . To avoid the possibility of another fire , a power house , which today serves as the college print shop , was constructed separately from the building . Two years later , in 1895 , the New Hampshire legislature granted Saint Anselm College the right to bestow standard academic degrees upon its graduates . In 1912 , the bell tower and ivy were added to the building ; in 1923 , the college 's second chapel ( the first being located on the second floor at the present @-@ day business office ) was constructed as a connecting wing . The second chapel serves today as the Alva <unk> Megan Chapel Arts Center . 
 The Abbey Shield was designed by Pierre de <unk> la Rose of Harvard University . It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal of the state of New Hampshire . In 1927 , by a monastic vote , the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college . The drops in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm 's coat of arms , and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of New Hampshire , representing the five original counties of the state . Hence , the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire . 
 One goal of the early college was to be a self @-@ sufficient institution . The college had a farm that was over 100 acres ( 0 @.@ 40 km2 ) in size , complete with chickens , pigs and cows . The farm also included a full vegetable garden which extended from the lawn of Alumni Hall to the current parking lot located between Joan of Arc Hall and Davison Hall . Due to the hard work of the monks and several lay members from the local community , the college was agriculturally independent of the local community . Fr . Bonaventure <unk> , O. S. B. founded the Studio of Christian Art in 1893 in order to sell paintings to local Catholic churches throughout the region . The current Raphael House of the Courts dorms was the original art studio for the monks , built in 1895 . 
 The Benedictines who established Saint Anselm founded a preparatory school , as well . The preparatory school was a prestigious boarding school for elite men from around New England . In 1935 , the monks decided to close the preparatory school to save money for the college 's expansion . A notable alum of Saint Anselm Preparatory was Connecticut Senator Thomas J. Dodd . 
 In 1942 , Saint Anselm became one of the institutions selected by the War Department for training of Army Aviation cadets . Thousands of young men were sent to the college to receive training and education before entering World War II . Cadets trained on large open fields which were located directly behind the present @-@ day Coffee Shop . The U.S. government paid the college for training the cadets , and after the war , the college acquired two prefabricated government buildings which have been transformed into the modern @-@ day coffee shop and bookstore . During World War II , several members of the monastic community served as Army chaplains ; their names are inscribed on a monument in front of Alumni Hall dedicated to all graduates who have served in the armed forces . Also inscribed on the monument is the Latin and English versions of the Benedictine community 's song . For more information see Saint Anselm Abbey Community Song . 
 Saint Anselm came out of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s with no major disturbances or riots on campus despite various bomb threats called into campus , often from parties outside the college . Fr . <unk> Riley , O.S.B. successfully lead the college through these challenging times . Despite the backlash against the U.S. military on college campuses nationwide , the presence of a National Guard armory did not result in any major problems . However , in May 1970 , final exams for that year were made optional as students showed support for the students of Kent State after the massacre of several unarmed college students protesting the Vietnam War . Students , faculty and members of the monastic community held prayer services and rallies throughout campus after the shootings . 
 The Institute of Saint Anselm Studies was founded in 2000 , and the New Hampshire Institute of Politics was founded in 2001 . In 2009 , the college lost a notable trustee , Dominic DiMaggio , an All @-@ Star center fielder for Boston Red Sox who served on the college 's Board of Trustees from 1978 to 2009 .

 Saint Anselm 's campus has been noted as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States , exemplified by the Princeton Review 's number # 17 " Most Beautiful Campus " ranking in 2011 . The campus is situated in Goffstown , New Hampshire , with a portion of the athletic fields occupying the adjoining town of Bedford . The mailing address for students and faculty is Manchester , New Hampshire . There are a total of 60 buildings on campus , which spans over 450 acres ( 1 @.@ 8 km2 ) . Since 1977 , over 40 buildings have been built . The oldest building on campus is Alumni Hall , which was originally constructed in 1891 , and rebuilt in 1893 after a fire ; at that time , the building was the entire original school . 
 Within the next ten years , there are plans to change the current roads and re @-@ route the traffic flow of the entire campus .

 Alumni Hall was constructed by the Benedictine monks and local contractors from 1891 through the winter of 1892 ; the building was designed by Patrick W. Ford , an Irish @-@ American architect from Boston . Nearing completion in February 1892 , all that remained was for workers to continue to plaster the interior walls ; sadly , a fire which was most likely caused by a heating stove 's gate not closed completely , sparked an ember and destroyed the entire structure .
