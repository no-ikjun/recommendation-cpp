 Didier Yves Drogba <unk> ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 11 March 1978 ) is an Ivorian professional footballer who plays as a striker for Canadian Major League Soccer club Montreal Impact . He is the all @-@ time top scorer and former captain of the Ivory Coast national team . He is best known for his career at Chelsea , for whom he has scored more goals than any other foreign player and is currently the club 's fourth highest goal scorer of all time . He has been named African Footballer of the Year twice , winning the accolade in 2006 and 2009 . 
 After playing in youth teams , Drogba made his professional debut aged 18 for Ligue 2 club Le Mans , and signed his first professional contract aged 21 . After finishing the 2002 – 03 season with 17 goals in 34 appearances for Ligue 1 side Guingamp , he moved to Olympique de Marseille , where he finished as the third highest scorer in the 2003 – 04 season with 19 goals and helped the club reach the 2004 UEFA Cup Final . 
 In the summer of 2004 , Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for a club record £ 24 million fee , making him the most expensive Ivorian player in history . In his debut season he helped the club win their first league title in 50 years , and a year later he won another Premier League title . In March 2012 , he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals , and also became the only player in history to score in four separate FA Cup finals the same year , when he scored in Chelsea 's win over Liverpool in the 2012 final . He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final , in which he scored an 88th @-@ minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the deciding shoot @-@ out against Bayern Munich . After spending 6 months with Shanghai Shenhua in China , and one and a half seasons with Turkish club Galatasaray where he scored the winning goal in the final of the 2013 Turkish Super Cup , Drogba returned to Chelsea in July 2014 . With a career record of scoring 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies at club level , Drogba has been referred to as the " ultimate big game player . " 
 An Ivory Coast international between 2002 and 2014 , Drogba captained the national team from 2006 until his retirement from the Ivory Coast team and is the nation 's all @-@ time top goalscorer with 63 goals from 104 appearances . He led the Ivory Coast to the 2006 FIFA World Cup , their first appearance in the tournament , and also scored their first goal . He later captained the Ivory Coast at the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cups . He was part of the Ivory Coast teams that reached the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in 2006 and 2012 , but were beaten on penalties on both occasions . On 8 August 2014 , he announced his retirement from international football . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Drogba was born in Abidjan , Ivory Coast , and at the age of five was sent to France by his parents to live with his uncle , Michel Goba , a professional footballer . However , Drogba soon became homesick and returned to Abidjan after three years . His mother nicknamed him " Tito " , after president Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia , whom she admired greatly . He played football every day in a car park in the city but his return to the Ivory Coast was short lived . Both of his parents lost their jobs and he again returned to live with his uncle . In 1991 , his parents also travelled to France ; first to Vannes and then , in 1993 , setting in Antony in the Paris suburbs , at which point the 15 @-@ year @-@ old Drogba returned to live with them and his siblings . It was here that he began playing team football more frequently , joining a local youth side . Drogba then joined the semi @-@ professional club Levallois , gaining a reputation as a prolific scorer in the youth team and impressing the coach with his professional attitude . His performances earned him a place in the senior squad but despite scoring in his debut , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Ivorian failed to make an impression on Jacques <unk> , the first team coach . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Le Mans = = = 
 When Drogba finished school he moved to the city Le Mans to study accountancy at university and he had to change clubs , becoming an apprentice at Ligue 2 club Le Mans . However , his first two years there were marred by injuries and he was physically struggling to cope with the training and match schedule . Former Le Mans coach Marc <unk> later remarked that " it took Didier four years to be capable of training every day and playing every week " . Furthermore , Drogba 's complicated family life meant that he had never attended a football academy and only began daily football training as a fully grown adult . 
 By age 21 , Drogba realised that he had to establish himself as a player soon or else he would have little chance of becoming a professional footballer . He made his first team debut for Le Mans soon thereafter and signed his first professional contract in 1999 . The same year , he and his Malian wife Alla had their first child , Isaac . He grew into his new responsibilities , later stating : " Isaac 's birth was a turning point in my life , it straightened me out " . His first season , in which he scored seven goals in thirty games , boded well for the future , but during the following season he did not live up to expectations . Drogba lost his place to Daniel Cousin due to injury , then upon his return , he failed to score throughout the remainder of the season . However , he returned to form the following season , scoring five goals in 21 appearances . 
 = = = Guingamp = = = 
 Halfway through the 2001 – 02 season Ligue 1 club Guingamp consolidated months of interest with a transfer offer and Drogba left Le Mans for a fee of £ 80 @,@ 000 . The second half of the 2001 – 02 season saw Drogba make 11 appearances and score three goals for Guingamp . While his contributions helped the club avoid relegation , the coaching staff remained unconvinced of their new young striker . However , the next season he rewarded his coaches ' patience , scoring 17 goals in 34 appearances and helping Guingamp finish seventh , a record league finish . He credited his teammates for his impressive season , highlighting the contributions of winger Florent Malouda , a long time friend of Drogba , as a key factor in his goalscoring <unk> that season . His strong goal scoring record attracted interest from larger clubs and at the end of the season , he moved to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille for a fee of £ 3 @.@ 3 million . 
 = = = Marseille = = = 
 After a switch of coaches , Drogba retained his position in the team , scoring 19 goals and winning the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Player of the Year award . He also scored five goals in that season 's UEFA Champions League and six in the UEFA Cup . At the end of the season , he was bought by Chelsea as the club 's then record signing for £ 24 million .

 Signing for Chelsea in July 2004 for £ 24 million , Drogba scored in his third game for the club with a header against Crystal Palace . His season was interrupted when he pulled a stomach muscle against Liverpool which kept him out of action for over two months . Chelsea won the Premier League , only their second English top @-@ flight championship and their first in 50 years , and the League Cup . Later , Drogba scored in extra time in a 3 – 2 final win against Liverpool at the Millennium Stadium , as well as reaching the semi @-@ finals of the Champions League . Drogba scored a somewhat disappointing 16 goals in a total of 40 games for Chelsea in his first season : ten in the Premier League , five in the Champions League and one in the League Cup final . 
 Drogba started the 2005 – 06 season by scoring two goals in a Community Shield win over Arsenal . His reputation was marred amidst accusations of cheating during Chelsea 's 2 – 0 win over Manchester City . Replays showed that he had used his hand to control the ball before scoring the second of his two goals . This occurred just a week after a similar incident against Fulham where the goal was disallowed . Chelsea went on to retain the league title with two games to play , becoming only the second club to win back @-@ to @-@ back English titles in the Premier League era . Again Drogba finished with 16 goals for the season , 12 in the Premier League , two in the Community Shield , one in the Champions League and one in the FA Cup . 
 = = = = 2006 – 07 = = = = 
 After the departure of Damien Duff to Newcastle United , Drogba switched from the number 15 shirt he had worn for Chelsea since 2004 to the number 11 shirt vacated by Duff . The season was a personal success for Drogba as he hit 33 goals in all competitions ( more than his tally in the previous two seasons combined ) , including 20 in the Premier League to win the Golden Boot . In doing so , he became the first Chelsea player since Kerry Dixon in 1984 – 85 to reach 30 goals in a season , scoring 20 in the Premier League , six in the Champions League , three in the FA Cup and four in the League Cup . 
 Among the highlights were scoring game @-@ winners from outside the penalty area against Liverpool , Everton and Barcelona , a 93rd @-@ minute equaliser against Barcelona at the Camp Nou and both Chelsea 's goals in their 2 – 1 League Cup final win over Arsenal . He also completed two hat @-@ tricks ; one against Watford and the other against Levski Sofia in the Champions League , Chelsea 's first hat @-@ trick in European competition since Gianluca Vialli in the Cup Winners ' Cup in 1997 . In his last competitive game that season , he scored the winning goal over Manchester United in the first FA Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium . This also meant that he joined Norman Whiteside ( Manchester United in 1983 ) and Mark Hughes ( Manchester United in 1994 ) as players who have scored goals in both English domestic finals in the same year , although Drogba was the first player to end up on the winning team after scoring in both finals . 
 In January 2007 , Drogba was named the Ivorian Player of the Year , ahead of Kader Keïta , Aruna <unk> , and Kolo Touré . In March , he was named African Footballer of the Year for the first time , ahead of Samuel Eto 'o and Chelsea teammate Michael Essien . His performances during the season saw him named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year and runner @-@ up to Cristiano Ronaldo in the PFA Player of the Year awards . 
 Drogba faced problems off the pitch during the end of the season as his transfer from Marseille to Chelsea in July 2004 came under scrutiny . The Stevens inquiry in June 2007 expressed concerns because of the lack of co @-@ operation from agents <unk> Zahavi and Barry <unk> . 
 = = = = 2007 – 08 = = = = 
 The 2007 – 08 season began badly for Drogba as he expressed doubts about the departure of manager José Mourinho . He was reportedly in tears when Mourinho told him he was leaving the club , and said " Mourinho 's departure destroys a certain familiarity we had at the club . Many of us used to play first and foremost for the manager . Now we need to forget those feelings and find another source of motivation " . Following these claims , Drogba told France Football Magazine " I want to leave Chelsea . Something is broken with Chelsea , The damage is big in the dressing room " . Despite having signed a four @-@ year contract with the club in 2006 , Drogba reportedly pointed out several favoured clubs in the interview , identifying Barcelona , Real Madrid , Milan or Internazionale as possible future destinations , he later admitted he regretted this and was 100 % committed to Chelsea . Drogba made it up to the fans by scoring in Chelsea 's 2 – 0 victory over Middlesbrough on 20 October 2007 , against Schalke 04 in the Champions League four days later , and two goals against Manchester City . In December 2007 , Drogba was voted fourth ( after Kaká , Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo ) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year . 
 Drogba continued scoring goals but suffered an injury at the training ground and decided to have an operation on his knee . He was unable to play for four weeks and missed key games against Valencia , Arsenal and Liverpool . Drogba returned from injury to play in an FA Cup third round match against Queens Park Rangers and wore the captain 's armband for the last 30 minutes he was on the pitch , but that was his last performance for Chelsea before international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations . Upon his return , Drogba scored a goal in the 2008 League Cup Final , making him the all @-@ time leading scorer in League Cup Finals with four goals , but could not help prevent Chelsea fall to a 2 – 1 defeat at the hands of Tottenham Hotspur . Drogba also became the first player to score in three League Cup finals and the first to score in three consecutive English domestic cup finals . He scored both goals in a key 2 – 1 victory against Arsenal on 23 March 2008 , bringing Chelsea equal on points with leaders Manchester United . 
 On 26 April 2008 , Drogba faced controversy after a clash with Manchester United defender Nemanja Vidić . The Serbian centre @-@ back had to have stitches under his lip after losing a tooth in the clash . There was discussion whether Drogba had the intention or not to injure his rival . The debate also called into question an earlier incident on 26 November 2006 where Drogba elbowed Vidić . Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson expressed concerns over elbowing in the Premier League . Despite media speculation , Drogba 's yellow card for the clash was deemed adequate punishment by the Football Association . 
 Controversy still dogged the player as before the UEFA Champions League semi @-@ final second leg clash with Liverpool , Drogba was accused of diving by Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez . Benítez claimed to have compiled a four @-@ year dossier of Drogba 's " diving " antics but Drogba hit back at Benítez in an interview . On 30 April 2008 , Drogba scored two goals in the second leg of the semi @-@ final against Liverpool , which Chelsea won 3 – 2 at Stamford Bridge . This was the first time Chelsea had beaten Liverpool in the semi @-@ finals of the Champions League , having lost their previous two meetings to Liverpool . This also led to Chelsea reaching their first Champions League Final . Drogba became Chelsea 's top scorer in European competition , the two goals he scored put his total at 17 , surpassing Peter Osgood 's record of 16 . Drogba was sent off in the 117th minute of the Champions League Final for slapping defender Vidić , becoming only the second player to be sent off in a European Cup final – after Jens Lehmann in 2006 – and the first for violent conduct . Chelsea went on to lose 6 – 5 on penalties after a 1 – 1 draw in extra time . Chelsea assistant boss Henk ten Cate revealed Drogba was due to take the decisive fifth spot @-@ kick in the shootout . Team captain John Terry took his place but missed after slipping whilst taking the penalty .

 Drogba suffered a string of injuries early on in the 2008 – 09 season and struggled to regain fitness , missing games from August to November due to knee problems .

Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2 – 1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League , while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2 – 0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008 . Having missed many games through injury and suspension , Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two . However , he resolved to regain his position in the squad . 
 Upon the temporary appointment of Guus Hiddink in early February following the sacking of Scolari , Drogba enjoyed a rejuvenation of sorts , returning to his goal @-@ scoring form with four goals in five games after the new manager took over . His revival in form saw him net twice against Bolton Wanderers , and four times in four Champions League matches , one in each leg of the last sixteen and quarter @-@ final of the competition against Juventus and Liverpool respectively , with these goals ensuring Chelsea 's passage into the semi @-@ finals . Just four days after his Champions League games , Drogba scored a late goal in the FA Cup semi @-@ final match against Arsenal after Frank Lampard 's pass found Drogba and he carefully rounded Arsenal goalkeeper Łukasz Fabiański before passing the ball into <unk> 's empty net .

 = = Style of play = = 
 Given his relatively late breakthrough into professional football , Drogba has often been described as a late bloomer , having signed his first professional contract with Le Mans at the age of 21 . He is noted for his physical strength , ability in the air , and his ability to retain possession of the ball . Richard Beech of the Daily Mirror says that his " powerful and intrusive approach made him the lone striker [ José ] Mourinho grew to admire , and made it nearly impossible for opposing teams to isolate him and freeze him out of the game . " 
 Drogba is renowned for performing in big games , with a goalscoring record at club level of 10 goals in 10 finals winning 10 trophies . Aside from his goalscoring ability , Drogba is also capable of providing assists to his team @-@ mates . Between the 2009 – 10 and 2011 – 12 seasons , he managed 24 assists in the Premier League , with an average pass success rate of 61 @.@ 4 percent , owing to his vision and creativity on the ball . He provided 71 assists to team @-@ mates over the course of his entire career at Chelsea until May 2012 , showing that he is also a team player . 
 In set pieces , Drogba has also been known for his free kick ability , known to strike the ball with power and pace . Dr. Ken Bray of University of Bath has described him as a specialist especially from central positions , and says that he " really just passes the ball very hard " . He adds , " He hits it [ the ball ] very straight and appears to hit the ball with a very powerful side @-@ foot action , almost like the technique used in a side @-@ foot pass . Drogba 's style is about beating the goalkeeper with speed and depth . " 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Drogba is married to <unk> Lalla , a Malian woman whom he met in Paris , and the couple have three children together . His eldest son , Isaac , was born in France in 1999 , but grew up in England and has played in the Chelsea academy system . Drogba has two younger brothers who are also footballers : Joël and Freddy Drogba . Freddy , ( born 1992 ) , is currently in the youth system of French Ligue 1 side Dijon . He is a devout Roman Catholic . 
 Drogba is credited with playing a vital role in bringing peace to his country . After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup , Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants , asking them to lay down their arms , a plea which was answered with a cease fire after five years of civil war . Drogba later helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier to the rebel stronghold of <unk> ; a move that helped confirm the peace process . On 24 January 2007 , Drogba was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) as a Goodwill Ambassador . The UNDP were impressed with his previous charity work and believed that his high profile would help raise awareness on African issues . In September 2011 , Drogba joined the Truth , Reconciliation and Dialogue Commission as a representative to help return peace to his home nation . His involvement in the peace process led to Drogba being named as one of the world 's 100 most influential people by Time magazine for 2010 . Drogba 's charity work continued when , in late 2009 , he announced he would be donating the £ 3 million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi for the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Abidjan . This work was done through Drogba 's recently created " Didier Drogba Foundation " and Chelsea announced they too would donate the fee for the deal toward the Foundation 's project . Drogba decided on building the hospital after a recent trip to the Ivorian capital 's other hospitals , saying " ... I decided the Foundation 's first project should be to build and fund a hospital giving people basic healthcare and a chance just to stay alive . " 
 In November 2014 , Drogba appeared in FIFA 's " 11 against Ebola " campaign with a selection of top football players from around the world , including Cristiano Ronaldo , Neymar , Gareth Bale and Xavi . Under the slogan " Together , we can beat Ebola " , FIFA 's campaign was done in conjunction with the Confederation of African Football and health experts , with the players holding up eleven messages to raise awareness of the disease and ways to combat it . 
 Levallois Sporting Club , the amateur club where Drogba began his career , used their percentage of his transfer fees including £ 600 @,@ 000 out of the £ 24 million paid when he joined Chelsea – first to ensure the club 's survival , and then to improve their stadium to incorporate modern sports facilities for the benefit of the local community . They renamed the new stadium Stade Didier Drogba in his honour .

 = Bhikshuka Upanishad = 
 The Bhikshuka Upanishad ( Sanskrit : भिक ् <unk> उपनिषत ् , IAST : <unk> Upaniṣad ) , also known as <unk> , is one of the minor Upanishads of Hinduism and is written in Sanskrit . 
 The Upanishad describes four kinds of sannyasins ( Hindu monks ) , their eating habits and lifestyle . Yoga is the path of spiritual liberation for all four . Of these , the Paramahamsa monks are discussed in this text at greater length , and described as loners who are patient with everyone , free from dualism in their thoughts , and who meditate on their soul and the Brahman . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Bhikshuka means " mendicant " or " monk " , and is derived from the root word <unk> meaning " one who subsists entirely on alms " . 
 = = History = = 
 The author of the Bhikshuka Upanishad is unknown , as is its date of composition . It was probably composed in the late medieval to modern era , most likely in the 14th or 15th century . The text has ancient roots , as its contents are identical in key details to chapter 4 of the Ashrama Upanishad , which is dated to about the 3rd century CE . Both texts mention four types of mendicants with nearly identical life styles . The two texts have a few minor differences . The much older Ashrama Upanishad , for example , mentions that each type aspires to know their self ( Atman ) for liberation , while the Bhikshuka specifies that they seek this liberation through a yogic path . 
 The Bhikshuka Upanishad is a minor Upanishad attached to the Shukla Yajurveda . It is classified as one of the Sannyasa ( renunciation ) Upanishads of Hinduism . The text is listed at number 60 in the serial order in the Muktika enumerated by Rama to Hanuman , in the modern era anthology of 108 Upanishads . Some surviving manuscripts of the text are titled <unk> ( भिक ् <unk> ् ) . 
 = = Contents = = 
 Bhikshuka Upanishad consists of a single chapter of five verses . The first verse states that four types of mendicants seek liberation , and these are Kutichaka , Bahudaka , Hamsa and Paramahamsa . The text describes the frugal lifestyle of all four , and asserts that they all pursue their goal of attaining moksha only through yoga practice . The first three mendicant types are mentioned briefly , while the majority of the text describes the fourth type : Paramahamsa mendicants . 
 = = = Kutichaka , Bahudaka and Hamsa monks = = = 
 The Upanishad states that Kutichaka monks eat eight mouthfuls of food a day . Prominent ancient <unk> ( sages ) who illustrate the Kutichaka group are <unk> , Bharadwaja , Yajnavalkya , and <unk> . 
 The Bahudaka mendicants carry a water pot and a triple staff walking stick . They wear a topknot hair style and ochre @-@ coloured garments , and wear a sacrificial thread . The Bahudaka do not eat meat or honey , and beg for their eight mouthfuls of food a day . 
 The Hamsa mendicants are constantly on the move , staying in villages for just one night , in towns no more than five nights , and in sacred places for no more than seven nights . The ascetic practice of Hamsa monks includes daily consumption of the urine and dung of a cow . The Hamsa monks practice the <unk> cycle in their food eating habit , wherein they vary the amount of food they eat with the lunar cycle . They eat a single mouthful of food on the day after the dark new moon night , increase their food intake by an extra mouthful each day as the size of the moon increases , and reach the maximum fifteen mouthfuls of food for the day after full moon night . Thereafter , they decrease their food intake by a mouthful each day until they reach the new moon night and begin the cycle again with one mouthful the following day . 
 = = = Paramahamsa monks = = = 
 The Bhikshuka Upanishad illustrates the Paramahamsa ( literally , " highest wandering birds " ) mendicants with a list of names . The list includes <unk> , Aruni , <unk> , <unk> , Dattatreya , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . They eat only eight mouthfuls of food a day and prefer a life away from others . They live clothed , naked or in rags . 
 The Upanishad dedicates the rest of the verses to describing the beliefs of the <unk> monks . For example , 
 The <unk> monks , who are loners , are to be found in deserted houses , in temples , straw huts , on ant hills , sitting under a tree , on sand beds near rivers , in mountain caves , near waterfalls , in hollows inside trees , or in wide open fields . The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind , they are the Paramahamsas . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The classification of mendicants in the Bhikshuka Upanishad , their moderate eating habits and their simple lifestyles , is found in many Indian texts such as the Mahabharata sections 1 @.@ 7 @.@ 86 – 87 and 13 @.@ 129 . 
 Gananath Obeyesekere , an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the Princeton University , states that the beliefs championed and attributed in Bhikshuka Upanishad are traceable to Vedic literature such as <unk> Brahmana . These views are also found in other Upanishads such as the Narada @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ Sannyasa Upanishad . In all these texts , the renouncer is accepted to be one who , in pursuit of spirituality , was " no longer part of the social world and is indifferent to its mores " . 
 A test or marker of this state of existence is where " right and wrong " , socially popular " truths or untruths " , everyday morality , and whatever is happening in the world makes no difference to the monk , where after abandoning the " truths and untruths , one abandons that by which one abandons " . The individual is entirely driven by his soul , which he sees to be the Brahman . 
 = 2 / 9th Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 2 / 9th Battalion was an infantry battalion of the Australian Army during World War II . Raised in Queensland as part of the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) shortly after the outbreak of the war , it formed part of the 18th Brigade and over the course of the war it was attached to the 6th , 9th and 7th Divisions due to several re @-@ organisations . It served in the United Kingdom in 1940 , forming part of a small Australian garrison sent there to help defend against a possible German invasion , before being transferred to North Africa where it took part in the Siege of Tobruk and then undertook garrison duties in Syria following the Syria – Lebanon campaign in 1941 . 
 In early 1942 , the 2 / 9th was brought back to Australia where it was re @-@ organised for jungle warfare and took part in the New Guinea campaign . Throughout 1942 – 44 , the battalion was committed twice to the fighting against the Japanese in New Guinea . In 1942 – 43 , the 2 / 9th fought actions at Milne Bay and Buna – Gona before being withdrawn to Australia for rest prior to returning to New Guinea to take part in the advance through the Finisterre Range where the battalion took part in the Battle of Shaggy Ridge in 1943 – 44 . The battalion 's final involvement in the war came during the Borneo campaign in mid @-@ 1945 , when it took part in the landing at Balikpapan . It was disbanded shortly after the war in early 1946 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 Formed on 13 November 1939 at Redbank Camp , Brisbane , the 2 / 9th Battalion was the first of four infantry battalions raised in Queensland for the all @-@ volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) . Initially assigned to the 6th Division , the battalion formed part of the 18th Brigade , along with the 2 / 10th , 2 / 11th and 2 / 12th Battalions . Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel James Eric Gifford Martin , formerly of the 42nd Battalion , a Militia battalion based in Rockhampton . The majority of the battalion 's officers were drawn from the Militia ; although , like many of the 2nd AIF units , it was initially supplied with a Regular officer to serve in the role as adjutant . 
 In terms of structure , the early months of the battalion 's existence was a period of flux . The early 2nd AIF infantry battalions were established with a structure that was unique to the Australian Army ; however , shortly after formation it was decided that they would adopt the British Army battalion structure . Thus , by December 1940 , the 2 / 9th had an authorised strength of around 900 personnel and consisted of four rifle companies ( each consisting of three platoons with three sections ) , a battalion headquarters , a support company , and a headquarters company consisting of six platoons performing specialist roles including signals , mortar , and anti @-@ tank . The four rifle companies were designated ' A ' through to ' D ' . The colours chosen for the battalion 's Unit Colour Patch ( UCP ) were the same as those of the 9th Battalion , a unit which had served during World War I before being raised as a Militia formation in 1921 . These colours were black over light blue , in a horizontal rectangular shape , although a border of gray was added to the UCP to distinguish the battalion from its Militia counterpart . 
 Following training at Redbank and then later in New South Wales at Rutherford and Ingleburn , the 2 / 9th was among the force of 8 @,@ 000 Australians sent to the United Kingdom in early 1940 . It had been planned to send this force to France to serve alongside the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) , but France had fallen by the time the Australians arrived in Scotland on 16 June 1940 , so they remained in the United Kingdom to help defend against a possible German cross @-@ Channel invasion , which was feared following the capture of part of the BEF in France and the loss of much of its equipment . 
 After their arrival in the United Kingdom , the battalion was transported by rail to the south of England where it set up a camp at <unk> Corner , on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire . Amidst the backdrop of the Battle of Britain , the battalion 's personnel used their integral Vickers machine @-@ guns and Bren guns to provide self defence against air attack and to bolster the anti @-@ aircraft defences of local areas . They also undertook training exercises and formed a mobile striking force tasked with rapidly responding in the event of an invasion . In September , the 18th Brigade was transferred to the 9th Division . On 14 October the battalion moved to <unk> Barracks in Colchester , Essex , where it took over responsibility for a defence sector from a British officer training battalion . The 2 / 9th remained in Colchester until 10 November when orders came for the 18th Brigade to hand over to the 25th Brigade , and the 2 / 9th was relieved by the 2 / 31st Battalion . With the threat of invasion passing as winter came , the decision was made to redeploy the Australians to North Africa where they might be actively employed in combat operations . Following this , preparations for embarkation began as orders were received for the battalion to entrain for Glasgow where , on 15 November 1940 , it boarded HMT Strathaird . 
 = = = Middle East = = = 
 Sailing via the longer , but safer southern route , on the way to the Middle East the convoy carrying the Australians made a port call at Durban , South Africa . While there , the battalion marched through the city under arms on 13 December 1940 , before re @-@ embarking . Disembarking in Alexandria , Egypt , on 31 December 1940 , the battalion went into camp at Ikingi Maryut with 33 officers and 707 men . In February 1941 , the battalion was transferred once more , as the 18th Brigade was reassigned to the 7th Division . Around the same time , the brigade was reduced to only three infantry battalions as part of an Army @-@ wide re @-@ organization , and the 2 / 11th Battalion was transferred to the 19th Brigade . With the 7th Division the battalion fought its first major engagement of the war on 21 March 1941 , when it led the 18th Brigade 's assault on the Italian fortress at Giarabub , which was held by about 1 @,@ 500 Italians . Advancing from Siwa in Egypt , the battalion , supported by elements of the 2 / 10th and 2 / 12th Battalions , attacked from the south across marshland , while cavalry from the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment feigned an attack against the strongest point of the fortress . Amidst a sandstorm that limited visibility , heavy fighting ensued and the garrison surrendered at around 2 : 00 pm ; 250 Italians were killed , while 1 @,@ 300 were taken as prisoners of war . A total of 17 Australians were killed and 77 were wounded , with the majority of these being men from the 2 / 9th Battalion . Afterwards , the battalion was sent to Ikingi Maryut and the following month the 2 / 9th was transported to Tobruk by road and sea to reinforce the garrison there as German forces surrounded the strategic port in an effort to capture it . The 2 / 9th would remain in there for the next five months as Tobruk fell under siege . 
 On 3 May , the 2 / 9th Battalion launched a counter @-@ attack on the German forces around " the Salient " in order to retake some of the posts that had previously been lost to the Germans . After being subjected to a heavy German artillery bombardment at their form up point , at 8 : 45 pm the battalion attacked from the southern flank under the cover of considerable counter @-@ battery fire from the British artillery . After capturing a number of positions and inflicting heavy losses upon the defenders , the Australians were eventually forced to withdraw at around 3 : 00 am on 4 May when it became apparent that they would not be able to complete the advance before daylight . Having lost three men killed , three missing and 51 wounded , at dawn the 2 / 9th Battalion returned to the " Blue Line " , where it took over a defensive position south of Bianca . Here a series of small skirmishes ensued during which time the battalion was able to extend their lines by about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) . 
 For the rest of May the battalion undertook defensive construction tasks and raids into " no mans land " south @-@ west of Bianca before being relieved by the 2 / 17th Battalion on the night of 4 / 5 June 1941 . Following this , the 18th Brigade went into reserve and the battalion saw little action for the next month as it was moved back to the Bardia – El Adem Road junction . In July , the battalion returned to " the Salient " , where it spent a period of time in brigade reserve in the <unk> sector . Later , it was moved back up to the " Red Line " in the El Adem sector where the battalion 's personnel undertook aggressive patrols into no mans ' land , penetrating a number of minefields and moving booby traps . On 23 July , the battalion launched a major raid in their sector in an effort to gauge German responses , penetrating over 800 metres ( 870 yd ) through the German lines , but after finding their objective unoccupied , the raiders withdrew . 
 Following this the battalion went back into reserve for a period , before briefly returning to the " Red Line " at the start of August . This was short @-@ lived , though , for later in the month the decision was made to withdraw the 18th Brigade from Tobruk and the 2 / 9th Battalion was subsequently sent to Palestine to undertake training . Later the battalion was transferred to Syria where it was employed on occupation duties following the defeat of the Vichy French forces in that country in the recently concluded Syria – Lebanon campaign . 
 = = = Pacific = = = 
 In February 1942 , along with the majority of the 2nd AIF , the 2 / 9th was withdrawn to Australia in response to the threat posed by Japan 's entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and in Malaya . Returning via Bombay and Colombo , the 2 / 9th arrived in Australia , landing in Port Adelaide , South Australia , in March 1942 and from there proceeded to camp in Sandy Creek , near Gawler . The battalion remained there until April when it was moved to Tenterfield , New South Wales , and then <unk> , Queensland , where it carried out training prior to departure overseas . At this time , the strategic situation in the Pacific was finely balanced . In July , the Japanese had landed on the northern New Guinea coast and had began advancing along the Kokoda Track towards Port Moresby , amidst heavy fighting . On 6 August 1942 , the order to deploy came and the battalion embarked from Brisbane along with the rest of the 18th Brigade , bound for Milne Bay in New Guinea where the 2 / 9th arrived on 21 August to help reinforce the garrison there , due concerns about a possible Japanese landing there to secure the adjacent airfields . 
 From the beginning of August the Japanese had been bombing the troops of the 7th Brigade which had initially been sent to garrison the Milne Bay area , and as a Japanese invasion force was expected , the three battalions of the 18th Brigade were quickly placed into positions where they could be most effective . The 2 / 9th was assigned the task of defending Milne Force Headquarters at <unk> House and the Number 1 Strip ( also known as Gurney Field ) . Upon arrival , the 2 / 9th Battalion was used to construct roads and lay steel matting on the airstrip as well as unloading stores from ships as they arrived , and carrying out patrolling operations . Following the Japanese landing on 25 August , the battalion was placed on alert and increased its patrolling operations around the airfield ; however , for five days no contact was made . On 3 September , the battalion moved from Gili Gili to KB Mission and alongside the 2 / 12th Battalion , which had launched a counteroffensive along the north coast of the bay , went into battle with the Japanese for the first time . Over the course of the next two days the Japanese were beaten back and eventually a withdrawal was ordered by the Japanese commanders . This represented the first full @-@ scale defeat of the Japanese on land during the war ; it came at a cost for the 2 / 9th , though , with the battalion losing 29 men killed and a further 86 wounded in action , seven of whom later died of wounds . Disease took a far greater toll , with a further 308 men being hospitalised due to illness . 
 As the tide in the New Guinea campaign began to turn in favour of the Allies , the Japanese , having reached the zenith of their advance in New Guinea , were forced to withdraw back towards Buna and Gona . Fierce fighting subsequently followed as Australian and US troops fought to reduce the Japanese beachhead . After taking part in defeating the Japanese at Milne Bay , the 18th Brigade was transferred to Buna . The 2 / 9th arrived at Oro Bay aboard HMAS Broome on 14 December . It was the first battalion of the brigade committed to this battle . Leading the attack of 18 December , with support of M3 Stuart tanks from the 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment , it made significant gains . The 18th Brigade ( and the 2 / 9th ) continued to fight , attached to the US 32nd Division until the fall of Buna at the start of January 1943 . It was returned to command of the Australian 7th Division in time to participate in an attack on 12 January against Japanese positions on the Sanananda Track that had been holding up the Australian advance there . The battalion continued fighting in the Sanananda area until it concluded with an Allied victory on 22 January . By this time its strength had fallen from over 600 to just under 100 men due to the effects of tropical diseases and heavy fighting ; combat losses were recorded as 95 killed in action or died of wounds , 32 missing , and 247 wounded . These losses were offset by the arrival of 300 reinforcements during the battle , but nevertheless losses were so heavy , particularly from disease , that in February the 2 / 9th Battalion was transported back to Port Moresby , before returning to Australia the next month . 
 Following the battalion 's return , it undertook further jungle training at Ravenshoe on the Atherton Tablelands . In August 1943 , after embarking at Townsville the 2 / 9th returned to Port Moresby , where it continued further training in the areas surrounding the port . It remained there until 31 December when the battalion deployed into the Finisterre Range , being flown into Dumpu and joining the Allied advance inland . In early January 1944 , the battalion took part in the Battle of Shaggy Ridge , capturing " Green Sniper 's Pimple " on 21 January as part of a brigade @-@ level operation to carry the ridge . Following the conclusion of the fighting around Shaggy Ridge in February , the battalion occupied a position around the western side of the saddle before being relieved by the 57th / 60th Battalion , as the 15th Brigade relieved the 18th and continued the advance on Bogadjim as the Australians linked up with US forces on the coast , prior to capturing Madang and securing the Huon Peninsula in late April . During this period the battalion occupied a defended locality about 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) downstream from Dumpu , from which they conducted patrols long @-@ range fighting patrols to prevent the Japanese from infiltrating back into the Ramu Valley over the months which followed . Training activities and work parties were also conducted . 
 In May 1944 , the battalion was brought back to Australia , as part of a broader plan to return the three AIF divisions to Australia for " training and rehabilitation " while the United States military assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the Pacific . A period of operational uncertainty followed regarding the future combat role of the Australian Army , and consequently a long period of training in Australia followed for the AIF battalions . After a period of leave the battalion 's personnel concentrated at Strathpine , Queensland , in July . In August , the battalion moved to the Atherton Tablelands again , establishing themselves at Kairi . After this , the battalion conducted exercises which included collective training up to brigade level , while amphibious training was also undertaken at Trinity Beach near Cairns aboard the British troopship HMS Glenearn , working in concert with Royal Marines . In December 1944 , the battalion participated in a divisional exercise . During this period the unit was also introduced to several new weapons , including flame throwers and the PIAT anti @-@ tank weapon , and undertook training in infantry / tank co @-@ operation . A range of training exercises , competitions , sporting events , and recreational activities continued early in the new year to keep the men busy and combat possible feelings of " anti @-@ climax " and " boredom " that may have been associated with the granting of limited local leave after the delay of their expected deployment overseas . 
 In the final months of the war , the battalion was committed to the Borneo campaign . Embarking from Cairns in May on several tank landing ships , the battalion concentrated on Morotai Island . On 1 July 1945 , the 2 / 9th took part in the landing at Balikpapan , the final Australian amphibious operation of the war . At the start of the attack , the battalion was assigned the role of being the 18th Brigade 's reserve ; however , by mid @-@ morning on the opening day it was ordered forward to relieve the 2 / 10th Battalion , taking Klandasan before noon , and commencing house @-@ to @-@ house clearances in concert with a troop of tanks . From there it forced a small Japanese force off <unk> Hill , before tying in its positions at 6 : 00 pm and digging @-@ in for the night . On 5 July , the 2 / 9th landed on the western side of Balikpapan Bay . Along with a small force of armour , artillery , mortars and other supporting arms , it began to clear inland from <unk> . Over the course of the following month the battalion sent detachments south along the coast towards the <unk> River and north towards the <unk> River and onto the <unk> River via <unk> . By 12 August , posts had been established astride the <unk> – <unk> Road , and a detachment from ' C ' Company had reached <unk> , where the 2 / 9th linked up with elements from the 2 / 1st Pioneer Battalion . 
 = = = Disbandment = = = 
 Finally , in mid @-@ August , the fighting on Borneo came to an end following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan . After this the 2 / 9th Battalion carried out various garrison duties such as guarding prisoners of war and maintaining internal security while the demobilisation process took place . As personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service , the battalion 's strength dropped until it was finally disbanded on 3 January 1946 while still at Balikpapan . 
 During the course of the war , a total of 4 @,@ 107 men served with the 2 / 9th Battalion of whom 319 were killed in action or died on active service , and a further 726 wounded . One of its members , John Alexander French , was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the fighting around Milne Bay in September 1942 . Other decorations that men of the 2 / 9th received were : four Distinguished Service Orders , nine Military Crosses , three Distinguished Conduct Medals , nineteen Military Medals and sixty @-@ eight mentions in despatches ; in addition , one member of the battalion was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire , one was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire , and one was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire .

 For their service during World War II , the 2 / 9th Battalion received 10 battle honours :

 = Tunguska ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Tunguska " is the eighth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premièred on the Fox network on November 24 , 1996 . It was directed by Kim Manners , and written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter . " Tunguska " featured guest appearances by John Neville , Nicholas Lea and Fritz Weaver . The episode helped explore the series ' overarching mythology . " Tunguska " earned a Nielsen household rating of 12 @.@ 2 , being watched by 18 @.@ 85 million people in its initial broadcast . 
 In the episode , FBI special agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) travels to Russia to investigate the source of a black oil contamination . His partner Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and assistant director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) are summoned to attend a United States Senate hearing on Mulder 's whereabouts . " Tunguska " is a two @-@ part episode , with the plot continuing in the next episode , " Terma " . 
 " Tunguska " was inspired by reports of evidence of extraterrestrial life possibly being found in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite , while the gulag setting was inspired by the works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn . The story offered the writers a chance to expand the scale of the series ' mythology globally , although production of the episode was described as troublesome and expensive . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The episode opens in medias res to Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) as she is brought before a Senate select committee to be questioned about the whereabouts of Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) . Scully refuses to answer the committee 's questions and attempts to read a statement denouncing the conspiracy within the government . Senator Sorenson threatens to hold Scully in contempt of Congress . 
 Ten days earlier , at Honolulu Airport , a courier returning from the Republic of Georgia ( David Bloom ) is searched by customs officers . One of the officers ( Andy Thompson ) removes a glass canister from the courier 's briefcase and accidentally shatters it , exposing both men to the black oil . Meanwhile , in New York City , Mulder and Scully take part in an FBI raid against a domestic terrorist group . Mulder 's tipster within the group is revealed to be Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) , whom the terrorists released from the missile silo where he had been trapped . Krycek has turned against The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) , and tells the distrustful agents that he can help expose him . 
 Krycek leads the agents to Dulles International Airport , where they try to apprehend a second courier carrying a diplomatic pouch from Russia . The courier leads the agents on a pursuit through the airport , but drops the pouch before escaping . The pouch is revealed to carry a seemingly unremarkable rock . Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . Dr. Sacks , a NASA scientist , tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria . 
 Skinner is approached by the Smoking Man , who demands that the pouch be returned . The courier breaks into Skinner 's apartment and searches for the pouch , only to be thrown off Skinner 's patio by Krycek . Meanwhile , Dr. Sacks cuts into the fragment , but inadvertently releases the black oil inside ; the organism penetrates the scientist 's hazmat suit and puts him in a coma @-@ like state . Mulder travels to New York to visit Marita Covarrubias ( Laurie Holden ) , who reveals that the fragment originated from the Russian province of Krasnoyarsk and provides the documents needed to travel there . Mulder reluctantly brings along Krycek , who is fluent in Russian . 
 In Charlottesville , Virginia , the Smoking Man is admonished by the Well @-@ Manicured Man ( John Neville ) when the latter learns about Mulder 's travels . Skinner and the agents are subpoenaed to appear before Senator Sorenson 's panel over the missing pouch ; when Skinner questions Scully about Mulder 's whereabouts , she is not forthcoming . Meanwhile , as Mulder and Krycek hike through the forests of Krasnoyarsk , the former theorizes that the fragment may be tied to the Tunguska event , a mysterious cosmic impact that occurred in the area in 1908 . The two men come across a slave labor camp , but are captured by the taskmasters and thrown into a gulag . 
 Skinner and Scully meet with Senator Sorenson who questions them on the death of the courier and the location of Agent Mulder . Mulder talks with a fellow prisoner who tells him that innocent people have been captured and brought here to be subjected to experiments . Immediately afterwards guards burst into the room and inject Mulder with a syringe . When Mulder awakens he is in a large room bound with chicken wire along with many other prisoners . Black material is dumped onto his face , infecting him with the black oil . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Tunguska " and its follow @-@ up " Terma " were conceived by the writers when they were trying to conceive a " big and fun canvas " to tell stories . They decided to create a story connected to the Russian gulags , which led to the " natural " idea that the Russians were experimenting separately from the Syndicate to create a vaccine for the black oil . Series writer John Shiban felt it was natural to create an arms race @-@ like story between the United States and Russia , being that the Cold War had ended a few years earlier . The writers desired to expand the series ' mythology globally , a concept that continued into the fifth season and the series ' 1998 feature film adaptation . The idea of a conspiracy with a global reach was first broached in the series ' second season , and it was felt that this two @-@ part story was a good place to expand upon this , allowing the production crew to " stretch the limits " of their resources and imagination . The inspiration for the oil @-@ containing rocks was NASA 's announcement of possible evidence of extraterrestrial life in the Allan Hills 84001 meteorite ; while the gulag scenes were based on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn 's books The Gulag Archipelago and One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich . 
 The scenes featuring the SWAT raid on a terrorist cell found to be harbouring Alex Krycek were filmed in a single night , requiring sixty individual film setups split between three camera crews working simultaneously . By dawn , only four of the sixty required shots had not been filmed , and these were later completed on a sound stage . Additional scenes shot for the episode featuring The Smoking Man and the Well @-@ Manicured Man were cut due to time constraints . A scene featuring Scully briefing Skinner on the events of the episode was also cut , as it was felt that it was " redundant " within the narrative , repeating information that had already been shown to the audience . David Duchovny 's father was present during production of the episode , leaving the actor to enjoy the shoot ; although the crew described production as expensive and " stubbornly trouble @-@ plagued " . " Tunguska " marked the fourth appearance in the series by Malcolm Stewart , who had previously appeared in " Pilot " , " 3 " and " Avatar " .

John Keegan , writing for Critical Myth , gave the episode a favorable review and rated it a 9 out of 10 . Keegan described it as " another strong mythology episode for the season " and added that it " never loses momentum " . Writing for The A.V. Club , Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B , noting that the move to a global scale detracted from the series ' overall relevance . VanDerWerff felt that " the action setpieces in this episode and the next one are really terrific " , and praised William B. Davis ' portrayal of The Smoking Man . However , he described " Tunguska " as being " one of the first really unfocused mythology episodes in the show 's run " , and found the plot of the episode to not be moving the series forward enough , noting that " for the first time , Mulder feels less like he 's driving the action and more like he 's a messenger boy " .

 = The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy = 
 The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy is a cookbook by Hannah Glasse ( 1708 – 1770 ) first published in 1747 . It was a best seller for a century after its first publication , dominating the English @-@ speaking market and making Glasse one of the most famous cookbook authors of her time . The book ran through at least 40 editions , many of them pirated . It was published in Dublin from 1748 , and in America from 1805 . 
 Glasse emphasised in her note " To the Reader " that she used plain language so that servants would be able to understand it . 
 The 1751 edition was the first book to mention trifle with jelly as an ingredient ; the 1758 edition gave the first mention of " Hamburgh sausages " and <unk> , while the 1774 edition of the book included one of the first recipes in English for an Indian @-@ style curry . Glasse expressed criticism of French influence , but included dishes with French names and French influence in the book . Other recipes use imported ingredients such as cocoa , cinnamon , nutmeg , pistachios and even musk . 
 The book was popular in the Thirteen Colonies of America , and its appeal survived the American War of Independence , copies being owned by Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson and George Washington . 
 = = Book = = 
 The Art of Cookery was the dominant reference for home cooks in much of the English @-@ speaking world in the second half of the 18th century and the early 19th century , and it is still used as a reference for food research and historical reconstruction . The book was updated significantly both during her life and after her death . 
 Early editions were not illustrated . Some posthumous editions include a decorative frontispiece , with the caption 
 The FAIR , who 's Wise and oft consults our <unk> , And thence directions gives her Prudent Cook , With <unk> <unk> , has her Table Crown 'd , And Health , with <unk> <unk> is found . 
 Some of the recipes were plagiarised , to the extent of being reproduced verbatim from earlier books by other writers . To guard against plagiarism , the title page of for example the sixth edition ( 1758 ) carries at its foot the warning " This <unk> is published with his <unk> 's Royal Licence ; and whoever prints it , or any Part of it , will be prosecuted " . In addition , the first page of the main text is signed in ink by the author . 
 The first edition of the book was published by Glasse herself , funded by subscription , and sold ( to non @-@ subscribers ) at Mrs. Ashburn 's China Shop . 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 = = = Approach = = = 
 To make a trifle . 
 <unk> the bottom of your dish or bowl with Naples biscuits broke in pieces , <unk> broke in halves , and <unk> cakes . Just wet them all through with sack , then make a good boiled custard not too thick , and when cold pour it over it , then put a <unk> over that . You may garnish it with <unk> cakes , currant jelly , and flowers . 
 The book has a brief table of contents on the title page , followed by a note " To the Reader " , and then a full list of contents , by chapter , naming every recipe . There is a full alphabetical index at the back . 
 Glasse explains in her note " To the Reader " that she has written simply , " for my Intention is to instruct the lower Sort " , giving the example of <unk> a chicken : she does not call for " large <unk> , they would not know what I meant : But when I say they must lard with little Pieces of Bacon , they know what I mean . " And she comments that " the great Cooks have such a high way of expressing themselves , that the poor Girls are at a Loss to know what they mean . " 
 As well as simplicity , to suit her readers in the kitchen , Glasse stresses her aim of economy : " some Things [ are ] so extravagant , that it would be almost a Shame to make Use of them , when a Dish can be made full as good , or better , without them . " 
 Chapters sometimes begin with a short introduction giving general advice on the topic at hand , such as cooking meat ; the recipes occupy the rest of the text . The recipes give no indication of cooking time or oven temperature . There are no separate lists of ingredients : where necessary , the recipes specify quantities directly in the instructions . Many recipes do not mention quantities at all , simply instructing the cook what to do , thus : 
 Sauce for Larks . 
 <unk> , roast them , and for Sauce have Crumbs of Bread ; done thus : Take a Sauce @-@ pan or Stew @-@ pan and some Butter ; when melted , have a good Piece of Crumb of Bread , and rub it in a clean Cloth to Crumbs , then throw it into your Pan ; keep stirring them about till they are Brown , then throw them into a <unk> to drain , and lay them round your Larks . 
 = = Foreign ingredients and recipes = = 
 Glasse set out her views of French cuisine in the book 's introduction : " I have indeed given some of my Dishes French Names to distinguish them , because they are known by those names ; And where there is great Variety of Dishes , and a large Table to cover , so there must be Variety of Names for them ; and it matters not whether they be called by a French , Dutch , or English Name , so they are good , and done with as little <unk> as the Dish will allow of . " An example of such a recipe is " To à la <unk> Pigeons " ; a <unk> is a rich French meat stew from Provence , traditionally made with beef . Her " A Goose à la Mode " is served in a sauce flavoured with red wine , home @-@ made " <unk> " , veal sweetbread , truffles , morels , and ( more ordinary ) mushrooms . She occasionally uses French ingredients ; " To make a rich Cake " includes " half a Pint of right French Brandy " , as well as the same amount of " Sack " ( Spanish sherry ) . 
 Ingredients from faraway countries were becoming available . The recipe for " Elder @-@ Shoots , in Imitation of Bamboo " makes use of a homely ingredient to substitute for a foreign one that English travellers had encountered in the Far East . The same recipe also calls for a variety of imported spices to flavour the pickle : " an Ounce of white or red Pepper , an Ounce of Ginger sliced , a little Mace , and a few Corns of Jamaica Pepper . " 
 There are two recipes for making chocolate , calling for costly imported ingredients like musk ( an aromatic obtained from musk deer ) and ambergris ( a waxy substance from sperm whales ) , vanilla and <unk> : 
 Take six pounds of Cocoa @-@ nuts , One Pound of <unk> , four <unk> of long Pepper , one of Cinnamon , a Quarter of a Pound of Almonds , one Pound of Pistachios , as much <unk> as will make it the colour of Brick ; three grains of Musk , and as much <unk> , six Pounds of Loaf @-@ sugar , one Ounce of <unk> , dry and beat them , and <unk> them through a fine <unk> ...

 The Art of Cookery was a best seller for a century after its first publication , making Glasse one of the most famous cookbook authors of her time . The book was " by far the most popular cookbook in eighteenth @-@ century Britain " . 
 It was rumoured for decades that despite the byline it was the work of a man , Samuel Johnson being quoted by James Boswell as observing at the publisher Charles Dilly 's house that " Women can spin very well ; but they cannot make a good book of cookery . " 
 The Foreign Quarterly Review of 1844 commented that " there are many good receipts in the work , and it is written in a plain style . " The review applauds Glasse 's goal of plain language , but observes " This book has one great fault ; it is disfigured by a strong anti @-@ <unk> [ anti @-@ French ] prejudice . " 
 = = = Thirteen Colonies = = = 
 The book sold extremely well in the Colonies of North America . This popularity survived the American War of Independence . A New York memoir of the 1840s declared that " We had emancipated ourselves from the sceptre of King George , but that of Hannah Glasse was extended without challenge over our fire @-@ sides and dinner @-@ tables , with a sway far more imperative and absolute " . The first American edition of The Art of Cookery ( 1805 ) included two recipes for " Indian pudding " as well as " Several New Receipts adapted to the American Mode of Cooking " , such as " Pumpkin Pie " , " Cranberry Tarts " and " Maple Sugar " . Benjamin Franklin is said to have had some of the recipes translated into French for his cook while he was the American ambassador in Paris . Both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned copies of the book . 
 Food critic John Hess and food historian Karen Hess have commented that the " quality and richness " of the dishes " should surprise those who believe that Americans of those days ate only Spartan frontier food " , giving as examples the glass of Malaga wine , seven eggs and half a pound of butter in the pumpkin pie . They argue that while the elaborate bills of fare given for each month of the year in American editions were conspicuously wasteful , they were less so than the " interminable " menus " stuffed down " in the Victorian era , as guests were not expected to eat everything , but to choose which dishes they wanted , and " the cooking was demonstrably better in the eighteenth century . " 
 The book contains a recipe " To make Hamburgh Sausages " ; it calls for beef , suet , pepper , cloves , nutmeg , " a great Quantity of Garlick cut small " , white wine vinegar , salt , a glass of red wine and a glass of rum ; once mixed , this is to be stuffed " very tight " into " the largest Gut you can find " , smoked for up to ten days , and then air @-@ dried ; it would keep for a year , and was " very good boiled in Peas Porridge , and roasted with toasted bread under it , or in an <unk> " . The cookery writer Linda Stradley in an article on hamburgers suggests that the recipe was brought to England by German immigrants ; its appearance in the first American edition may be the first time " Hamburgh " is associated with chopped meat in America . 
 = = = Modern opinions = = = 
 Rose Prince , writing in The Independent , describes Glasse as " the first domestic goddess , the queen of the dinner party and the most important cookery writer to know about . " She notes that Clarissa Dickson @-@ Wright " makes a good case " for giving Glasse this much credit , that Glasse had found a gap in the market , and had the distinctions of simplicity , an " appetising repertoire " , and a lightness of touch . Prince quotes the food writer Bee Wilson : " She 's authoritative but she is also intimate , treating you as an equal " , and concludes " A perfect book , then ; one that deserved the acclaim it received . " Jane Shilling , writing in Mail Online , agrees , noting that " Glasse writes in the same sort of chatty , intimate style that makes Delia and Nigella 's books so comforting for the nervous cook : Glasse concludes one chapter ' You must do just as you like it ' . " 
 Cookery writer Laura Kelley notes that the 1774 edition was one of the first books in English to include a recipe for curry : " To make a currey the Indian way . " The recipe calls for two small chickens to be fried in butter ; for ground turmeric , ginger and pepper to be added and the dish to be stewed ; and for cream and lemon juice to be added just before serving . Kelley comments that " The dish is very good , but not quite a modern curry . As you can see from the title of my interpreted recipe , the modern dish most like it is an eastern ( Kolkata ) butter chicken . However , the Hannah Glasse curry recipe lacks a full complement of spices and the varying amounts of tomato sauce now so often used in the dish . " . 
 Cookery writer Sophia Waugh said that Glasse 's food was what Jane Austen and her contemporaries would have eaten . Glasse is one of the five female writers discussed in Waugh 's 2013 book Cooking People : The Writers Who Taught the English How to Eat .

 = Self @-@ Portrait with Halo and Snake = 
 Self @-@ Portrait with Halo and Snake , also known as Self @-@ Portrait , is an 1889 oil on wood painting by French artist Paul Gauguin , which represents his late Brittany period in the fishing village of Le Pouldu in northwestern France . No longer comfortable with Pont @-@ Aven , Gauguin moved on to Le Pouldu with his friend and student Meijer de Haan and a small group of artists . He stayed for several months in the autumn of 1889 and the summer of 1890 , where the group spent their time decorating the interior of Marie Henry 's inn with every major type of art work . Gauguin painted his Self @-@ Portrait in the dining room with its companion piece , Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan ( 1889 ) . 
 The painting shows Gauguin against a red background with a halo above his head and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand while plants or flowers appear in the foreground . The religious symbolism and the stylistic influence of Japanese wood @-@ block prints and <unk> are apparent . The portrait was completed several years before Gauguin visited Tahiti and is one of more than 40 self @-@ portraits he completed during his lifetime . The work reached the art market in 1919 when Marie Henry sold it at the Galerie <unk> in Paris as part of her collected works from the Le Pouldu period . American banker Chester Dale acquired the painting in 1928 , gifting it upon his death in 1962 to the National Gallery of Art in Washington , D.C. 
 = = Background = = 
 Paul Gauguin ( 1848 – 1903 ) was a French Post @-@ Impressionist artist and figure in the Symbolist movement known for his contributions to the <unk> style . In 1886 , he spent the summer in Pont @-@ Aven in Brittany , an artists colony that became known as the Pont @-@ Aven School for Gauguin 's influence and the work they produced . In late 1888 , Gauguin painted for nine weeks with Vincent van Gogh at his Yellow House in Arles in the south of France before van Gogh had a breakdown , leading him to cut off his ear and be hospitalized . Gauguin left Arles and never saw van Gogh again , but they continued to exchange letters and ideas . 
 He briefly returned to Paris where he lived with painter Émile <unk> , but returned to Pont @-@ Aven in the spring of 1889 only to find it too crowded . Gauguin moved farther away " to escape the tourists and the Parisian and foreign painters " and arrived at Le Pouldu on October 2 , 1889 . He found lodgings with Meijer de Haan at <unk> de la Plage , an inn run by Marie Henry . De Haan introduced Gauguin to Thomas Carlyle 's novel Sartor Resartus ( 1836 ) by way of conversation . Although he would not read the novel for several more years , Gauguin became acquainted with Carlyle 's ideas which would influence his approach to art during this time . 
 The interior of Marie Henry 's inn became their canvas , and they painted their work on the walls , ceilings , and windows . They were later joined by artists Paul <unk> and Charles <unk> . According to Nora M. <unk> , when the room was completed , it " encompassed paintings of every major type — genre , landscape , self @-@ portraiture , portraiture , still life , and even history painting — in media ranging from tempera and oil on plaster to oil on canvas and panel ; as well as prints and drawings ; painted and glazed ceramic vessels ; exotic found objects ; and carved , <unk> figures in wood . " 
 Gauguin tried to win the affection of Marie Henry , the <unk> , but she spurned his advances and became intimate with de Haan instead , leaving Gauguin jealous . Gauguin departed on November 7 , 1890 , leaving his work at Marie Henry 's inn . She retired in 1893 and moved to <unk> , taking many of the art works with her . She continued to lease the inn until 1911 when she sold it . When the new owner was redecorating the inn in 1924 , which by then had been converted into a restaurant , the rest of the murals were discovered buried intact under wallpaper . 
 = = Development = = 
 Van Gogh had previously decorated rooms with his paintings , in particular the rooms of several restaurants in Paris and the Yellow House in Arles . Gauguin and de Haan appear to have been influenced by this work , as they began decorating the dining room of <unk> de la Plage in a similar fashion . Gauguin 's Self @-@ Portrait was prepared along with its pendant , Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan ( 1889 ) , to the right and left respectively of a fireplace on the upper panels of two wooden cupboard doors . Gauguin gave the panels a subtle , textured matte surface using white chalk ground and a combed wave pattern . Both works were completed sometime between mid @-@ November and mid @-@ December 1889 .

 French art historian Françoise Cachin notes that Gauguin designed both Self @-@ Portrait with Halo and Snake and its companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan as a caricature . In his Self @-@ <unk> , Gauguin appears against a red background with a halo above his head and apples hanging beside him as he holds a snake in his hand with what appear to be either plants or flowers in the foreground . Curator Philip <unk> observes the religious symbolism in the images , noting that the " apples and snake refer to the Garden of Eden , temptation , sin , and the Fall of Man . " Gauguin divides the canvas in half , painting himself as both saint and sinner , reflecting his own personal myth as an artist . In the top portion of the painting , Gauguin is almost angelic with the halo , looking away from the apples of temptation . In the bottom portion , he holds the snake , completing the duality . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> notes that art historian Denys Sutton was the first critic to interpret Gauguin 's self @-@ portrait as " demonic " . This interpretation is illustrated by the pendant , the companion piece Portrait of Jacob Meyer de Haan ( 1889 ) , which visually complements the Self @-@ Portrait . De Haan 's devilish eyes and red hair shaped like horns in his portrait on the left side of the dining room where it was created in situ , corresponds to the snake held in Gauguin 's hand in his self @-@ portrait on the right door of the dining room . Two books appear on the table in de Haan 's portrait : Paradise Lost ( 1667 – 74 ) by seventeenth @-@ century English poet John Milton , and Sartor Resartus by Thomas Carlyle . These respective literary allusions , to Milton 's Satan and to Carlyle 's Diogenes <unk> , a character described as both angelic and diabolical , play directly into de Haan 's and Gauguin 's corresponding self @-@ portraits . <unk> @-@ <unk> argues that Gauguin portrays himself as a magus , as " both seer and demonic angel " . 
 The work shows the influence of Japanese wood @-@ block prints and <unk> . In the painting , Gauguin wears what art historian Henri <unk> compares to the saffron colored robe of a Buddhist monk , perhaps influenced by Van Gogh 's earlier Self @-@ Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin ( 1888 ) . In a letter to Gauguin dated October 3 , 1888 , Van Gogh describes himself in the self @-@ portrait as " a character of a <unk> , a simple worshiper of the eternal Buddha " . Compared to Gauguin 's more traditional Self @-@ Portrait Dedicated to Carrière ( 1888 or 1889 ) , the self @-@ portrait painted at Le Pouldu is more " sinister " . 
 = = Provenance = = 
 In 1919 , Marie Henry sold Gauguin 's Self @-@ Portrait as part of a batch of 14 other works to François <unk> for a total of 35 @,@ 000 francs , where it was exhibited at the Galerie <unk> in Paris . Although ownership details are scant , the painting is thought to have passed through the hands of several owners , including London art collector Mrs. R. A. Workman and later Lord Ivor Spencer @-@ Churchill . It was sold by Churchill to the galleries Alex Reid and Lefèvre in 1923 , who then sold it to Kraushaar Galleries in 1925 . American banker Chester Dale acquired the work in 1928 . The painting was later bequeathed by Dale to the National Gallery of Art in 1962 after his death . The Chester Dale Collection opened at the National Gallery in 1965 . 
 = Walter Ohmsen = 
 Walter Ohmsen ( 7 June 1911 – 19 February 1988 ) was a highly decorated Oberleutnant zur See in the Kriegsmarine during World War II . On 6 June 1944 the Western Allies launched Operation Overlord , the amphibious invasion of Normandy , France . Ohmsen was the first German defender of Fortress Europe to sight the invasion force . His battery engaged in heavy fighting and subsequently Ohmsen was awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) for the defense of the Crisbecq Battery against the American 4th Infantry Division , which landed on Utah Beach . The Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross recognised extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership . 
 = = Military service = = 
 Walter Ohmsen was born on 7 June 1911 in Elmshorn and joined the military service of the Reichsmarine of the Weimar Republic on 1 April 1929 in Stralsund . He became a <unk> ( Seaman First Class ) on 1 April 1933 and <unk> ( Petty Officer Third Class <unk> ) on 1 September 1934 . From 12 December 1934 until 1 January 1944 he was platoon commander , company commander then head of telemetry training at the Naval Artillery School in Sassnitz . He had been promoted to <unk> ( Boatswain 's Mate 2nd class ) on 1 November 1935 and <unk> ( Boatswain 's Mate 1st class ) on 1 September 1936 . He served at sea on the German battleship Schleswig @-@ Holstein , the training vessel Gorch Fock , the training ship Carl @-@ Zeiss , the torpedo boat T @-@ 153 and the cruiser Königsberg . He attained the rank of <unk> ( Chief Boatswain 's Mate ) on 1 July 1940 and was awarded the War Merit Cross 2nd class with swords on 20 April 1941 . During his assignment at the Coastal Artillery School he was promoted to <unk> ( Officer Candidate ) and became an officer attaining the rank of Leutnant der <unk> ( Ensign of Coastal Artillery ) on 1 January 1942 and Oberleutnant ( M.A. ) ( Lieutenant Junior Grade ) . 
 = = = Normandy invasion = = = 
 Ohmsen had taken command of the Crisbecq Battery 49 ° 28 @.@ 8 ′ N 01 ° 17 @.@ 8 ′ W , also known as Marine <unk> Batterie " Marcouf " ( Naval Coastal Battery Marcouf ) or <unk> Batterie " Marcouf " ( Sea Target Battery Marcouf ) , on 1 February 1944 . His command , including himself , consisted of three officers , 24 non @-@ commissioned officers and 287 men of the Kriegsmarine . The unit was subordinated to the Marine @-@ Artillerie @-@ Abteilung 260 ( <unk> 260 — 260th Naval Coastal Artillery Battalion ) . The battery 's personnel was further augmented by members of the 6 . / Grenadier @-@ Regiment 919 ( 6th Company , 919th Grenadier Regiment ) of the 709 . Infanterie @-@ Division ( 709th Infantry Division ) for ground defense under the command of Leutnant Geissler , which brought the overall manpower of the battery close to 400 men . 
 On 6 June 1944 at 5 a.m. Ohmsen was the first to sight the Allied invasion fleet through the battery rangefinder . He immediately reported his observation to the Kriegsmarine headquarters at Cherbourg , which triggered the German alarm throughout installations on the Atlantic coast . The notification of the award of his Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) , announced in the German newspapers on 15 June 1944 , also referred to Ohmsen as the first person to report the invasion fleet off Normandy . At 5 : 52 a.m. he received the order to open fire on the ships , which were then 17 kilometers ( 11 mi ) away . At 5 : 55 a.m. , Ohmsen 's battery targeted and exchanged fire with the US cruisers USS Tuscaloosa and USS Quincy and the US battleship USS Nevada . At 6 : 30 a.m. , the battery fired upon the US destroyer USS Corry and sank her . 
 At 8 a.m. , Nevada hit the foremost casemated gun . The US battleships USS Texas and USS Arkansas , originally assigned to provide covering fire for the landing at Omaha Beach , intervened to help silence the Crisbecq Battery . At 9 a.m. the concentrated fire of the three battleships put the second casemate out of action , when a shell from Nevada pierced the embrasure , killing the entire crew . The remaining gun behind casemate No. 24 , withstood the naval bombardment , but was incapable of reaching targets out at sea ; the gun initiated fire at 11 a.m. , directed to the beach facing WN 5 <unk> 5 ( Resistance Nest 5 ) , 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) away . It caused heavy losses among the Americans and hindered the landing of material and reinforcements at Utah Beach . 
 The American 1st Battalion , 22nd Infantry Regiment , 4th Infantry Division started their advance towards Saint @-@ Marcouf and the Crisbecq Battery at 7 a.m. on 7 June . After the first assault they succeeded in entering Saint @-@ Marcouf but were stopped in front of the battery by the 75 mm Flak guns that had been repaired and were put in firing positions against ground targets . A German counterattack on the flanks of the American forces , supported by the 105 mm <unk> ( f ) guns from the <unk> Battery 49 ° 27 @.@ 7 ′ N 01 ° 18 @.@ 42 ′ W forced Captain Tom Shields to withdraw . Concurrent to this ground fighting , the artillery duel between the Crisbecq Battery and the Allied fleet continued . One of the Škoda 210 mm gun <unk> / 41 had been put back into service during the previous night . The gun was damaged once more and remained silent for the rest of the day . The Americans brought several field artillery guns in position during the afternoon and immediately started firing at the battery . Subsequently , the battery was subjected to harassing fire every night . 
 Ohmsen was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 2 . Klasse ) in the morning of 7 June 1944 for his defense of his strong point against the American attacks . On the evening of 7 June he received a phone call from Cherbourg with the information that he had been awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class ( Eisernes Kreuz 1 . Klasse ) in addition to the earlier award . Ohmsen was wounded on the left hand during a bombardment of the battery in the afternoon of 8 June . 
 The American 1st Battalion started their second attack on the battery at 10 a.m. on 8 June and retook the village of Saint @-@ Marcouf . At 1 : 30 p.m. after the naval artillery had prepared the attack with a 20 @-@ minute bombardment and rolling artillery fire the attack on the battery continued . The Americans succeeded in entering the battery perimeter . The Germans had fallen back in the shelters but the last 210 mm gun was destroyed . At 4 p.m. , American forces started to blow up the shelters ; seeing that his forces had been overwhelmed , Ohmsen ordered the <unk> Battery to fire on his own position with its four 105 mm guns to chase them away . The effect was immediate and the Americans fell back in disarray . Ohmsen took advantage of the situation and counterattacked with the support of Leutnant Geissler 's 6th company , and pushed the Americans back to <unk> ( roughly 1 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) south southeast of the battery ) . American casualties reached 15 % of the forces they had committed to the attack and 98 soldiers were taken prisoner . 
 By the morning of 11 June , Ohmsen had run out of ammunition and medical equipment for the wounded and all his guns were out of service . In the afternoon , he received a phone call from Konteradmiral ( Counter Admiral or Rear Admiral ) Walter <unk> , who instructed him to escape with the survivors . Leaving 21 wounded German soldiers and 126 American prisoners behind , Ohmsen and 78 men broke through the American encirclement and reached the German lines at <unk> , roughly 8 kilometers ( 5 mi ) away . On 14 June , Ohmsen and his men reached the <unk> battery , where he was decorated with the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross . Ohmsen and his men were subsequently assigned to an infantry company and took part in the final days of the Battle of Cherbourg . Ohmsen was taken prisoner of war in Cherbourg on 26 June by the American forces . He was released on 15 March 1946 . 
 On 12 June the soldiers of the 9th Infantry Division , who had come ashore the previous day , readied themselves for an attack on the battery . At 8 : 30 a.m. , the men of the 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery . The fighting over the battery took a heavy toll on both sides , 307 German soldiers died to defend it and about as many Americans died to take it .

 After World War II Ohmsen initially worked as a government employee of the Schleswig @-@ Holstein agricultural ministry . He ran for public office as a candidate of the Schleswig @-@ Holstein @-@ Block in the 1954 Landtag of Schleswig @-@ Holstein election . During an election speech , he disparaged the Minister @-@ President of Schleswig @-@ Holstein Friedrich @-@ Wilhelm Lübke . Ohmsen was immediately dismissed without notice from his position in the agricultural ministry for insulting the Minister @-@ President . He rejoined the military service of the Bundeswehr on 16 March 1956 as a Kapitänleutnant ( Captain Lieutenant ) of the Bundesmarine ( German Federal Navy ) . He was promoted to Korvettenkapitän ( Corvette Captain ) on 15 November 1957 and Fregattenkapitän ( Frigate Captain ) on 13 August 1965 and retired on 30 September 1967 . 
 From 1968 to 1978 , Ohmsen was one of the organizers of the sailing at the Summer Olympics events and of numerous other larger sailing regattas and events . From 1970 to 1978 he also served as a member of the consultative council of the city of Kiel and was involved in the support of war victims . For these services he received the Freiherr @-@ von @-@ Stein commemorative medal and Federal Cross of Merit 2nd Class ( <unk> 2 . Klasse ) . The father of three daughters , Walter Ohmsen died in Kiel on 19 February 1988 .

 Interstate 68 ( I @-@ 68 ) is a 112 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ( 181 @.@ 7 km ) Interstate Highway in the U.S. states of West Virginia and Maryland , connecting I @-@ 79 in Morgantown , West Virginia , to I @-@ 70 in Hancock , Maryland . I @-@ 68 is also Corridor E of the Appalachian Development Highway System . From 1965 until the freeway 's construction was completed in 1991 , it was designated as U.S. Route 48 ( US 48 ) . In Maryland , the highway is known as the National Freeway , an homage to the historic National Road , which I @-@ 68 parallels between Keysers Ridge and Hancock . The freeway mainly spans rural areas and crosses numerous mountain ridges along its route . A road cut at Sideling Hill exposed geological features of the mountain and has become a tourist attraction . 
 The construction of I @-@ 68 began in 1965 and continued for over 25 years , with completion on August 2 , 1991 . While the road was under construction , it was predicted that economic conditions would improve along the corridor for the five counties connected by I @-@ 68 : Allegany , Garrett , and Washington in Maryland , and Preston and Monongalia in West Virginia . The two largest cities connected by the highway are Morgantown , West Virginia , and Cumberland , Maryland . Despite the fact that the freeway serves no major metropolitan areas , I @-@ 68 provides a major transportation route in western Maryland and northern West Virginia and also provides an alternative to the Pennsylvania Turnpike for westbound traffic from Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore . 
 US 219 and US 220 both overlap I @-@ 68 in Garrett County , and Cumberland , respectively , and US 40 overlaps with the freeway from Keysers Ridge to the eastern end of the freeway at Hancock .

 = = = Predecessors = = = 
 Prior to the construction of the freeway from Morgantown to Hancock , several different routes carried traffic across the region . West Virginia Route 73 ( WV 43 ) extended from Bridgeport to Bruceton Mills , serving regions now served by I @-@ 79 ( Bridgeport to Morgantown ) and I @-@ 68 ( Morgantown to Bruceton Mills ) . After the I @-@ 68 freeway , then known as US 48 , was completed in West Virginia , the WV 73 designation was removed . Portions of the road still exist as County Route 73 ( CR 73 , CR 73 / 73 , and CR 857 . Between I @-@ 68 's exit 10 at Cheat Lake and exit 15 at Coopers Rock , I @-@ 68 was largely built directly over old WV 73 's roadbed . 
 At Bruceton Mills , WV 73 ended at WV 26 , which from there runs northeast into Pennsylvania , becoming Pennsylvania Route 281 at the state line and meeting US 40 north of the border . From there eastbound traffic would follow US 40 into Maryland . I @-@ 68 now parallels US 40 through western Maryland . 
 US 40 followed the route of the National Road through Pennsylvania and Maryland . The National Road was the first federally funded road built in the United States , authorized by Congress in 1806 . Construction lasted from 1811 to 1837 , establishing a road that extended from Cumberland to Vandalia , Illinois . Upon the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , the route of the National Road became part of US 40 . 
 = = = Cumberland Thruway = = = 
 In the early 1960s , as the Interstate Highway System was being built throughout the United States , east – west travel through western Maryland was difficult , as US 40 , the predecessor to I @-@ 68 , was a two @-@ lane country road with steep grades and hairpin turns . In Cumberland , the traffic situation was particularly problematic , as the usage of US 40 exceeded the capacity of the city 's narrow streets . Traffic following US 40 through Cumberland entered through the Cumberland Narrows and followed Henderson Avenue to Baltimore Avenue . After the construction of I @-@ 68 , this route through Cumberland became US 40 Alternate ( US 40 Alt . ) . 
 Construction began on one of the first sections of what would become I @-@ 68 , the Cumberland Thruway , on June 10 , 1965 . This portion of the highway , which consists of a mile @-@ long elevated bridge , was completed and opened to the public on December 5 , 1966 . The elevated highway connected Lee Street in west Cumberland to Maryland Avenue in east Cumberland , providing a quicker path for motorists traveling through the town on US 40 and US 220 . The Cumberland Thruway was extended to US 220 and then to <unk> Road ( Maryland Route 658 , MD 658 ) by 1970 . Problems quickly emerged with the highway , especially near an area called " Moose Curve " . At Moose Curve , the road curves sharply at the bottom of Haystack Mountain , and traffic accidents are common . 
 = = = Corridor E = = = 
 In 1965 , the Appalachian Development Act was passed , authorizing the establishment of the Appalachian Development Highway System , which was meant to provide access to areas throughout the Appalachian Mountains that were not previously served by the Interstate Highway System . A set of corridors was defined , comprising 3 @,@ 090 miles ( 4 @,@ 970 km ) of highways from New York to Mississippi . Corridor E in this system was defined to have endpoints at I @-@ 79 in Morgantown , West Virginia , and I @-@ 70 in Hancock , Maryland . At the time , there were no freeways along the corridor , though construction on the Cumberland Thruway began that year . It was this corridor that would eventually become I @-@ 68 . 
 The construction of Corridor E , which was also designated as US 48 , took over 20 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to complete . The cost of completing the freeway in West Virginia has been estimated at $ 113 million ( equivalent to $ 732 million in 2015 ) The cost of building I @-@ 68 from Cumberland to the West Virginia state line came to $ 126 million ( $ 816 million in 2015 ) ; the portion between Cumberland and Sideling Hill cost $ 182 million ( $ 417 million in 2015 ) ; and the section at Sideling Hill cost $ 44 million ( $ 101 million in 2015 ) . 
 Much of the work in building the freeway was completed during the 1970s , with US 48 opened from <unk> Road in LaVale to MD 36 in Frostburg on October 12 , 1973 , and to MD 546 on November 1 , 1974 . On November 15 , 1975 , the West Virginia portion and a 14 @-@ mile ( 23 km ) portion from the West Virginia state line to Keysers Ridge in Maryland opened , followed by the remainder of the freeway in Garrett County on August 13 , 1976 . 
 In the 1980s , the focus of construction shifted to the east of Cumberland , where a 19 @-@ mile ( 31 km ) section of the road still had not been completed . The first corridor for the construction to be approved by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) ran south of US 40 . This corridor would have bypassed towns in eastern Allegany County such as Flintstone , leaving them without access to the freeway , and would have passed directly through Green Ridge State Forest , the largest state forest in Maryland . This proposed corridor provoked strong opposition , largely due to the environmental damage that would be caused by the road construction in Green Ridge State Forest . Environmental groups sued MDSHA in order to halt the planned construction , but the court ruled in favor of the State Highway Administration . In 1984 , however , MDSHA reversed its earlier decision and chose an alignment that closely paralleled US 40 , passing through Flintstone and to the north of Green Ridge State Forest . Construction on the final section of I @-@ 68 began May 25 , 1987 , and was completed on August 2 , 1991 . 
 = = = Designation as I @-@ 68 = = = 
 Though the National Freeway was designated as US 48 , as the completion of the freeway neared , the possibility of the freeway being designated as an Interstate Highway came up . In the 1980s , the project to improve US 50 between Washington , D.C. , and Annapolis to Interstate Highway standards had been assigned the designation of I @-@ 68 . MDSHA , however , later concluded that adding additional route shields to the US 50 freeway would not be helpful to drivers , since about half the freeway already had two route designations ( US 50 and US 301 ) and drivers on the freeway were already familiar with the US 50 designation . This made the designation to be applied to that freeway more flexible , and so in 1989 , the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) , the organization composed of the various state departments of transportation that decides route numbering in the United States , approved MDSHA 's request to renumber the US 50 freeway from I @-@ 68 to I @-@ 595 . That same year , AASHTO approved changing US 48 's designation to I @-@ 68 . This change took effect upon the completion of the last section of the National Freeway , on August 2 , 1991 . 
 With the completion of I @-@ 68 and the change in its route number , the US 48 designation was removed . In 2002 , AASHTO approved the establishment of a new US 48 , this time for the Corridor H highway from Weston , West Virginia , to Strasburg , Virginia . This marks the third time that the US 48 number has been assigned to a highway , the first use being for a highway in California that existed in the 1920s . 
 = = = Incidents = = = 
 Numerous accidents and incidents have occurred on I @-@ 68 . On June 1 , 1991 , a gasoline tanker descending into downtown Cumberland from the east attempted to exit the freeway at exit <unk> , Maryland Avenue . The tanker went out of control and overturned as the driver tried to go around the sharp turn at the exit . Gasoline began to leak from the damaged tanker , forcing the evacuation of a three @-@ block area of Cumberland . Approximately 30 minutes later , the tanker exploded , setting eight houses on fire . The fire caused an estimated $ 250 @,@ 000 in damages ( equivalent to $ 570 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , and prompted MDSHA to place signs prohibiting hazardous materials trucks from exiting at the Maryland Avenue exit . 
 On May 23 , 2003 , poor visibility due to fog was a major contributing factor to an 85 @-@ vehicle pileup on I @-@ 68 on Savage Mountain west of Frostburg . Two people were killed and nearly 100 people were injured . Because of the extent of the wreckage on the road , I @-@ 68 remained blocked for 24 hours while the wreckage was cleared . In the aftermath of the pileup , the question of how to deal with fog in the future was discussed . Though the cost of a fog warning system can be considerable , MDSHA installed such a system in 2005 at a cost of $ 230 @,@ 000 ( $ 290 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . The system alerts drivers when visibility drops below 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) . 
 = = = Effect on surrounding region = = = 
 One of the arguments in favor of the construction of I @-@ 68 was that the freeway would improve the poor economic conditions in western Maryland . The economy of the surrounding area has improved since the construction of the freeway , especially in Garrett County , where the freeway opened up the county to tourism from Washington , D.C. , and Baltimore . Correspondingly , Garrett County saw a sharp increase in population and employment during and after the construction of the road , with full- and part @-@ time employment increasing from 8 @,@ 868 in 1976 to 15 @,@ 334 in 1991 . However , economic difficulties remain in Allegany and Garrett counties . There were concerns over loss of customers to businesses that have been cut off from the main highway due to the construction of the new alignment in the 1980s , leading to protests when then @-@ Governor Harry Hughes visited the Sideling Hill road cut when it was opened . 
 = = = Proposed extension = = = 
 In the 1990s , there was discussion about a future westward extension to I @-@ 68 . Such an extension would connect the western terminus of I @-@ 68 in Morgantown to WV 2 in Moundsville . A 1989 proposal had suggested a toll road be built along this corridor . In 2003 , the Federal Highway Administration approved the extension , paving the way for federal funding and for the road to become part of the National Highway System on completion . However , the project ran into problems due to lack of funds , and in 2008 , West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin suggested dropping the project altogether , making construction of a westward extension of I @-@ 68 unlikely in the near future . 
 On September 15 , 2014 , Marshall County officials brought the extension of I @-@ 68 up again as a way for oil companies to have easier access to drill into the area , likely by fracking . Much like the second leg of the Southern Beltway in the Pittsburgh area , an extension of I @-@ 68 is being spurred in response to the Marcellus natural gas trend . If the extension were to be built , it would also include a widening of WV 2 to four lanes and would cost an estimated $ 5 million per mile . It is expected that the project would be divided into two legs , first from Morgantown to Cameron , then Cameron to Moundsville . 
 In May 2015 , Maryland passed a law to increase the state 's maximum speed limit . The speed limit was changed from 65 to 70 miles per hour ( 105 to 113 km / h ) . October 1 of the same year , this law was put into effect , making I @-@ 68 's speed limit 70 mph except for the Cumberland area . Other Interstates in Maryland could also have their speed limit raised . West Virginia 's speed limit is already 70 mph .

 I @-@ 68 spans 112 @.@ 6 miles ( 181 @.@ 2 km ) — 81 @.@ 1 miles ( 130 @.@ 5 km ) in Maryland and 31 @.@ 5 miles ( 50 @.@ 7 km ) in West Virginia — connecting I @-@ 79 in Morgantown , West Virginia to I @-@ 70 in Hancock , Maryland , across the Appalachian Mountains . The control cities — the cities officially chosen to be the destinations shown on guide signs — for I @-@ 68 are Morgantown , Cumberland , and Hancock . I @-@ 68 is the main route connecting western Maryland to the rest of Maryland . I @-@ 68 is also advertised to drivers on I @-@ 70 as an " alternate route to Ohio and points west " by the MDSHA .

 I @-@ 68 begins at exit 148 on I @-@ 79 near Morgantown and runs eastward , meeting with US 119 one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of its terminus at I @-@ 79 . I @-@ 68 turns northeastward , curving around Morgantown , with four interchanges in the Morgantown area — I @-@ 79 , US 119 , WV 7 , and WV 705 . Leaving the Morgantown area , I @-@ 68 again runs eastward , interchanging with WV 43 , which provides access to Cheat Lake and Uniontown , Pennsylvania . Near this interchange , I @-@ 68 passes over Cheat Lake and climbs a steep ascent out of Cheat Canyon . 
 Entering Preston County , the route interchanges with CR 73 / 12 , which provides access to Coopers Rock State Forest . In contrast to the Morgantown area , the portion of Preston County that I @-@ 68 crosses is more rural , with the only town along the route being Bruceton Mills . In Bruceton Mills , I @-@ 68 meets WV 26 . I @-@ 68 meets CR 5 ( Hazleton Road ) at its last exit before entering Garrett County , Maryland . 
 The region of West Virginia through which the freeway passes is rural and mountainous . There are several sections that have steep grades , especially near the Cheat River Canyon , where there is a truck escape ramp in case trucks lose their brakes descending the steep grade . 
 The peak traffic density in terms of average annual daily traffic on I @-@ 68 in West Virginia is 32 @,@ 900 vehicles per day at the interchange with I @-@ 79 in Morgantown . The traffic gradually decreases further eastward , reaching a low point at 14 @,@ 600 vehicles per day at the Hazleton exit .

 After entering Garrett County , I @-@ 68 continues its run through rural areas , crossing the northern part of the county . The terrain through this area consists of ridges that extend from southwest to northeast , with I @-@ 68 crossing the ridges through its east – west run . The first exit in Maryland is at MD 42 in Friendsville . I @-@ 68 ascends Keysers Ridge , where it meets US 40 and US 219 , both of which join the highway at Keysers Ridge . The roadway that used to be the surface alignment of US 40 parallels I @-@ 68 to Cumberland , and is now designated as US 40 Alt . I @-@ 68 crosses Negro Mountain , which was the highest point along the historic National Road that the freeway parallels east of Keysers Ridge . This is the source of the name of the freeway in Maryland : the National Freeway . Three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of Grantsville , US 219 leaves the National Freeway to run northward towards Meyersdale , Pennsylvania , while I @-@ 68 continues eastward , crossing Savage Mountain before entering Allegany County . 
 The section of I @-@ 68 west of Dans Mountain in Allegany County is located in the Allegheny Mountains , characterized in Garrett County by a series of uphill and downhill stretches along the freeway , each corresponding to a ridge that the freeway crosses . In Allegany County , the freeway crosses the Allegheny Front , where , from Savage Mountain to LaVale , the highway drops in elevation by 1 @,@ 800 feet ( 550 m ) in a distance of nine miles ( 14 km ) . 
 The traffic density on I @-@ 68 in Garrett County is rather sparse compared to that of Allegany County . At the Maryland – West Virginia state line , there is an annual average daily traffic of 11 @,@ 581 vehicles per day . This density increases to its highest point in Garrett County at exit 22 , where US 219 leaves I @-@ 68 ; 19 @,@ 551 vehicles per day drive through this section . At the Allegany County line , the traffic density decreases slightly to 18 @,@ 408 . In Allegany County , the vehicle count increases to 28 @,@ 861 in LaVale , and to the freeway 's peak of 46 @,@ 191 at the first US 220 interchange ( exit 42 ) in Cumberland . East of Cumberland , the vehicle count decreases to 16 @,@ 551 at Martins Mountain and stays nearly constant to the eastern terminus of I @-@ 68 in Hancock . 
 After entering Allegany County , I @-@ 68 bypasses Frostburg to the south , with two exits , one to Midlothian Road ( unsigned MD 736 ) and one to MD 36 . Near the MD 36 exit is God 's Ark of Safety church , which is known for its attempt to build a replica of Noah 's Ark . This replica , which currently consists of a steel frame , can be seen from I @-@ 68 . 
 East of Frostburg , I @-@ 68 crosses a bridge above Spruce Hollow near Clarysville , passing over MD & <unk> ; 55 , which runs along the bottom of the valley . The freeway runs along the hillside above US 40 Alt. in the valley formed by Braddock Run . Entering LaVale , I @-@ 68 has exits to US 40 Alt. and MD 658 ( signed southbound as US 220 Truck ) . I @-@ 68 ascends Haystack Mountain , entering the city of Cumberland . This is the most congested section of the highway in Maryland . The speed limit on the highway drops from 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) in LaVale to 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) until the US 220 exit , and to 40 miles per hour ( 64 km / h ) in downtown Cumberland . This drop in the speed limit is due to several factors , including heavy congestion , closely spaced interchanges , and a sharp curve in the road , known locally as " Moose Curve " , located at the bottom of Haystack Mountain . This section of the highway was originally built in the 1960s as the Cumberland Thruway , a bypass to the original path of US 40 through Cumberland . 
 Until 2008 , signs at exit 43A in downtown Cumberland labeled the exit as providing access to WV 28 Alt . Because of this , many truckers used this exit to get to WV 28 . This created problems on { WV 28 Alt . } in Ridgeley , West Virginia , as trucks became stuck under a low railroad overpass , blocking traffic through Ridgeley . To reduce this problem , the Maryland State Highway Administration removed references to WV 28 Alt. from guide signs for exit 43A and placed warning signs in Cumberland and on I @-@ 68 approaching Cumberland advising truckers to instead use exit 43B to MD & <unk> ; 51 , which allows them to connect to WV 28 via Virginia Avenue , bypassing the low overpass in Ridgeley . 
 At exit 44 in east Cumberland , US 40 Alt. meets the freeway and ends , and at exit 46 , US 220 leaves I @-@ 68 and runs northward toward Bedford , Pennsylvania . I @-@ 68 continues across northeastern Allegany County , passing Rocky Gap State Park near exit 50 . In northeastern Allegany County , the former US 40 bypassed by I @-@ 68 is designated as MD 144 , with several exits from I @-@ 68 along the route . I @-@ 68 crosses several mountain ridges along this section of the highway , including Martins Mountain , Town Hill , and Green Ridge , and the highway passes through Green Ridge State Forest . East of Green Ridge State Forest , MD 144 ends at US 40 Scenic , another former section of US 40 . 
 I @-@ 68 crosses into Washington County at Sideling Hill Creek and ascends Sideling Hill . The road cut that was built into Sideling Hill for I @-@ 68 can be seen for several miles in each direction , and has become a tourist attraction as a result of the geologic structure exposed by the road cut . 
 On the east side of Sideling Hill , I @-@ 68 again interchanges with US 40 Scenic , at its eastern terminus at Woodmont Road . Here US 40 Scenic ends at a section of MD 144 separate from the section further west . Four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of this interchange , I @-@ 68 ends at I @-@ 70 and US 522 in the town of Hancock .

 = Richard Henry Savage = 
 Richard Henry Savage ( June 12 , 1846 – October 11 , 1903 ) was an American military officer and author who wrote more than 40 books of adventure and mystery , based loosely on his own experiences . Savage 's eloquent , witty , dashing and daring life may have been the inspiration for the pulp novel character Doc Savage . 
 In his youth in San Francisco , Savage studied engineering and law , and graduated from the United States Military Academy . After a few years of surveying work with the Army Corps of Engineers , Savage went to Rome as an envoy following which he sailed to Egypt to serve a stint with the Egyptian Army . Returning home , Savage was assigned to assess border disputes between the U.S. and Mexico , and he performed railroad survey work in Texas . In Washington D.C. , he courted and married a widowed noblewoman from Germany . 
 Savage returned to San Francisco with his wife to stay for ten years , raising a daughter and taking part in a family business . He served at the rank of colonel in the California National Guard , and took part in the social activity of the city . During a period of anti @-@ Chinese race riots , Savage stood up for law and order , and thereby gained the respect of San Francisco 's leaders , property holders and middle class residents . Savage traveled to many exotic lands but in 1890 he was struck with jungle fever in Honduras . While recuperating in New York state he wrote his first book : My Official Wife . This very successful action @-@ and @-@ adventure story was followed by more , at the rate of about three per year , written for the general public rather than for literary critics ; the latter were charmed by the first book but scathing of many later ones . Savage lived primarily in New York City , and was involved in lawsuits , especially against his New York publisher regarding unpaid royalties . 
 When the Spanish – American War broke out , Savage volunteered to lead men in battle . Instead , he was given command of an engineering unit which then built a complete base in Havana . Returning to New York , he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband . Four years after mustering out of the Army , Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded at the age of 57 by a horse and carriage on the streets of New York . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Savage was born in Utica , New York , the son of Jane Moorhead Ewart and Richard Savage ( 1817 – 1903 ) , a lawyer and manufacturer whose family had lived in the Utica area for years . The 1848 finding of gold in California , prompted Savage 's father to join the California Gold Rush in 1850 . Savage and the rest of his family left New York in 1851 to join his father . They arrived in San Francisco in February 1852 . Savage was among the first boys to attend public school in the new city , along with future poet Charles Warren Stoddard and the brothers Gus , Charles and Harry de Young who would found the San Francisco Chronicle . While the younger Savage was in school , his father helped discover the rich silver deposits of the Comstock Lode . 
 Savage finished high school at age 15 and began to study law with U.S. Senator James A. McDougall . Later , he studied with the law firm Halleck , Peachy & Billings , while partner Henry Halleck was back East serving as major general in the Union Army . At the start of the American Civil War Savage joined the Union Army , but his father secured his discharge on the grounds of his extreme youth . Savage 's father used his influence to push for California to stay on the Union side , and was rewarded by President Lincoln with the post of Collector of Internal Revenue in which capacity he served between 1861 and 1873 . Through government connections , Savage 's father gained for Savage an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1864 . Despite the danger of Confederate privateers , Savage chose to travel east by way of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company to the Isthmus of Panama , followed by the Atlantic leg to New York , but significant wartime delays prevented him from joining the summer plebes at the academy . Rather , he took his place with the September students . In 1868 , Savage graduated sixth in his class of 55 at West Point , and was assigned as brevet second lieutenant with the Army Corps of Engineers at Yerba Buena Island in San Francisco Bay . ( The " brevet " rank acknowledged that Savage was needed as a second lieutenant despite the US government limiting the number of serving army officers . ) Savage took part in survey work on the Indian reservations of Round Valley in Northern California and the Pima and Maricopa reservations in Arizona . 
 = = Government and writing career = = 
 Savage performed his Army tasks but was unhappy with the narrowly defined role . He tendered his resignation on December 31 , 1870 . Through President Grant , he went to Marseilles and Rome as an American vice @-@ consul . In 1871 , Savage traveled to Egypt to act with the rank of captain for one year as secretary to Charles Pomeroy Stone , a former American general in the Egyptian Army , serving under Khedive Isma 'il Pasha . Following an honorable discharge from the Egyptian Army , Savage returned to the U.S. and was tasked by Grant to serve as one of three commissioners investigating a series of border incidents between the U.S. and Mexico 1872 – 74 . At the same time , he worked with Richard King and the nascent Corpus Christi & Rio Grande Railroad as chief surveyor for the route to Laredo . 
 At the German Embassy in Washington , D.C. , on January 2 , 1873 , Savage married the aristocratic Anna Josephine <unk> , a German widow three years older than he who had arrived in war @-@ torn America in 1864 with her first husband , Gustav , to look after family @-@ owned land in Georgia . Gustav <unk> died in 1866 and Anna became a favorite of the Washington social circle . Her marriage to Savage produced one daughter , who later married Anatol de Carriere , a minor nobleman and an Imperial Russian Councilor of State . 
 In 1874 , Savage began a ten @-@ year stay in San Francisco . He worked with his father and brother on an iron foundry enterprise , and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard . Savage took a prominent role in the civic and social life of the city , and was often called upon to make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds , a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him . In January 1878 , Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety , a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who wanted to get rid of Chinese immigrants . Savage 's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots . Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate , now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard . He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter , who would later publish some of Savage 's stories . 
 While in San Francisco , Anna Savage began a devoted interest in the fight for women 's suffrage . Savage retired from government service in 1884 to practice law with his youngest brother . In 1890 , he moved to New York City . 
 In late 1890 at a friend 's house on Lake George in upstate New York , while recovering from a near @-@ fatal case of jungle fever contracted in Honduras , Savage wrote a tale loosely based on his life , entitled My Official Wife . The book was a great success , and was translated into many languages . The Times in London called it " a wonderful and clever tour de force , in which improbabilities and impossibilities disappear , under an air that is irresistible . " 
 Savage followed his first book with Delilah of Harlem , The Mask of Venus , Our Mysterious Passenger and Other Stories and In the Shadow of the Pyramids . In addition to his fiction prose output , Savage published collections of his speeches and essays , and in 1895 wrote a book of poetry dedicated to his wife : After Many Years . Savage 's writing style was fast and precise : he wrote from morning to night and rarely needed to correct his first drafts . He was able to carry on a conversation while writing . He joined the Author 's Guild of America in 1894 . 
 = = = Critical review = = = 
 In 1893 , Savage 's book The Masked Venus was scathingly reviewed in the Overland Monthly : 
 Colonel Richard Henry Savage 's career as a novelist has been one of unbroken and rapid decline in the grade of work . My Official Wife was a delicious story , novel in situations and treatment , and simply and well told . The Little Lady of Lagunitas also pleased many people . Prince <unk> 's Wooing was markedly inferior to either , both in plot and style , and sadly marred by blood @-@ and @-@ <unk> . The last of the series yet to hand is The Masked Venus , and it is undoubtedly the worst of all . [ ... ] The style is bombastic , the plot impossible , and the tone bad . [ ... ] The fatal Custer campaign is the climax , — if there can be said to be a climax to a story that endeavors to keep the excitement up to the climax pitch through nearly its whole length , — and there is throughout a lack of moderation , of repose , of proportion , that makes the book a dime novel and not literature . 
 Savage 's In the Shadow of the Pyramids was reviewed in The Literary World in May 1898 . The reviewer said that Savage used " a happy mixture of audacity and ignorance quite untrammeled by facts . " The " absurd " main character was criticized as unrealistically exposed to mortal danger almost daily , " just escaping dagger thrusts and pistol shots , with results more favorable to the theatrical progress of the story than to his common sense . " The previous month in the same periodical , Savage 's 25 ¢ book For Life and Love was dismissed as " a slap @-@ dash romance " . 
 = = Final decade = = 
 In 1896 , Savage sued his publisher for $ 12 @,@ 000 in unpaid royalties . The publisher , Frank Tennyson Neely , who had filed for bankruptcy five years earlier before accepting Savage as a client , argued that he did not owe Savage anything , instead , Savage owed him . Neely 's scattered and incomplete accounting books prevented an easy conclusion to the trial . Three years later , Neely once again declared bankruptcy . In 1899 , Abraham Lewis of Brooklyn sued Savage for $ 10 @,@ 000 in damages , for stealing away the affections of his wife . Savage 's own wife and a friend defended him in court , saying Lewis , an informal supplier of food to soldiers under Savage 's command , was retaliating for being stopped from the lucrative but illegal act of selling liquor to the troops at Montauk Point . 
 On January 3 , 1898 , Savage and his wife celebrated their 25th anniversary , in New York City . On February 16 , Savage volunteered for Army duty during the Spanish – American War . Savage would have served as lieutenant colonel of the 1st Tammany Regiment , but New York 's Governor Frank S. Black declined the formation . Savage was instead assigned senior major of the 2nd U.S. Volunteer Engineers at the end of May . After stateside training and the building of a complete Army camp at Montauk Point , his unit traveled in November to Havana , Cuba and cleared Marianao to build Camp Columbia for the Army of Occupation . Savage hoisted the first American flag in Havana Province on December 10 . He was in command of the battalion at the surrender of Havana on January 1 , 1899 . Weakened with yellow fever , Savage was mustered out of the Volunteer Engineers in April , 1899 , and assigned captain with the 27th Volunteer Infantry . Continuing illness prevented him from traveling with his unit to the Philippines , and he was honorably discharged . 
 In August 1903 , Savage 's wife and daughter were in Kishinev , Russia , where Savage 's son @-@ in @-@ law Anatol de Carriere was serving the Russian government . Savage 's wife sent word through Breslau to London that 27 of the Kishinev pogrom rioters had been given prison sentences . The de <unk> hid some 40 Jews in their house during the rioting . Anna Savage warned that if further bloody riots were encouraged by the Tsar 's government , " the wealthy Russian aristocracy will be in danger of their lives . "

 Savage died on October 11 , 1903 , at Roosevelt Hospital after being knocked down and injured in the ribcage on a New York City street by a horse and wagon on October 3 . Savage 's wife and daughter were still in Europe at the time of his death . 
 Anna Josephine Savage died at the age of 67 on July 7 , 1910 after a long illness in New York City , with her daughter at her side . For 30 years , she had been a noted supporter of women 's right to vote . 
 Author Marilyn <unk> has suggested that Doc Savage , the pulp hero from the 1930s and 1940s , was based in part on Savage 's life , or at least his name . Though he never met Savage , Henry Ralston , one of men who created the pulp character , joined Street and Smith publishers one year after a collection of Savage 's short stories were published .

 = Hammurabi = 
 Hammurabi ( c . 1810 BC - 1750 BC ) was the sixth king of the First Babylonian Dynasty , reigning from 1792 BC to 1750 BC ( according to the Middle Chronology ) . He was preceded by his father , Sin @-@ Muballit , who abdicated due to failing health . He extended Babylon 's control throughout Mesopotamia through military campaigns . Hammurabi is known for the Code of Hammurabi , one of the earliest surviving codes of law in recorded history . The name Hammurabi derives from the Amorite term <unk> ( " the kinsman is a healer " ) , itself from <unk> ( " paternal kinsman " ) and <unk> ( " healer " ) . 
 = = Reign and conquests = = 
 Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty king of the city @-@ state of Babylon , and inherited the power from his father , Sin @-@ Muballit , in c . 1792 BC . Babylon was one of the many largely Amorite ruled city @-@ states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land . Though many cultures co @-@ existed in Mesopotamia , Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi . The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself . Babylon was overshadowed by older , larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam , Assyria , Isin , Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding . However his father Sin @-@ Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and , by the time of his reign , had conquered the minor city @-@ states of <unk> , Kish , and <unk> . 
 Thus Hammurabi ascended to the throne as the king of a minor kingdom in the midst of a complex geopolitical situation . The powerful kingdom of Eshnunna controlled the upper Tigris River while Larsa controlled the river delta . To the east of Mesopotamia lay the powerful kingdom of Elam which regularly invaded and forced tribute upon the small states of southern Mesopotamia . In northern Mesopotamia , the Assyrian king Shamshi @-@ Adad I , who had already inherited centuries old Assyrian colonies in Asia Minor , had expanded his territory into the Levant and central Mesopotamia , although his untimely death would somewhat fragment his empire . 
 The first few decades of Hammurabi 's reign were quite peaceful . Hammurabi used his power to undertake a series of public works , including heightening the city walls for defensive purposes , and expanding the temples . In c . 1801 BC , the powerful kingdom of Elam , which straddled important trade routes across the Zagros Mountains , invaded the Mesopotamian plain . With allies among the plain states , Elam attacked and destroyed the kingdom of Eshnunna , destroying a number of cities and imposing its rule on portions of the plain for the first time . In order to consolidate its position , Elam tried to start a war between Hammurabi 's Babylonian kingdom and the kingdom of Larsa . Hammurabi and the king of Larsa made an alliance when they discovered this duplicity and were able to crush the Elamites , although Larsa did not contribute greatly to the military effort . Angered by Larsa 's failure to come to his aid , Hammurabi turned on that southern power , thus gaining control of the entirety of the lower Mesopotamian plain by c . 1763 BC . 
 As Hammurabi was assisted during the war in the south by his allies from the north such as Yamhad and Mari , the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest . Continuing his expansion , Hammurabi turned his attention northward , quelling the unrest and soon after crushing Eshnunna . Next the Babylonian armies conquered the remaining northern states , including Babylon 's former ally Mari , although it is possible that the ' conquest ' of Mari was a surrender without any actual conflict . 
 Hammurabi entered into a protracted war with <unk> @-@ Dagan I of Assyria for control of Mesopotamia , with both kings making alliances with minor states in order to gain the upper hand . Eventually Hammurabi prevailed , ousting <unk> @-@ Dagan I just before his own death . Mut @-@ <unk> the new king of Assyria was forced to pay tribute to Hammurabi , however Babylon did not rule Assyria directly . 
 In just a few years , Hammurabi had succeeded in uniting all of Mesopotamia under his rule . The Assyrian kingdom survived but was forced to pay tribute during his reign , and of the major city @-@ states in the region , only Aleppo and Qatna to the west in the Levant maintained their independence . However , one stele of Hammurabi has been found as far north as Diyarbekir , where he claims the title " King of the Amorites " . 
 Vast numbers of contract tablets , dated to the reigns of Hammurabi and his successors , have been discovered , as well as 55 of his own letters . These letters give a glimpse into the daily trials of ruling an empire , from dealing with floods and mandating changes to a flawed calendar , to taking care of Babylon 's massive herds of livestock . Hammurabi died and passed the reins of the empire on to his son Samsu @-@ iluna in c . 1750 BC , under whose rule the Babylonian empire began to quickly unravel . 
 = = Code of laws = = 
 The Code of Hammurabi was inscribed on a stele and placed in a public place so that all could see it , although it is thought that few were literate . The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital , Susa ; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris . The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws , written by scribes on 12 tablets . Unlike earlier laws , it was written in Akkadian , the daily language of Babylon , and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city . 
 The structure of the code is very specific , with each offense receiving a specified punishment . The punishments tended to be very harsh by modern standards , with many offenses resulting in death , disfigurement , or the use of the " Eye for eye , tooth for tooth " ( Lex <unk> " Law of Retaliation " ) philosophy . The code is also one of the earliest examples of the idea of presumption of innocence , and it also suggests that the accused and accuser have the opportunity to provide evidence . However , there is no provision for extenuating circumstances to alter the prescribed punishment . 
 A carving at the top of the stele portrays Hammurabi receiving the laws from the god Shamash or possibly Marduk , and the preface states that Hammurabi was chosen by the gods of his people to bring the laws to them . Parallels between this narrative and the giving of laws by God in Jewish tradition to Moses and similarities between the two legal codes suggest a common ancestor in the Semitic background of the two . Fragments of previous law codes have been found . However David P. Wright argues that the Covenant Code of the Biblical Book of Exodus is ' directly , primarily , and throughout ' based upon the Laws of Hammurabi . 
 Similar codes of law were created in several nearby civilizations , including the earlier Mesopotamian examples of Ur @-@ Nammu 's code , Laws of Eshnunna , and Code of <unk> @-@ Ishtar , and the later Hittite code of laws .

 During his reign Babylon usurped the position of " most holy city " in southern Mesopotamia from its predecessor , Nippur , for the final time ( Babylon had also previously enjoyed this status under the Akkadians , before it was restored to Nippur in the " Sumerian renaissance " ) . 
 Under the rule of Hammurabi 's successor Samsu @-@ iluna , the short @-@ lived Babylonian Empire began to collapse . In northern Mesopotamia , both the Amorites and Babylonians were driven from Assyria by <unk> @-@ Sin a native Akkadian @-@ speaking ruler , circa 1740 BC . Around the same time , native Akkadian speakers threw off Amorite Babylonian rule in the far south of Mesopotamia , creating the Sealand Dynasty , in more or less the region of ancient Sumer . Hammurabi 's ineffectual successors met with further defeats and loss of territory at the hands of Assyrian kings such as <unk> and Bel @-@ ibni , as well as to the Sealand Dynasty to the south , Elam to the east , and to the Kassites from the northeast . Thus was Babylon quickly reduced to the small and minor state it had once been upon its founding . The coup de grace for the Hammurabi 's Amorite Dynasty occurred in 1595 BC , when Babylon was sacked and conquered by the powerful Hittite Empire , thereby ending all Amorite political presence in Mesopotamia . However , the Indo @-@ European @-@ speaking Hittites did not remain , turning over Babylon to their Kassite allies , a people speaking a language isolate , from the Zagros mountains region . This Kassite Dynasty was to rule Babylon for over 400 years , adopting parts of the Babylonian culture , including Hammurabi 's code of laws . 
 Because of Hammurabi 's reputation as a lawgiver , his depiction can be found in several U.S. government buildings . Hammurabi is one of the 23 lawgivers depicted in marble bas @-@ reliefs in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives in the United States Capitol . A frieze by Adolph Weinman depicting the " great lawgivers of history " , including Hammurabi , is on the south wall of the U.S. Supreme Court building . 
 A theory current in the early part of the past century holds that Hammurabi was <unk> , the King of <unk> in the Book of Genesis 14 : 1 .

At USC , Sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty . Sanchez also became popular within the community due to his Mexican @-@ American heritage . Named the starter in 2008 , Sanchez led USC to a 12 – 1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State for which Sanchez was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense . 
 Although USC coach Pete Carroll and many scouts considered him too inexperienced , Sanchez announced his intention to enter the 2009 NFL Draft . He was selected by the Jets after they traded up with the Cleveland Browns , and was named the starting quarterback prior to the start of the season . Despite a subpar performance , Sanchez led the Jets to the AFC Championship Game , a losing effort to the Indianapolis Colts , becoming the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first playoff game and the second to win two playoff games . In his second season , Sanchez continued to develop and led the Jets to the playoffs and the team 's second consecutive AFC Championship Game where they narrowly lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers , 24 – 19 . With the win over the New England Patriots the week prior , Sanchez tied four other quarterbacks for the second most post @-@ season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history . In leading the Jets to two consecutive conference championships , Sanchez joined quarterback Ben Roethlisberger as the only two quarterbacks in NFL history to reach the conference championship in their first two seasons in the league . 
 The next two seasons would be a regression for both the team and Sanchez as they failed to reach the playoffs . Fans and media critics called for a struggling Sanchez to be benched . He eventually was replaced towards the end of the 2012 season by Greg McElroy . Sanchez suffered a season @-@ ending shoulder injury during the preseason in 2013 ; he was released after the season concluded and was subsequently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles . When Philadelphia 's starter Nick Foles went down with an injury , Sanchez started the second half of the season for the Eagles , where he set career highs in completion percentage and passer rating , while also passing for 2 @,@ 418 yards despite only starting 8 games .

 Mark was born in Long Beach , California , to Nick Sr. and Olga Sanchez . When Mark was four , his parents divorced ; Mark and his brothers , Nick Jr. and Brandon , stayed with their father but their mother remained involved in their upbringing . Mark initially lived in Whittier and Pico Rivera ; when he was six his father moved with the children to Rancho Santa Margarita , a predominantly white neighborhood of Orange County . 
 Mark 's father remarried and raised them strictly , seeking to influence them to become leaders . Throughout his childhood and teenage years , Mark 's father would have him combine athletic and mental training . Mark would have to dribble a basketball without looking at it while reciting multiplication tables ; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self @-@ confidence that would guide Mark in all areas of life and not simply sports . 
 By the time Mark entered the eighth grade , he had developed an interest in football but was unsure of what position to play . His father consulted coaches Bill <unk> , who formerly coached at Saddleback College , and Bob Johnson , the head coach at Mission Viejo High School . Both coaches stated Mark could be a quarterback if he applied himself and was open to learning the intricacies of the position . Nick Sr. trained Mark during sessions in their backyard or at the park . Mark , who was attending Santa Margarita High School , joined the football team . During his first pass attempt as a sophomore , Mark threw a 55 @-@ yard touchdown . 
 Prior to his junior year of high school , Mark transferred to Mission Viejo , where Johnson , who was recognized as a " quarterback guru " , having trained professionals like Carson Palmer , was head coach . Under Johnson 's tutelage , Mark felt he would have a better opportunity to become a better player . Johnson tutored Mark on the complexities of the position and in two seasons with the team , Mark led the Diablos to a 27 – 1 record culminating with the California Interscholastic Federation Division II championship in 2004 . 
 Mark was named football player of the year by several major college recruiting services and was considered the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of his high school football career in 2005 . In July 2004 , Mark announced his commitment to the University of Southern California .

 Being named the nation 's top quarterback coming out of high school , Sanchez was well regarded upon his arrival at USC . With upperclassmen Matt Leinart and John David Booty returning , Sanchez did not play during his freshman year in 2005 , opting to preserve a year of eligibility . During this time , he participated as the quarterback of USC 's scout team , earning the Trojans ' Service Team Offensive Player of the Year Award . 
 In April 2006 , Sanchez was arrested after a female USC student accused him of sexual assault . He was released from jail the following day and suspended . On June 3 , 2006 , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office announced no charges would be filed , and Sanchez was reinstated , though he was disciplined by the football team for underage drinking and using false identification on the night he was arrested . 
 At the outset of the 2006 season , Sanchez competed for the starting quarterback position ; once Booty , a junior , suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre @-@ existing back condition , surgery was required and Sanchez was promoted to run the first @-@ team offense during the spring as Booty recovered . Coaches stated Booty would be considered the starting quarterback when he returned for fall practice . During the 2006 season , Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas , Stanford and Oregon . Through those three games , Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and 1 interception . He also saw additional action against Arizona , Michigan , and Notre Dame but he did not attempt a pass in those contests . 
 In fall practice , before USC 's 2007 season , Sanchez broke his right thumb , missing the first game against Idaho ; he returned the following week and served as the primary backup to Booty . Sanchez earned limited playing time in wins against Nebraska and Washington State . Sanchez was named the starting quarterback by head coach Pete Carroll against Arizona after Booty suffered a broken finger during a 24 – 23 loss to Stanford . 
 On October 13 , Sanchez led USC to a 20 – 13 victory , overcoming a wavering performance during the first half of the game in which he threw two interceptions , as Arizona went on to tie the game heading into halftime . During the second half , Sanchez was more proficient in passing the ball and ultimately finished the game completing 19 of his 31 passes while throwing for 130 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions . With Booty still recovering , USC elected to start Sanchez for a second consecutive week against Notre Dame ; he made significant improvements , completing 21 of his 38 passes for 235 yards and four touchdowns in a 38 – 0 victory over Notre Dame . 
 On October 27 , Sanchez started for the final time in place of the injured Booty , an away game against Oregon . USC lost , 24 – 17 ; Sanchez had two passes intercepted by Oregon safety Matthew Harper in the second half . The first interception led to a fourth @-@ quarter touchdown that gave Oregon a 14 @-@ point lead ; the second interception ended USC 's final chance for a comeback . In spite of a myriad of mistakes committed by his teammates in addition to his own , Sanchez publicly accepted blame for the loss . The following week , against Oregon State , Booty returned as USC 's starting quarterback , with Sanchez resuming his position as Booty 's backup . Sanchez did not perform in subsequent games and finished the season with 695 yards and seven touchdowns with five interceptions . 
 Sanchez entered spring practice after the 2008 season as the front @-@ runner to take over the starting quarterback position , but faced strong competition from redshirt freshman Aaron Corp and Mitch Mustain , a transfer from Arkansas , where he had been the starting quarterback ; Mustain , like Sanchez , was named the top quarterback in the nation upon the conclusion of high school career in 2006 . By the end of spring practice , Carroll announced Sanchez would be the starting quarterback heading into the fall . During the first week of fall camp , Sanchez dislocated his left kneecap during warm @-@ ups prior to practice ; trainers immediately put the kneecap back into place . After missing nearly three weeks , Sanchez was cleared to play in the opener against Virginia . Before the opener , Sanchez was contacted by USC 's previous three quarterbacks — Carson Palmer , Leinart and Booty — who wished him well and offered general advice . 
 In the opener at Virginia , Sanchez threw for a career @-@ best 338 yards , completing 26 of his 35 passes for three touchdowns and one interception . The Davey O 'Brien Foundation named him the O 'Brien Quarterback of the Week and his performance garnered early Heisman discussion . The Trojans suffered a stunning 27 – 21 loss against Oregon State on September 25 . By season 's end , the Trojans ' lone loss was enough to remove them from contending for the BCS National Title and instead they were to play in the Rose Bowl against Penn State . The Trojans defeated the Nittany Lions 38 – 24 . Sanchez won the 2009 Rose Bowl Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense ; his 413 passing yards ranked second in the history of the Rose Bowl and fourth in Trojan history . With Sanchez starting all thirteen games , the Trojans ended the season 12 – 1 and ranked number two in the Coaches ' Poll and number three in the AP Poll . Sanchez finished the season with 3 @,@ 207 yards passing , 34 touchdowns , second most in Trojan history , behind Leinart , and 10 interceptions . 
 Upon the conclusion of the Rose Bowl , Sanchez stated it would be " hard to say goodbye to [ USC ] . I don ’ t think I can do it . " However , with the subsequent announcement that other NFL @-@ caliber quarterbacks , such as Sam Bradford , Tim Tebow , and Colt McCoy had decided to stay in school , rumors arose that Sanchez would use the opportunity to enter the 2009 NFL Draft . On January 15 , Sanchez announced his plans to forgo his final year of college eligibility and enter the 2009 NFL Draft , although he continued as a USC student and completed work on his degree in the spring of 2009 while preparing for the draft . 
 Sanchez became the first USC quarterback to leave early since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season . During the press conference , head coach Pete Carroll made it clear that he did not agree with Sanchez 's decision , and advised him of the low success @-@ rate of quarterbacks who left college early . Despite the public disagreement , the two remained close afterward .

 = = = Pre @-@ draft = = = 
 Sanchez hired his older brother and business litigator , Nick Sanchez , to be his agent alongside David Dunn , who represented Carson Palmer . Sanchez received an invitation to the 2009 Scouting Combine , where his performance was well received . He was ranked as one of the top two quarterbacks , behind fellow junior Matthew Stafford from the University of Georgia . In the final days leading up to the draft , several NFL teams expressed serious interest in Sanchez , including the Seattle Seahawks ( No. 4 selection ) , Cleveland Browns ( No. 5 selection ) , Washington Redskins ( No. 13 selection ) , and New York Jets ( No. 17 selection ) .

 The New York Jets drafted Sanchez using the fifth overall selection in the 2009 NFL Draft , making him the first quarterback selected by the Jets in the first round since Chad Pennington . To select Sanchez , the Jets traded their first and second round selections and three players , Kenyon Coleman , Abram Elam and Brett Ratliff , to the Cleveland Browns . At the time , the selection was lauded as good value for the team and for Sanchez . Sanchez reached an agreement with the team on June 10 , 2009 , signing a five @-@ year , $ 50 million contract , with $ 28 million guaranteed . It is the largest contract the Jets signed a player to in franchise history . 
 = = = = 2009 season = = = = 
 Heading into his rookie training camp , Sanchez was listed as the second quarterback behind veteran Kellen Clemens . Jets head coach Rex Ryan viewed the camp as an opportunity for both quarterbacks to compete against each other to determine the eventual starter for the 2009 season . On August 26 , 2009 , Sanchez was named the starter , becoming the first rookie quarterback to start the season for the team since Dick Jamieson in 1960 . 
 Sanchez started his first regular season NFL game against the Houston Texans on September 13 , 2009 , throwing his first touchdown pass , a 30 @-@ yard reception , to <unk> Stuckey . Sanchez and the Jets won the game 24 – 7 , with Sanchez throwing for 272 yards , a touchdown and an interception . He was named the Pepsi Rookie of the Week for his performance in the game , the first of three consecutive Rookie of the Week awards . He played his first home game a week later versus the New England Patriots , a 16 – 9 victory ; it was also his first division game and his first rivalry game . It was the Jets ' first victory over New England at home since 2000 . With a 24 – 17 victory over the Tennessee Titans in Week 3 , Sanchez became the first rookie quarterback to start and win his first three games of an NFL season . However , his performance began to regress as he had a pass intercepted for a 99 @-@ yard touchdown return , and fumbled another attempted pass in the end zone for another touchdown , as the Jets fell to the New Orleans Saints in Week 4 . These two plays were enough to spoil an otherwise strong outing from the Jets 's defensive unit as the team dropped to a 3 – 1 record . Following the loss to New Orleans , Sanchez received criticism in a 16 – 13 overtime loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 6 when he threw five interceptions against a lowly Bills defense that previously had only four interceptions all season long . The Jets ended their losing streak in a 38 – 0 victory against the Oakland Raiders in Week 7 however , Sanchez was criticized after he was seen eating a hot dog on the Jets ' bench in the fourth quarter . 
 In the team 's second meeting against the Bills on December 3 , 2009 , Sanchez suffered a sprained posterior cruciate ligament in the third quarter , prompting the veteran Clemens to take his place . Though there were no setbacks to the injury , head coach Ryan benched Sanchez the following game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for precautionary reasons , much to Sanchez 's dismay . At 7 – 7 , the Jets had a chance to secure a playoff berth if they won the remainder of their games . One such game was against the Indianapolis Colts who had 23 consecutive regular season wins . Sanchez and the Jets engineered a comeback win following Colts head coach Jim Caldwell 's decision to controversially rest the team starters in the third quarter with a five @-@ point lead . The following week , on January 3 , 2010 , Sanchez led the team into the playoffs , despite a subpar effort , completing eight of sixteen passes for sixty @-@ three yards , en route to a 37 – 0 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals , who rested their starters as the team had already clinched the AFC North division title and a playoff berth . The manner of the two wins , which gave the Jets their first playoff berth since 2006 , caused many to claim the team had " backed into the playoffs " . Sanchez completed his rookie season with 2 @,@ 444 yards , 12 touchdowns and 20 interceptions . 
 = = = = 2009 postseason = = = = 
 In the wild card round , that took place on January 9 , 2010 at Paul Brown Stadium , Sanchez led the Jets to another victory over the Bengals , 24 – 14 , behind his positive performance where he completed 12 of his 15 passes while throwing for 182 yards and a touchdown with a passer rating of 139 @.@ 4 . Sanchez became the fourth rookie quarterback in NFL history to win his first post @-@ season contest , and the second to do so on the road . The others were Shaun King ( ' 99 Bucs ) , Ben Roethlisberger ( ' 04 Steelers ) , and Joe Flacco ( ' 08 Ravens ) . On January 17 , 2010 , Sanchez , with the help of fellow rookie Shonn Greene , defeated the heavily favored San Diego Chargers 17 – 14 to attain the Jets ' third AFC Championship appearance in franchise history . Sanchez became only the second rookie quarterback to win two consecutive playoff games , behind Joe Flacco . In a rematch of their regular season meeting with the Colts , Sanchez performed well in the first half however , the offense succumbed to the Colts ' defense in the second half and the Jets gave up an 11 @-@ point lead , losing 30 – 17 . Sanchez was named to Sporting News ' All @-@ Rookie team for his performance during the season . 
 = = = = 2010 season = = = = 
 On February 17 , 2010 , Sanchez underwent surgery to repair the patella ligament in his left knee that he originally injured when he played for USC . The surgery was successful . Sanchez was expected to miss early workouts and return in time for training camp however Sanchez made a quick recovery and participated in team drills during Organized Team Activities ( OTA ) . The Jets opened the 2010 season with a 5 – 1 record however , the passing game was subpar as Sanchez struggled to accurately throw the football . Sanchez recorded his first career 300 @-@ yard passing game in a win over the Detroit Lions on November 7 , 2010 . At 10 – 4 , the Jets faced the Chicago Bears on December 26 , 2010 with a chance to clinch a playoff berth . Though Sanchez injured his shoulder in a victory over Pittsburgh the previous week , he started the game completing 24 of his 37 passes for a touchdown and an interception . However , the Jets were unable to defend the Bears ' offense and subsequently lost the game 38 – 34 after a comeback drive was halted when Sanchez was intercepted . Due to a loss by the Jacksonville Jaguars that same day , the Jets clinched the playoff berth . Sanchez finished the season with 3 @,@ 291 yards , 17 touchdowns and 13 interceptions . 
 = = = = 2010 postseason = = = = 
 The Jets finished the season with an 11 – 5 record and entered the wild card round facing the Indianapolis Colts in a rematch of their previous encounter in the AFC Championship . Although Sanchez had a subpar performance completing 18 of his 31 passes while throwing an interception , he led the team in the final minutes of the game on a comeback drive culminating with kicker Nick Folk kicking the game @-@ winning field goal as time expired . The Jets went on to face the New England Patriots in the divisional round and upset the heavily favored Patriots , 28 – 21 , as Sanchez completed 16 of his 25 passes for 194 yards and three touchdowns . With the win , Sanchez tied Len Dawson , Roger Staubach , Jake Delhomme , and Joe Flacco for the second most post @-@ season road victories by a quarterback in NFL history . The team traveled to the AFC Championship , for a second consecutive season , to face the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 23 , 2011 . 
 Heading into halftime losing 24 – 3 , the team , led by Sanchez , engineered a comeback following a heartfelt speech given by the quarterback at halftime . Although the Jets ' defense did not allow Pittsburgh to score in the second half , the team fell short as their final offensive drive was stymied by the Steelers ' defense and the Jets lost 24 – 19 . 
 = = = = 2011 season = = = = 
 Prior to the outset of the 2011 season , head coach Rex Ryan named Sanchez a team captain . The Jets opened the season with a 2 – 3 record leading to discontent within the clubhouse . The team had begun to stray from their philosophy of consistently running the ball and began to pass more often however , the offense struggled with this adjustment . Receivers Plaxico Burress , Santonio Holmes and Derrick Mason approached coach Ryan to question offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer 's system as Holmes and Mason averaged only 3 catches per game and Burress only 2 @.@ 5 catches through four games . Additionally , Sanchez drew criticism for his difficulties to effectively throw the ball to his receivers . The struggles culminated with Holmes getting into a heated argument with another teammate in the huddle during their final regular season game against the Miami Dolphins . Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while Sanchez threw three interceptions in the Jets ' loss that eliminated the team from playoff contention for the first time in Sanchez 's career . Statistically , Sanchez had similar numbers in a comparison to Eli Manning when he concluded his third year of football however , there were concerns that Sanchez was simply an ineffective quarterback and therefore expendable . During the offseason , Sanchez was criticized by anonymous teammates for his poor work ethic and his inability to improve ; these claims were publicly refuted by other teammates . Despite questions surrounding his job security , after New York acquired Tim Tebow , the Jets agreed to a 3 @-@ year contract extension with Sanchez on March 9 , 2012 . The contract included $ 20 million in guarantees . 
 = = = = 2012 season = = = = 
 The Jets opened their season against the Buffalo Bills with Sanchez completing 19 of his 27 passes for 266 yards , 3 touchdowns and an interception in a 48 – 28 rout of the Bills . In the subsequent four games , Sanchez became the first quarterback since Stoney Case in 1999 to complete under 50 % of his passes in four straight contests as the Jets fell to a 2 – 3 record . This prompted fierce criticism from the media and the fans in regards to Sanchez 's continued accuracy issues and prompted calls for the promotion of Tim Tebow . Sanchez snapped this streak against the Indianapolis Colts on October 14 , 2012 completing 11 of his 18 passes for 82 yards and throwing for 2 touchdowns in a 35 – 9 victory over Indianapolis . 
 The following week , the Jets faced their division rivals , the Patriots . Despite a second @-@ half lead by New England , the game was tied at the end of regulation forcing overtime . Following a Patriots field goal , Sanchez had the ball knocked out his hand by Rob <unk> who recovered the fumble and sealed the Patriots ' victory . This was Sanchez 's best overall performance to that point in the season as he completed a career record 68 % of his passes when attempting 40 or more passes . Sanchez 's struggles continued in the following two games against Miami and Seattle ; in Seattle , Sanchez completed 9 of 22 passes for 124 yards while throwing his fourth red zone interception of the year and was the fifth game of the season where he completed under 50 % of his pass attempts . 
 The Jets snapped their losing streak in a 27 – 13 victory over the St. Louis Rams in which Sanchez completed 15 of his 20 passes for 178 yards and a touchdown . However , his struggles continued in a rematch against New England on Thanksgiving night . Despite completing 26 of 36 of his pass attempts for 301 yards and a touchdown and interception , the Jets lost to the Patriots 49 – 19 and fell to 4 – 7 as Sanchez turned the ball over twice — each turnover led to Patriots touchdowns . The Jets surrendered 21 points within a 53 @-@ second span on 3 turnovers . The play that earned Sanchez the most criticism was a second @-@ quarter fumble where he ran into the backside of lineman Brandon Moore and the Patriots scored on the resulting fumble ; this play , becoming widely known as the butt fumble , was mocked in the media . 
 Sanchez started the next week , but was benched in the third quarter of the Jets ' contest against the Arizona Cardinals on December 2 , 2012 in favor of third string back @-@ up Greg McElroy . Prior to being benched by Rex Ryan , Sanchez threw three interceptions . McElroy threw a touchdown to Jeff Cumberland to score the team 's only points in a 7 – 6 victory over Arizona . Rex Ryan renamed Sanchez the starting quarterback the following Wednesday after seeking out multiple opinions within the organization . Sanchez returned to complete 12 his 19 passes for 111 yards against the Jacksonville Jaguars , fumbling once that led to a Jaguar field goal . The Jets won 17 – 10 . In a must @-@ win game against the Tennessee Titans to remain in playoff contention , Sanchez struggled ; he completed 13 of his 28 passes for 131 yards while throwing four interceptions and fumbling the ball in Titans territory in the closing minutes of the Jets ' 14 – 10 defeat . A day later , Ryan named McElroy the starter . Sanchez started the Jets ' final game against the Buffalo Bills after McElroy revealed he had been experiencing concussion symptoms in the days preceding . The Jets were defeated 28 – 9 with Sanchez completing 17 of his 35 passes for 205 yards and two turnovers . 
 = = = = 2013 season = = = = 
 Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury on August 24 , 2013 in the Jets ' third game of the preseason against the New York Giants after being tackled by Marvin Austin . The Jets , who drafted rookie quarterback Geno Smith in the 2013 NFL Draft , named Smith the starter on September 4 with Sanchez still rehabilitating his injury . On September 14 , 2013 , Sanchez was placed on injured reserve with a designation to return . After undergoing shoulder surgery on October 8 , 2013 , it was announced he would miss the rest of the season . After much speculation regarding his future in New York , the Jets released Sanchez on March 21 , 2014 , the same day the Jets signed Michael Vick , the former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback . 
 = = = Philadelphia Eagles = = = 
 = = = = 2014 season = = = = 
 Sanchez signed with the Philadelphia Eagles on March 29 , 2014 , for a 1 @-@ year , $ 2 @.@ 25 million contract . After spending seven full games as Nick Foles ' backup , Sanchez filled @-@ in for an injured Foles , in a Week 9 game against the Houston Texans . Throwing for 202 yards , 2 touchdowns , and 2 interceptions , Sanchez led the Eagles to a 31 @-@ 21 win . After the game , Eagles head coach , Chip Kelly , praised Sanchez , saying , " He 's a hell of a quarterback and we 're excited that we got him . " Foles was later confirmed to be out for 6 to 8 weeks with a broken collarbone , meaning Sanchez would take over as the team 's quarterback . 
 On November 10 , 2014 , Sanchez started his first game for the Eagles and led them in a 45 @-@ 21 rout of the visiting Carolina Panthers on Monday Night Football . Even though it was his first QB start since Dec. 2012 , Sanchez notched two TDs as he threw for 332 yards — the fourth highest total in his NFL career . The victory also marked the first time he had ever thrown for more than 265 yards without an interception . Sanchez followed this with a 53 @-@ 20 loss against Green Bay , but he came back with 2 consecutive wins , including a 33 @-@ 10 win against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving . With the Eagles at a 9 @-@ 3 record , and his record as a starter at 3 @-@ 1 , the Eagles looked poised to win the NFC East , but after 3 consecutive losses and playoff elimination , he finished the 2014 season with a 4 – 4 record as the Eagles starting quarterback . He threw for 2 @,@ 418 yards , 14 TDs , 11 <unk> , and a 64 @.@ 0 completion percentage , while rushing for 87 yards and 1 TD , with an 88 @.@ 4 passer rating . All of these stats has surpassed Foles . 
 = = = = 2015 season = = = = 
 The Eagles re @-@ signed Sanchez to a two @-@ year , $ 16 million contract on March 8 , 2015 , but despite his play in the 2014 season , he remained the backup quarterback as Nick Foles was traded for Sam Bradford . In Bradford 's first several games , he had thrown more interceptions than touchdowns and often had a low completion percentage , but head coach Chip Kelly refused to bench Bradford in favor of Sanchez . Ironically , Sanchez would get his first playing time when <unk> was playing his best football of the season . 
 On November 15 , 2015 , Sanchez came into a Week 10 game against the Dolphins in relief of injured starter Sam Bradford with the Eagles trailing 20 – 16 late in the 3rd quarter . Sanchez finished 14 @-@ 23 with 156 yards and an interception . The interception was costly as it occurred in the endzone when the Eagles were in field goal range down 20 – 19 , which ended up being the final score of the game . 
 Sanchez was announced as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 game against the Buccaneers after it was revealed that Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion . Sanchez 's opening drive was excellent , completing 100 % of his passes and ending it with a 39 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to make the score 7 @-@ 0 . Sanchez continued to play well for the majority of the 1st half , and threw a second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles , but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points . However , after that drive , Sanchez started to crumble , throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter . Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions , 1 of which was returned for a touchdown , in a humiliating 45 @-@ 17 blowout . His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense . 
 Sanchez once again put up the only points for the offense in another humiliating blowout , this time a 45 @-@ 14 loss to the Detroit Lions . Sanchez played relatively well , avoiding a 3 @-@ and @-@ out on the first drive with a 5 @-@ yard scramble and managing to tie the game 7 @-@ 7 with a touchdown pass to Brent <unk> , ( the team 's leading receiver over the last two games ) , but a defensive meltdown and lack of offensive momentum left the Eagles hopeless , and Sanchez finished his Eagles record with an 0 @-@ 2 record as starter . Sanchez finished 19 / 27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions , which translated into a passer rating of 116 @.@ 1 . 
 Despite his above average passer rating , Sanchez proceeded to go back to the bench the next week due to his winless record as starter , and he would not throw another pass for the rest of the season .

 Early in his career , Sanchez was praised for his ability to maintain composure in the pocket amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team 's offensive series . In his four @-@ year career , Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives . These characteristics were highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger . Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature ; in December 2010 , following dismal performances , Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez 's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez . 
 In December 2012 , following a series of poor performances that eventually led to his being benched , a panel of former NFL quarterbacks were questioned about Sanchez 's different attributes . It was unanimously agreed upon that his arm strength was " good enough " to succeed in the league and that he could be effective while mobile in the pocket . His regression was mainly attributed to his poor accuracy , a byproduct of his indecisive mentality once the ball is snapped , and the fact the Jets did little to help surround Sanchez with the talent to overcome his shortcomings . Ron Jaworski commented that Sanchez had lost his confidence which contributed to his decline . 
 While Sanchez has embraced a playboy lifestyle , drawing comparisons to former Jet Joe Namath , he was praised by Brian Schottenheimer for his ability to work with various personalities and build relationships with teammates . After undergoing knee surgery following his rookie season , Sanchez established " Jets West " in 2010 , an annual off @-@ season camp located in his home state of California . Sanchez hosts workouts and offers classroom review sessions for his skill @-@ position teammates on offense for one week . During the NFL labor dispute , Sanchez managed to organize private workouts with over forty of his teammates .

 Sanchez is an avid fan of musical theatre . He was a presenter at the 2010 Tony Awards , where he introduced a number from the Broadway musical Memphis . Sanchez has been involved in multiple charities including the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to help raise awareness for Type 1 diabetes and Sam 's Club 's Giving Made Simple which , helps raise awareness about childhood obesity and how families can prevent it . Sanchez has also worked with the Teddy Atlas Foundation through which he met Aiden Binkley , a terminally ill 11 @-@ year @-@ old struck with <unk> . Sanchez developed a bond with Binkley and the two remained close friends until Binkley 's death in December 2010 . 
 Sanchez 's father is a fire captain for the Orange County Fire Authority and a member of the national urban search and rescue team . In college , Nick Sanchez played quarterback for East Los Angeles College and was later a sergeant in the United States Army . His two older brothers both played college football . Nick Jr. attended Yale University where he played quarterback while Brandon attended DePauw University where he played on the offensive line . Nick Jr. went on to attend the USC Law School and is a business attorney ; Brandon became a mortgage broker . 
 In June 2016 , a lawsuit filed by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Sanchez 's broker , Ash Narayan , formerly of <unk> Capital Management , conducted a " <unk> @-@ like scheme " which defrauded three professional athletes out of $ 30 million . The athletes were later named as Sanchez , Roy Oswalt , and Jake Peavy .

Sanchez was placed on center stage in Los Angeles , home to more than 4 @.@ 6 million Hispanics , the majority of whom are of Mexican descent . While there had been previous , successful Mexican @-@ American quarterbacks such as Tom Flores , Jim Plunkett , Joe Kapp , Jeff Garcia , Tony Romo , and Marc Bulger , unlike most of his predecessors , Sanchez is a third @-@ generation , full Mexican and none had been embraced to the extent Sanchez was . USC fans began playing up Sanchez 's ethnicity by wearing items such as <unk> , lucha libre masks and homemade " ¡ Viva Sanchez ! " T @-@ shirts . His rise to fame within the Mexican @-@ American community was compared to that of boxer Oscar De La Hoya and baseball pitcher Fernando Valenzuela . 
 While starting for an injured John David Booty in 2007 , Sanchez wore a custom mouthguard that featured the colors of the Mexican flag in honor of his heritage . It became a prominent issue after a nationally televised game against Notre Dame . The mouthpiece became a symbol for two opposing viewpoints : for Mexican @-@ Americans , it was a symbol of unity — Sanchez accepting his heritage ; for critics , the gesture symbolized a radical political statement . Sanchez , who was born and raised in the United States , received hate mail urging him to return to Mexico . Sanchez responded to the controversy stating , " It ’ s not a Mexican power thing or anything like that . It ’ s just a little bit of pride in our heritage . Hopefully , it inspires somebody and it ’ s all for the best . " Overwhelmed by the attention and shying away from politics , Sanchez stopped wearing the mouthpiece , but began participating in other efforts to help the Hispanic community . 
 Sanchez , who knew how to speak some Spanish but was not bilingual , began to take Spanish lessons during his junior year at USC so he could have conversations with others who share his heritage and conduct interviews with the media without the use of a translator . The USC band played " El Matador " when Sanchez would come onto the field . Sanchez participated in a fundraiser to help provide school supplies to first @-@ graders in the city of Long Beach and region of South Bay , and helped Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa give holiday gifts to impoverished families . By the end of his USC career , he had been hailed as a role model for Hispanic youth . Sanchez serves as the Ambassador to the Inner @-@ City Games Los Angeles , an after @-@ school program that provides " at @-@ risk youth " with positive , alternative activities . ESPN Radio came to an agreement with the Jets to broadcast all of the team 's regular season games in 2011 on 710 ESPN Radio in Los Angeles . The agreement came about due to Sanchez 's continued popularity in California .

 = Kirov @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Kirov @-@ class ( Project 26 ) cruisers were a class of six cruisers built in the late 1930s for the Soviet Navy . After the first two ships , armor protection was increased and subsequent ships are sometimes called the Maxim Gorky class . These were the first large ships built by the Soviets from the keel up after the Russian Civil War , and they were derived from the Italian cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli , being designed with assistance from the Italian Ansaldo company . Two ships each were deployed in the Black and Baltic Seas during World War II , while the last pair was still under construction in the Russian Far East and saw no combat during the war . The first four ships bombarded Axis troops and facilities after the Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 . All six ships survived the war and lingered until the 1970s in training and other secondary roles before being scrapped . 
 = = Design = = 
 Following the October Revolution and the subsequent Russian Civil War , Soviet industry was not capable of designing large , complex warships by itself and sought foreign assistance . The Ansaldo company provided plans for the contemporary Raimondo Montecuccoli @-@ class cruisers and a design displacing 7 @,@ 200 tonnes ( 7 @,@ 086 long tons ) and armed with six 180 @-@ millimetre ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) guns in twin turrets was produced in 1933 . The Italians guaranteed that the cruiser could make 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) on trials if the size was kept under the 7200 @-@ tonne limit . The designer of the new turret managed to persuade his superiors that he could fit triple turrets to the ship while keeping it within the specified limit , and this design was approved in November 1934 as the Project 26 . 
 The Soviets bought an example of , and plans for , the machinery of the later Duca d 'Aosta @-@ class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more @-@ powerful machinery , so much so that it delayed the start of construction . Another problem was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends , while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more @-@ severe weather conditions that the Soviets commonly encountered . 
 The <unk> were built in pairs , each pair incorporating some improvements over the earlier pair . These pairs were designated as the Project 26 , Project 26bis , and Project 26bis2 in sequence . The differences between pairs usually related to size , armor , armament and aircraft . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Project 26 class ships were 191 @.@ 3 m ( 627 ft 7 in ) long overall . They had a beam of 17 @.@ 66 m ( 57 ft 11 in ) and at full load a draft of 6 @.@ 15 m ( 20 ft 2 in ) . They displaced 7 @,@ 890 tonnes ( 7 @,@ 765 long tons ) at standard load , and 9 @,@ 436 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 287 long tons ) at full load . Their single rudder meant that they were not very maneuverable . Kirov and Voroshilov were fitted with a massive quadruped foremast , but this proved to restrict the view from the conning tower as well as the fields of fire of the 100 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns and greatly increased their silhouette . It was reduced to a simple pole mast in the later ships and the superstructure enlarged to accommodate the fire control facilities formerly housed in the foremast . 
 Shortly after Kirov was launched in 1936 , the two Project 26bis ships were laid down . They incorporated a number of changes from the first batch , not least of which was that they were larger . They displaced 8 @,@ 177 tonnes ( 8 @,@ 048 long tons ) at standard load and 9 @,@ 728 tonnes ( 9 @,@ 574 long tons ; 10 @,@ 723 short tons ) at full load . They were only slightly longer at 191 @.@ 4 m ( 627 ft 11 in ) overall and had a deep draft of 6 @.@ 30 m ( 20 ft 8 in ) at full load . On trials they proved to be the fastest ships of the class with a speed of 36 @.@ 72 knots ( 68 @.@ 01 km / h ; 42 @.@ 26 mph ) . Their armament was much the same as the earlier ships , although nine 45 mm 61 @-@ K anti @-@ aircraft guns were mounted rather than the six on the first pair and they were fitted to carry 150 Model 1908 / 39 mines in place of the Model 1912 mines . 
 The Project 26bis2 pair were still larger and displaced 8 @,@ 400 tonnes ( 8 @,@ 267 long tons ) at standard load , and 10 @,@ 400 tonnes ( 10 @,@ 236 long tons ) at full load . They were a tenth of a meter shorter than the Project 26 ships , although the waterline length did not change at all between any of the pairs . Their turbines proved to be slightly more powerful than those of the Project 26bis ships and propelled them at 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) on trials . Production delays with the 100 mm B @-@ 34 dual @-@ purpose guns forced them to use 85 mm 90 @-@ K guns instead and ten 37 mm 70 @-@ K anti @-@ aircraft guns supplemented the 45 mm guns . The mines changed yet again as they could carry 100 KB or 106 Model 1926 mines . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The main armament consisted of three electrically powered MK @-@ 3 @-@ 180 triple turrets with three 57 @-@ calibre 180 mm B @-@ 1 @-@ P guns . The turrets were very small to fit them into the hull space available and were so cramped that their rate of fire was much lower than designed ( only two rounds per minute instead of six ) . The guns were mounted in a single cradle to minimize space and were so close together that their dispersion was very high because the muzzle blast from adjacent guns affected each gun . The turrets weighed approximately 236 to 247 tonnes ( 232 to 243 long tons ) , and the guns could be depressed to − 4 ° and elevated to 48 ° . The guns fired 97 @.@ 55 @-@ kilogram ( 215 @.@ 1 lb ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 900 – 920 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) ; this provided a maximum range of around 38 @,@ 000 m ( 42 @,@ 000 yd ) , depending on ammunition and gun type . Normally , 100 rounds per gun were carried , although an additional four rounds per gun could be carried at overload by the Project 26 ships only . 
 The secondary armament consisted of six single 56 @-@ caliber 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) B @-@ 34 anti @-@ aircraft guns with 325 rounds per gun fitted on each side of the rear funnel in all ships except the Project 26bis2 which used eight single 52 @-@ caliber 85 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 3 in ) 90 @-@ K guns with 300 rounds per gun when the B @-@ 34 program ran into problems . Light AA guns initially consisted of six semi @-@ automatic 45 mm 21 @-@ K AA guns with 600 rounds per gun and four DK 12 @.@ 7 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) machine guns , with 12 @,@ 500 rounds per gun , but were significantly increased in service . The Project 26bis ships carried nine 21 @-@ K mounts and the Project 26bis were built with an additional ten fully automatic 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 70 @-@ K AA guns with a thousand rounds per gun . Over the course of World War II most , if not all , of the 45 mm guns were replaced by 37 mm guns and one or two Lend @-@ Lease quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun MK III mounts were fitted to the ships in the Baltic and Black Seas , although each ship varied in its anti @-@ aircraft suite . 
 Six 533 @-@ millimetre ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) 39 @-@ Yu torpedo tubes were fitted in two triple mountings ; these tubes could be individually adjusted to spread out their salvos . Molotov and Kaganovich replaced their launchers with the more @-@ modern 1 @-@ N mount during the war . A total of 96 KB or 164 Model 1912 mines could be carried by the first pair of ships . A pair of depth charge racks were mounted as well as four BMB @-@ 1 depth charge throwers . Twenty large BB @-@ 1 and thirty small BM @-@ 1 depth charges were carried although no sonar was fitted for the Project 26 and Project 26bis ships . They did mount the <unk> underwater acoustic communication system . Kalinin and Kaganovich received the Lend @-@ Lease ASDIC @-@ 132 system , which the Soviets called Drakon @-@ 132 , as well as the experimental Soviet Mars @-@ 72 sonar system . 
 The Project 26 ships were fitted with the <unk> fire control system for their main guns which included the <unk> @-@ 2 mechanical computer and the <unk> @-@ 6 director . Each turret and the director had DM @-@ 6 rangefinders which allowed multiple targets to be engaged using a combination of local and central fire control . The four later ships had an improved <unk> @-@ <unk> fire control system which could accept data from spotter aircraft . The anti @-@ aircraft armament was controlled by the Gorizont @-@ 1 system with a SO @-@ 26 computer , <unk> vertical gyroscope and a pair of SPN @-@ 100 directors on each side of the superstructure . Each director had a fully stabilized 3 m ( 9 ft 10 in ) rangefinder . Voroshilov had SPN @-@ 200 directors , but the Project 26bis ships used the Gorizont @-@ 2 system . This had a more advanced Gorizont @-@ 2 computer and Shar vertical gyroscope . 
 The first Soviet ship to carry a radar was Molotov which was given a <unk> @-@ K air warning system in 1940 , which she used for the entire war . Lend @-@ Lease radars equipped most of the other ships . The British Types 281 , 291 and the American SG radars were used for air search . Main battery fire control radars were the British Types 284 and 285 while anti @-@ aircraft fire control was provided by the Type 282 radar . Soviet @-@ designed <unk> @-@ 1 and Mars @-@ 1 gunnery radars were fitted in Molotov and Kalinin by 1944 . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 The ships had a twin @-@ shaft @-@ unit machinery layout with alternating boiler rooms and engine rooms . The machinery for Kirov was shipped from Italy ( being diverted from the contract for the Italian cruiser Eugenio di Savoia ) . The machinery for the rest was built in Kharkiv to Italian plans . The Soviet TB @-@ 7 geared turbines proved to be more powerful and more economical than the originals . Kirov burned .8 kg ( 1 @.@ 8 lb ) of fuel oil per unit of horsepower compared to Kalinin 's .623 kg ( 1 @.@ 37 lb ) . Furthermore Kirov produced only 113 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 84 @,@ 600 kW ) on trials while Voroshilov made 122 @,@ 500 shp ( 91 @,@ 300 kW ) and was almost a full knot faster . Six license @-@ built Yarrow @-@ Normand type water @-@ tube boilers powered the turbines with a nominal capacity of 106 @-@ tonnes / hour of superheated steam at a pressure of 25 kg / cm2 ( 2 @,@ 452 kPa ; 356 psi ) and a temperature of 325 ° C ( 617 ° F ) . Each shaft drove a three @-@ bladed 4 @.@ 7 @-@ metre ( 15 ft ) bronze propeller for a designed speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) , although this varied from ship to ship . The normal oil capacity was between 600 to 650 tonnes ( 591 to 640 long tons ) , but the ships varied widely in the amount of oil carried at full load ; this ranged from 1 @,@ 150 to 1 @,@ 660 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 132 to 1 @,@ 634 long tons ) . Endurance figures also varied widely at full load , from 2 @,@ 140 to 4 @,@ 220 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 960 to 7 @,@ 820 km ; 2 @,@ 460 to 4 @,@ 860 mi ) at 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The maximum amount of fuel that could be carried ranged from 1 @,@ 430 to 1 @,@ 750 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 407 to 1 @,@ 722 long tons ) . 
 = = = Protection = = = 
 The armour scheme formed a raft around the vitals , protected by a waterline belt , deck and traverse bulkheads uniformly 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) in thickness . The turret and barbette armour was also 50 mm thick . The conning tower sides were 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) with a 100 mm roof . A 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) box protected the steering gear and a number of control positions were protected against splinters : 14 mm ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) for the torpedo control station , 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) for main @-@ battery fire control and secondary gun shields , 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) for the secondary @-@ battery control position and the auxiliary command station had 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) sides and roof . 
 The belt extended 121 m ( 397 ft 0 in ) or 64 @.@ 5 % of the ship 's length . Its total height was 3 @.@ 4 m ( 11 ft 2 in ) , of which 1 @.@ 33 m ( 4 ft 4 in ) was below the designed waterline . A double bottom extended past the armored traverse bulkheads and a thin longitudinal bulkhead provided some measure of protection against flooding . It has been judged too thin to withstand a torpedo 's detonation , but possibly the far @-@ side bulkhead might survive intact , which would cause a list from asymmetrical flooding . 
 The armor of the Project 26 ships was vulnerable even to destroyer @-@ class weapons at ranges under 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) and the last four ships were given additional armor . The belt , traverse bulkheads , barbettes and turret face thicknesses were all increased to 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) and the box protecting the steering gear was increased to 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) . One oddity of the later ships ' armor scheme was the joint between the armour deck and belt . The top and bottom edges of the belt were tapered , the outer surface angling in 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) from the edge to a thickness of 45 mm . Similarly the deck edge was also tapered down to about 25 mm for its outermost 200 mm . It has been speculated that " This seam in the protection , representing a small target area , may simply have served to save weight and simplify construction . " 
 = = = Aircraft = = = 
 The <unk> were designed to carry two aircraft , but German catapults had to be imported . Two Heinkel K @-@ 12 catapults were bought in 1937 for Kirov and Voroshilov . They could traverse 360 ° and launch an aircraft weighing 2 @,@ 750 kg ( 6 @,@ 060 lb ) at a speed of 125 km / h ( 78 mph ) , although no suitable aircraft were in service until the KOR @-@ 1 seaplane entered service in September 1939 . They proved to be unsuitable for rough @-@ weather landings and were disembarked when Operation Barbarossa began . Gorky and Molotov mounted Soviet @-@ built ZK @-@ 1 catapults of roughly comparable performance , but were destined never to use them for lack of suitable aircraft . 
 The Project 26 ships landed their catapult during 1941 to make room for more AA guns , as did Molotov in 1942 . A ZK @-@ 1a catapult was installed aboard Molotov in 1943 , and she conducted successful experiments with a catapult @-@ launched Supermarine Spitfire fighter . The Project 26bis2 ships did not receive a catapult until after the end of the war , when a ZK @-@ 2b was fitted . The catapults , however , were removed from all ships by 1947 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 While Voroshilov was laid down first , Kirov was the prototype for the class and was completed first . Her trials were a disappointment as her Italian @-@ built turbines initially had minor defects , and she was 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) slower than guaranteed . The Italians pointed out that the guarantee only applied if she displaced 7200 tonnes or less , and she was overweight by over 500 tonnes ( 490 long tons ; 550 short tons ) . Her turrets had numerous teething problems and inflicted more blast damage than anticipated , which showed that her welding plan had not been followed . Her firing arcs were reduced in an attempt to mitigate the problem . Voroshilov 's Soviet @-@ built turbines were more powerful than anticipated , and she almost achieved her design speed . 
 Components for the Project 26bis2 ships were manufactured in the West ( Ordzhonikidze built those for Kalinin and Marti those for Kaganovich ) and shipped to Komsomolsk @-@ on @-@ Amur for assembly . They were launched from drydocks and towed incomplete to Vladivostok for fitting @-@ out .

 Kirov was commissioned into the Baltic Fleet in the autumn of 1938 , but was still being worked on into early 1939 . She sailed to Riga on 22 October 1940 when the Soviet Union began to occupy Latvia ; the following day she sailed for Liepāja . During the Winter War , Kirov , escorted by the destroyers <unk> and <unk> <unk> , attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns at Russarö , 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) south of Hanko . She only fired 35 rounds before she was damaged by a number of near misses and had to return to the Soviet naval base at Liepāja for repairs . She remained there for the rest of the Winter War and afterwards was under repair at Kronstadt from October 1940 to 21 May 1941 . 
 Both Kirov and Maxim Gorky were transferred to the Gulf of Riga on 14 June 1941 , shortly before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa . Both cruisers were active in the last days of June covering Soviet defensive mining operations , but Gorky and her escorts ran into the German @-@ laid " <unk> " minefield on the 23rd and Maxim Gorky and the destroyer Gnevny both lost their bows . Gnevny sank , while Gorky made it to port before being transferred , with assistance , to Tallinn and later to Kronstadt . Kirov followed her to Tallinn at the end of the month , after being lightened to pass through the shallows of Moon Sound . 
 Gorky had a new bow section fabricated in Kronstadt and it was mated with the ship on 21 July . Kirov provided gunfire support during the defense of Tallinn and served as the flagship of the evacuation fleet from Tallinn to Leningrad at the end of August 1941 . For most of the rest of the war both cruisers were blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad and support for the Soviet Vyborg – Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid — 1944 . Both ships were damaged by German air and artillery attacks , but were repaired during the war . 
 = = = = Black Sea Fleet = = = = 
 On 23 June 1941 , Voroshilov covered Soviet destroyers bombarding Constanţa , but the destroyer leader Moskva was sunk by a mine and Kharkov was damaged by return fire . She bombarded Axis positions near Odessa in mid @-@ September , but was transferred to Novorossiysk shortly afterwards . On 2 November , she was hit twice in harbor by Junkers Ju 88 bombers of KG 51 ; one hit started a fire in # 3 magazine that was extinguished by water flooding in from the second hit . She had to be towed to Poti for repairs , which lasted until February 1942 . She shelled Axis positions near Feodosiya on 2 April 1942 , but was damaged by some near misses on 10 April and had to return to Batumi for repairs . In May she supported Soviet troops around Kerch and the Taman Peninsula while helping to transfer the 9th Naval Infantry Brigade from Batumi to Sevastopol . On 29 November 1942 , she was damaged by nearby mine explosions while bombarding <unk> , but managed to return to Poti under her own power . Just after her repairs were completed she assisted Soviet forces landing behind German lines at the so @-@ called " Malaya Zemlya " at the end of January 1943 . The loss of three destroyers to German aircraft attempting to interdict the German evacuation of the Taman Bridgehead on 6 October 1943 caused Stalin to forbid the deployment of large naval units without his express permission and this meant the end of Voroshilov 's active participation in the war . 
 Molotov was commissioned just before the German invasion and spent most of 1941 moving from port to port to take advantage of her air warning radar , the first fitted in the Soviet Navy . She bombarded Axis positions near Feodosiya in early November and was sent to reinforce Sevastopol with elements of the 386th Rifle Division from Poti . Damaged by a number of shell hits while off @-@ loading troops on 29 December , she was still able to take 600 wounded when she departed . She reprised her role as a transport during the first week of January . Her bow was damaged during a heavy storm in Tuapse when it was thrown against the jetty on 21 – 22 January 1942 . She spent most of the next month under repair , although her bow could not be straightened which reduced her speed by several knots . After making a number of bombardment sorties in support of Soviet troops on the Kerch Peninsula , she returned to Poti for more permanent repairs on 20 March . In June she made a number of transport runs in support of the garrison of Sevastopol . On 2 August her stern was blown off by torpedo bombers acting in concert with Italian MAS torpedo boats . The damage reduced her speed to 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) and she had to be steered by her engines . She was under repair at Poti until 31 July 1943 , using the stern of the incomplete Chapayev @-@ class cruiser Frunze , the rudder of the incomplete cruiser <unk> , the steering gear from Kaganovich and the steering sensor from the submarine L @-@ 25 . She saw no action after completing her repairs due to Stalin 's order .

 Even though Lazar Kaganovich and Kalinin were both commissioned before the end of the war , they saw no action during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in 1945 ; in any event , Lazar Kaganovich was not fully completed until 29 January 1947 .

 Kirov was damaged by a German magnetic mine while leaving Kronstadt on 17 October 1945 . She was under repair until 20 December 1946 . Refitted from November 1949 to April 1953 , her machinery was completely overhauled , with her radars , fire control systems and anti @-@ aircraft guns being replaced by the latest Soviet systems . She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961 , regularly visited Poland and East Germany , and was sold for scrap on 22 February 1974 . Two of her gun turrets were installed at Saint Petersburg as a monument . Maxim Gorky tested the first Soviet naval helicopter , the Kamov Ka @-@ 10 , in December 1950 and began her refit in mid @-@ 1953 . This was planned much like Kirov 's refit , although her displacement was to increase 1 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 984 long tons ) from torpedo bulges , with consequent penalties to her speed and range . The Navy reevaluated the scope of the work in 1955 , deemed it insufficient to create a fully modern ship , and suspended the refit . Gorky was sold for scrap on 18 April 1959 after it was decided that she was not required as a missile test ship . 
 Voroshilov began her postwar modernization in April 1954 , but encountered the same issues as Maxim Gorky . Unlike her half @-@ sister , she was selected for conversion as a testbed for missile development as Project 33 on 17 February 1956 . The conversion process was quite prolonged , as her armament was removed and she received an entirely new superstructure and masts ; and she was not recommissioned as OS @-@ 24 until 31 December 1961 . She was modernized under Project <unk> from 11 October 1963 to 1 December 1965 . Converted to a floating barracks on 6 October 1972 , she was briefly redesignated as PKZ @-@ 19 before being sold for scrap on 2 March 1973 . Voroshilov 's 14 @-@ ton propeller and 2 @.@ 5 @-@ ton stop anchor are on display at the Museum of Heroic Defense and Liberation of Sevastopol on Sapun Mountain in Sevastopol . 
 Molotov suffered a fire in the # 2 turret handling room on 5 October 1946 which required the magazine to be flooded ; 22 sailors were killed and 20 wounded . She was used as a testbed for the new radars intended for the Chapayev and Sverdlov @-@ class cruisers in the late 1940s . <unk> like her half @-@ sister Kirov between 1952 and 29 October 1955 , she was renamed Slava on 3 August 1957 after Vyacheslav Molotov fell out of favor with Nikita Khrushchev . She was reclassified as a training cruiser on 3 August 1961 and deployed to the Mediterranean during 5 – 30 June 1967 to show Soviet support for Syria during the Six @-@ Day War . She returned to the Mediterranean between September and December 1970 where she assisted the Kotlin @-@ class destroyer <unk> after the latter 's collision with the aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal on 9 November 1970 . She was sold for scrap on 4 April 1972 . 
 Kalinin was placed in reserve on 1 May 1956 , and was restored to the Navy List on 1 December 1957 before being disarmed and converted into a floating barracks on 6 February 1960 . She was sold for scrap on 12 April 1963 . Kaganovich was renamed Lazar Kaganovich on 3 August 1945 to distinguish her from Lazar 's disgraced brother Mikhail Kaganovich . She was renamed Petropavlovsk on 3 August 1957 after Lazar Kaganovich was purged from the government after an unsuccessful coup against Nikita Khrushchev that same year . Her superstructure was badly damaged by a Force 12 typhoon on 19 September 1957 and she was deemed uneconomical to repair and sold for scrap on 6 February 1960 . 
 = Rumours ( album ) = 
 Rumours is the eleventh studio album by the British @-@ American rock band Fleetwood Mac . Largely recorded in California during 1976 , it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records . The record reached the top of both the United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart . The songs " Go Your Own Way " , " Dreams " , " Don 't Stop " , and " You Make Loving Fun " were released as singles . Rumours is Fleetwood Mac 's most successful release ; along with winning the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978 , the record has sold over 45 million copies worldwide , making it one of the best @-@ selling albums of all time . Rumours has received diamond certifications in several countries , including the US , Canada , and Australia . 
 The band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac , but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started . The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife among Fleetwood Mac members ; these experiences shaped the album 's lyrics . Influenced by pop music , the record 's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments . The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours , but was finished by the end of 1976 . Following the album 's release in 1977 , Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours . 
 Rumours garnered widespread critical acclaim . Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies , which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists . The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres . Often considered Fleetwood Mac 's best release , it has featured in several publications ' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time . In 2004 , Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions . A three @-@ CD reissue of the album was released by Warner Bros. on 29 January 2013 . The set included outtakes of songs and concert tracks the band played while on tour in 1977 .

 In July 1975 , Fleetwood Mac 's eponymous tenth album was released to great commercial success , reaching No. 1 in the U.S. in 1976 . The record 's biggest hit single , " Rhiannon " , gave the band extensive radio exposure . At the time , Fleetwood Mac 's line @-@ up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham , drummer Mick Fleetwood , keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie , bassist John McVie , and vocalist Stevie Nicks . After six months of non @-@ stop touring , the <unk> divorced , ending six years of marriage . The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters . Buckingham and Nicks — who had joined the band before 1975 's Fleetwood Mac , after guitarist Bob Welch had left — were having an on / off relationship that led them to fight often . The duo 's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together . Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny , mother of his two children , had an affair with his best friend . 
 Press intrusions into the band members ' lives led to inaccurate stories . Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness , while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood 's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her . The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green , Danny Kirwan , and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour . Despite false reports , the band did not change its line @-@ up , although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began . Fleetwood has noted the " tremendous emotional sacrifices " made by everyone just to attend studio work . In early 1976 , Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida . Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer , Keith Olsen , because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section . The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band 's interests .

 In February 1976 , Fleetwood Mac convened at the Record Plant in Sausalito , California , with hired engineers Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut . Production duties were shared by the three parties , while the more technically adept Caillat was responsible for most of the engineering ; he took a leave of absence from Wally Heider Studios in Los Angeles on the premise that Fleetwood Mac would eventually use their facilities . The set @-@ up in Sausalito included a number of small recording rooms in a large , windowless wooden building . Most band members complained about the studio and wanted to record at their homes , but Fleetwood did not allow any moves . Christine McVie and Nicks decided to live in two condominiums near the city 's harbour , while the male contingent stayed at the studio 's lodge in the adjacent hills . Recording occurred in a six @-@ by @-@ nine @-@ metre room which included a 3M 24 @-@ track tape machine , a range of high @-@ quality microphones , and an API mixing console with <unk> equalisers ; the latter were used to control frequency differences or a track 's timbre . Although Caillat was impressed with the set @-@ up , he felt that the room lacked ambience because of its " very dead speakers " and large amounts of soundproofing . 
 The record 's working title in Sausalito was Yesterday 's Gone . Buckingham took charge of the studio sessions to make " a pop album " . According to Dashut , while Fleetwood and the <unk> came from an improvisational blues @-@ rock background , the guitarist understood " the craft of record making " . During the formative stages of compositions , Buckingham and Christine McVie played guitar and piano together to create the album 's basic structures . The latter was the only classically trained musician in Fleetwood Mac , but both shared a similar sense of musicality . When the band jammed , Fleetwood often played his drum kit outside the studio 's partition screen to better gauge Caillat 's and Dashut 's reactions to the music 's groove . <unk> were placed around the drums and around John McVie , who played his bass guitar facing Fleetwood . Buckingham performed close to the rhythm section , while Christine McVie 's keyboards were kept away from the drum kit . Caillat and Dashut spent about nine days working with a range of microphones and amplifiers to get a larger sound , before discovering they could adjust the sound effectively on the API mixing console . 
 As the studio sessions progressed , the band members ' new intimate relationships that formed after various separations started to have a negative effect on Fleetwood Mac . The musicians did not meet or socialise after their daily work at the Record Plant . At the time , the hippie movement still affected Sausalito 's culture and drugs were readily available . Open @-@ ended budgets enabled the band and the engineers to become self @-@ indulgent ; sleepless nights and the extensive use of cocaine marked much of the album 's production . Chris Stone , one of the Record Plant 's owners , indicated in 1997 that Fleetwood Mac brought " excess at its most excessive " by taking over the studio for long and extremely expensive sessions ; he stated , " The band would come in at 7 at night , have a big feast , party till 1 or 2 in the morning , and then when they were so whacked @-@ out they couldn 't do anything , they 'd start recording " . 
 Nicks has suggested that Fleetwood Mac created the best music when in the worst shape , while , according to Buckingham , the tensions between band members informed the recording process and led to " the whole being more than the sum of the parts " . The couple 's work became " bittersweet " after their final split , although Buckingham still had a skill for taking Nicks ' tracks and " making them beautiful " . The vocal harmonies between the duo and Christine McVie worked well and were captured using the best microphones available . Nicks ' lyrical focus allowed the instrumentals in the songs that she wrote to be looser and more abstract . According to Dashut , all the recordings captured " emotion and feeling without a middle man ... or tempering " . John McVie tended to clash with Buckingham about the make @-@ up of songs , but both admit to achieving good outcomes . Christine McVie 's " Songbird " , which Caillat felt needed a concert hall 's ambience , was recorded during an all @-@ night session at <unk> Auditorium , across San Francisco Bay in Berkeley . 
 Following over two months in Sausalito , Fleetwood arranged a ten @-@ day tour to give the band a break and fan feedback . After the concerts , recording resumed at venues in Los Angeles , including Wally Heider Studios . Christine McVie and Nicks did not attend most of the sessions and took time off until they were needed to record any remaining vocals . The rest of Fleetwood Mac , with Caillat and Dashut , struggled to finalise the overdubbing and mixing of Rumours after the Sausalito tapes were damaged by repeated use during recording ; the kick and snare drum audio tracks sounded " lifeless " . A sell @-@ out autumn tour of the US was cancelled to allow the completion of the album , whose scheduled release date of September 1976 was pushed back . A specialist was hired to rectify the Sausalito tapes using a vari @-@ speed oscillator . Through a pair of headphones which played the damaged tapes in his left ear and the safety master recordings in his right , he converged their respective speeds aided by the timings provided by the snare and hi @-@ hat audio tracks . Fleetwood Mac and their co @-@ producers wanted a " no @-@ filler " final product , in which every track seemed a potential single . After the final mastering stage and hearing the songs back @-@ to @-@ back , the band members sensed they had recorded something " pretty powerful " . 
 = = Promotion and release = = 
 In autumn 1976 , while still recording , Fleetwood Mac showcased tracks from Rumours at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles . John McVie suggested the album title to the band because he felt the members were writing " journals and diaries " about each other through music . Warner Bros. confirmed the release details to the press in December and chose " Go Your Own Way " as a December 1976 promotional single . The label 's aggressive marketing of 1975 's Fleetwood Mac , in which links with dozens of FM and AM radio stations were formed across America , aided the promotion of Rumours . At the time , the album 's advance order of 800 @,@ 000 copies was the largest in Warner Bros. ' history . 
 Rumours was released on 4 February 1977 in the US and a week later in the UK . The front cover features a stylised shot of Fleetwood and Nicks dressed in her " Rhiannon " stage persona , while the back has a montage of band portraits ; all the photographs were taken by Herbert Worthington . On 28 February 1977 , after rehearsing at SIR Studios in Los Angeles , Fleetwood Mac started a seven @-@ month @-@ long promotional tour of America . Nicks has noted that , after performing mostly Rumours songs during gigs , the band initially encountered poor receptions from fans who were not accustomed to the new material . A one @-@ off March performance at a benefit concert for United States Senator Birch Bayh in Indiana was followed by a short European tour of the UK , the Netherlands , France , and Germany in April . Nigel Williams of Uncut called Fleetwood Mac 's performances " rock 's greatest soap opera " . " Dreams " , released in June 1977 , became the band 's only number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 .

 = = = Lyrics = = = 
 Fleetwood Mac 's main writers — Buckingham , Christine McVie and Nicks — worked individually on specific songs , but sometimes shared lyrics with each other . " The Chain " is the only track that all members , including Fleetwood and John McVie , collaborated on . All songs on Rumours concern personal , often troubled , relationships . According to Christine McVie , the fact that the lyricists were extensively focusing on the various separations became apparent to the band only with hindsight . " You Make Loving Fun " is about her boyfriend , Fleetwood Mac 's lighting director , after she split from John . Nicks ' " Dreams " details a breakup and has a hopeful message , while Buckingham 's similar effort in " Go Your Own Way " is more pessimistic . After a short fling with a New England woman , he was inspired to write " Never Going Back Again " , a song about the illusion of thinking that sadness will never occur again once feeling content with life . The lines " Been down one time / Been down two times " are in reference to the lyricist 's efforts when persuading the woman to give him a chance . 
 " Don 't Stop " , written by Christine McVie , is a song about optimism . She noted that Buckingham helped her craft the verses because their personal sensibilities overlapped . McVie 's next track , " Songbird " , features more introspective lyrics about " nobody and everybody " in the form of " a little prayer " . " Oh Daddy " , the last McVie song on the album , was written about Fleetwood and his wife Jenny Boyd , who had just gotten back together . The band 's nickname for Fleetwood was " The Big Daddy " . McVie commented that the writing is slightly sarcastic and focuses on the drummer 's direction for Fleetwood Mac , which always turned out to be right . Nicks provided the final lines " And I can 't walk away from you , baby / If I tried " . Her own song , " Gold Dust Woman " , is inspired by Los Angeles and the hardship encountered in such a metropolis . After struggling with the rock lifestyle , Nicks became addicted to cocaine and the lyrics address her belief in " keeping going " .

 Featuring a soft rock and pop rock sound , Rumours is built around a mix of acoustic and electric instrumentation . Buckingham 's guitar work and Christine McVie 's use of Fender Rhodes piano or Hammond B @-@ 3 organ are present in all tracks . The record often includes stressed drum sounds and distinctive percussion such as congas and maracas . It opens with " Second Hand News " , originally an acoustic demo titled " Strummer " . After hearing Bee Gees ' " Jive Talkin ' " , Buckingham and co @-@ producer Dashut built up the song with four audio tracks of electric guitar and the use of chair percussion to evoke celtic rock . " Dreams " includes " ethereal spaces " and a recurring two note pattern on the bass guitar . Nicks wrote the song in an afternoon and led the vocals , while the band played around her . The third track on Rumours , " Never Going Back Again " , began as " Brushes " , a simple acoustic guitar tune played by Buckingham , with snare rolls by Fleetwood using brushes ; the band added vocals and further instrumental audio tracks to make it more layered . Inspired by triple step dancing patterns , " Don 't Stop " includes both conventional acoustic and tack piano . In the latter instrument , nails are placed on the points where the hammers hit the strings , producing a more percussive sound . " Go Your Own Way " is more guitar @-@ oriented and has a four @-@ to @-@ the @-@ floor dance beat influenced by The Rolling Stones ' " Street Fighting Man " . The album 's pace slows down with " Songbird " , conceived solely by Christine McVie using a nine @-@ foot Steinway piano . 
 Side two of Rumours begins with " The Chain " , one of the record 's most complicated compositions . A Christine McVie demo , " Keep Me There " , and a Nicks song were re @-@ cut in the studio and were heavily edited to form parts of the track . The whole of the band crafted the rest using an approach akin to creating a film score ; John McVie provided a prominent solo using a fretless bass guitar , which marked a speeding up in tempo and the start of the song 's final third . Inspired by R & B , " You Make Loving Fun " has a simpler composition and features a clavinet , a special type of keyboard instrument , while the rhythm section plays interlocking notes and beats . The ninth track on Rumours , " I Don 't Want to Know " , makes use of a twelve string guitar and harmonising vocals . Influenced by the music of Buddy Holly , Buckingham and Nicks created it in 1974 before they were in Fleetwood Mac . " Oh Daddy " was crafted spontaneously and includes improvised bass guitar patterns from John McVie and keyboard blips from Christine McVie . The album ends with " Gold Dust Woman " , a song inspired by free jazz , which has music from a harpsichord , a Fender Stratocaster guitar , and a dobro , an acoustic guitar whose sound is produced by one or more metal cones .

 Rumours was a huge commercial success and became Fleetwood Mac 's second US number one record , following the 1975 eponymous release . It stayed at the top of the Billboard 200 for 31 non @-@ consecutive weeks , while also reaching number one in the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , and New Zealand . In May 2011 it re @-@ entered Billboard 200 chart at number 11 , and the Australian ARIA chart at number 2 , due to several songs from the album being used for the " Rumours " episode of the American TV series Glee . The album was certified platinum in America and the UK within months of release after one million units and 300 @,@ 000 units were shipped respectively . All three major US trade publications — Billboard , Cash Box , and Record World — named it Album of the Year for 1977 . After a debut at number seven , Rumours peaked at the top of the UK Albums Chart in January 1978 , becoming Fleetwood Mac 's first number one album in the country . In February , the band and co @-@ producers Caillat and Dashut won the 1978 Grammy Award for Album of the Year . By March , the album had sold over 10 million copies worldwide , including over eight million in the US alone . 
 By 1980 , 13 million copies of Rumours had been sold worldwide , a figure which increased to nearly 20 million by 1987 . By the time of Fleetwood Mac 's reunion tour in 1997 , it had sold 25 million copies worldwide . The amount rose to 30 million by 2004 , and to 40 million by 2009 . As of May 2016 , Rumours has spent 630 weeks in the UK Top 75 album chart and is the 11th best @-@ selling album in UK history and is certified 11 × platinum by the British Phonographic Industry , the equivalent of 3 @.@ 3 million units shipped .

 = = Critical reception = = 
 Rumours has been acclaimed by music critics since its release . Robert Christgau , reviewing in The Village Voice , gave the album an " A " and described it as " more consistent and more eccentric " than its predecessor . He added that it " jumps right out of the speakers at you " . Rolling Stone magazine 's John Swenson believed the interplay among the three vocalists was one of the album 's most pleasing elements ; he stated , " Despite the interminable delay in finishing the record , Rumours proves that the success of Fleetwood Mac was no fluke . " In a review for The New York Times , John Rockwell said the album is " a delightful disk , and one hopes the public thinks so , too " , while Dave Marsh of the St. Petersburg Times claimed the songs are " as grandly glossy as anything right now " . Robert Hilburn was less receptive and called Rumours a " frustratingly uneven " record in his review for the Los Angeles Times , while Juan Rodriguez of The Gazette suggested that , while the music is " crisper and clearer " , Fleetwood Mac 's ideas are " slightly more muddled " . The album finished fourth in The Village Voice 's 1977 Pazz & Jop critics ' poll , which aggregated the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers . 
 In a retrospective review , AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave Rumours five stars and noted that , regardless of the voyeuristic element , the record was " an unparalleled blockbuster " because of the music 's quality ; he concluded , " Each tune , each phrase regains its raw , immediate emotional power — which is why Rumours touched a nerve upon its 1977 release , and has since transcended its era to be one of the greatest , most compelling pop albums of all time . " According to Slant Magazine 's Barry Walsh , Fleetwood Mac drew on romantic dysfunction and personal turmoil to create a timeless , five @-@ star record , while Andy Gill of The Independent claimed it " represents , along with The Eagles Greatest Hits , the high @-@ water mark of America 's Seventies rock @-@ culture expansion , the quintessence of a counter @-@ cultural mindset lured into coke @-@ fuelled hedonism " . In 2007 , BBC 's Daryl Easlea labelled the sonic results as " near perfect " , " like a thousand angels kissing you sweetly on the forehead " , while Patrick McKay of Stylus Magazine wrote , " What distinguishes Rumours — what makes it art — is the contradiction between its cheerful surface and its anguished heart . Here is a radio @-@ friendly record about anger , recrimination , and loss . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Mick Fleetwood has called Rumours " the most important album we ever made " , because its success allowed the group to continue recording for years to come . Pop culture journalist Chuck Klosterman links the record 's sales figures to its " really likable songs " , but suggests that " no justification for greatness " is intrinsically provided by them . The Guardian collated worldwide data in 1997 from a range of renowned critics , artists , and radio DJs , who placed the record at number 78 in the list of the 100 Best Albums Ever . In 1998 , Legacy : A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac 's Rumours was produced by Fleetwood and released . The record contained each song of the original Rumours covered by a different act influenced by it . Among the musicians involved were alternative rock bands Tonic , Matchbox 20 , and Goo Goo Dolls , Celtic rock groups The Corrs and The Cranberries , and singer @-@ songwriters Elton John , Duncan Sheik , and Jewel . Other diverse acts influenced by Rumours include baroque pop artist Tori Amos , hard rock group Saliva , indie rock band Death Cab for <unk> and art pop singer Lorde , who called it a " perfect record " . 
 In 1998 , Q placed Rumours at number three — behind The Clash 's London Calling and Pink Floyd 's The Dark Side of the Moon — in its list of 50 Best Albums of the 70s . In 1999 , Vibe featured it as one of 100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century . In 2003 , VH1 ranked the record at number 16 during its 100 Greatest Albums countdown , while Slant included it as one of 50 Essential Pop Albums . The same year , USA Today placed Rumours at number 23 in its Top 40 Albums list , while Rolling Stone ranked it at number 25 in its special issue of " The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " , the highest Fleetwood Mac record . In 2006 , Time named it in its All @-@ TIME 100 Albums shortlist , while Mojo featured it in its unnumbered list of 70 from the 1970s : Decade ’ s Greatest Albums . The record is included in both The Guardian 's " 1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die " and the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 = Lenore Romney = 
 Lenore LaFount Romney ( born Lenore Lafount but adopted the variation LaFount ; November 9 , 1908 – July 7 , 1998 ) was an American actress and political figure . The wife of businessman and politician George W. Romney , she was First Lady of Michigan from 1963 to 1969 . She was the Republican Party nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1970 from Michigan . Her youngest son , Mitt Romney , was the former Governor of Massachusetts and was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee . 
 Lenore LaFount was born in Logan , Utah , and raised in Salt Lake City . She went to Latter @-@ day Saints High School , where she developed an interest in drama and first met George Romney . She attended the University of Utah and George Washington University , graduating from the latter in 1929 . She studied acting at the American Laboratory Theatre in New York , then went to Hollywood where she became a bit player who appeared in a number of films with Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer . Turning down a contract offer with them , she married George Romney in 1931 . The couple had four children together ; she was a stay @-@ at @-@ home mother , eventually living in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , while he became a success in business and politics . 
 Lenore Romney was a popular First Lady of Michigan and was a frequent speaker at events and before civic groups . She was involved with many charitable , volunteer , and cultural organizations , including high positions with the Muscular Dystrophy Association , YWCA , and American Field Services , and also was active in the LDS Church that she was a lifelong member of . She was an asset to her husband 's 1968 presidential campaign . Although a traditionalist , she was an advocate for the greater involvement of women in business and politics . 
 In 1970 , she was urged by her husband and state Republican Party officials to run against popular , two @-@ term Democratic incumbent Senator Philip Hart . However , she struggled to establish herself as a serious candidate apart from her husband and failed to capture the support of conservatives within the party , only narrowly defeating State Senator Robert J. Huber in the party primary . Her difficulties continued in the general election and she lost to Hart by a two @-@ to @-@ one margin . She returned to volunteer activities during the 1970s , including stints on the boards of the National Center for Voluntary Action and the National Conference of Christians and Jews , and gave speeches to various organizations . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Lenore LaFount was born on November 9 , 1908 , in Logan , Utah , the second of four daughters Alma Luella ( née Robison ; 1882 – 1938 ) and Harold Arundel Lafount ( 1880 – 1952 ) . Her father was born in Birmingham in England , and her mother , born in Montpelier , Idaho , was of colonial English ancestry ( with more distant French roots ) . She had three sisters , one older and two younger . The family belonged to the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ; her father had converted to it in England and then come to the U.S. , while her maternal grandmother , Rosetta Berry , had been one of the Mormon handcart pioneers . Her father worked as a headphone manufacturer while her mother was prominent in local charities . 
 Lenore was raised in Salt Lake City , in a house located at Fifteenth South and Ninth East . She played the ukulele and was a member of the LDS girls club The Seagulls . She attended Latter @-@ day Saints High School , where she had a strong interest in drama . In 1924 , during her junior year , she and senior George W. Romney became high @-@ school sweethearts . She was from a more assimilated Mormon family than his , which had struggled with financial failure and debt . Although she was a " reach " for him in terms of social standing , he pursued her relentlessly from that point on , studying at a nearby junior college while she was a senior . 
 She graduated from high school in 1926 after only three years and attended the University of Utah for two years , while George went to England and Scotland to serve as a Mormon missionary ( making her " promise never to kiss anybody " while he was away ) . At the university , she was a member of the Chi Omega sorority . In 1927 , she was one of six attractive young women chosen to welcome Charles Lindbergh to Salt Lake City following his historic Spirit of St. Louis flight , and she was featured on the front page of the Salt Lake Telegram as a result . Later that year , on the strength of his friendship with U.S. Senator Reed Smoot , Harold Lafount was appointed by President Calvin Coolidge to serve on the new Federal Radio Commission . The family moved to Washington , D.C. , and Lenore transferred to George Washington University , where she graduated with an A.B. degree in English literature in June 1929 after spending only three years total in college . George returned from his missionary stint and soon followed her to Washington . 
 = = Acting career = = 
 LaFount 's mother wanted her to explore a theatrical career before marrying , and an aunt offered her further encouragement and assistance . LaFount thus moved to New York and enrolled in the American Laboratory Theatre to study acting , where she was taught Stanislavski 's system under school co @-@ founder Maria <unk> . She found the experience inspiring . In student productions there , she starred in the Shakespearean roles of Ophelia and Portia and also appeared in roles from Ibsen and Chekhov plays . She received a performance award there in 1930 . Talent scouts attending the productions were impressed , and she received an offer from the National Broadcasting Corporation to perform in a series of Shakespeare radio programs and from Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer to go to Hollywood under an apprentice actress contract . She decided on the latter , despite strenuous arguments against doing so from a threatened George , who had been visiting her on weekends . By then , he had a job with Alcoa , and arranged to be transferred to Los Angeles to be with her . In September 1930 , the couple became engaged . 
 A 5 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 68 m ) slender woman with porcelain skin and naturally curly chesnut colored hair , LaFount earned bit parts in Hollywood . These included appearing as a fashionable young French woman in a Greta Garbo film and as an ingenue in the William Haines film A Tailor Made Man . She also appeared in films that starred Jean Harlow and Ramon Navarro and was a stand @-@ in for Lili Damita . Her trained voice made her valuable during this dawn of the talking pictures era , and she worked as a voice actor in animated cartoons , sometimes doing the parts of speaking cats and dogs . She appeared in a promotional film clip with Buster , MGM 's star dog . George 's long @-@ time jealousy about her being in contact with other men became even worse as she met stars like Clark Gable , and in reaction to his attempts to control her , she threatened to break off their engagement . 
 After a few months in Hollywood , she had the opportunity to sign a three @-@ year contract with MGM that was worth $ 50 @,@ 000 if all the options were picked up . However , she was dismayed by some of the <unk> aspects of Hollywood , including the studio 's request that she pose for cheesecake photos and the constant gambling among the extras . She also found the long waits between shots unsatisfying as a thespian , and read Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky novels on the set to pass the time . Romney finally convinced her to go ahead with marriage and return to Washington , where he worked for Alcoa as a lobbyist , earning $ 125 a month . 
 Although Lenore had been more independent than many women of the time , she later stated that she " never had any regrets about giving up movies . " Another time she said that she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career : " In an acting career , I would have been upstaging him , and he couldn 't stand that . It was never either and ; it was always either or . " George would later consider his successful seven @-@ year courtship of her to be his greatest sales achievement . 
 = = Marriage and family = = 
 Lenore LaFount married George Romney on July 2 , 1931 , at the Salt Lake Temple . Their wedding reception in the Chi Omega house at the University of Utah was attended by about four hundred guests . 
 In Washington , Lenore 's cultural refinement and hosting skills , along with her father 's social and political connections , helped George in his business career , and the couple met the <unk> , the Roosevelts , and other prominent Washington figures . George often called upon her to host short @-@ notice parties . During 1933 – 1934 , Lenore hosted a 15 @-@ minute weekly program , Poetical <unk> , on Washington 's famed radio station WRC where she selected and read the poems . ( The staff announcer who introduced her was Arthur Godfrey . ) She also directed student plays at George Washington University . 
 The couple 's first child , Margo Lynn ( known as Lynn ) was born in 1935 after a difficult childbirth , and Lenore became a stay @-@ at @-@ home mother . A second daughter , Jane , followed in 1938 . In 1939 , the family moved to the Detroit , Michigan , area when George took a job with the Automobile Manufacturers Association . They rented a house in Grosse Pointe , Michigan , for two years , then bought one in the Palmer Woods section of Detroit . The couple 's first son , George Scott ( known as G. Scott ) , was born in 1941 . The couple longed for another child , but doctors told them that Lenore probably could not become pregnant again and might not survive if she did . By 1946 , they had begun the process of adopting a war orphan living in Switzerland . However , Lenore became pregnant , and after a difficult pregnancy – lying still on her back for a month in hospital during one stretch – and delivery , Willard Mitt ( known as Mitt ) was born in 1947 . After the birth she required a hysterectomy . Lenore would subsequently refer to Mitt as her miracle baby . 
 The family moved to affluent Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , around 1953 . In 1953 , Lenore suffered another health crisis when a blood transfusion of the wrong type put her life in danger , but she recovered . In 1954 , George was named president and chairman of American Motors Corporation . During this time a bad attack of bursitis left her with no movement in her left arm for five years , and the rest of the family took up her chores . The couple spent summers at a cottage on the Canadian shore of Lake Huron . A slipped disk suffered there gave her further trouble , and that and the bursitis caused her to switch from golf to swimming as her main exercise . 
 The couple 's marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship . George was devoted to Lenore , and tried to bring her a flower every day , often a single rose with a love note . George was also a strong , blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will , but the more self @-@ controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him . The couple quarreled often , so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them " the <unk> " . In the end , their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably , often by her finally accepting what he wanted . She still had a restive nature ; Mitt later recalled that , " It always seemed that she wanted something a little more for herself . " ( Mitt himself would later show a more reserved , private , and controlled nature than George 's , traits he got from Lenore . )

 When her husband decided to enter electoral politics by running for Governor of Michigan in 1962 , Lenore Romney said she and the family supported him : " I know it will be difficult – not easy . But we 're all dedicated with him for better government . " She played a productive role in the 1962 campaign , making speeches before groups of Republican women at a time when it was unusual for women to campaign separately from their husbands . She was given the task of campaigning in the rural , naturally Republican <unk> areas while he focused on the naturally Democratic Detroit area . 
 Following George 's victory in November 1962 , Lenore became the state 's First Lady . About her new role , she said her goal was to make " a real breakthrough in human relations by bringing people together as people – just like George has enunciated . Women have a very interesting role in this , and I don 't expect to be a society leader holding a series of meaningless teas . " 
 She proved popular as a First Lady . She was a frequent speaker at events and before civic groups and became known for her eloquence . She was thus useful to his political career , just as she had been to his business one . Like her husband , she did not make public appearances on Sundays . He was re @-@ elected in 1964 and 1966 , and she campaigned frequently with him . Moreover , she played more of an active and partisan role within her party than any Michigan first lady before or after her . She knew his policy positions at least as well as any of his official aides , went with him on almost all of his out @-@ of @-@ state trips , and gave his speeches for him if sudden events made him unable to attend . Over time an impression grew among some in the public that she was smarter than he was . George Romney biographer T. George Harris concluded in 1967 that " she has been considerably more than a first lady . " 
 Lenore was a traditionalist who decried the women 's liberation movement as being one of " strident voices " and " burning bras and railing against male @-@ chauvinistic pigs . " She decried relaxed sexual mores and talk of a " New Morality " , saying " the morality they discuss is the barnyard morality and it is as old as the hills . " However , she was also an advocate for the involvement of women in business and politics . By 1966 , she was telling audiences around the state , " Why should women have any less say than men about the great decisions facing our nation ? " She added that women " represent a reservoir of public service which has hardly been tapped . " 
 She explicitly criticized the counterculture phrase " Turn on , tune in , drop out " , saying " What kind of a philosophy is that ? " Instead she urged young people to " Think of something outside of yourselves . Have something in yourself that is greater than self . " She told one high school audience , " You have the right to rebel , but make sure what you 're rebelling for is greater than what you 're rebelling against . " 
 She was a devout and faithful Mormon who taught Sunday School lessons at her church for many years , including a stint during the early 1960s teaching 14 @-@ year @-@ olds . Her views on many social issues were more liberal than most of the Republican Party , and she appeared on stage with Martin Luther King , Jr. at Michigan State University in March 1966 . On the issue of the LDS Church policy of the time that did not allow black people in its lay clergy , she defended the church , saying , " If my church taught me anything other than that the Negro is equal to any other person , I could not accept it . " She was a member of the Women 's City Club in Detroit , but in 1967 , said she would resign unless the club dropped a policy barring black guests from eating in its dining room . 
 During her husband 's 1968 presidential campaign , Lenore continued to exert a calming influence on him and helped keep his sometimes problematic temper in check . She was adept at campaigning , appearing at ease and speaking in a lively , fluent manner without notes before audiences of various types . The Associated Press wrote that she was probably " the most indefatigable campaigner on the New Hampshire primary circuit , including the candidates " . The New York Times wrote , " To see Mrs. George Romney in action is to watch an authentic , stand @-@ up evangelist weave a spell . ... in the view of seasoned politicians , Lenore Romney is a far more effective speaker than the wife of any national candidate in recent memory . She may even be among the select group of political wives who win votes for their husbands through their own speeches and contacts . " As the campaign went on , George fell far behind Republican rival Richard Nixon in polls and withdrew in February 1968 before the first primaries took place . 
 Lenore continued to have health difficulties , visiting medical centers around the country but unable to get a clear diagnosis . One specialist attributed her problems to a failure to absorb sufficient calcium , for which she was given once @-@ a @-@ week shots . She was found to have several food allergies and spent time at Chicago 's Swedish Covenant Hospital in 1967 . She suffered an injury outside her house around 1967 and another the next year when she fell and suffered a shoulder dislocation that turned into bursitis . During October 1968 she was hospitalized at Barnes @-@ Jewish Hospital in St. Louis , seeing a bone and mineral specialist . 
 Lenore Romney worked on behalf of many volunteer organizations over a number of years . In 1963 , she was co @-@ chair of the Muscular Dystrophy Association . Starting in 1965 , she was a member of a special committee of the American Mothers Committee . By 1970 , she was on the national board of directors of the YWCA and a member of the national advisory board to American Field Services . She had also held high positions with Goodwill Industries , United Community Services , Child Guidance Study , Association for Retarded Children , Michigan Association for Emotionally Disturbed Children , and the Michigan Historical Society . She worked with Project HOPE . She was chair of the Detroit Grand Opera Association and was active with the Women 's Association for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra . The Boston Globe later characterized her as a " pillar of Detroit society " .
