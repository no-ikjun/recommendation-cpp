 The 2007 TransAVIAexport Airlines Il @-@ 76 crash refers to an Ilyushin Il @-@ 76 cargo aircraft operated by that Belarusian airline that crashed in the outskirts of Mogadishu , Somalia , on 23 March 2007 , during the Battle of Mogadishu . The plane was carrying repair equipment and humanitarian aid . According to a spokesperson for the transport ministry of Belarus , the aircraft was shot down . However , the Somali government insisted that the crash was accidental . A crew of eleven on board the aircraft perished in the accident . 
 = = Previous shootdown attempt of another company 's aircraft = = 
 On 9 March 2007 , a <unk> Ilyushin Il @-@ <unk> , registration EW @-@ <unk> , that was about to complete an Entebbe – Mogadishu flight carrying Ugandan peacekeepers and equipment , made a successful emergency landing at Mogadishu International Airport after having been struck by a rocket propelled grenade and catching fire on approach to the airport of destination . The rocket had apparently been fired from a boat while the plane passed over it at a height of 150 metres ( 490 ft ) . A crew of nine Belarusian were aboard the aircraft , along with six <unk> soldiers ; all of them resulted unharmed . Islamist militia claimed the attack , saying that African Union peacekeepers were their target , as they were seen as invading troops ; Somali officials denied such attack , and said the incident was due to the aircraft experiencing a technical failure . 
 There had been a report with unverified claims circulating on the internet stating that the aircraft had actually been carrying a secret load of infantry fighting vehicles for Ugandan troops . This report also claimed that these vehicles saved all occupants on board . 
 = = Description of the accident = = 
 The aircraft involved was an Ilyushin Il @-@ 76 , a large Russian @-@ built cargo aircraft . Registered as EW @-@ 78849 , the Il @-@ 76 had been on a chartered cargo flight carrying equipment to Ugandan AMISOM peacekeepers in the Somali capital of Mogadishu . All of the crew members were Belarusian . Four of the personnel on board the accident aircraft were engineers who had worked on repairing another aircraft of the same type that had been the subject of an attempted shootdown 14 days earlier . Much of the equipment on board EW @-@ 78849 was for repairing the aircraft damaged earlier ; the rest of the cargo was humanitarian aid . The first aircraft was still crippled at the departure time of EW @-@ 78849 , and TransAVIAexport were considering whether to cannibalise it for re @-@ usable parts . 
 EW @-@ 78849 was due to fly back to Belarus carrying equipment used for the repairs of EW @-@ <unk> . The flight plan included a refuelling stop at Djibouti . Bound for Minsk , the aircraft had taken off from Mogadishu International Airport at 14 : 00 local time . According to Somali Interior Minister Mohamed <unk> <unk> , as soon as it reached 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) altitude , the pilot reported a problem in engine number two , stating that he would turn back to the airport . He was in the process of attempting to return to the airport for an emergency landing when one wing exploded , separated from the aircraft and fell into the Indian Ocean , while the rest of the plane continued , on fire , along the beach at a low altitude before crashing . 
 The accident occurred in an area called <unk> , with the main part of the wreckage landing near a farmer 's hamlet . A Reuters reporter who visited the scene reported seeing crushed animals , four corpses still on the ground , and wreckage spread across an area the size of four football fields . Rescuers found ten of the crew members dead at the scene , and an eleventh alive and wandering around the crash site . He was transported to a hospital where he died the same day . Operations at the airport were not affected by the crash , with Somali Prime Minister Ali <unk> and his delegation departing as scheduled from the airport the next day , destined for the Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia .

 A civilian who witnessed the crash said he heard what he believed to be a surface @-@ to @-@ air missile being fired immediately before the accident . " I saw with my eyes when the plane , which was flying low @-@ level , was hit by a rocket and then fell to the ground , " Shabelle reporter Maryan Hashi said . " There have been reports that the projectile came from a small boat , and others that it came from a nearby farmers ' market . The plane appears to have been struck by the missile at an altitude of about 150 metres ( 490 ft ) .

 All eleven occupants on board the aircraft perished in the incident . Their bodies were transported back to Belarus in a <unk> aircraft on 30 March 2007 . On 2 April funeral services were held in Belarus for the victims , with hundreds attending . Eight of the victims were buried in a single lot at <unk> cemetery , the rest in Vitsebsk .

 The Somali authorities originally stated that the cause of the crash was unknown , and have since maintained that the crash occurred as a result of an accident , and that it had not been shot down . However , while not claiming responsibility for this specific attack , an Islamist web site published claims that the plane was indeed struck by a missile . Within 24 hours of the crash , Belarusian officials confirmed that the plane had been shot down . Somali soldiers began to guard the area against interference . TransAVIAexport suspended all flights to Somalia as a result of the incident , and Belarus advised its airlines not to enter Somali airspace . An investigation was launched by the Belarusian transport prosecutor 's office for violations of Article 126 of the Criminal Code , which concerns international terrorism . 
 On 5 April 2007 , the US Federal Aviation Administration released a communication prohibiting US airlines and commercial operators from operating over Somali airspace at altitudes below 26 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 900 m ) , due to possible threats from rocket propelled grenades and shoulder @-@ launched missiles .

 = 2009 – 10 Plymouth Argyle F.C. season = 
 The 2009 – 10 season was the 115th season in the history of Plymouth Argyle Football Club , their 85th in the Football League , and 41st in the second tier of the English football league system . Their 21st @-@ place finish in the 2008 – 09 season meant it was their sixth successive season playing in the Championship . Their campaign ended disappointingly as they were relegated to League One with 11 wins , 8 draws , and 27 losses from 46 matches . The club exited both domestic cup competitions at the first stage , being eliminated by Newcastle United in the third round of the FA Cup and by Gillingham in the first round of the League Cup . The club changed managers in December due to a string of poor results as Paul Sturrock was replaced by Paul Mariner . 
 The club began their league campaign with two draws , but defeat by Cardiff City marked the beginning of a seven @-@ game losing streak . Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner . Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period , including a 4 – 1 win against Reading ; their best of the season . The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan , including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale , in order to try to improve their league position . A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February , which prompted Mariner to make more signings . 
 Argyle lost three of their next nine matches to give themselves a chance of avoiding relegation , but their win at Doncaster Rovers proved to be the last game that they would collect any points in . Defeats at home to Middlesbrough and away to Watford left the club on the brink of a return to England 's third tier , and that was confirmed in their next game . Newcastle United won 2 – 0 at Home Park to secure the Championship title , and relegated the home side at the same time . The club finished 23rd in the league table after defeat by bottom club Peterborough United on the final day of the season , eight points adrift of safety . Jamie Mackie finished as the club 's top scorer with eight goals in all competitions , and captain Carl Fletcher was voted Player of the Year . 
 = = Background = = 
 The 2008 – 09 season was Paul Sturrock 's first full campaign in his second spell as the club 's manager . The club secured their status in the second tier of English football for a sixth season after finishing 21st in the league table , five points above Norwich City . A number of players returned to their parent clubs at the end of the season after successful loan spells , including Craig Cathcart , David Gray , Alan Judge and Paul Gallagher . Sturrock wanted to bring Gallagher back to the club on a permanent basis , but was eventually unsuccessful after admitting before the season finished that the transfer fee and wages were an issue . Three apprentices of the club 's youth system were offered professional contracts in May , including Irish youth international Joe Mason . The club 's first signing of the summer was Carl Fletcher , who returned to Home Park permanently after signing on loan in February . Fletcher replaced Karl Duguid as the team captain , and Romain <unk> was named club captain . Sir Roy Gardner was confirmed as the club 's new chairman in July , replacing Paul Stapleton who remained on the new board as vice @-@ chairman . The club added to their squad that month with the permanent signings of Bradley Wright @-@ Phillips , Kári Árnason and <unk> Johnson , while Jermaine Easter and long @-@ serving Frenchman Mathias <unk> @-@ <unk> were among the players who left . <unk> was released from his contract by mutual consent in August after five years with the club .

 Plymouth Argyle began their campaign at Selhurst Park on 8 August against Crystal Palace , with Carl Fletcher captaining his new side against his former club . An early goal from Hungarian international centre @-@ back <unk> <unk> put Argyle ahead but the home side responded in the second @-@ half to give both teams a share of the points . Argyle faced Queens Park Rangers in their first home game of the season and an injury @-@ time own goal from <unk> <unk> salvaged a point after the visitors had taken the lead in the first @-@ half . Alan Gow 's first goal for the club in their next match against Cardiff City was merely a consolation , as a hat @-@ trick from Michael Chopra consigned Argyle to their first league defeat of the season . A stoppage time goal from Derby County 's Miles Addison denied Argyle their third draw of the season after they had taken a first @-@ half lead through Alan Judge , and a second 3 – 1 home defeat followed a week later , this time against Sheffield Wednesday . A first @-@ half goal from Jamie Mackie gave Argyle hope of their first victory of new the season at The Hawthorns against West Bromwich Albion , but the home side responded with three goals either side of half @-@ time to claim a comfortable win . 
 The club 's poor run of form continued in their next home match against Watford , as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped to the bottom of the league table . Another 3 – 1 defeat , against Newcastle United , was followed by a second successive 1 – 0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest , to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches . Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United , and two second @-@ half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle 's first three points of the new season . " It 's nice to get three points , but now we have to build on it , " said Sturrock . " There 's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again . " Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United . A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2 – 1 win after Fallon 's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper . Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool , who won 2 – 0 at Bloomfield Road . The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip , a player on loan from Argyle . He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway , a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials . " I suppose it was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal , but I don 't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better , " said executive director Keith Todd . " We understood exactly what we are doing . " 
 An Argyle Hall of Famer returned to Home Park on 18 October 2009 , when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club 's new head coach . " In football , there is not much sentiment . But , if sentiment is involved in this scenario , then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands , " said Mariner on the New England Revolution website , the club he left to rejoin Argyle . " Plymouth Argyle are in my blood . Obviously the teams you 're associated with are the ones you look for every week , and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed there , I was delighted . " His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3 – 1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate . They faced Ipswich Town , another side struggling for form , at home in their next match and a first @-@ half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead , but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead , who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer . Welshman Darcy Blake , on loan from Cardiff City , was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square . Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough , in Gordon Strachan 's first game as their new manager . Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points , in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot , thanks to a second @-@ half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table , within three points of Doncaster Rovers . 
 = = = November – February = = = 
 The club began November in the same fashion they ended the previous month – with a win . Judge and Fallon scored again to secure a 2 – 1 home victory against Doncaster Rovers , and pull Argyle clear of the relegation zone . They looked like earning a valuable point when they travelled to play Leicester City but were denied by a 94th @-@ minute goal from midfielder Andy King . Another home defeat , this time to Sheffield United followed , which left Sturrock desperate to improve morale among his squad , but a third consecutive 1 – 0 defeat at Swansea City , during which Lowry was sent off , signalled the end of Paul Sturrock 's second spell as manager . Paul Mariner was placed in charge until further notice . " It 's a sad day , but obviously a happy day for me because I 'm getting my chance to be a manager in the league , " said the former striker . " He 's a great friend of mine . The bond that we have together is quite remarkable and we have a mutual respect for each other . " His first match was a 2 – 0 defeat at Preston North End , but he took positives from the performance . 
 John Carver , right @-@ hand man to former Barcelona manager Sir Bobby Robson at Newcastle United , arrived as the club 's new assistant manager on 17 December 2009 , but the club suffered another 1 – 0 defeat at home , against Coventry City , two days later . Argyle travelled to Cardiff on Boxing Day to play Cardiff City at their new stadium , and came away with an important three points thanks to a late goal from Sawyer . They recorded their biggest win of the season two days later against Reading . A brace from Judge , and first goals of the season for Kári Árnason and Ashley Barnes secured a 4 – 1 win at Home Park and six points from their two games over the Christmas period . Argyle returned to league action after their FA Cup ties on 16 January , looking for another three points against Crystal Palace but an early goal from young striker Victor Moses won the game for the visitors . Another must @-@ win home game followed against Derby County and a fifth goal of the season from Jamie Mackie boosted their survival bid . A defeat by fellow <unk> 's Sheffield Wednesday , coupled with other results going against them , left Argyle five points from safety , with a tough match to come against West Bromwich Albion a week later . A single goal from striker Simon Cox kept Albion in touch at the top of the table and left Argyle deep in relegation trouble again , six points from safety . 
 A stoppage time penalty from Shane Long earned a crucial 2 – 1 win for Reading in Argyle 's next match , but they came from a goal behind to claim a 3 – 1 victory at Barnsley four days later , which included a 35 @-@ yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon . Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie , who made his debut for the club . " We played with intellect . We got the ball down , rather than panicking a little bit ; we stroked it around ; we retained position at vital times , " he said . " The introduction of Bolasie was a breath of fresh air . I think even the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to see what he was doing . He brought a lot to the table for us . " A double @-@ header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle , against Swansea City and Leicester City , and they both ended in 1 – 1 draws . New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea , and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester . An end @-@ to @-@ end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4 – 3 defeat , which included a number of defensive mistakes . Argyle went 3 – 0 before finally sparking into life , scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason . A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale , on loan from Fulham , gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20 @-@ yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale . In the aftermath , Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason , describing him as " an incredible talent . " 
 = = = March – May = = = 
 Argyle salvaged a late point against Preston North End at the start of March , but remained in serious trouble at the bottom end of the table , seven points adrift of safety with 13 matches remaining . A 2 – 0 defeat followed at Queens Park Rangers , with Adel <unk> playing a part in both of the home sides goals . Draws at Home Park were proving to be an Achilles ' heel for Argyle , but they secured a creditable 1 – 1 draw at play @-@ off chasing Coventry City , having taken the lead through a glancing header from Árnason . Three days later , a 20 @-@ yard strike from captain Fletcher earned Argyle their fifth home win of the season in a 3 – 2 thriller against Bristol City . They had taken a 2 – 0 lead through Chris Clark and an overhead kick from Bradley Wright @-@ Phillips , his first for the club . However , the visitors responded in the second @-@ half with two goals from Nicky Maynard before former Welsh international Fletcher scored with seconds to spare . Argyle travelled to play Scunthorpe United looking to keep up the momentum , but threw away a lead to be defeated by a deflected effort from Martyn Woolford . 
 They were on the road again three days later when they faced Ipswich Town at Portman Road . Argyle came away with all three points courtesy of goals from Wright @-@ Phillips and Mason on what was a special night for Paul Mariner . " It was pretty special and I was a little choked up , " he said . " It was a special night . When I moved to the States 20 years ago , I didn 't think it would come to fruition but it was a tremendous reception from the fans , and I can 't thank them enough . Bringing Plymouth Argyle here in my present role was a special occasion . " Former manager Ian Holloway returned to Home Park for the first time since his departure in November 2007 in the club 's next game , and he left happy as Blackpool side claimed all three points after a 2 – 0 victory , with Charlie Adam at the heart of their attacking threat . Argyle played out an entertaining 0 – 0 draw at home with Barnsley three days later , but it did little to help in their battle against relegation , still five points away from safety . They produced another rousing away performance against Doncaster Rovers to earn a 2 – 1 win , coming from behind with second @-@ half goals from Mason , and an injury time header from Wright @-@ Phillips . In order to stay up , Argyle knew that they had to make the most of their remaining home games , but they went down 2 – 0 on 5 April to an efficient Middlesbrough side , which left them four points adrift with four games left . A solitary goal from Watford 's <unk> <unk> dealt Argyle 's survival hopes an almost fatal blow at Vicarage Road , but vice @-@ captain Karl Duguid remained upbeat about their chances of defeating the league leaders in their next game . " We 'll be upbeat , and we 'll go for the win against Newcastle next Monday . " 
 It was a night of contrasting emotions at Home Park . A 2 – 0 win for the visitors confirmed Argyle 's relegation to League One and Newcastle 's promotion back to the Premier League as champions at the first attempt . Hours after the match , the club 's board declared that it remained determined to steer it to the top flight of English football . Paul Mariner reaffirmed his commitment to the club , vowing to put things right . " I feel the pain of the supporters because this is the club that gave me my first start , " he said . " The reason I came here was because of the vision that the club can get into the Premiership . Now we 've got another couple of hurdles before we do that but I firmly believe that we can do it . " Argyle 's penultimate game of the season took place at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest , who had already qualified for the play @-@ off 's , and they secured a comfortable 3 – 0 victory against the relegated side . The club signed off their campaign with another home defeat against Peterborough United on 2 May . Argyle took the lead in the first @-@ half from a fine individual goal from Wright @-@ Phillips but conceded two goals after the break to Craig Mackail @-@ Smith . Four days later , the club announced that they would be searching for a new manager , with Paul Mariner reverting to his original role as head coach . He said : " I am disappointed that we could not produce the results we wanted last season . I am a realist and understand why and how the board came to the conclusion they have done . I am committed to this club and want only to help it regain Championship status as soon as possible and build on that . " Work on a new state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art <unk> pitch at Home Park began the following week .

 The third round draw for the FA Cup paired Argyle with Newcastle United , which left assistant manager John Carver with mixed emotions . Neither side could break the deadlock in a competitive contest at Home Park . Argyle striker Rory Fallon forced a good save from Tim Krul before the visitors had chances of their own , the majority of which went to Fabrice <unk> . Newcastle looked likely to win the game late on but were denied by goalkeeper Romain <unk> , who tipped a looping volley from Nicky Butt over the crossbar . The match saw the return of Chris Barker to the Argyle defence after a lengthy spell on the sidelines because of injury , and manager Paul Mariner was full of praise for his performance . " For him to come and do what he did against such a high powered , attacking team as Newcastle and playing 90 plus minutes was pretty remarkable . He 's a very strong character and very experienced . " The replay at St James ' Park was Argyle 's next match due to the wintry weather , and they were on the wrong end of a 3 – 0 scoreline . Newcastle striker Peter Løvenkrands gave the home side a two @-@ goal lead at half @-@ time and completed his hat @-@ trick after 72 minutes . " His timing of his runs is pretty special and for the first goal , his finish was fantastic , " said Mariner . The match on Tyneside was to be the last in an Argyle shirt for Cillian Sheridan who returned to Celtic in Scotland the next day when his loan spell with the club finished , having made 13 appearances , scoring no goals .

 Having been drawn to face Gillingham in the first round of the League Cup , the club 's manager , Paul Sturrock , planned to make a couple of changes to the team that faced Crystal Palace on the opening day of the new season , with youngster Joe Mason included in the squad . Two first @-@ half goals were enough to take the hosts into the second round . Simeon Jackson put Gillingham ahead after 42 minutes and Andy Barcham scored a second just before the half @-@ time break . Argyle reduced the deficit four minutes into the second @-@ half when Luke Summerfield from a direct free kick , but they couldn 't find an equaliser . The visitors should have forced extra time but Jamie Mackie spurned a chance when he pulled his shot wide with only the goalkeeper to beat . The defeat extended Sturrock 's unfortunate run in the League Cup as a manager , having won just once in nine attempts . " I must have the worst record of all managers in cup competitions , it 's unbelievable , " he said . " One or two of my defenders didn 't defend properly tonight . It 's not proper to name people but there were some glaring attempts to clear the ball and that 's where we had problems . "

 Pre @-@ season for Plymouth Argyle began on 1 July 2009 when the first team squad returned to Harpers Park . A week of intense training followed , before the club 's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City . In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason , Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win . A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth the next day to take on Plymouth Parkway . The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly , including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason . The first team were in action again the next day , against Torquay United . The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving <unk> with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute . The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland , and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009 . Argyle came away with a 2 – 0 win after scoring a goal in each half . A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009 . An 81st @-@ minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn 't enough to save Argyle from their first defeat of the season . 
 Hungarian international Zoltán <unk> joined the squad in training ahead of their next match against Romanian champions Unirea <unk> . They came from behind to record a 2 – 1 win in a feisty encounter , with Steve MacLean scoring the decisive goal . Argyle returned to England to play against Morecambe on 25 July 2009 , and included a triallist called <unk> Johnson in their defence , who appeared in the match under a pseudonym . Two second half goals ensured that they left Christie Park with a win . The club 's only pre @-@ season friendly to take place at Home Park was against Scottish club Heart of Midlothian on 29 July 2009 . Neither side could break the deadlock in a dour 0 – 0 draw . Swindon Town were the opposition for Argyle 's penultimate friendly . A goal from Marcel Seip after 57 minutes set the visitors on their way to a 2 – 0 victory at manager Paul Sturrock 's old club . Argyle 's final pre @-@ season match took place on 3 August 2009 against Tiverton Town . A young team containing only two senior professionals , Yoann Folly and Simon Walton , secured a 1 – 0 win at <unk> .

 = Mariano Moreno = 
 Mariano Moreno ( September 23 , 1778 – March 4 , 1811 ) was an Argentine lawyer , journalist , and politician . He played a decisive role in the Primera Junta , the first national government of Argentina , created after the May Revolution . 
 Moreno was born in Buenos Aires in 1778 . His father was Manuel Moreno y Argumosa , born in Santander , Spain , who arrived in the city in 1776 and married María del Valle . Mariano was the firstborn of the Moreno family , and had thirteen brothers . During his youth he studied Latin , logic , and philosophy at San Carlos Royal College , followed by college studies of law at Chuquisaca . During these studies , he learned the new ideas of the Spanish Enlightenment . He married María Guadalupe Cuenca and returned to Buenos Aires , becoming a prominent lawyer for the Cabildo . Unlike most other criollos , he rejected the Carlotist project and the administration of Santiago de Liniers , joining instead the ill @-@ fated mutiny of Álzaga against him . He worked for the next viceroy , Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros . He wrote the economic paper The Representation of the Landowners , which persuaded the viceroy to open trade with Britain . 
 Although he was not prominently involved in the May Revolution that deposed Cisneros , he was appointed as secretary of war of the new government , the Primera Junta . Along with Juan José Castelli , he promoted harsh policies against the supporters of the former government and the strengthening of the new one . These policies were detailed at a secret document , the Operations plan ; some historians dispute its authorship . Moreno organized military campaigns to Paraguay and Upper Peru , and ensured the execution of Santiago de Liniers after the defeat of his counter @-@ revolution . He established the first Argentine newspaper , La Gazeta de Buenos Ayres , and translated Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau 's The Social Contract into Spanish . 
 When the Junta achieved the first military victories , President Cornelio Saavedra opposed Moreno , favoring moderate policies instead . Allied with Gregorio Funes , Saavedra expanded the number of members of the Junta to leave <unk> in a minority . With disputes still going on , Moreno was appointed to a diplomatic mission to Britain , but died at sea on the way there . His brother Manuel Moreno alleged that he was poisoned . His supporters were still an influential political party for some years after his death . Historians hold several perspectives about the role and historical significance of Moreno , from hagiography to repudiation . He is considered the precursor of Argentine journalism . 
 = = Birth and studies = = 
 Mariano Moreno was the son of poor parents , Manuel Moreno y Argumosa and Ana Maria Valle , he had fourteen siblings . He studied at Colegio Grande de San Carlos , but without living in it , as his family could not afford the price . He graduated with an honor diploma . He met influential people within the literary field , who helped him to continue his studies at the University of Chuquisaca , even when his father could not afford the cost . This was the only big university in South America at the time . He studied the books of Montesquieu , Voltaire , Denis Diderot , Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau , and other European philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment . He studied English and French languages as well , to understand authors from Britain and France . This allowed him to work as a translator , and he spent several years working with Rousseau 's The Social Contract . Moreno was convinced that society could be changed by the power of intelligence and reason . 
 He also studied philosophical texts of the Spanish Enlightenment under the tutelage of the priest Terrazas , and aspired to implement the new ideas in his country . He wrote a thesis with strong criticism of the native slavery at the mines of Potosí , influenced by the Spanish jurist Juan de <unk> Pereira , the foremost publisher of Indian Law , and Victoria Villalva , fiscal of the Audiencia of Charcas and defender of the indigenous cause . 
 He started his professional career between 1803 and 1804 , in the office of Augustine Gascón , officiating as labour counselor for Indians . As a result , he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and <unk> . He left the city after being threatened , and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son . Once in the city , he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia , a local appeal court . The Buenos Aires Cabildo , the local council , hired him as an advisor as well . He defended Melchor Fernández , aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega , in one of his first cases . In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia . 
 A British army invaded Buenos Aires in 1806 , starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata . Although Moreno was not actively involved with the military counter @-@ offensive which drove them out , he opposed the British presence in Buenos Aires . He wrote a diary that noted all the events , so that , in the future , his countrymen would know the circumstances that allowed such an invasion . The British made a new attack in 1807 , this time invading Montevideo . They published a bilingual English – Spanish newspaper known as " The Southern Star " or " La estrella del sur " ( the newspaper used both names in conjunction ) . It advocated free trade , a British goal , and promoted American independence under British protection . The Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires banned the newspaper and requested Moreno to write articles refuting those of the British publication . Moreno refused because , although he did not accept British rule , he agreed with some of their criticisms of the Spanish government . Fearing a new attack to Buenos Aires , Moreno left the city with his whole family and relocated in the countryside . His house in Buenos Aires , left unoccupied , was used to keep prisoner William Carr Beresford , the British commander of the first invasion . Several friends of Moreno helped Beresford to escape and move to Montevideo , but it is unknown if Moreno was aware of the plan .

 Although Mariano Moreno was a criollo , a Spanish citizen born in the Americas , he did not work with the other criollos of Buenos Aires who sought to promote political changes against the privileges of the Spanish @-@ born . Unlike the criollo politicians Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli , he did not support viceroy Liniers or the Carlotist project , which sought the coronation of Carlota of Spain in the Americas . He joined mayor Martín de Álzaga instead , which allowed him to serve as legal adviser of the Cabildo . In that capacity , he wrote a petition to the King of Spain , so that the Buenos Aires Cabildo was named Protector of the Cabildos of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . As a result , all petitions from local cabildos to the King or the Viceroy would be channeled through the Cabildo at the capital . 
 Martín de Álzaga organized a mutiny on January 1 , 1809 , and Moreno joined it . Álzaga aspired to replace Viceroy Santiago de Liniers with a government Junta , after learning of the capture of the Spanish King Ferdinand VII during the Peninsular War and the creation of the Junta of Seville . If it prevailed , Mariano Moreno would have been part of the new Junta . The mutiny was defeated by the swift reaction of Cornelio Saavedra , in command of the Regiment of Patricians , who dispersed the crowd and persuaded Liniers not to abdicate . It is disputed by historians whenever the mutiny had similar or opposite goals to those of the May Revolution that would take place a year later . The historians who support the latter perspective try to make attempts to excuse or justify Moreno 's involvement ; those who support the former consider instead that Moreno was a revolutionary a year before most other Argentines . Moreno was Álzaga 's lawyer in the trial that followed , which was labeled a trial for " independentism " . Liniers did not extend the trial to Moreno himself , for reasons unknown . 
 Liniers was succeeded by Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros a few months later , who pardoned the mutineers to reduce political conflicts . Cisneros allowed free trade as well , as instructed by the Junta of Seville , which benefited British merchants ; Britain was allied with Spain in the Peninsular War . The agents of the Consulate of Cadiz asserted that this would hurt the local economy , moral values , social usages , religious practices , and the loyalty to Spain and its monarchy . As a result , Cisneros closed trade again , restoring the Spanish monopsony . A group of hacendados ( owners of haciendas ) , who did not feel adequately represented at the Cabildo , asked Moreno to defend them . Moreno wrote The Representation of the Landowners , a report that represented the export interest of the landowners , encouraged free trade , and condemned the privileges of the merchants benefited from the monopsony . It is considered the most comprehensive economic report from the time of the viceroyalty . It represented the new European economic ideas , and noted that the legal monopsony with Spain did not prevent British goods from being smuggled . Several authors have questioned Moreno 's authorship of the paper , considering it instead an update of another , previously drafted by Manuel Belgrano , Secretary of the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , written to make a similar request to the former viceroy Liniers . This report , as well as Moreno 's prestige in the colonial society , helped him gain the confidence of Cisneros . Yet secretly , Moreno supported the plan to dismiss the Viceroy . 
 = = Primera Junta = = 
 Mariano Moreno had several contacts with groups seeking the removal of Cisneros , but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution , which considered the fall of the Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta . At the time , Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga . He attended the May 22 open Cabildo , but according to the father of Vicente Fidel López and the father @-@ in @-@ law of Bartolomé Mitre ( both direct witness ) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate . He voted for Saavedra 's proposal : to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta . Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre , captain of hussars , proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government , with five men appointed as counselors , Moreno among them . However , nobody else voted for that proposal , and it was the only one that included him . Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros . He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events . The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25 , which was given to the Cabildo . The reasons of Moreno 's inclusion in the list are unclear , as with all other members of the Junta . A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists . 
 The Junta faced strong opposition from the beginning : it was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia , still loyal to the absolutist factions ; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it ; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter @-@ revolution at Córdoba . Mariano Moreno , an unimportant politician up to that point , became the leader of the most radical supporters of the Junta . He was supported by the popular leaders Domingo French and Antonio Beruti , Dupuy , Donado , <unk> , and Cardozo ; and priests like Grela and Aparicio . Historian Carlos Ibarguren described that Morenist youths roamed the streets preaching new ideas to each pedestrian they found , turned the " Marcos " coffee shop into a political hall , and proposed that all social classes should be illustrated . Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli supported Moreno within the Junta , and French was promoted to Colonel of the regiment " América " . This regiment , also known as " The Star " because of a star that they wore on their sleeves , was composed of radical youths led by French during the riots of the May Revolution . 
 Moreno established the official newspaper Gazeta de Buenos Ayres through a June 2 decree , and managed its contents . The first newspapers were available to the public five days later . He issued a freedom of the press decree , which allowed the press to publish anything that did not offend public morals or attack the Revolution or the government . Moreno published some works of Gaspar de Jovellanos , and his translation of Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau 's The Social Contract . In this later work he skipped the chapter about religion , suggesting that the author " has raved in religious matters " . This was done to prevent religious disputes among patriots . This publication was criticized by conservatives such as Tomás de Anchorena , who said that it could generate popular unrest . As with the Junta itself , Moreno 's writings maintained loyalty to Ferdinand VII . It is unclear to historians whether he was concealing pro @-@ independence ambitions , or was truly loyal to the deposed king . However , he made specific references to independentism as early as November , 1810 . In reference to the Courts of Cádiz that would write a Constitution , he said that the Congress " may establish an absolute disposal of our beloved Ferdinand " , meaning that the right of self @-@ determination would allow even that . He did not think the monarchical authority to be absolute , but subject to popular sovereignty , so that a monarch may lose his authority if he worked against the common good of the people . He also considered that if Ferdinand VII returned to the throne , he would not be able to challenge a Constitution written in his absence . However , he wrote that as a hypothetical scenario , to describe the strength of a Constitution , not as a likely possibility . 
 Moreno issued several decrees during his first days in government . He ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes , and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people . The military bodies of " <unk> " and " Morenos " , composed of indigenous peoples , were reformed to have military ranks similar to those of the Spanish military bodies . He did this invoking the rulings of the Catholic Monarchs during the early Spanish colonization of the Americas .

 Although the Junta of Seville was defeated , a new one was created afterwards , the Regency Council . The Primera Junta did not swear loyalty to it , but the Royal Audiencia did so in defiance of the local authority . The Junta summoned them , along with former viceroy Cisneros , and exiled them to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives . The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution . Moreno wrote in the Gazeta that the Audiencia attacked the good faith of the government , and that the Junta left their usual moderation for the safety of the people . 
 The Junta was rejected in Montevideo , as was the exile of Cisneros and the former Audiencia . Moreno reacted immediately , replying to the Montevidean concerns . He supported the legitimacy of the Primera Junta by criticizing the Regency Council and stating that the overseas Spanish territories were equally capable of creating Juntas , as it was debated during the open cabildo . He also called for unity and support of the metropolis , and that both cities recognize Ferdinand VII as their legitimate monarch . He argued that the Junta treated the exiles initially with moderation , but their obstinacy , particularly on the part of Cisneros , generated popular discontent . Matías Irigoyen told the same thing to the British Lord Strangford in Río de Janeiro . 
 Moreno organized two military expeditions to counter the threat of the plazas that resisted the Junta . The first one , headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo , would move to Córdoba and attack the counter @-@ revolution organized by the former viceroy Santiago de Liniers ; they next went to Upper Peru . Ocampo 's initial orders were to capture the counter @-@ revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires , so that they could be judged . When the counter @-@ revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and , with support from Castelli and Paso , proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot as soon as they were captured instead of brought to trial . The Junta accepted the new proposal , and delivered it to Ocampo . The counter @-@ revolution was defeated the following August , but Ocampo did not execute his prisoners . Gregorio Funes , head of the patriotic party of Córdoba , persuaded him to spare them , because the prisoners were popular in Córdoba and the people would not support their deaths . Besides Liniers , the prisoners included the governor of Córdoba and the bishop of the city . Ocampo stuck to the initial orders and delivered the prisoners to the city . Moreno did not accept it , and told Ocampo that a general should simply obey orders . He called a new meeting of the Junta , and produced a paper left at his home which said , " If Liniers does not die , LET HIM LIVE ! " ( note : the second part was written in capital letters in the original ) . The Junta agreed to fire Ocampo and replace him with Castelli , with Nicolás Rodríguez Peña as secretary and Domingo French leading the escort . They intercepted the convoy at Cabeza de Tigre and executed them , except for Bishop Orellana , because of his religious endowment . The Auxiliary Army , commanded by Ocampo and Castelli , was renamed as the Army of the North , and launched the First Alto Perú campaign . Moreno gave harsh new instructions for it : monitor the activities of the rich ; kill Goyeneche , Nieto , Paula Sanz and the bishop on sight ; and allow soldiers to pillage the enemies at the first patriot victory , to generate terror . The context was not favourable : only Cochabamba and Charcas made a genuine support of the revolution , and some indigenous people hesitated in joining , fearing the consequences of a possible royalist counter @-@ attack . The Morenist projects for Upper Peru , which included the emancipation of the indigenous peoples and the nationalization of the mines of Potosi , were resisted by the local populations that were benefiting from the system already in force . Castelli proposed to advance the military campaign even closer to Lima , but Moreno asked him to stay at his position . 
 The other military expedition moved to Paraguay , commanded by Manuel Belgrano . Following instructions from Moreno , he helped the natives at the missions in Corrientes , on his way to Paraguay . He gave them full civil and political rights , granted lands , authorized commerce with the United Provinces , removed taxes for ten years , abolished any type of torture , and lifted restrictions on taking public or religious office . 
 Moreno promoted stronger measures against the royalists . In July , he gave orders to the neighboring mayors to prevent the creation of secret groups , or activities that could promote alienation . He promoted a new decree of the Junta that called for trial and confiscation of goods for anyone that left the city without authorization , kept military weapons in secret , promoted popular alienation or discontent against the government , or wrote letters to people in other cities for such a purpose . Serious cases were usually punished with execution or exile . Some rich people exiled by this decree were Francisco <unk> , Olaguer Reynals , Norberto de <unk> y <unk> , and Pablo <unk> . Manuel Andrés Arroyo y Pinedo , another rich man , blamed Moreno for these actions , accusing him of equaling disagreement with <unk> , and felt that the ideas of egalitarianism would only cause great evils . Those measures were also criticized by moderate supporters of the revolution , such as Gregorio Funes from Córdoba , who rejected the lack of proper trials , or Dámaso Uriburu , from Salta , who compared Moreno , Castelli , and Vieytes with the French Jacobins . 
 By this time , Moreno thought that the only way to secure the Revolution would be if it was successful throughout the continent . However , he considered that Latin American integration should be achieved peacefully among equals , and not as the result of a conquest campaign . He wrote at the Gazeta that " even as pure as our intentions may be , it would be dangerous if the freedom of America was just our own work . Such a circumstance could lead to a real despotism and the Peruvian peoples would not improve having porteño oppressors instead of European ones . " He made positive comments about the rebellions at Cochabamba and Chile . 
 = = = Operations plan = = = 
 Following a proposal of Manuel Belgrano , the Junta wrote a political platform setting broad goals and procedures to follow to achieve its objectives . The creation of this document , whose name is often summarized simply as the " Operations plan " , was trusted to Mariano Moreno . There have been disputes about the authenticity of this document . Some historians like Paul Groussac suspect that the document was a literary forgery , prepared by a Spaniard at the Court of Portugal to discredit the Junta . Supporters of the truthfulness of the document like Norberto Piñeiro , allege that the content would be consistent with government actions taken by the Primera Junta . 
 The document states the need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution . It rejected the use of political moderation , considering that it would be dangerous during revolutionary times . It compared the South American revolution , still in its early stages , with the French and North American ones , and even the revolution in Spain itself , pointing out that none of those relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings . The document proposes to favor patriots , and fill the state offices with them . Peninsulars , on the other hand , should be carefully monitored , and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta , and executed if they were rich or influential . For this end , the Junta would need to create an espionage network . This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter @-@ revolution , and similar to the one employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after . Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally , and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism . He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay , and urged support of local patriots against local royalists . 
 On the level of international relations , Mariano Moreno rejected slavery in Brazil , a neighboring Portuguese colony . He proposed to distribute large numbers of Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspapers , filled with libertarian ideas and translated into Portuguese , and provide military support to the slaves if they should riot . He considered the risk of a complete Spanish defeat in the Peninsular War or a restoration of absolutism great menaces , and regarded Britain as a potential ally against them . During a conflict , Britain would be able to provide them with weapons and other goods not produced locally . Critics of Moreno consider him an Anglophile because of this proposal , but the same document also warns against the risk of allowing Britain too much influence in national economy . He criticized the relationship between Britain and Portugal , considering that Portugal was subject to a " shameful slavery " to Britain , and that British influence in Brazil was so high that the Portuguese colonies might eventually become British ones . Moreno held the same ideas about being simultaneously friendly and cautious with Britain in the pages of the Gazeta newspaper . 
 In the economic field , the document addressed the lack of a bourgeoisie that could turn the political changes into economic development , and proposed to overcome this lack with strong state interventionism . Mariano Moreno proposed that the state invest 200 or 300 million in factories , manufacturing , arts , agriculture , navigation , and other critical areas . There would be no risk of bankruptcy because the state would manage the businesses . With the money generated , the state would then seek seeds and tools , and ultimately allow the continent to be economically <unk> . The initial money that the state would need to become such an active economic force would come from the mines in Potosi , where the slavers had nearly 500 or 600 million . Moreno proposed simply to confiscate the money and nationalize the mines . He reasoned that five or six thousand people would be harmed by such action , but eighty or a hundred thousand would benefit . The state would not manage those areas indefinitely ; Moreno proposed that this should be done only until there was a strong economic activity in each area , and then the state would just observe , making sure that they followed the laws enacted for the common good of society . 
 Early 19th @-@ century liberalism did not promote confiscation among their common proposals , but an antecedent of this proposal was the Conspiracy of the Equals , promoted by François @-@ Noël <unk> during the French Revolution . Moreno thought that state @-@ sized fortunes managed by a few individuals were detrimental to civil society , and those individuals would tend to manage the economy for their own benefit , without fixing the problems of society at large . 
 The document proposed to avoid exporting money , and to include high tariffs on the import of luxury goods . This is often seen as a contradiction of the The Representation of the Hacendados , but each request different things . The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain , which is not the same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy . As secretary , Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports , but kept high ones for imports . 
 = = = Internal disputes = = = 
 Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra had disagreements about the events of the May Revolution and the way to run the government ; their disputes became public shortly after the creation of the Junta . Saavedra was the president , and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members . Ignacio Núñez describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys , thus downgrading the importance of the other members of the Junta at public events ; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking . However , Domingo Matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honours and privileges than for a real power struggle . Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long @-@ term consequences . He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way of talking about concepts like self @-@ determination , tyranny , slavery , and freedom . Theologians resented that Moreno cited authors like Rousseau , Voltaire , or Montesquieu rather than Christian philosophers like Saint Augustine or Saint Thomas . He was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of the military . 
 By October , Moreno 's measures started to generate resistance among some who initially supported the May Revolution . Traders did not like the protectionist policy , and some members of the military had close ties with rich people and opposed their punishment . On October 16 it was discovered that ten members of the Cabildo had sworn loyalty to the Regency Council the past July , and they were all jailed . This included Julián Leiva and Juan José de Lezica . Moreno and Saavedra had a dispute when the Junta was deciding what to do . Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent , accusing them of working with the Montevideo Cabildo , the enemy of the Junta . Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency , and rejected the use of the Patricians Regiment to carry out such executions . The prisoners were finally exiled to Luján , Ranchos , and Salto , and Leiva was housed by Gregorio Funes in Córdoba . 
 By this point , the only military support for Moreno was Domingo French , head of " The Star " regiment . Castelli and Belgrano supported him , but were far away from the capital on their respective military campaigns . The activists of the May Revolution supported him as well , as did other members of the Junta and other patriots like Vieytes and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña . Saavedra kept the strong support of the Regiment of Patricians , and added that of the merchants and even some supporters of the former regime who deemed the moderated Saavedra a lesser evil . Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules . Up until that point , the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority ; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead . However , in the short run this measure worked against him , as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules . He also thought that support from the lower classes was instrumental to the success of the Revolution , and wrote letters to Chiclana instructing him to generate such support at Upper Peru . Such popular involvement would take time to consolidate : the Guerra Gaucha , the War of the <unk> , and the rise of José Gervasio Artigas took place later , not as of 1810 . 
 Saavedra increased his resistance to Moreno 's proposals after the victory at the Battle of Suipacha , considering that the revolution had defeated its enemies and should relax its severity in consequence . The Regiment of Patricians hosted a banquet celebration at the barracks , restricting attendance to the military and supporters of Saavedra . Moreno was not allowed to pass by the guards at the door , which generated a small incident . That same night , Officer Atanasio Duarte , who was drunk , gave a crown of sugar to Saavedra 's wife and saluted Saavedra as if he was the new king or emperor of the Americas . The next day , when Moreno heard about the incident , he wrote the " Honours Suppression decree " , which suppressed the ceremony usually reserved for the president of the Junta and inherited privileges of the office of viceroy . Duarte was exiled , and Moreno 's act was justified by stating that " An inhabitant of Buenos Aires neither drunk nor asleep should be expressed against the freedom of his country " . Saavedra signed the decree without complaint , but Gregorio Funes felt that the Patricians resented Moreno because of this . 
 The conflicts between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions . Lord Strangford complained about the later actions of the Junta , such as the execution of Liniers , which were seen as more violent than the initial ones . Brazil was also concerned because many copies of the Gazeta were being distributed at Rio Grande do Sul , influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas . The Brazilian government sent Carlos José Guezzi to Buenos Aires , with the purpose of mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to rule as regent . He met Saavedra in his first interview , in July , and got a positive impression of him . Saavedra said that if Carlota 's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy , Buenos Aires would support her , even if it meant they had to stand against the other provinces . The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil , offered Carlota 's mediation with Montevideo , and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier , awaiting orders to attack the revolution . This time , Moreno resisted . Moreno rejected sending a representative , and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil , but for those of the United Provinces . He rejected the mediation as well , considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat . Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship . He described Moreno as " the Robespierre of the day " , and accused the Junta of attempting to build a republic . 
 In December , the deputies of the other provinces convened by the circular of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires . Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra , and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them . They did not agree about which body they should join : the deputies wanted to join the Junta , while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly . Funes , allied with Saavedra , calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta , as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority . The Junta , with both its original members and the deputies , discussed the topic on December 18 . Funes said that Buenos Aires had no right to rule the other provinces without their consent , and got the support of the other members . He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta . The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels , and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the <unk> decree . However , only Paso voted with him , and the deputies joined the Junta . Moreno resigned , but his resignation was rejected . His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces , which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades . Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party , while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party . However , historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future . Piñeiro considered it an error to label Moreno as federal or unitary , proving that this organization been prioritized over the secondary aspect of centralism or federalism , while Groussac similarly notes that Moreno devoted all his energies to the immediate problem of achieving independence without giving much thought to possible long @-@ term scenarios . 
 = = Political decline and death = = 
 Hipólito Vieytes was about to make a diplomatic mission to Britain , but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead . Saavedra accepted immediately . He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido , on the British schooner Fame . His health declined and there was no doctor on board , but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro ( Brazil ) or Cape Town ( South Africa ) . The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time , prepared with four grams of antimony potassium tartrate . Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence , and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram . He died shortly afterwards . His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea , after a volley of musketry . 
 Manuel Moreno speculated later that he was poisoned by the captain . Manuel Moreno was unsure of whether the captain really given him that substance , or if he substituted something else , or gave an even higher dose . Circumstances did not allow an autopsy to be performed . Further points used to sustain the idea of a murder are the captain 's refusal to land elsewhere , his slow sailing , his administration of the emetic in secrecy , and that he didn 't return to Buenos Aires with the ship . Enrique de Gandía pointed to an irregular ruling of the Junta that appointed a British person named Curtis as Moreno 's replacement for the diplomatic mission in the case of Moreno 's death . The son of Mariano Moreno commented to the historian Adolfo Saldías that his mother , Guadalupe Cuenca , received an anonymous gift of a mourning hand fan and handkerchief , with instructions to use them soon . By that time , the murder of Moreno was a common assumption , and it was mentioned during the trial of residence of the members of the Junta . Juan Madera stated at the trial that Moreno may have requested to go to Britain because he was afraid of being murdered , and that he may have stated this during the meeting when the Junta discussed his resignation . Modern author Manuel Luis Martín studied the health of both Moreno and his family , and concluded that he died of natural causes . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Despite the death of Mariano Moreno , his supporters were still an influential party in Buenos Aires . Morenists accused Saavedra and Funes of plotting to allow the coronation of Carlota , and organized a rebellion with " The Star " Regiment . However , the Saavedrists became aware of it , and organized another rebellion on May 5 and 6 , 1811 . This rebellion requested strong changes in the government : the removal of Morenists Nicolás Rodríguez Peña , Hipólito Vieytes , Miguel Azcuénaga , and Juan Larrea from the Junta ; the exile of Domingo French , Antonio Beruti , Agustín Donado , Gervasio Posadas and Ramón Vieytes ; and the return and trial of Manuel Belgrano . Thus , the Morenist party was set apart from the government . 
 The Saavedrist hegemony was short @-@ lived . The military defeats of Castelli and Belgrano started a new political crisis , and the First Triumvirate replaced the Junta Grande as the executive power , and then closed it completely . The former supporters of Moreno ( Belgrano , Dupuy , Tomás Guido , Beruti , Monteagudo , French , Vicente López ) would later support the campaign of José de San Martín . The Argentine war of independence would give room to the Argentine Civil War between unitarians and federals . Saavedrists like Martín Rodríguez , Ortiz de Ocampo , de la Cruz — and even Saavedra himself — became unitarians . Manuel Moreno , French , Agrelo , Vicente López , and Pancho Planes opposed both the First Triumvirate and the presidency of unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia . Manuel Moreno and Tomás Guido , in particular , worked in the government of the most powerful federal leader , Juan Manuel de Rosas . 
 = = = Historical perspectives = = = 
 Early Argentine historians described Mariano Moreno as the leader of the Revolution and a great historical man . Later liberal historians would embellish this portrayal even more . An example of this tendency is La Revolución de Mayo y Mariano Moreno by Ricardo Levene . Biographers would describe him as a serene statesman , a notable economist , a decided democrat , and a great leader . For those historians , Moreno would have been an anglophile , and " The Representation of the Hacendados " , the government platform of the May Revolution . 
 Subsequently , revisionist authors would formulate accusations against him , while promoting Saavedra as a popular leader . According to those authors , Moreno was a British agent , a demagogic caudillo , a paranoid , a mere man of theoretical ideas applying European principles that failed in the local context , wrongly portrayed as leader of the Revolution by the liberal historiography . Año X by Hugo Wast is considered the harshest work against Moreno . Moreno was still considered an anglophile , but in a negative light . They blamed Moreno for the harsh policies of the Junta , considering him a terrorist or a predecessor of Marxism ; liberal historians usually concealed these policies . 
 Modern authors like Ernesto Palacio , Norberto Galasso , and Jorge Abelardo Ramos attempt to rescue the image of Moreno by avoiding both extremes : the sweet liberal Moreno and the horrible one written by revisionists . Those historians do not consider Bernardino Rivadavia a successor of Moreno , and the proposals to seek an alliance with Britain are not seen as the product of anglophilia , but just an example of the limited options available to the Primera Junta . Similarly , they do not attribute much influence to the Representation ... , considering it a mere work for a client that didn 't really influence Cisneros , who would have allowed free trade for international contexts . The harsh policies are acknowledged , but not attributed specifically to Moreno , but rather to the whole Junta , and compared with similar royalist measures used to punish the Chuquisaca , the La Paz revolution , and the indigenous rebellion of Túpac Amaru II . 
 = = = Journalism = = = 
 Mariano Moreno is regarded as the first Argentine journalist , as he created the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres . June 7 , the day this newspaper was first available to the public , is recognized in Argentina as " Journalist day " since 1938 . The Gazeta , however , was not the first newspaper in Buenos Aires , but the first one since the May Revolution . The first newspaper was the Telégrafo Mercantil ( 1801 ) , followed by the Semanario de Agricultura Industria y Comercio ( 1802 ) and the Correo de Comercio de Buenos Aires ( 1810 ) , edited during the colonial period . 
 Moreno was the only one to sign the decree that established the newspaper , but the text implies that it was the result of a discussion of the whole Junta , and not just his initiative . Fellow member of the Junta Manuel Alberti was appointed director of the newspaper . However , Alberti never actually directed the newspaper ; Moreno did . Historian Guillermo Furlong considers that it was really Alberti who directed the newspaper , but the memoirs of José Pedro Agrelo ( a later director ) , Tomás Guido , and Saavedra confirm that the newspaper was managed by Moreno . Moreno has also been promoted as a supporter of the freedom of the press , but the Gazeta ... was actually a state @-@ sponsored newspaper , and the Junta allowed such freedom only for information that was not against the interests of the government . According to Norberto Galasso , that situation would today be considered media bias .

 The Moreno family was poor , but could afford a house and some slaves . Ana María Valle y Ramos , Mariano 's mother , was one of the few literate women in Buenos Aires . Mariano Moreno was the firstborn of fourteen children . Mariano moved to Chuquisaca with his brother Manuel Moreno and their friend Tomás Guido once the family raised the money . The long and difficult journey gave Mariano a rheumatism attack ; he had to stay in bed for fifteen days on arrival . He had further attacks years later . Moreno met María Guadalupe Cuenca in this city , after seeing a miniature portrait of her at a silversmith 's house . Both Moreno and María were expected by their families to follow religious studies , and Moreno 's father did not authorize a change . Moreno studied laws all the same , and married María in secret to avoid family resistance . They had a single son , named Mariano like the father . 
 When Moreno left for Europe on a diplomatic mission in 1811 , his wife and son stayed in Buenos Aires . María wrote many letters to Moreno , with descriptions of ongoing events in the city . Most of them were written when Moreno was already dead ; she did not learn of his fate until the following August , when a letter arrived from Manuel Moreno . She requested a widow 's pension from the First Triumvirate , which was in power by then ; its value was thirty pesos .

 Mariano Moreno studied French and Spanish authors of the Age of Enlightenment during his studies at Chuquisaca . Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau 's The Social Contract was a main influence ; he translated this work to Spanish and used it to justify the actions of the Primera Junta . Contemporary people as Ignacio Núñez and Tomás de Anchorena acknowledged him as the translator . However , as the main page said that the work was " reprinted in Buenos Ayres " , some historians doubt whether it was actually Moreno 's work . Vicente Fidel López claimed that Moreno reprinted the translation made by the Spaniard Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos , but the two translations differ . Paul Groussac thought it was a reprint of an Asturian translation , and Ricardo Levene said that Moreno was not the translator , but neither gave any indication as to who they thought had completed it . Enrique de Gandía considers that the comments of contemporary people and the lack of an earlier similar translation of Rousseau 's work allow us to conclude that Moreno must have been the translator , at least until an earlier translation is found . 
 Despite his interest in French authors , Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado . He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage , and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books . In line with the Spanish Enlightenment , Moreno kept strong religious beliefs . He removed the chapter from Rousseau 's work that is critical of religion , and never became a freemason . He gave up his religious studies to study law and get married , but never actually became a priest , so there was no defrocking . He studied with priests such as Terrazas , who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation .

 The canonical image of Mariano Moreno is the one from the portrait Mariano Moreno en su mesa de <unk> ( Spanish : Mariano Moreno at his work desk ) . It was done by the Chilean artist Pedro Subercaseaux during the centennial of the May Revolution in 1910 . The historian Adolfo Carranza asked him to design various allegorical pictures of the event . Carranza belonged to the mainstream line of historians who professed great admiration for Moreno , who he described as follows : " He was the soul of the government of the revolution of May , his nerve , the distinguished statesman of the group managing the ship attacked the absolutism and doubt , anxious to reach the goal of his aspirations and his destiny . Moreno was the compass and that also grabbed the helm , as he was the strongest and the ablest of those who came to direct it " . He asked for a picture that was consistent with this image . The portrait depicts him as a friendly man with an open and round face , a wide forehead , and a serene look . Subsequent interpretations , like those of Antonio Estrada , would follow this style , as would portraits of other members of the Junta . However , as this portrait was made a hundred years after the death of the subject , with no known depictions done during his lifetime , it was thus based on the artist 's imagination . It was known that Moreno had clearly visible smallpox scars from the age of eight , but not to the point where they disfigured his face . 
 Later a portrait of Moreno was discovered that had been done from life , by the Peruvian silversmith Juan de Dios Rivera . This portrait was painted between 1808 or 1809 , before Moreno 's appointment as secretary of the Junta . It is now considered to be the closest representation of Moreno 's real appearance . In this portrait , he is depicted with an elongated face , abundant hair , long sideburns , big eyes , and a pointy nose . 
 = Kinky Boots ( musical ) = 
 Kinky Boots is a Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Tony , Emmy and Grammy @-@ winner Cyndi Lauper and a book by Tony @-@ winner Harvey Fierstein . Based on the 2005 film Kinky Boots by Geoff Deane and Tim Firth , which was inspired by true events , the musical tells the story of Charlie Price , who inherits a shoe factory from his father . To save the business , Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and drag queen , Lola . With Lola 's help , Charlie develops a plan to produce a line of high @-@ heeled boots . In the process , he and Lola discover that they are not so different after all . 
 Following the show 's conception in 2006 , the creative team was assembled by 2010 . The original production of Kinky Boots premiered at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago in October 2012 , with both direction and choreography by Jerry Mitchell , and starring Stark Sands and Billy Porter as Charlie and Lola , respectively . It made its Broadway debut at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on April 4 , 2013 following previews that began on March 3 , 2013 . The musical began its US tour in 2014 . 
 Having been less well received by theatre critics and at the box office , initially , than another 2013 Broadway production , Matilda the Musical , Kinky Boots entered the 2013 awards season as an underdog . However , less than a month after opening , Kinky Boots surpassed this rival with audiences in weekly box office gross and later enjoyed a post @-@ Tony boost in advance sales . The production earned a season @-@ high 13 nominations and 6 Tony wins , including Best Musical and Best Score for Lauper in her first outing as a Broadway songwriter , making her the first woman to win alone in that category . The musical 's cast album premiered at number one on the Billboard Cast Albums Chart and number fifty @-@ one on the Billboard 200 chart . In 2016 , it won three Laurence Olivier Awards , including Best New Musical . 
 = = Background and creation = = 
 Kinky Boots is based on the 2005 British film of the same name , which was , in turn , inspired by a 1999 episode of the BBC2 documentary television series Trouble at the Top . It followed the true story of Steve Pateman , who was struggling to save his family @-@ run shoe factory from closure and decided to produce fetish footwear for men , under the brand name " Divine Footwear " . Daryl Roth , a Tony Award @-@ winning producer , saw the film at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and fell in love with its " heart and soul " . She felt that its themes resonated and thought that the story had potential as source material for a musical . Independently , Hal Luftig saw the film in London and agreed " that its heart and humanity ( and bigger @-@ than @-@ life leading ' lady ' ) would translate well to musical theatre . " Within a year , Roth secured the rights to adapt the film to the stage and partnered with Luftig , a Tony and Olivier Award @-@ winning producer . 
 By mid @-@ 2008 , Roth and Luftig were in discussions with a potential director , Jerry Mitchell , but they still had not found writers . When Roth sent Mitchell the DVD of the film , he was enthusiastic about it . Roth and Luftig hired Mitchell to direct and Harvey Fierstein to write the book . Mitchell knew that Fierstein and Cyndi Lauper were friends , and he thought they would make a good team to create the musical . Fierstein agreed and eventually approached Lauper to write the songs because he " saw in the adaptation an opportunity to work with someone with a big musical range , ' somebody who could write club music , ' ... along with show tunes . " Lauper joined the creative team in June 2010 . Lauper 's last project before Kinky Boots had been the album Memphis Blues , while Fierstein was working on Newsies when he began Kinky Boots . The work marked Lauper 's debut as a musical theatre songwriter , although she had some theatrical experience , having performed on Broadway in the 2006 Roundabout Theatre Company production of The Threepenny Opera . Among Fierstein 's prior experiences were works about drag queens : La Cage aux Folles and Torch Song Trilogy . Lauper has said that she identifies with drag queens . 
 Fierstein and Lauper had both gained previous critical acclaim and honors in their respective fields . Fierstein had won four Tonys : acting and writing awards for Torch Song Trilogy , an acting Tony for Hairspray , and one for writing the book of La Cage ; Lauper is a chart @-@ topping singer @-@ songwriter and actress who had won Grammy , Emmy and many other awards for her songs and performances . Fierstein noted a change in focus between the film " about the saving of a factory " and the musical , which include " drag queens singing as they pass along the assembly line . " He said the main difference is that the musical is , " at its core , about two young men who come from seemingly opposite worlds who figure out that they have a lot in common , beginning with the need to stand up to their dads . " Lauper 's inspirations ranged from listening as a child to her parents ' recordings of South Pacific and West Side Story , as well as musical inspirations as diverse as Aaron Copland 's " Appalachian Spring " and pop singer Lana Del Rey . In a broadcast interview with Patrick Healy of The New York Times , Lauper and Fierstein said that , in adapting the film , they stressed themes of community and the universality of the father @-@ son bond as vehicles to explore the issues of tolerance and self @-@ acceptance . 
 Kinky Boots was given a reading on October 6 , 2011 . Lauper was actively engaged in refining the material once the cast began readings . In January 2012 , Roth announced that the show would be workshopped that month , and that Stark Sands and Billy Porter had been cast in the starring roles . In August 2012 , the producers announced the Broadway opening date of April 4 , 2013 .

 Charlie Price grows up as the fourth @-@ generation " son " in his family business , Price & Son , a shoe factory in Northampton . Another young boy , growing up in London , is as fascinated by shoes as Charlie is bored by them , but in this case it is a pair of red women 's heels that have attracted his attention , aggravating his strict father . Years pass . Charlie 's father is aging and hopes that Charlie will take over the factory , but Charlie is eager to move to London with his status @-@ conscious fiancée , Nicola , and pursue a career in real estate ( " The Most Beautiful Thing " ) . 
 Charlie has barely made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly . Charlie hurries home for the funeral , where he finds the factory near bankruptcy . The factory makes good quality men 's shoes , but they are not stylish and not cheap , and the market for them is drying up . Charlie is determined to save the factory and his father 's legacy , though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself . The workers , many of whom have known Charlie his entire life , do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place , and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management . 
 Returning to London , Charlie meets his friend and fellow shoe salesman Harry , in a pub , to ask for help with the factory . Harry can only offer a temporary solution and advises Charlie not to fight the inevitable ( " Take What You Got " ) . Leaving the pub , Charlie witnesses a woman being accosted by two drunks . He intervenes and is knocked unconscious . He comes to in a seedy nightclub , where the woman he attempted to rescue is revealed to have been the club 's drag @-@ queen headliner , Lola , who performs with her backup troupe of drag dancers , the " angels " ( " Land of Lola " ) . Recuperating from his ordeal in Lola 's dressing room , an uncomfortable Charlie notices that the performers ' high @-@ heeled boots are not designed to hold a man 's weight , but Lola explains that the expensive and unreliable footwear is an essential part of any drag act . 
 Charlie returns to the factory and begins reluctantly laying off his workers . Lauren , one of the women on the assembly line , explodes at Charlie when given her notice , and stubbornly tells him that other struggling shoe factories have survived by entering an " underserved niche market " . This gives Charlie an idea ( " Land of Lola " reprise ) , and he invites Lola to come to the factory to help him design a women 's boot that can be comfortable for a man ( " Charlie 's Soliloquy " / " Step One " ) . 
 Lola and the angels arrive at the factory , and she is immediately unsatisfied with Charlie 's first design of the boot . Quickly getting the women of the factory on her side , she draws a quick design of a boot , explaining the most important factor is by far the sex appeal ( " The Sex is in the Heel " ) . George , the factory manager , realizes a way to make her design practical , and an impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks ' time , to design a new line of " kinky boots " that could save the factory . Lola is reluctant , since she is already receiving crass comments from some of the factory workers , but is flattered by Charlie 's praise , and finally agrees . 
 Charlie announces that the factory will be moving ahead with production on the boots . He thanks Lauren for giving him the idea , and offers her a promotion . She accepts , and is horrified but thrilled to realize she is falling for him ( " The History of Wrong Guys " ) . 
 The next day , Lola shows up in men 's clothes and is mocked by the foreman , Don , and his friends . An upset Lola takes refuge in the bathroom , and Charlie attempts to comfort her . Lola explains that her father trained her as a boxer , but disowned her when she showed up for a match in drag . The two discover their similarly complex feelings toward their fathers , and Lola introduces herself by her birth name : Simon ( " Not My Father 's Son " ) . 
 Nicola arrives from London , and presents Charlie with a plan for the factory that her boss has drawn up : closing it and converting it into condominiums . Charlie refuses , but is shocked to discover that his father had agreed to this plan before he died , presumably because Charlie was not there to run it . He refuses to sell , and soon the workers are celebrating as the first pair of " kinky boots " is finished ( " Everybody Say Yeah " ) . 
 = = = Act II = = = 
 Many of the factory workers are not enthusiastic about the radical change in their product line . Some of them , especially the intimidating Don , make Lola feel very unwelcome . Lola taunts him back , enlisting the help of the female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman 's ideal man than Don ( " What a Woman Wants " ) . Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better " man " : Lola will do any one thing that Don specifies if Don will do one thing that Lola specifies . Don 's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub . Charlie , remembering Lola 's background , is horrified . Lola easily scores against Don in the ring but ultimately lets Don win the match ( " In This Corner " ) . Afterwards , in private , Don asks why she let him win , and Lola replies that she could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates . She gives him her part of the challenge : " accept someone for who they are . " 
 Charlie is pouring his own money into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan , and he is getting frantic that the product is not right , angrily forcing his staff to redo what he considers to be shoddy work . Nicola arrives , fed up with Charlie 's obsession over the factory , and breaks up with him . Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie . When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models , an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her , humiliating her in front of the other workers . Lola storms out , and the factory workers go home . Alone , Charlie struggles with the weight of his father 's legacy and what it means to be his own man ( " Soul of a Man " ) . 
 Lauren finds Charlie and tells him to come back to the factory . It is revealed that Don has persuaded all the workers to return to work and to sacrifice a week 's pay to ensure the boots can be finished in time for Milan . Charlie is astonished and grateful , and asks if Don has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola . Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself . 
 As he heads to the airport for Milan , Charlie leaves a heartfelt apology on Lola 's voicemail . Meanwhile , Lola performs her act at a nursing home in her home town . After she leaves the stage , she speaks to her now wheelchair @-@ bound father , who is dying in the home , and reaches a sense of closure ( " Hold Me in Your Heart " ) . 
 Charlie and Lauren arrive in Milan , but without models Charlie is forced to walk the runway himself . Lauren is thrilled by his dedication ( " The History of Wrong Guys ( Reprise ) " ) but the show threatens to be a disaster . Just as all seems lost , Lola and her angels arrive to save the day . Lauren and Charlie share their first kiss , and the whole company celebrates the success of the " Kinky Boots " ( " Raise You Up / Just Be " ) .

 In Lauper 's first effort at writing for the stage , she found that it required a sustained effort to write songs for the different characters . Lauper joked about the difficulty of writing her first score : " How much of a stretch is it for me to write songs about fashion , funny relationships , people changing their minds and shoes ? " The first song that Lauper wrote was the opening number , which included a wide range of voices . Her process was to conceive a song and sing it into her iPhone , and orchestrator Stephen Oremus would write it down . Oremus would then " ' blow up ' the vocal line into harmonies , create the incidental music that linked scenes and songs " and orchestrate the material . The songs range in style " from pop to funk to new wave to tango , with highly personal lyrics " . New York Times critic Melena Ryzik wrote : " Though there are plenty of hooky , rousing numbers , the emotional heart of Kinky Boots is several ballads about the weight of parental expectations . " The musical uses a twelve @-@ piece orchestra consisting of keyboards , percussion , bass , guitars , reeds , violin , viola , cello , trumpet , and trombone .

 On February 6 , 2012 , the Chicago Tribune reported that Kinky Boots ' producers were considering taking advantage of an incentive program from the State of Illinois for out @-@ of @-@ town tryouts for Broadway shows . The October 2012 pre @-@ Broadway Chicago tryout was announced on February 22 , 2012 . On June 28 , 2012 the full Chicago cast was announced . The production was rehearsed at the New 42nd Street Studios in New York City in September 2012 . The show began its pre @-@ Broadway run at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago , on October 2 , 2012 , which continued until November 4 , 2012 . The show was directed and choreographed by Mitchell ; scenic design was by David Rockwell , costumes by Gregg Barnes , lighting by Kenneth Posner and sound by John Shivers . The music director and orchestrator was Stephen Oremus . The director and design team had gained previous critical acclaim and theatre or music awards . Mitchell had won a Tony Award for choreographing the 2005 revival of La Cage aux Folles ; Barnes and Posner had won Tonys ; and Rockwell had been nominated for Tonys and other theatre awards . 
 Mitchell and Rockwell had previously collaborated on Hairspray , Catch Me If You Can and Legally Blonde . Mitchell told The New York Times that the " Everybody Say Yeah " scene , in which the cast celebrates the creation of the first pair of Kinky Boots with a choreographed celebration on conveyor belts , required repeated innovations and adjustments like the eventual addition of safety rails and actor controls for the apparatus . Designer Derek McLane commented that it is not uncommon for repeat choreographer / set designer collaborations to result in intriguing innovation like the conveyor belt dance scene in Kinky Boots . McLane was impressed with the " series of conveyor belts that came apart , moved around , and fit the context of the story " in order to accentuate the choreography of " a troupe of men in four @-@ inch heels " . With respect to the conveyor belts , he said , " They 've never been used as dynamically as this , creating a series of surprises , with the kind of wild athleticism that actually looks dangerous . It 's one of the more thrilling combinations of stage design and choreography that I can recall . " 
 After the tryout , the team went back to work , adding a new musical number for Charlie and a second song in the drag club , removing another song , and revising the book . The Broadway debut started previews on March 3 , 2013 at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre , with the official opening on April 4 , 2013 . Both the Chicago and original Broadway casts starred Billy Porter as Lola , Stark Sands as Charlie and Annaleigh Ashford as Lauren . Porter , in particular , was singled out for critical praise . 
 The New York Times noted that in the 2012 – 13 season , most of the new Broadway musicals were " inspired by movies or books " . The paper found the show timely for its treatment of problems that paralleled those at the time of its production , including " chronic unemployment , financial distress and the collapse of manufacturing " . Prior to the June 9 , 2013 Tony Awards , Kinky Boots had trailed its box office competitor , Matilda the Musical , in advance sales . However , less than a month after opening , Kinky Boots surpassed this rival in weekly box office gross . Kinky Boots won a season @-@ high six Tony Awards , including Best Musical . The next day , the show sold $ 1 @.@ 25 million tickets , and its advance ticket sales for future dates became a hot commodity . In the weeks following its Tony wins , the show became so popular that in the beginning of July a special ticket lottery system was created to keep fans from camping outside the theatre . Kinky Boots set a new box @-@ office record at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre , and " recouped its $ 13 @.@ 5 million capitalization in a relatively quick 30 weeks of performances " , which was " faster than any big budget musical in recent history . " In October 2013 , Kinky Boots had the second highest premium @-@ price tickets on Broadway behind only The Book of Mormon . As of 4 February 2015 , the show had grossed just over $ 135 million . 
 On November 28 , 2013 , members of the cast performed the finale of the show in the nationally televised Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Many viewers commented that , in their opinion , the performance was inappropriate for a family program . Fierstein responded that the show 's inclusion in the parade reflected decreasing prejudice and increased tolerance for LGBT people in society . The August 26 , 2015 performance marked the 1000th Broadway performance for the production .

 Initially planned to run from June to September 2015 at the Royal Alexandra Theatre , with a mostly Canadian cast , by the beginning of July , the run was extended to November .

 In January 2014 , it was revealed Mitchell was planning a West End production and was negotiating to secure a theatre for 2015 .

Tickets went on sale on 2 March . On 23 April 2015 , it was confirmed that Killian Donnelly and Matt Henry would play Charlie and Lola respectively , with other cast members including Amy Lennox as Lauren , Amy Ross as Nicola , Jamie <unk> as Don and Michael Hobbs as George . The West End production became London 's first paperless and mobile ticketing operation . Although the show is set in a British Northampton neighborhood , it took a concerted effort to remove Americanisms from the production after its West End spinoff from the Broadway production . In August 2015 , booking was extended to February 6 , 2016 . In October 2015 , booking was extended to May 28 , 2016 . Booking was extended to September 24 , 2016 in January 2016 .

 Upon its October 2012 Chicago opening , Chicago Tribune critic Chris Jones described the show as a " warm , likable , brassy , sentimental , big @-@ hearted and modestly scaled " production . Another reviewer praised the score , book , direction and , particularly , Porter , before suggesting that , before opening on Broadway , it could use a more effective opening number , better pacing in Act 2 and " the budding romance between Charlie and coworker Lauren ... needs more lead @-@ in . In other words , give Ashford , a clear crowd favorite , more to do " . 
 The musical 's Broadway debut received mixed to positive reviews . The show was awarded a " Critic 's Pick " designation by The New York Times , Time Out New York and New York Magazine , and was included in Entertainment Weekly magazine 's " Must See " list . 
 Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave a warm review , calling it " inspired " and comparing the work to other successful recent Broadway musicals : " Like The Full Monty ( choreographed by Mr. Mitchell ) and Billy Elliot the Musical , it is set in a hard @-@ times British factory town , where jobs are in jeopardy and spirits need lifting . Like La Cage aux Folles and Priscilla Queen of the Desert , it presents drag queens as the show ’ s official spirit lifters . And like Hairspray , the musical this production most resembles in tone , Kinky Boots is about finding your passion , overcoming prejudice and transcending stereotypes . " Brantley wrote that Lauper 's " <unk> and heat @-@ seeking score " wowed with her " trademark ... mix of sentimentality and eccentricity " , and that the costumes and boots courtesy of Gregg Barnes made for " big red scene stealers " . He also praised “ Raise You Up / Just Be , ” as " one of the best curtain numbers since ' You Can ’ t Stop the Beat ' sent Hairspray audiences dancing out of the theater . ” Brantley , however , did not extend his praise to Fierstein 's script , writing that his " sticky , sermonizing side " comes through in the second half , where " all the clichés stand naked before you . " 
 The theatre critic for Time Out New York called the show " the very model of a modern major musical . " The Associated Press termed it " a big ol ’ sweet love story about sons , the families we make and red patent leather . ... Thank goodness for Harvey Fierstein – he spins theatrical magic " , but noted that " the second half is almost completely unnecessary , the English accents are laughable and the footwear puns are relentless . " Entertainment Weekly said " Cyndi Lauper 's infectious score is cause for celebration . " New York Magazine , The New York Post , The Washington Post and Variety all gave mostly favorable reviews . 
 Los Angeles Times theater critic Charles McNulty criticized Lauper 's " novice mistakes " with a score that " never establishes a compositional through line " and saying that while " Fierstein 's heart is in the right place ... the show 's earnestness sinks it " , adding that " if [ the show ] weren 't such a cheesy commercial mess , it might actually be fun " . Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News wrote that while the " script has issues like a pair of shoes " that don 't quite fit , " Mitchell 's production moves lickety @-@ split " and " Porter ... is a force of nature as Lola . " But , he added , Lauper 's " multicolored , surprising and fun " score outshines the fancy footwear and proves to be the " real star of this show " . Writing for The Guardian , David Cote noted that the decision to use American actors for an adaptation that maintained the Northampton setting resulted in a disconcerting inconsistency in terms of accents . The Wall Street Journal gave the show a negative review , calling it " an imitation heart @-@ warming British working @-@ class musical with a gay angle and a maudlin ending . ... Kinky Boots is its own spoiler alert , the kind of musical in which you recite the dialogue a half @-@ beat ahead of the actors . ... [ the score ] sounds like ... " Cyndi : The <unk> Forgotten Late- ' 80s B @-@ Sides . " A review in The Bergen Record said that the show " sorely lacks is a dramatic commitment to what it 's doing . Which is why a show that seems to make few false steps is so relentlessly tedious , " calling it " dull " and " synthetic " . Talkin ' Broadway also gave the show a negative review . The Village Voice , AM New York , and NBC turned in lukewarm reviews . 
 In 2014 , Kinky Boots began a United States national tour , which has also garnered mostly positive reviews . Democrat and Chronicle raved , “ Flashy , funny and uplifting , Kinky Boots has appeal — and lots of it — for all ‘ ladies , gentleman and those who are yet to make up their mind . ’ ” <unk> Los Angeles offered “ praise to the entire triple threat ensemble ! “ The Republic countered , “ Despite the fiery showstopper " Sex Is in the Heel , " however , " Kinky Boots " is surprisingly short on sex appeal , and the <unk> troupe of drag queens called Angels don 't have any of the transgressive appeal of the <unk> from Fierstein 's earlier hit " La Cage aux Folles .

 Matilda had been the pre @-@ Award season favorite , but as the season progressed , it became clear that Kinky Boots and the revival of Pippin would provide serious competition . Early in the 2013 awards season , Kinky Boots did well , receiving Drama League Award nominations for Distinguished Production of a Musical and Distinguished Performance , for both Porter and Sands , and winning for Distinguished Production . The show received nine Outer Critics Circle Award nominations , winning three , including Outstanding New Broadway Musical , Outstanding New Score and Outstanding Actor in a Musical ( Porter ) . The musical received only two Drama Desk Award nominations , however , and only one win : Porter for Outstanding Actor in a Musical . New York Times theatre writer Patrick Healy , however , reported that some Tony voters found Matilda " dark " and " a bit chilly " , and accurately predicted that " while the cleverness of Matilda may be enough to win best book , the warmth of Kinky Boots will be enough to score an upset and take the top Tony for best musical . " 
 Kinky Boots received a season @-@ high 13 Tony Award nominations . Matilda , which The New York Times described as the " unalloyed critical hit " of the season , received 12 nominations , 11 of them in the same categories as Kinky Boots . In addition to its critical success , Matilda had won the Drama Desk Award for outstanding musical and had set a record by winning the most Olivier Awards in history . Nevertheless , Kinky Boots won a season @-@ high six Tonys , including Best Musical , which the press described as an upset , and Lauper 's win for Best Score made her the first woman to win alone in that category . The creative team are Americans , and reviewer David Cote , an American writing in The Guardian , judged that the show 's win was a case of " the balance of love going to a homegrown American musical , Kinky Boots , over the British import Matilda . " The other Tony wins were for best actor ( Porter ) , sound design ( Shivers ) , choreography ( Mitchell ) and orchestrations ( Oremus ) . Fierstein , Sands , Ashford , Mitchell ( as director ) and the three other designers were all nominated but did not win . Kinky Boots also won the 2013 Artios Award for Outstanding Achievement in Casting in the Broadway musical category . 
 The West End production won the Evening Standard Radio 2 Audience Award for Best New Musical , which was based on voting by the public at the 2015 Evening Standard Theatre Awards . The show earned seven nominations for the 2016 Laurence Olivier Awards , which was second to a revival of Gypsy , which earned eight nominations .

 = Ramblin ' Wreck = 
 The Ramblin ' Wreck from Georgia Tech is the 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe that serves as the official mascot of the student body at the Georgia Institute of Technology . The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions . Its most noticeable role is leading the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field , a duty which the Wreck has performed since 1961 . The Ramblin ' Wreck is mechanically and financially maintained on campus by students in Ramblin ' Reck Club . 
 The first mechanical Wreck was a 1914 Ford Model T owned by Dean Floyd Field . Until the current Wreck was donated to the school in 1961 , most of the early Ramblin ' Wrecks were owned by students , faculty or alumni . The modern Wreck has donned a number of different paint jobs and has had several restorations and modifications made to it . These changes were made by various individuals and organizations over the years , including Bobby Dodd and a Georgia Tech Alum at the Ford plant in Hapeville , Georgia . The upkeep of the Wreck has been the sole responsibility of Ramblin ' Reck Club and the Wreck driver since 1987 . 
 The Ramblin ' Wreck has been the target of several pranks perpetrated by rival schools ; the University of Tennessee once provided the Wreck with an unsolicited new paint job , and the University of Georgia has stolen the Wreck on at least two occasions . Several replica or " false " Wrecks are owned by alumni , or are used for display and do not run . The official Ramblin ' Wreck is considered the only " true " Wreck , and no backups or replacements exist . 
 = = History = = 
 The term " Ramblin ' Wreck " has been used to refer to students and alumni of Georgia Tech much longer than the car that now bears the name has been in existence . The expression has its origins in the late 19th century and was used originally to refer to the makeshift motorized vehicles constructed by Georgia Tech engineers employed in projects in the jungles of Central America . The Wrecks were constructed from whatever the engineers could find — mostly old tractor and automotive parts — and were kept running by the engineers ' ingenuity and creativity . Other workers in the area began to refer to these vehicles and the men who drove them as " Rambling Wrecks from Georgia Tech . " 
 The first " mechanical mascot " at Georgia Tech was a 1914 Ford Model T owned by Dean Floyd Field . Field drove the car to and from class every day from 1916 until 1928 . Field cared so much for the car that he even nicknamed it " Nellie " . The vehicle was distinguished by its metallic black paint job and a large black box fastened to the rear end by a buggy wheel hoop . The black box 's contents were never revealed to the student body and the box became part of the mystique of the Old Ford . 
 The student body initially nicknamed the vehicle " Floyd 's <unk> " but eventually began to call the car the " Ramblin ' ' Reck . " The first mention of Field 's Ford as a Ramblin ' ' Reck was in 1926 when he performed an overhaul of the car 's motor , body , and paint job with the help of the campus machine shop . 
 Dean Field found a love for travel with his Model T. He took it all the way to California for seminars on mathematics and education . However , in 1927 rumors began to abound campus that Field was going to buy a Model A. Field quelled the rumors with a personal interview in the last issue of the 1927 Technique . By September 1928 , Field felt he could not travel as much with the dilapidated Model T. To the dismay of the student body the vehicle was discarded by Dean Field in 1928 and a Model A was purchased . Field 's Model A lasted until 1934 in which he bought a Ford V8 . He would drive over 122 @,@ 000 miles ( 196 @,@ 300 km ) in all three cars during his Georgia Tech tenure of 1900 – 1945 . 
 In memoriam to his retired " Tin Lizzie " , Dean Field started " an Old Ford Race " from the intersection of North Avenue and Techwood Drive in Atlanta to the intersection of Hills Street and Prince Avenue in Athens . The race was sponsored by the Technique , which nicknamed the event the " Flying <unk> Race . " The finish line was facilitated by the University of Georgia student newspaper The Red and Black . The only rule of the race was that the car had to be a pre @-@ 1926 4 @-@ cylinder motor car . The fastest time in the race was achieved by an Essex which completed the 79 @-@ mile ( 126 km ) race in 1 hour and 26 minutes or 55 mph ( 88 km / h ) . 
 The Tech administration disliked the perilous race and reduced the race to a more peaceful and regulated parade of contraptions known as the Ramblin ' Wreck Parade after races were completed in 1929 and 1930 . The Yellow Jacket Club facilitated the first official Ramblin ' Wreck parade in 1932 . The only break in the parade 's continuous operation occurred with the onset of World War II . There were no parades from 1942 – 1943 and when the parade did continue in 1944 , all wrecks had to be human powered . In 1946 , the Ramblin ' Wreck Parade was allowed to operate combustion engines again . The rules instituted in the 1946 Wreck Parade still remain as the parade has become the featured event for all Tech <unk> .

 Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin ' Wreck when he observed the student body 's fascination with classic cars . Fraternities , in particular , would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm . It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken down vehicle . 
 In 1960 , Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute . He specifically wanted a classic pre @-@ war Ford . Dull 's search would entail newspaper ads , radio commercials , and other means to locate this vehicle . The search took him throughout the state and country , but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 . Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory . The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson , Atlanta 's chief Delta Air Lines pilot . 
 Johnson had purchased the car from a junkyard in 1956 . Johnson and his son , Craig , would restore the car as a father @-@ son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy . The two spent two years and over $ 1 @,@ 800 restoring the vehicle . Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources to refurbish the rusty hulk . He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas , Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring . After Craig graduated from high school , he attended Florida State on a track scholarship . In 1960 , Craig 's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech . Johnson , wanting to see his son compete , took the Model A to Tech campus , parked it near Towers dormitory , and went to watch Craig compete . 
 When Johnson returned to his car , he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his windshield . Dull 's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech 's official mascot . Johnson , after great deliberation , agreed to take $ 1 @,@ 000 but would eventually return the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander @-@ Tharpe Fund . The Ramblin ' Wreck would be officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26 , 1961 . 
 The Ramblin ' Wreck was unveiled September 30 , 1961 at Grant Field in front of 43 @,@ 501 Tech fans as it led the team onto the field against Rice University . The team prevailed 24 – 0 and the Wreck became an instant success within the Tech family . The Wreck has since led the team onto the field for every home game . 
 = = = Bobby Dodd 's touch = = = 
 The current color scheme was selected in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd . The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield on both the driver and passenger @-@ side doors . This shield was removed during Dodd 's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme . He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door , a Tech helmet on the rear quarter panel , and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front quarter panel . According to Tech lore , Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin ' Wreck paint scheme . 
 The biggest structural change was a support system attached to the car 's frame . The support system runs the length of the running boards and allows the increased weight of cheerleaders or Reck Club members standing on the runningboards . 
 From 1973 to 1987 , 1947 IE alum Pete George maintained the Ramblin ' Wreck at the Hapeville Ford Plant . George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors as well as a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech 's 1985 centennial celebration . The car was completely disassembled , rebuilt , and repainted by late 1982 . 
 = = = Centennial Celebration changes = = = 
 There were a few noticeable changes to the Ramblin ' Wreck after the 1982 refurbishment . An aftermarket chrome stone guard was added to protect the grill , The emblems on the side were removed and replaced by a basic GT decal on the doors . The 1952 Yellow Jackets were moved to the front tire wells . The white horn was chromed over . The old tire cover was a shield with a football helmet wearing yellow jacket . This was replaced with a white generic <unk> Ford tire cover . The Old Model A tires and brakes were replaced with Model B whitewall tires and modified brakes . 
 The Wreck experienced a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration . Since Reck Club had financially maintained the vehicle for so long and Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association , the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987 . The transaction further solidified Reck Club 's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot . The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon . 
 After Pete George 's retirement in 1987 , the upkeep of the Wreck fell directly upon the shoulders of the Wreck Drivers and Reck Club . In 1994 , the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club . Since then , the Wreck has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages . The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George 's initial full rebuild . 
 After 1994 , Reck Club restored the wheels and brakes to original Model A specifications . Reck Club performed a major off body restoration in the Spring of 2000 that saw the car repainted and the motor rebuilt . Pete George , although several years retired , aided Reck Club in its restoration providing funding and labor to the 2000 restoration . After the restoration , a small modification replaced the electrical generator with a more efficient Nu @-@ Rex alternator . In 2007 , Reck Club coordinated their second major restoration following a <unk> accident that severely damaged the body and top of the Ramblin ' Wreck .

 The Ramblin ' Wreck has led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Grant Field almost 300 games . It also makes appearances for other Georgia Tech sports teams : it is often seen before big basketball games at Hank McCamish Pavilion , occasionally parked outside of Russ Chandler Stadium during warm weekend baseball series , and has attended several softball games a year at the new mid @-@ campus stadium . 
 A symbol of the Institute 's academic and collegiate tradition , the old Model A is often dispatched to special events on campus . It is always present when new buildings are opened or dedicated . On December 5 , 2006 , the Wreck became the first car to drive across the new Fifth Street Bridge . 
 Every spring , the Institute holds a ceremony , known as When the Whistle Blows , to honor students , staff , and faculty who died during the previous year . The Georgia Tech Whistle is blown once for each person who died , and once more to salute Georgia Tech alumni and friends who may also have died . A procession of the military escort , led by the Ramblin ' Wreck , leads up to the ceremony , during which the Wreck is parked next to the speaker 's stage . 
 During Tech Homecoming , the Ramblin ' Wreck has several duties . Several days before Homecoming , it acts as a giant gold starter pistol for the Mini 500 tricycle race . The Wreck 's next task is to lead the racers out of the starting line in the Freshman Cake Race . On the day of the Homecoming football game , the Wreck leads the Ramblin ' Wreck Parade , then leads the football team onto the field . 
 The car is also present at every Freshman Orientation ( FASET ) , Earth Day festival , and other campuswide events . 
 A ride in the Wreck serves as a gift to many retiring faculty and staff ; a ride onto Grant Field is one of the greatest honors Georgia Tech can bestow . Kim King , for example , received this honor on October 2 , 2004 during halftime of the Miami game . 
 = = Wreck traditions and specifications = = 
 There are several lesser known details about the Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive . Specific physical details and the actual person behind the wheel are often missed or overlooked . The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin ' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers . There is no official source of funding from the Institute , Athletic Association , or Alumni Association . This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots . 
 When a freshman first reaches campus for FASET ( orientation ) , one of the many traditions that they are introduced to is that freshmen cannot touch the Wreck until the completion of their first year . This rule originated in the 1963 edition of the RAT Rules . If a freshman touches the Wreck between convocation and the last day of classes in the Spring , they will receive bad luck throughout their college career and GT will be cursed to lose to UGA in football that year . 
 The Wreck is distinguished by its old gold body and white soft top . The soft top has a chrome support strut , which features a brass classic Tech T and 1952 yellow jacket . The body also has two solid white runningboards , which run the length of the vehicle . The running boards support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride . The interior upholstery is solid white vinyl . The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it . There are two golden nylon pennants emblazoned with the words " To Hell With Georgia " and " Give ' Em Hell Tech " fastened to the front bumper . 
 = = = Driver = = = 
 The Driver of the Ramblin ' Wreck is an elected position within Ramblin ' Reck Club . This position is determined after every football season . The driver manages the car 's public appearances and maintenance . There have only been 46 drivers of the Wreck , making the position of Wreck driver one of the most prestigious positions in all of Georgia Tech 's student organizations . 
 The driver gets to add their own personal touch every year to the Wreck . The front license plate is chosen by the driver every year and the radiator cap is replaced yearly as well . The cap is typically a flying quail or a wreath . After each driver 's term , the driver gets to keep the two pennants as well . 
 Dean Dull initiated a group known as the Ramblin ' Reck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot . When the Wreck was found in 1961 , the Ramblin ' Reck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree . Rountree would drive the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers . He was also the first person to drive the Ramblin ' Wreck onto Grant Field . Don Gentry , the president of Reck Club in 1961 , was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson 's home . The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964 – 1967 . During this period , Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck , upholding traditions , and generating school spirit . There have been three female drivers of the Ramblin ' Wreck in its history . Lisa <unk> , an industrial engineering major , was elected the driver in 1984 and she was the first female driver after 23 consecutive years of male @-@ only drivers .

 The name can be spelled either Ramblin ' Wreck or Ramblin ' Reck . In all spellings , there is no g in Ramblin ' . The first references to the 1930 Model A ( 1961 ) spelled the word Reck while the first references to the 1914 Model T owned by Dean Field spelled the word ' Reck ( 1925 ) . Ramblin ' Reck Club has spelled the word Reck since their 1945 club charter . The Institute has adopted the spelling Ramblin ' Wreck and holds a trademark on the phrase . Reck Club still refers to the Ramblin ' Wreck as the Ramblin ' Reck while most other agencies refer to it as the Ramblin ' Wreck . 
 = = Travelin ' Wreck = = 
 In its history , the Wreck has appeared at a number of away games and other events away from the Georgia Tech campus . Many of these trips resulted in damage to the Wreck or other interesting anecdotes . 
 The first away game for the Ramblin ' Wreck was the 1961 game against the Alabama Crimson Tide . The Wreck was freighted by Southern Railway to Birmingham , Alabama . At the time , Alabama played its home games at Legion Field . Before the game the current driver Dekle Rountree decided to traverse the slope up to visit Birmingham 's Vulcan statue . The trip to Birmingham was such a success , a trip to Jacksonville for Tech 's Gator Bowl appearance against Penn State was organized as well . These would be the first road and bowl game appearances for the Wreck in its illustrious career . 
 In 1963 , the Ramblin ' Reck Committee and Ramblin ' Reck Club organized another road trip for the Wreck . This trip would take the Wreck up to Knoxville for a game against the Tennessee Volunteers . After Tech won the game , the Wreck was stored overnight in Neyland Stadium . Administrators and Tennessee 's Athletic Director Bob Woodruff promised Georgia Tech Athletics that the Wreck would be safe . They were wrong . Tennessee students broke into the storage area and painted the Wreck orange . They wrote " Go Vols " in the paint and covered the gold wheels with paint as well . After the incident , Georgia Tech sent a bill to Tennessee 's Athletic Department asking for restitution . It was believed that Woodruff had aided the students in their efforts after he openly contested the officiating of the football contest . 
 In 1976 , Tech students took the Wreck to Athens for the annual football game with UGA . After the game , the Wreck 's police escort abandoned the car . The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it . The Tech students responsible for the car 's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol . 
 The farthest trips the Ramblin ' Wreck has ever traveled from Atlanta were the 1970 Sun Bowl in El Paso , Texas and Denver , Colorado , in 1990 for Tech 's NCAA Final Four Appearance against UNLV . The Wreck was freighted by van 1 @,@ 400 miles ( 2 @,@ 250 km ) to Denver Coliseum . Along the way , a television crew documented the trip and broadcast the Wreck 's expedition during the Final Four promotions . 
 The last major <unk> for the Ramblin ' Wreck were to the 2004 Final Four in San Antonio , Texas , the 2006 ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville , Florida , and the 2009 ACC Championship Game in Tampa 's Raymond James Stadium . The Wreck led the Yellow Jacket football team onto Alltel Stadium 's field for Tech 's first appearance in the ACC Title game , as well as performing the same duty in their second appearance and first win in the ACC Championship Game in 2009 . The Wreck has also been to the Orange Bowl , Gator Bowl , All @-@ American Bowl , Sun Bowl , Peach Bowl , Citrus Bowl , and Champs Sports Bowl . 
 On June 15 , 2007 , the Wreck was involved in an accident while being towed to a wedding south of Atlanta in a covered car trailer . The trailer failed while carrying the Wreck , in turn causing the truck and trailer to run off the road and into the roadside ditch . The Wreck fell over inside the trailer , causing damage to its side and roof . Despite the severe body damage ( in excess of $ 30 @,@ 000 ) , the Wreck was repaired for the first game of the 2007 season against the Samford Bulldogs .

 The Ramblin ' Wreck has been featured in several newspapers , magazines , and books . The Ramblin ' Wreck is portrayed leading the Georgia Tech football team onto the field on the cover of Al <unk> 's 1973 work Ramblin ' Wreck - A Story of Georgia Tech Football . Pete George 's 1982 refurbishment was featured in the November 1983 edition of the Ford Times . The June 1986 edition of Cars & Parts Magazine featured the Ramblin ' Wreck and the raffle for the Centennial Wreck . The December 1991 Car Collector & Car Classics featured the Wreck on the cover after the National Championship season . The December 2007 <unk> Real White Pages for Greater Atlanta featured the Ramblin ' Wreck with censored flags . 
 The Ramblin ' Wreck has been featured numerous times in Tech 's student newspaper , The Technique , and Atlanta 's primary newspaper , the Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution . The Wreck has also been featured in The New York Times and the Associated Press . Local newspapers such as the Cherokee Times , Augusta Chronicle , and Gwinnett Daily Post have also printed articles about the Wreck . 
 In the week prior to the 2007 home opener , the Ramblin ' Wreck was featured on ESPN First Take . ESPN showed old clips of the Wreck leading the football team onto the field and discussed the possibility of the Wreck not making the football opener after 45 consecutive years of never missing a game . 
 The Ramblin ' Wreck was featured prominently on the October 18 , 2007 episode of Jim Cramer 's Mad Money . Cramer exited the Wreck 's passenger door to start the show and one of Cramer 's trademark <unk> was attached to the front bumper . 
 On April 16 , 2009 , a Georgia Tech student riding on the running board of the Ramblin ' Wreck fell and suffered severe head injuries hospitalizing the student for four days . Almost a year later , the student filed suit against Georgia Tech and an auto shop responsible for installing handles on the roof of the car . The lawsuit cites the failure of the auto shop 's handles as the reason for the fall and claims the University promoted the unsafe use of a vehicle by students . 
 The 2012 edition of EA Sports ' NCAA football video game featured the addition of the Ramblin ' Wreck leading Georgia Tech 's football team onto the field at all games played in Bobby Dodd Stadium . The Ramblin ' Wreck was included in the game alongside many other colleges ' pre @-@ game traditions to " deliver the pride and pageantry of game day " .

 There are several vehicles that claim " Ramblin ' Wreck status . " However , there is only one modern official Ramblin ' Wreck . There are no backups or equivalent vehicles . 
 The most famous of the fake Wrecks is a 1931 Ford Model A Cabriolet known as the Centennial Wreck . This vehicle was refurbished along with the real Wreck in 1985 . The vehicle followed the Ramblin ' Wreck onto the field all of the 1985 football season and was raffled for $ 250 @,@ 000 by Pete George and Georgia Tech in 1986 . 
 In 1988 , the Alumni Association purchased a 1931 Ford Model A Roadster and restored the vehicle again in 1994 . The Alumni Wreck is distinguished by its spare tire locations on the driver 's side and passenger 's side runningboards and the words " Georgia Tech Alumni Association " printed on the doors . It also has a convertible top . On the real Wreck , the spare is behind the rumble seat and the roof cannot be removed or lowered . 
 There is a 1930 Ford Model A Sports Coupe shell in the Georgia Tech Hotel . This car has not worked since it has been on campus . The motor is incomplete and the front end lacks the Wreck 's chrome stone guard . This is one of the few replicas that is almost identical in make , model , and paint scheme when compared to the real Ramblin ' Wreck . 
 There are also several alumni owned vehicles that are painted to resemble the Wreck . These vehicles mimic the look and feel of the Wreck but are not the Ramblin ' Wreck . One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988 . A father @-@ son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens . After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T , the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin ' Wreck had remained in Atlanta . 
 Several B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses and B @-@ 24 Liberators and at least one F4U Corsair were designated the name Ramblin ' Reck during service in World War II . 
 The Chicago Brewing Company features an amber ale by the name of Ramblin ' Reck Amber Ale . 
 = 1952 Kern County earthquake = 
 The 1952 Kern County earthquake occurred on July 21 in the southern San Joaquin Valley and measured 7 @.@ 3 on the moment magnitude scale . The main shock occurred at 4 : 52 am Pacific Daylight Time ( 11 : 52 UTC ) , killed 12 people and injured hundreds , and caused an estimated $ 60 million in property damage . A small sector of damage near <unk> corresponded to a maximum Mercalli intensity of XI ( Extreme ) , though this intensity rating was not representative of the majority of damage . The earthquake occurred on the White Wolf Fault near the community of Wheeler Ridge and was the strongest to occur in California since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake . 
 The town of Tehachapi suffered the greatest damage and loss of life from the earthquake , though other locations in Kern County experienced significant damage as well , but its effects were widely felt throughout central and southern California . The July mainshock had a significant aftershock sequence that persisted into July and August with many magnitude 5 + events with intensities of V ( Moderate ) to VII ( Very strong ) . Six of these aftershocks occurred on the day of the mainshock , but the strongest aftershock came on August 22 as a M5.8 event that had a maximum perceived intensity of VIII ( Severe ) and resulted in the deaths of two people and caused an additional $ 10 million in property damage . 
 Following the event , a field survey was conducted along the fault zone with the goal of estimating the peak ground acceleration of the shock based on visually evaluating precarious rock formations and other indicators . Ground disturbances that were created by the earthquakes were also surveyed , both in the valley and in the foothills , with both vertical and horizontal displacements present in the epicentral area . The strong motion records that were acquired from the event were significant , and a reconnaissance report was recognized for its coverage of the event , and how it set a standard for those types of engineering or scientific papers . Repercussions of the sequence of earthquakes were still being felt in the heavily damaged downtown area of Bakersfield well into the 1990s as city leaders attempted to improve safety of the surviving unreinforced masonry buildings . 
 = = Tectonic setting = = 
 At Lebec , California , just south of the epicenter of the July mainshock , the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault , which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert . The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections , and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges . The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River , and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault , but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset . The Owens Valley Fault , on the east side of the Sierran block , has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks . Other fault zones are present in the region , and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes , but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon , Owens Valley , and San Andreas Faults . 
 The 1952 earthquakes were the first to be observed well within Kern County lines . Other strong , but remote events were previously felt in the area , but they were distant enough to cause only occasional destructive effects . The county is bounded on the western side by the <unk> Range which is adjacent to the southern San Andreas Fault . Other large events have affected the area as well , like the January 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake that severely affected Fort Tejon ( about 15 miles ( 24 km ) south of Wheeler Ridge ) .

Historically , the left @-@ lateral fault has had a component of reverse slip , and at the time of the July mainshock the ratio of reverse / left @-@ lateral slip was about 1 @.@ 2 : 1 . The epicenter of the shock was at the 90 km ( 56 mi ) fault 's southwestern end , at a point where it may end , or merge with the east @-@ west trending <unk> thrust fault . The White Wolf Fault ( as illuminated by the aftershocks ) was found to be curved , with less dip on the northeast end , though that zone also had a higher strike @-@ slip component . Other distinct characteristics on that end of the fault were the shallower shocks and the less overall slip . If the total fault displacement came about as a result of the same type of large @-@ displacement shocks like the one in 1952 , the recurrence interval was proposed to be 170 – 450 years . The 1995 Working Group on California Earthquake Probabilities gave a ( high uncertainty ) slip rate estimate of 2 mm per year . 
 Mercalli intensities for the mainshock were gauged to be VIII ( Severe ) , especially in Tehachapi and close to the epicenter , but southeast of <unk> 46 cm ( 18 in ) thick reinforced concrete railroad tunnel walls were cracked , tracks were warped , and the gap between tunnel entrances was reduced by up to 2 @.@ 5 meters ( 8 ft 2 in ) . Because of the extraordinary damage there , an intensity rating of XI ( Extreme ) was assigned specifically for that location . 
 = = = Damage = = = 
 Though damage was spread throughout a large area , most was concentrated in the town of Tehachapi where at least 11 were killed and 35 were injured . An early estimate reported in the Los Angeles Times had the damage at $ 2 @.@ 6 million with 700 families affected in Tehachapi alone , where most of the town 's buildings sustained damage . Fifteen homes were destroyed there , 53 were heavily damaged , and another 75 sustained light damage . In Bakersfield , windows were broken and dislodged plaster littered residential and commercial districts , and the county jail was damaged . 
 To the southwest of Bakersfield in Maricopa , the justice court building , the Maricopa Hotel , the post office , and several businesses were condemned because of heavy damage . In the small town of Taft disruption was light , with the exception of a destroyed wall at a J. C. Penney department store and a single home that was damaged . In the ( former ) settlement of Paloma a fire burned at an oil refinery , and an explosion occurred at refinery in Long Beach due to a cracked pipe , but most of the Greater Los Angeles Area was free from heavy damage due to the distant location ( around 10 miles southwest of Tehachapi ) of the earthquake . Power disruptions affected Van Nuys and Los Angeles and in Long Beach some windows were broken . Other moderate damage in that area included a 2 @.@ 5 ft ( 0 @.@ 76 m ) crack on a street in Hollywood and a 90 ft ( 27 m ) crack in a Santa Ana parking lot . 
 = = = Aftershocks = = = 
 Through late September , Caltech seismometers recorded 188 aftershocks higher than magnitude 4 @.@ 0 . Six of those on the day of the mainshock were M5 and above , but some of these ( like the 12 : 05 M6.3 shock ) were only felt , and didn 't cause any damage . The July 21 <unk> shock at 15 : 13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00 : 38 both damaged buildings in Arvin , and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield . Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive . Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from the 07 : 53 <unk> event , and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it . Gas and water lines were also severed , and transformers were loosened or dislodged . The 13 : 17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously @-@ affected buildings that was described as serious , but the 18 : 13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin . 
 Two shocks on July 25 that occurred within an hour of each other were felt throughout central California and caused pipeline damage south of Bakersfield and other minor building damage in several locations . Pre @-@ existing ground disturbances were enhanced in Tejon Canyon , and landslides occurred at Caliente Creek Canyon , Oiler Canyon Grade , and on State Route 178 between <unk> and Bakersfield . A number of fires were initiated by the July 29 aftershock ( intensity VII ( Very strong ) ) and other severe damage was caused by it , especially to buildings that had already been damaged ( including one in Bakersfield ) . The strongest aftershock in the sequence came on August 22 as a magnitude 5 @.@ 8 event with a maximum perceived intensity of VIII ( Severe ) . Damage was especially heavy to brick buildings in Bakersfield , and although only a few buildings collapsed outright , 90 of 264 buildings that the shock damaged needed to be brought down completely . Total damage from this event alone was estimated to be $ 10 million , with several injuries , and two additional deaths . 
 = = = Peak acceleration = = = 
 Prior to the 1999 Chi @-@ Chi earthquake in Nantou County , Taiwan , little information was available for estimating ground motion that resulted from large ( greater than M7 ) thrust earthquakes , and whether the values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved . Foam rubber modeling , numerical modeling , and field studies have shown that intense ground motions close to 1g are possible on the hanging wall side of the fault during some large thrust earthquakes . A common occurrence of shattered rock that has been observed on the hanging wall of thrust faults reinforces the existence of the strong motions , but precarious rock surveys have indicated that smaller ground motions are present on the foot wall side of the fault . Foam rubber modelling studies confirm that the ground motion on the foot wall side can be lower by a factor of up to five , and an example of this imbalance was displayed during the September 1999 <unk> earthquake in Taiwan . 
 Rocks are classified as precarious if their toppling accelerations are <unk> or less and semi @-@ precarious at .3 – <unk> The area around the White Wolf fault was surveyed by a group of earth scientists with extensive experience estimating thousands of rock formations . The toppling accelerations of many rocks were assessed by the three geologists , with individual estimates usually agreeing within <unk> On the foot wall side , many precarious and semi @-@ precarious rock formations were observed and allowed for peak ground acceleration to be estimated at <unk> ( within a kilometer of the fault trace ) while rock shattering and a lack of precarious rocks on the hanging wall side suggested a value near 1g had been experienced at the time of the shock . 
 = = = Ground effects = = = 
 Many erratic surface fractures were generated in the San Joaquin Valley along the White Wolf Fault . The cracks were not well @-@ defined , and were the result of the disturbance of the alluvium that makes up the valley floor , rather than cracking along the fault trace . Northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline @-@ width to near five inches wide were seen between Arvin and California State Route 166 , and some showed clear lateral offset , but those were determined to be localized effects . Some of the fractures in the ground were aligned with the fault , and some were perpendicular to the general trend , but the more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth . This was true in the mountainous areas as well , but some of the breaks at the higher elevations were probably related to slumping . The northeast trending breaks were described in a report from the State of California ( that was prepared by well @-@ known geologists and seismologists ) as " thrusting of the southeast block up and over the northwest block , and / or a lateral movement of the southeast block to the northeast " . 
 Offset rows of cotton were documented at a number of locations along the northeast trending fault breaks in the valley . An offset of 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) was seen 17 miles ( 27 km ) south of Bakersfield , about .5 mi ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) east of California State Route 99 , and 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) southwest of Arvin a north south oriented row was offset with movement towards the west on the south side of the shift . At the same location , an east @-@ west road was dislocated towards the northeast a minimum of 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) , and near the mouth of Comanche Creek ( 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) south of Arvin ) a shallow @-@ sloped fault scarp was raised with a maximum vertical displacement of about 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) .

 <unk> Gutenberg , a German @-@ American seismologist , was the director of the Caltech Seismological Laboratory at the time of the shock . He commented about the event first by saying that the energy of the event was 100 times that of the 1933 Long Beach earthquake . In statements made in the July 22 Los Angeles Times , the shock was compared to the 1857 Fort Tejon event . He went on to say , " There is no doubt that yesterday 's quake is the largest Southern California has had in this century and is the largest to occur in this area since modern instruments were available . It 's possible that the 1857 quake might have been more intense . " Charles Richter departed the lab in Pasadena in a mobile seismograph truck bound for the epicentral area to record aftershocks close to the fault , and Harry O. Wood ( the founder of the lab thirty years prior ) visited the lab following the onset of the shocks and commented that it was still not possible to predict the location of large earthquakes . 
 The American Red Cross called it a major disaster , but getting relief into the area was stalled because of landslides blocking the ridge route running between Los Angeles and Kern counties . California State Route 99 was also blocked by a landslide ten miles south of Gorman , but the highway was quickly reopened later in the day . Two tunnels used by the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Santa Fe Railroad collapsed between Tehachapi and Marcel , and all aircraft not related to the relief effort were ordered not to land at the Tehachapi Municipal Airport . All 417 inmates from the Tehachapi Prison for Women were evacuated because of damage ; the California Department of Corrections stated that the facility was left unusable . Most of the injured received medical care at Kern County General Hospital and some sought treatment at Tehachapi Valley Hospital , where some existing patients were moved to make room for new arrivals . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Downtown Bakersfield was heavily impacted by the earthquakes , and many damaged buildings were bulldozed to make room for buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles . After World War II , and with a booming economy , the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal . The Kern County Courthouse , St. Francis Church , and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt . In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal , some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down , though some stood for many years after the earthquakes . Some of Bakersfield 's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later , but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners , and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993 . The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive , and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations . 
 Following most present day damaging earthquakes , teams of investigators from institutions such as the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records , and to study the damage and other effects of the event . This has not always been the case , and the 1954 report from <unk> and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects ( especially to buildings ) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written . The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock , as well as the <unk> from the 1940 El Centro earthquake , were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake . 
 = United States Academic Decathlon = 
 The Academic Decathlon ( also called <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) is the only annual high school academic competition organized by the non @-@ profit United States Academic Decathlon Association ( USAD ) . The competition consists of seven multiple choice tests , two performance events , and an essay . Academic Decathlon was created by Robert Peterson in 1968 for local schools in Orange County , California and expanded nationwide in 1981 . That year , 17 states and the District of Columbia participated , a number that has grown to include most of the United States and some international schools . In 2015 Academic Decathlon held its first ever International competition in Shanghai , China . Once known as United States Academic Decathlon , on March 1 , 2013 , it began operating as the Academic Decathlon . 
 Academic Decathlon is designed to include students from all achievement levels . Teams generally consist of nine members , who are divided into three divisions based on grade point average : Honors ( 3 @.@ 75 – 4 @.@ 00 GPA ) , Scholastic ( 3 @.@ 00 – 3 @.@ 74 GPA ) , and Varsity ( 0 @.@ 00 – 2 @.@ 99 GPA ) . Each team member competes in all ten events against other students in his or her division , and team scores are calculated using the top two overall individual scores from each team in all three divisions . Gold , silver , and bronze medals are awarded for individual events and for overall scores . To earn a spot at the national competition in April , teams must advance through local , regional , and state competitions , though some levels of competition may be bypassed for smaller states . Online competitions , separated into small , medium , and large categories , are also offered . USAD has expanded to include an International Academic Decathlon and has created an Academic Pentathlon for middle schools . 
 The ten events require knowledge in many academic disciplines . Students must take seven multiple choice tests in art , economics , language and literature , math , music , science and social science . These topics , with the exception of math , are thematically linked each year . One of the multiple choice events , alternating between science or social science , is chosen for the Super Quiz . In addition to the seven objective events , there are three subjective events graded by judges : essay , interview and speech . 
 Over the years , there have been various small controversies , the most infamous being the scandal involving the Steinmetz High School team , which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals . This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film Cheaters . Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators for the amount of time it requires students to spend on the material , as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school . Around the turn of the millennium , several coaches protested the USAD 's decision to publish error @-@ ridden Resource Guides rather than provide topics for students to research . 
 = = History = = 
 Academic Decathlon was founded in 1968 by Robert Peterson , the superintendent of schools in Orange County , California . Marvin Cobb , the executive director of the California Academic Decathlon in 2003 , said after Peterson 's death that Peterson intended the competition to encourage not only the highest @-@ level students who already competed in academic competitions ( " [ adding ] a little glory , " as President of the Orange County Academic Decathlon Association put it in 1970 ) , but also to " change C students ' lives " . The inaugural competition , held in December 1968 , hosted 103 students from 20 local high schools . At first only regional contests were held , organized by the Orange County Academic Decathlon Corporation ( <unk> ) with the assistance of the Orange County Department of Education . In 1971 , when the grand jury recommended that the Orange County Department of Education should no longer play a part in the competition , full control was handed over to the <unk> . 
 In 1979 , the first statewide competition was held , and just over two years later , the newly formed United States Academic Decathlon Association held the first national competition in April 1982 at Loyola Marymount University in California — 200 high schools from 16 states and the District of Columbia competed for the chance to attend . Peterson , inspired by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event . At the 1984 Nationals , 32 states as well as Canada , Mexico , New Zealand and South Korea fielded teams . The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence , however . There was no more international participation until 1989 , when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed . Since then , only a handful of international schools have competed . 
 After a 1986 trial competition , Dr. Peterson founded a " International Decathlon for Academics " in 1990 . Competitions were held in 1990 , 1991 and 1992 , but for a number of reasons the competition did not continue . In April 2009 , USAD announced that it would be regularly hosting an online international competition , the International Academic Decathlon , after a successful trial event in 2008 ; however , all 2009 participants but Southbank opted out , leading USAD to issue Southbank an invitation to attend the 2009 U.S. National Competition instead . 
 Academic Decathlon was originally organized differently than the current competition . The original ten events were aesthetics ( music and visual arts ) , conversation , essay writing , mathematics , practical arts , formal speech , physical science , social science , current events , extracurricular activities , and English literature , grammar , and reading . Over time , those events evolved into : economics , essay , fine arts , interview , language and literature , math , science , social sciences , speech and Super Quiz . It was not until 1998 that fine arts was split into its two constituent tests : art and music . Due to this division , the Super Quiz took the place of one of the other subjects each year . In 1998 , Super Quiz replaced economics ; from 1999 until 2012 , it replaced either science or social science and alternated replacing the two from 2003 to 2012 . Beginning with the 2013 season , the Super Quiz consisted of a relay portion only , encompassing questions from the respective year 's Science , Language and Literature , Music , Social Science , Art , and Economics curriculum . 
 More than just the events were changed during the 1998 – 99 season — the style of study required of students changed . Prior to that season , students had performed their own research for each event , and test writers did not have to base their questions on material USAD published . However , after a policy change at the beginning of the 1999 – 2000 competition year , test writers were required to base the tests on official USAD materials . After the change in policy , scores vastly increased across the country . That year at Nationals , James E. Taylor High School had the highest team score yet seen at the competition . The following season , USAD once again altered their testing policies ; 50 % of test questions were to come from USAD published " Resource Guides " and 50 % were to come from unspecified sources . Economics focused on business organizations and profiles in individual enterprise rather than macroeconomics and microeconomics as it had for the previous 19 years . A decrease in scores followed these changes ; the national winner that year , El Camino Real High School , scored 5 @,@ 923 fewer points than James E. Taylor High School had the previous year . The following year , USAD settled on an organization of test materials that it would use for almost a full decade , with a mixture of questions from the provided material and independent research . A number of curriculum changes were reversed . 
 Though the events finally stabilized during the 2000 – 01 season , the USAD administration changed dramatically that year when the program 's executive director , James Alvino , resigned . Alvino had written a religious article that had been included in that year 's Super Quiz Resource Guide . His critics and the USAD Board regarded the inclusion as a conflict of interest , as the material was a persuasive essay that heavily pushed Alvino 's point of view . The season was also significant in that it was the first year that states were allowed to send both their large and small school champions to the national competition . ( Small schools are currently classified as those schools with fewer than 650 students . ) However , this practice was short @-@ lived and was discontinued after the 2002 season . Instead , a small school e @-@ Nationals was introduced during the 2005 – 06 school year . The medium school e @-@ Nationals was established two years later for those schools with between 650 and 1 @,@ 300 students . In 2010 , California Academic Decathlon announced that a large school e @-@ Nationals would be held for the second @-@ highest performing school in each state . 
 In 2009 , USAD announced the launch of an " Online Middle School Pentathlon Program " , a competition similar to Academic Decathlon , with only essay , language and literature , mathematics , geography or social science , and science as events . Either science or social science would be designated as the Super Quiz topic . 
 In 2010 , it was announced that high school students who don 't have access to a school team or whose team has been eliminated in an earlier round can participate in an online individual competition . 
 = = Participation = = 
 = = = Team makeup and eligibility = = = 
 The USAD requires a diversity of achievement within each team ; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA . The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3 @.@ 75 and 4 @.@ 0 . The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3 @.@ 0 and 3 @.@ 74 . The final group , the Varsity category , contains students whose GPA ranges from 0 @.@ 00 to 2 @.@ 99 . USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance @-@ based classes such as music , art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation . A grade counts for face value regardless of whether it is from an advanced placement , honors , regular or remedial class . An A is counted as a 4 @.@ 0 , a B as a 3 @.@ 0 , a C as a 2 @.@ 0 , a D as a 1 @.@ 0 , and a F as a 0 . Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA . 
 A team typically consists of nine competitors : three honors , three scholastic and three varsity . However , since only the top two scores from each category count towards the team 's total score , a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction . Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to , but generally it is to the students ' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can . Scores in Varsity are typically lower than those in Scholastic , and those in Scholastic are typically lower than those in Honors . 
 = = = Levels of competition = = = 
 There are four official levels of competition : local / scrimmage , regional , state , and national ( Rounds 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 respectively ) . With the exception of Round 1 , only the top finishers in each round advance to the next level . California , the state with the largest Academic Decathlon , holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests , which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at the regional level , which uses Round 2 tests . In the 2008 – 09 season , 43 states participated in statewide Academic <unk> , though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition . 
 = = Events = = 
 Like an athletic decathlon , the Academic Decathlon has ten events : art , economics , essay , interview , language and literature , math , music , science , social science , and speech . Prior to 2013 , the Super Quiz replaced one of the seven objective events each year ; from 2003 @-@ 2012 , it alternated between replacing science and social science . USAD releases the topics and theme of the following year 's competition in early March , giving students time to prepare for a competition season that runs from November to April . The curriculum is developed by a ten @-@ member panel of former USAD coaches known as the USAD Curriculum Advisory Group . The group contracts with " curriculum developers " , who must have at least a bachelor 's degree in their respective subject , to create the subject area outlines , Resource Guides , and Notebook <unk> . The Super Quiz Resource Guide was formed mostly from articles from peer reviewed journals , but also includes non @-@ peer reviewed articles , which are looked over by a panel of five reviewers and then checked for accuracy by another reviewer . Use of this format was continued for the Science packet in the 2012 @-@ 2013 season . 
 The events are split up into two groups : the seven objective tests ( art , economics , language and literature , math , music , science and social science ) the three subjective events ( essay , interview and speech ) . In addition , there is a <unk> relay event . The former seven are given as half @-@ hour multiple choice tests , whereas the latter three are graded by judges . The multiple choice exams consist of 50 questions each , with the exception of math , which has 35 questions . Beginning in the 2012 @-@ 2013 season , the <unk> written test was dropped and the oral relay was changed to include questions from six of the objective subjects : art , economics , language and literature , music , science , and social science . 
 = = = Objective events = = = 
 In general , the objective events follow a set organizational outline from year to year . Language and literature focuses on a single novel or a set of plays in addition to multiple short literary selections which tend to be poems or excerpts from short stories . The art and music sections include several selections with which students must familiarize themselves in addition to historical information . Economics remains fairly static ; 85 % of the material focuses on a standard course of macroeconomics and microeconomics and the remaining 15 % focuses on the year 's topic . For example , in 2005 the themed material covered the economics of ancient Egypt and Rome . Science and social science reflect the season 's theme . Unlike the other events , there is no basic information that carries over . The math curriculum has varied as well , occasionally dropping and adding new subjects or shifting the weight of particular subjects . 
 = = = = Super Quiz = = = = 
 The format of the Super Quiz differs from that of the other subject areas . Added in 1969 , it offers a culminating championship event . The Super Quiz consisted of a forty @-@ question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013 . In 2013 , the multiple @-@ choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects . Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay , it is the only event viewable by the general public . The relay starts with the Varsity students , followed by the Scholastic and the Honors students . Each group is given 10 or 15 questions , depending on the format decided by the state coordinator . These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors . After the questions and answers are read , the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer . The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience . 
 = = = Subjective events = = = 
 The subjective events allow students more creativity than the objective events . The speech event is divided into prepared and impromptu sections . A three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half to four @-@ minute long prepared speech is delivered . The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half to two @-@ minute impromptu speech . Example prompts have included : " It has been said about our modern times that , ' Invention is the mother of necessity . ' Please discuss . " , " Math has been described as the universal language . Discuss . " and " Why is light , light and dark , dark ? " In the interview , the students are asked a wide variety of questions in a formal environment . Questions range from : " Who is your role model ? " to " How would you alert someone that their zipper is down ? " In both the speech and interview , the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges . In the essay event , students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum . 
 = = = Themes and topics = = = 
 As the competition has evolved , more of the events have been tied into a central theme . For example , the 2008 – 2009 theme was " Latin America with a focus on Mexico " . Language and literature was based on six short selections of literature as well as the novel Bless Me , Ultima by Rudolfo Anaya . Art focused on the art of Mexico and featured several pieces of work , ranging from Olmec earthenware to José Guadalupe Posada 's La Calavera Catrina . The music event included questions on Latin American music and included works by musicians as varied as Manuel de Zumaya , Silvestre <unk> , Ástor Piazzolla and Xavier Cugat . Social science and economics focused on the history and economy of Mexico respectively . The Super Quiz covered an introduction to evolutionary biology , the historical development of the theory of evolution , natural selection , speciation , mutation , gene flow , genetic drift , and evolutionary developmental biology . Information was also included on Charles Darwin 's voyage on the HMS Beagle . 
 = = Study materials = = 
 The United States Academic Decathlon publishes a variety of study materials for the objective events , the profits from which support the program . The Resource Guides and the Basic Guides constitute the majority of the USAD corpus . An art reproduction booklet and music CD contain a particular year 's relevant pieces and are issued separately from the Resource Guides . Study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject . These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the Resource Guides . USAD also offered Research Guides until 2010 , which outlined the basics of what students ought to research . However , in the 2010 – 2011 competition season , USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research @-@ based questions from the competitions . 
 Resource Guides are offered for the art , economics , language and literature , music , science / social science , and Super Quiz events . The Super Quiz Resource Guide is a compendium of previously published articles , whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD . The aim of the Resource Guide is to assist students in their study of the topics listed in the subject area outlines . As an example , in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music . Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused on the development of Romantic music , its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era . A large part of the guide focused on information about that year 's composers : Beethoven , Berlioz , Rossini , Chopin , Mendelssohn , Verdi , Mussorgsky , Wagner , Bizet , Brahms , Tchaikovsky , Mahler and Strauss . Similarly , the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition . The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner , Claude Monet , Albert Bierstadt , and Camille Pissarro . 
 In the 1990s , various companies were established to research subjects and provide practice tests to teams . Two of the major ones were <unk> Cards and Exams and <unk> , formed by former coach Dan Spetner and former <unk> Daniel <unk> , respectively . The two offer exams and study guides that can augment or replace USAD 's official materials . USAD explicitly discouraged teams from ordering materials from third @-@ party companies in the late 1998 , though it later removed their discouragement from the curriculum page . USAD republished their discouragement just a few weeks after removing it , but did not publish such a warning in 2002 . 
 In 2000 , several coaches who had led their teams to Nationals during the 1990s resigned in protest over Academic Decathlon 's decision to sell nearly $ 1 @,@ 000 of study materials rather than simply providing topics for students to independently research . Teams felt obligated to buy the guides because USAD based the official tests on them . Teams also denounced the hundreds of errors they found in the official guides ; coaches were sometimes forced to instruct their students to deliberately give the wrong answer in the official competition . Richard <unk> , coach of the 1996 J. Frank Dobie High School team that won the national competition , said that the decision to market guides shifted Academic Decathlon 's emphasis to memorization over critical thinking . Coach Jim Hatem of Los Angeles and Coach Mark Johnson of El Camino 's 1998 winning team fumed over esoteric " trick " questions that USAD had begun asking . James Alvino , USAD 's executive director at that time , argued that the expensive study materials were necessary to continue funding nearly 75 % of the program 's $ 1 @,@ 750 @,@ 000 operating budget and to provide a fairer playing field for less wealthy schools , but did acknowledge that USAD would attempt to reduce prices , remove the more trivial questions , and base smaller portions of the tests on the official Resource Guide . 
 Basic Guides were formerly issued for students which , unlike the Resource Guides , remained the same from year to year . The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals , such as the elements of art , principles of composition , and different 2 @-@ D and 3 @-@ D techniques . Additionally , a brief introduction to art history is included . The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts in addition to the basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics . The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces key terms such as synecdoche , metonymy , assonance , and aphorism . The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math , including algebra , geometry , trigonometry , calculus , and statistics . The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics , rhythm , tempo , and the circle of fifths . It also includes information on a wide variety of instruments and a brief history of Western music . However , beginning in the 2010 – 2011 competition season , the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year 's Resource Guides . 
 The National Association of Secondary School Principals ( <unk> ) has criticized the intense amount of studying required by students as " excess fact @-@ mongering " . In the 1980s , the Association did not endorse Academic Decathlon , citing what it believes was an excessive amount of time involved with the studying necessary to win . It stated that while it is not opposed to the academic portion of the competition , it disliked the " national dimension " of it . However , beginning in 2008 , the Association placed USAD on their " National Advisory List of Student Contests and Activities " . The list consists of programs that a <unk> committee believes meets their requisite quality standards . 
 = = Scoring and winning = = 
 Each of the ten events is worth 1 @,@ 000 points , for a possible 10 @,@ 000 @-@ point individual total . Only the top two scores from the Honors , Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score . Until 2013 , 60 @,@ 000 was the maximum possible team score . In 2013 , Super Quiz became a 10 @,@ 000 point event that only counts for the team score , making the maximum possible team score 70 @,@ 000 . With the exception of math and Super Quiz , the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece . The math test is weighted more heavily , with 35 questions worth approximately 28 @.@ 6 points per question . Until 2013 , the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions , each worth 15 points . Depending on the state director , the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions , each worth 80 or 40 points respectively . Starting in 2013 , the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions , each worth approximately 333 @.@ 3 or 166 @.@ 7 questions respectively . The written test was sometimes omitted at the state level even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily . Perfect scores of 1 @,@ 000 in events are recorded regularly , and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near @-@ perfect scores . Gold , silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division ( Honors , Scholastic , and Varsity ) . All tying participants are awarded medals . 
 The medals ' design is the " AD " portion of the official USAD logo , encircled by " United States " at the top , " Academic Decathlon " at the bottom , and four stars of increasing size on either side . Though the medals are given out only to winners of the competitions , teams can order them along with other study materials . The medals given at state and local competitions are of a different design than those given at Nationals . 
 The interview and speech events are graded by two to three judges . The scores from the judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1 @,@ 000 points per event . The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged . If the difference between the judges ' scores differs by 200 points or more , then a third reader is asked to grade the student 's essay . The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score . 
 A benchmark for the Decathlon elite is obtaining an individual score of over 9 @,@ 000 points . It was not until 1992 , 24 years after the program 's inception , that Tyson Rogers achieved this feat at the national competition . Since then , numerous students have broken the 9 @,@ 000 point barrier . The current highest individual score is 9 @,@ 461 @.@ 4 , achieved by Kris Sankaran from <unk> High School at the 2009 California state competition . State champion scores vary greatly from year to year . As an example , for the 2002 – 03 season , scores ranged from 24 @,@ 785 to 49 @,@ 910 points . National champion scores have been as low as 45 @,@ 857 @.@ 0 points and as high as 54 @,@ 081 points . The 54 @,@ 081 score produced by the 2012 Granada Hills Charter High School team at the National Championship stands as the record for the highest team score . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 Three days before the 1995 Illinois state competition , Steinmetz High School obtained copies of the tests from the DeVry Institute of Technology , where the state finals were being held . The team was therefore able to look up and memorize the answers . The cheating allowed Steinmetz to beat perennial powerhouse Whitney Young Magnet High School , who had won the Illinois state finals in 22 of the previous 23 years . Six of the twelve students in the nation who scored over 900 points on the math test came from Steinmetz High School , prompting the Illinois state Academic Decathlon to suspect cheating . The Steinmetz team was disqualified after team members refused to take an alternate version of the test , and its coach eventually resigned . The incident was dramatized in the movie Cheaters . 
 Catholic Memorial High School coach John Burke was at the center of a dispute over the results of the 2003 Wisconsin state final . Confusion arose over a Catholic Memorial student 's essay after the results of the competition were released . The essay had only received 390 points out of a possible 1000 , and Burke contended that it had been scored improperly . He was well within his rights to contest the score ; however , Gerhard Fischer , President of Wisconsin Academic Decathlon , said that the way Burke handled the appeal was " highly questionable " and inflammatory . Though Burke was reprimanded , parents of Catholic Memorial students believed the punishment , a three @-@ year suspension for Burke and a one @-@ year suspension for Catholic Memorial , was due to personality differences between Burke and Wisconsin Academic Decathlon officials . The controversy eventually led to a more thorough investigation of previous issues involving Burke . The Wisconsin Academic Decathlon Board discovered that Burke had previously been accused of " [ m ] ore than a year of repeated ' attacks ' on another school 's pupils , including allegations of cheating on tests and ineligibility .

 = = National championship = = 
 The National Championship pits the winning school from each state against all the others for an overall title . Occasionally , a number of international schools compete as well . Schools compete based on size and are divided into three divisions ( I , II , and III ) . However , this separation is limited to overall team score and overall individual score . Nine overall team medals are awarded : gold , silver and bronze for each division . Similarly , 27 overall individual medals are awarded : gold , silver and bronze for Honors , Scholastic and Varsity in each division . The top prepared speeches are honored at the Speech Showcase , while the rest of the medals — for example , gold in art for Honors , or silver in math for Varsity — are awarded to the top scoring persons during the awards banquet regardless of division . Other awards given out include the Kristin Caperton Award for overcoming personal or physical challenges , among others . Certain awards occasionally come with monetary prizes ; these often vary from year to year . Since the first national event in 1982 , all National Championship winners have come from three states : California , Texas and Wisconsin .

 In 2006 , the small school virtual competition was created for schools with 650 or fewer students . Two years later , the medium school virtual competition was added to accommodate schools with a student population between 650 and 1 @,@ 300 . These two separate contests are held via the Internet and , as such , the interview and speech events are excluded . The remaining eight tests are completed on the computer and results are submitted electronically to USAD for scoring . Because only the seven multiple choice tests and essay are used , team scores are out of 48 @,@ 000 points instead of 60 @,@ 000 . Although it is only a virtual competition , winning schools are awarded trophies and medals for their efforts . University High School , from Fresno , California , has won 6 of 7 Small School National Championships . Coached by Sean Canfield , the team has won both the California and National Small School titles for the past 6 years . UHS has a current enrollment of 465 students , yet placed 8th overall at the 2013 California State , competing against schools several times its size . According to USAD , the goal of the small and medium school competitions is to " enhance learning , growth and recognition " .

 = Ghost ( Sky Ferreira EP ) = 
 Ghost is the second extended play ( EP ) by American recording artist Sky Ferreira , released on October 16 , 2012 by Capitol Records . It was made available in place of her frequently delayed debut studio album , which eventually became Night Time , My Time ( 2013 ) . Ghost represents a musical departure from Ferreira 's earlier work , which explored more prominent elements of dance @-@ pop . She collaborated with producers including Jon Brion , Dev Hynes , Greg Kurstin , Cass McCombs , and Ariel Rechtshaid to achieve her desired sound . Their efforts resulted in a primarily synthpop record , although it differs from her earlier work in that it sees additional influences from acoustic , indie pop and new wave music . 
 Ghost received mixed to positive reviews from music critics , who appreciated its diversity , but were ambivalent towards its overall cohesiveness . It peaked at numbers eight and 71 on the US Billboard Top Heatseekers and Alternative Albums record charts . Along with three other tracks , the extended play included prior single " Red Lips " and Ferreira 's critically acclaimed " Everything Is Embarrassing " . 
 = = Background = = 
 After releasing the tracks " 17 " , " One " , and " Obsession " , Ferreira announced that her debut studio album would be released on January 11 , 2011 . However , it was instead replaced by her first extended play ( EP ) As If ! , which was made available on March 22 of that year . That November , Ferreira announced that her debut studio album would be released in 2012 , with a lead single planned to precede its release that February . She was later revealed to have been working with Jon Brion , Greg Kurstin , and Shirley Manson on the project . Plans to release an extended play titled Ghost were revealed by Pitchfork on August 30 , 2012 . The extended play 's cover artwork was photographed by Hedi Slimane and revealed by Ferreira through her Twitter account on September 17 ; the black @-@ and @-@ white close @-@ up image depicts a blonde Ferreira holding her hair while dressed in a denim jacket . Although the extended play was initially slated for an October 2 release , it was ultimately released on October 16 in the United States and Canada . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Ghost incorporates styles from several musical genres , whereas her earlier works more prominently incorporated electropop styles . Writing for Now , Kevin Ritchie felt that the project " suggests a much broader range of intriguing possibilities [ ... ] for her dusky voice " than her previous music allowed , further suggesting that her earlier tracks " One " and " Obsession " saw Ferreira " succumbing " to the requests of her record label . Its opening track " Sad Dream " integrates acoustic guitar instrumentation ; Joe <unk> from No Ripcord stated that Ferreira 's vocals " almost [ cracked ] out of sadness " during the chorus , adding that the lyrics " Hope the guilt will dim and fade / A fire baptism engulfs my shame " emphasize her discouragement . Jon Caramanica from The New York Times shared a similar sentiment , stating that its lyrics " are darker than Ms. Ferreira 's usual mood . " " Lost in My Bedroom " is an uptempo electropop song that was deemed largely reminiscent of her earlier material . Caramanica felt that it sounded like an " outtake " from the soundtrack for the 1984 film Sixteen Candles . 
 The title track " Ghost " presents similar lyrical content and production as the opening track , although it is differentiated by its subtle use of background electric guitars ; <unk> opined that " synths sparkle against Ferreira ’ s sly vocals and the pulsing beat pounds away in the background . " " Red Lips " was co @-@ written by Shirley Manson , and was compared to material recorded by her band Garbage ; Ferreira delivers " breathy " vocals with a " no @-@ BS attitude " against a " distorted electric guitar gliding over battering drums " . The fifth and final track " Everything Is Embarrassing " was described as " moving firmly into New Wave territory " Ferreira 's vocals were noted as being " crisp and smooth " , while the inclusion of " propelling percussion [ and ] deep @-@ tuned piano chords " generated comparisons to music from the 1980s . Caramanica described its production as " sly , lush <unk> seduction " . 
 = = Singles = = 
 " Red Lips " was released as the lead single from the EP in the United States and Canada on July 17 , 2012 . It received generally favorable reviews from music critics , who appreciated its incorporation of grunge music elements An accompanying music video for the track was directed by Terry Richardson , and had premiered through Richardson 's YouTube channel the previous month on June 12 , 2012 ; the music video was later uploaded to Ferreira 's Vevo channel on July 13 . The clip sees Ferreira , dressed in underwear , applying lipstick on her entire face , and is interspersed with footage of its co @-@ star , the spider " Toby the Tarantula " , crawling across her body . Tara Aquino suggested that the visuals developed an increasingly risqué image for Ferreira , who responded by stating that her wardrobe was intended to complement the simplistic nature of the music video rather than an attempt to create sex appeal . 
 " Everything Is Embarrassing " premiered via Pitchfork on August 30 , 2012 along with the announcement of Ghost 's release ; it would later be issued as a single on April 14 of the following year in the UK and Ireland , where Ghost had not been released . It received critical acclaim from music critics , and was largely recognized as the standout track from the extended play . Katherine St. Asaph felt that the track was Ferreira 's " breakout moment " , while Jon Caramanica from The New York Times described it as " one of the year 's unlikely pop gems " . A writer for Tiny Mix Tapes stated that it " transcends the present moment [ ... ] in the way that it will soundtrack , for many people , memories of 2012 . " As of July 2013 , the track had sold 19 @,@ 000 digital downloads in the United States . 
 Capitol Records requested that an accompanying music video for " Everything Is Embarrassing " with no budget be filmed following the track 's online premiere ; it was directed by Grant Singer , who had previously directed the clips for " Sad Dream " and " Lost in My Bedroom " , and was filmed in one day in Los Angeles since Ferreira was scheduled to depart for New York City shortly after . It was premiered through Pitchfork on October 1 , 2012 ; the black @-@ and @-@ white clip sees Ferreira singing in various locations throughout the city , including a playground and the roof of the Capitol Records Building . In her debut television performance , she performed the track on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on January 7 , 2013 .

 Ghost received mixed to positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 62 , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " , based on six reviews . Writing for Pitchfork Media , Katherine St. Asaph provided a favorable review , placing particular praise on the " versatility " and " empathy " expressed in the tracks ' lyrics . Kevin Ritchie from Now appreciated the " diverse " nature of the record , commenting that the " lightness and <unk> " incorporated throughout suggested that Ferreira had yet to display " even more untapped potential " . 
 In a more mixed review , Jon Caramanica from The New York Times implied that Ghost lacked artistic cohesion . Despite remaining indifferent to the tracks individually , he opined that they were underwhelming when accompanied by " Everything Is Embarrassing " , and elaborated that the record was " just another round of throwing ideas at the wall . " A writer from No Ripcord shared a similar sentiment , stating that the " identity crisis " seemingly displayed in As If ! and Ghost overshadowed the " significant improvement " seen in the later project . Writing for Consequence of Sound , Tony Hardy was also critical of the significant musical diversity incorporated throughout the extended play , sarcastically referring to it as being " interesting " . A writer for Tiny Mix Tapes criticized the first four tracks on Ghost for sounding " dated on arrival " .

 = Jack the Ripper : The Final Solution = 
 Jack the Ripper : The Final Solution is a book written by Stephen Knight first published in 1976 . It proposed a solution to five murders in Victorian London that were blamed on an unidentified serial killer known as " Jack the Ripper " . 
 Knight presented an elaborate conspiracy theory involving the British royal family , freemasonry and the painter Walter Sickert . He concluded that the victims were murdered to cover up a secret marriage between the second @-@ in @-@ line to the throne , Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , and Annie Elizabeth Crook , a working class girl . There are many facts that contradict Knight 's theory , and his main source , Joseph Gorman ( also known as Joseph Sickert ) , later retracted the story and admitted to the press that it was a hoax . Most scholars dismiss the theory and the book 's conclusion is now widely discredited . 
 Nevertheless , the book was popular and commercially successful , going through 20 editions . It was the basis for the graphic novel and film From Hell , as well as other dramatisations , and has influenced crime fiction writers , such as Patricia Cornwell and Anne Perry . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Between August and November 1888 , at least five brutal murders were committed in the Whitechapel district of London . Although Whitechapel was an impoverished area and violence there was common , these murders can be linked to the same killer through a distinctive modus operandi . All the murders took place within the distance of a few streets , late at night or in the early morning , and the victims were all women whose throats were cut . In four of the cases , their bodies were mutilated , or even eviscerated . The removal of internal organs from three of the victims led to contemporary proposals that " considerable anatomical knowledge was displayed by the murderer , which would seem to indicate that his occupation was that of a butcher or a surgeon . " Media organisations and the police received many letters and postcards purportedly written by the killer , who was dubbed " Jack the Ripper " after one of the signatories . Most of the anonymous confessional letters were dismissed by the police as hoaxes but one , known as the " From Hell " letter after a phrase used by the writer , was treated more seriously ; it was sent with a small box containing half of a preserved human kidney . It is not clear , however , whether the kidney truly came from one of the victims or was a medical specimen sent as part of a macabre joke . 
 Despite an extensive police investigation , the killer was never found and his identity is still a mystery . Both at the time and subsequently , many amateur and professional investigators have proposed solutions but no single theory is widely accepted . 
 = = = Claims of Thomas Stowell = = = 
 In 1970 , British surgeon Thomas E. A. Stowell published an article entitled " Jack the Ripper – A Solution ? " in the November issue of The Criminologist . In the article , Stowell proposed that the Ripper was an aristocrat who had contracted syphilis during a visit to the West Indies , that it had driven him insane , and that in this state of mind he had perpetrated the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders . Although Stowell did not directly name his suspect in the article , he described in detail the suspect 's family and his physical appearance and nicknames , all of which pointed to Queen Victoria 's grandson , Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale . Stowell wrote that following a double murder on 30 September 1888 , his suspect was restrained by his own family in an institution in the south of England , but later escaped to commit a final murder on 9 November before ultimately dying of syphilis . To back up his theory , Stowell drew comparisons between the evisceration of the women and the disembowelment of deer shot by the aristocracy on their estates . Stowell said his information came from the private notes of Sir William Gull , a reputable physician who had treated members of the royal family . Stowell knew Gull 's son @-@ in @-@ law , Theodore Dyke Acland , and was an executor of Acland 's estate . 
 Stowell 's article attracted intense attention , and placed Albert Victor among the most notable Ripper suspects , but his innocence was soon proven . Gull died before Albert Victor , and so could not have known about Albert Victor 's death . All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia , and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression , it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis . The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure . While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute , for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888 , he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873 , six years before he visited the West Indies . Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution , when Albert Victor was serving in the British army , making regular public appearances , and visiting friends at country houses . Newspaper reports , Queen Victoria 's diary , family letters , and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public , or meeting foreign royalty , or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders . 
 On 5 November 1970 , Stowell wrote to The Times denying that it was his intention to imply Prince Albert Victor was Jack the Ripper . The letter was published on 9 November , the day after the elderly Stowell 's own death from natural causes . The same week , Stowell 's son reported that he had burned his father 's papers , saying " I read just sufficient to make certain that there was nothing of importance . " 
 = = = Claims of Joseph Gorman = = = 
 Though Stowell 's hypothesis was incorrect , his article rekindled interest in the Jack the Ripper case , and in 1973 the BBC launched a television series , Jack the Ripper , which investigated the Whitechapel murders . The series mixed documentary and drama ; it featured real evidence but was hosted by fictional detectives Barlow and Watt , played by Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor , respectively . The series was made into a book , The Ripper File , by Elwyn Jones and John Lloyd in 1975 . The sixth and final programme included a testimony by Joseph Gorman , who called himself Joseph Sickert and claimed to be the illegitimate son of noted painter Walter Sickert . Gorman claimed that Sickert had told him a story that implicated not only the royal family but also a host of other famous people in the murders . According to Gorman , Gull committed the murders with the help of accomplices . Stowell had mentioned rumours implicating Gull in his article , but had dismissed them as unfair and false . 
 Gorman said that his Catholic grandmother had secretly married Albert Victor , and that his mother , as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor , was the rightful heir to the throne . He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged as part of a conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth . In the original television series , the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives . Captivated by Gorman 's story , journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further , and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper : The Final Solution in 1976 . 
 = = Content = = 
 = = = Gorman 's story = = = 
 The book begins with Knight explaining how he came to meet Joseph Gorman , and then he tells Gorman 's story which " did not come in clear , precise , chronological order but I had to glean it from rambling and sometimes vague discussion " . Gorman says that Albert Victor 's mother , Princess Alexandra , introduced Walter Sickert to her son in the hope that Sickert would teach Albert Victor about art . Gorman claims that Albert Victor met one of Sickert 's models , Annie Elizabeth Crook , a Catholic shop girl , at Sickert 's studio at 15 Cleveland Street , London . They had an affair , he says , and married in a secret ceremony with Sickert and Annie 's friend , Mary Jane Kelly , acting as witnesses . Gorman alleges that Albert Victor and Annie 's daughter , Alice Margaret Crook , was born on 18 April 1885 , and that Albert Victor settled Annie and Alice into an apartment in Cleveland Street . In April 1888 , Gorman continues , Queen Victoria and the British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury discovered Albert Victor 's secret . Gorman accuses Salisbury of ordering a raid on the apartment because he was afraid that public knowledge of a potential Catholic heir to the throne would result in a revolution . Gorman claims that Albert Victor was placed in the custody of his family , while Annie was placed in the custody of Sir William Gull , who certified her insane ; she spent the next 30 years drifting in and out of institutions before dying in 1920 . 
 Meanwhile , Gorman alleges , Kelly was looking after the daughter , Alice , both during and after the raid . Gorman asserts that at first Kelly was content to hide the child , but then she , along with her friends Mary Ann Nichols , Annie Chapman and Elizabeth Stride , decided to blackmail the government . Gorman accuses Salisbury of conspiring with his fellow freemasons , including senior policemen in the London Metropolitan Police , to stop the scandal by staging the murders of the women . Gorman says Salisbury assigned the task to Gull , who lured the four women into a carriage individually where Gull murdered them with the assistance of coachman John Netley and Sir Robert Anderson , Assistant Commissioner of Scotland Yard . Gorman claims a fifth victim , Catherine Eddowes , was killed accidentally in a case of mistaken identity because she used the alias Mary Ann Kelly and was confused with Mary Jane Kelly . Gorman alleges that Netley tried to kill the young Alice twice but after the second unsuccessful attempt several witnesses chased Netley , who threw himself into the Thames and drowned . Gorman completes the story by saying that Alice lived well into old age , later becoming Walter Sickert 's mistress , and that Alice and Walter Sickert are his parents . 
 = = = Knight 's investigation = = = 
 Knight explains that at first he did not believe Gorman 's sensational story , which seemed " arrant , if entertaining , nonsense " , but was so entranced by it that he had to investigate further . In describing the progress of his investigation , Knight reveals a series of coincidences : both Albert Victor 's mother and Alice Crook were deaf ; both Albert Victor 's mother and Walter Sickert were Danish ; Sickert is obsessed by the Ripper ; the murders ended with the death of Mary Kelly ; there was growing republican sentiment at the time of the murders , as well as anti @-@ Catholic prejudice ; a woman named " Elizabeth Cook " , who Knight claims could be Annie Elizabeth Crook misspelt , did live at 6 Cleveland Street ; Annie Crook was institutionalised ; rumours of the time link Prince Albert Victor to a scandal in Cleveland Street ; Gull was fond of grapes , and one of the victims may have been eating some at the time of her death ; Gull matches the description of an unnamed physician accused by clairvoyant Robert James Lees , who claimed to have identified the Ripper by using psychic powers . 
 Eventually , as the circumstantial coincidences build up , Knight becomes convinced that Gorman 's story is true . The lack of tangible evidence , he claims , is due to a government cover @-@ up and deliberate misdirection of the police investigation . To back up the claims of a masonic conspiracy , he notes supposed similarities between the Jack the Ripper killings and alleged masonic ritual murders , and accuses Sir Charles Warren , Commissioner of Police , of destroying evidence to protect his freemason cronies . Knight points out that Stowell , who was apparently the first person to suggest Albert Victor 's and Gull 's involvement in the murders , was a freemason . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Reviewers at the time of first publication met the book with undisguised scepticism and satire , but felt that Knight presented his unlikely case with ingenuity . Quentin Bell wrote in The Times Literary Supplement : " [ The book ] begins bravely and fairly by presenting the greater part of the author 's case and admitting at once that ' it all sounds terribly unlikely ' . It does . " Medical History stated : " Despite the author 's ingenuity the case does not stand up to careful and critical analysis and is no more ' final ' than its many predecessors . " Since then , scholars from multiple disciplines have rejected Gorman 's story as a ridiculous fantasy , and highlight many facts which contradict the version of events presented by Knight . 
 Annie Crook was a real person and did have a daughter , Alice , born on 18 April 1885 at St Marylebone Workhouse , and Joseph Gorman was Alice 's son . However , there is no evidence in support of Gorman 's claim that his father was Walter Sickert . Gorman was one of five children born within the marriage of Alice Margaret Crook and William Gorman . Furthermore , according to Trevor Marriott , an expert on the Jack the Ripper case , Alice " must have been conceived between 18 July and 11 August 1884 " . Albert Victor was in Heidelberg from June to August 1884 ; hence , he was not in London at the time of Alice 's conception and could not have been her father . The name of Alice 's father was left blank on her birth certificate , but in adulthood , Alice claimed her father was William Crook . William Crook was also the name of her grandfather . Ripper expert Don Rumbelow has suggested that the name of Alice 's father was omitted from her birth certificate either because she was illegitimate or to conceal an incestuous relationship between her mother , Annie , and grandfather , William . There is no record of any marriage between Albert Victor and Annie Crook ; even if such a marriage had taken place , it would have been invalid under British law due to the Royal Marriages Act 1772 , which voids any marriage contracted by a member of the royal family without the consent of the Sovereign . Any child of an invalid marriage is deemed illegitimate and excluded from the line of succession . Gorman claimed that his grandmother was Catholic , although records prove this to be untrue . If she had been and if she had married Albert Victor , he and their child would be excluded from inheriting the throne under the Act of Settlement 1701 , which excludes Catholics from the line of succession . 
 There are further multiple problems with Gorman 's version of events . An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street could not have been raided in April 1888 , since by that time Nos. 4 – 14 Cleveland Street had been demolished , and the house no longer existed . Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron , such as Albert Victor , but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses . Annie was not institutionalised for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy . The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook , who lived on the other side of Central London . Even if they had known her or her child , it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed , so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed . Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke , which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak . Gull did recover , but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890 . Furthermore , neither Lord Salisbury , nor Sir James Anderson , nor Sir William Gull were freemasons , and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects , nor did he drown in the Thames . He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van . The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved , and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered . Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage . Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street , and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales . Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder , and so was not one of the perpetrators . 
 Knight appreciated that there were problems with Gorman 's claims , but he " either misinterpreted , or deliberately ignored " them . Knight admitted that parts of Gorman 's story were wrong but claimed that such mistakes were " stronger support of the fact that he was telling the truth " . Realising that Anderson 's absence in Switzerland meant that Anderson could not have been an accomplice , Knight considered Walter Sickert a much more likely culprit than Anderson , and suggested that he was the " third man " to participate in the crimes . This was not the first accusation made against Sickert . He had been previously mentioned as a potential suspect in Donald McCormick 's 1959 book The Identity of Jack the Ripper . However , Sickert was in France with his mother and brother in the late summer of 1888 , and is unlikely even to have been in London at the time of at least four of the murders . After Knight implicated Sickert , Joseph Gorman withdrew his testimony , admitting to The Sunday Times newspaper that " it was a hoax ... a whopping <unk> " . 
 Knight 's friend and fellow Ripper aficionado Colin Wilson thought the story was " obvious nonsense " but shortly after Knight 's tragically early death from a brain tumour he wrote in his defence : " he wrote the book with his tongue in his cheek , then found himself caught up in a success that prevented him from retracting or quietly disowning it . " 
 = = Influence = = 
 Despite its many inconsistencies , Knight 's and Gorman 's conspiracy theory has captured the imagination of other authors , who have made further modifications to the story . For example , Melvyn Fairclough 's The Ripper and the Royals ( London : Duckworth , 1991 ) asserted that Lord Randolph Churchill was the " third man " , although Fairclough later disowned his own book and told reporters that " he no longer believes the theory " . Andy Parlour , Sue Parlour and Kevin O 'Donnell , authors of The Jack the Ripper Whitechapel Murders ( St. Osyth , Essex : Ten Bells Publishing , 1997 ) , supposed that Mary Jane Kelly was pregnant with Albert Victor 's child instead of Annie Crook . These , and other books which promote Sickert from a knowing accomplice to being Jack the Ripper himself , such as Jean Overton @-@ Fuller 's Sickert and the Ripper Crimes ( Oxford : Mandrake , 1990 ) and Patricia Cornwell 's Portrait of a Killer ( 2002 ) , are marketed as non @-@ fiction books , but they are dismissed almost universally as derivative fantasies based on Knight 's initial flawed analysis . 
 The conspiracy theory outlined in Jack the Ripper : The Final Solution is fictionalised in the play Force and Hypocrisy by Doug Lucie .

 Knight 's theory features in the final book of Philip José Farmer 's <unk> series , Gods of <unk> , and novels utilising Knight 's book as a base include Robin Paige 's Death at Whitechapel ( New York : Berkley Publishing Group , 2000 ) and Anne Perry 's The Whitechapel Conspiracy ( London : Headline , 2001 ) . 
 = Nigel Cullen = 
 Richard Nigel Cullen , DFC ( 5 June 1917 – 4 March 1941 ) was an Australian fighter ace of World War II . Serving with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) , he was credited with as many as sixteen aerial victories before being killed in action during the Battle of Greece . Born in Newcastle , New South Wales , Cullen was living in London and had already seen action in the Spanish Civil War when he joined the RAF in 1937 . Following the outbreak of World War II , he served initially as a transport pilot with No. 267 Squadron in the Middle East before seeking reassignment to fighters . He was then posted to No. 80 Squadron , flying Gloster Gladiator biplanes , and claimed six Axis aircraft before the unit converted to Hawker Hurricanes . Nicknamed " Ape " due to his physical bulk , Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for destroying five enemy aircraft in a single sortie on 28 February 1941 . He was credited with another four victories in the one engagement on 3 March ; the next day , he was shot down and killed while on escort duty over Albania , by a Regia Aeronautica Fiat G.50bis , at age twenty @-@ three . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Born in Newcastle , New South Wales on 5 June 1917 , Nigel Cullen was the son of Horace David Cullen ( originally Horace David Cohen ) and his wife Hero . The boy 's uncle was future Major General Paul Alfred Cullen . Nigel was taken to England at an early age by his parents and attended Sherborne School in Dorset , before studying at the College of Aero Engineering , Chelsea . Fired by a love of adventure , he competed in motorbike racing at Brooklands in 1934 , and later saw action as a member of the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War , suffering a wound to the stomach that necessitated repatriation to England . When he caught up again with his friends from Brooklands , he was reluctant to talk about the conflict except to say that " the wars of the future would be fought in the air " . 
 Cullen was living in Putney when he joined the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) in 1937 , and was granted a short @-@ service commission as an acting pilot officer on 9 August . Completing his probation the following May , he was promoted to flying officer on 31 December 1939 , shortly after the outbreak of World War II . Posted to the Middle East , his early wartime service was with No. 267 Squadron , a transport unit ferrying passengers and freight to and from Egypt . " <unk> off " with transport duties , however , he sought reassignment to fighters and before long was able to effect a transfer to No. 80 Squadron , flying Gloster Gladiator biplanes , a type that was obsolescent well before the war began .

 = = = Gladiators = = = 
 After joining No. 80 Squadron in the Western Desert Campaign , Cullen was schooled in fighter tactics by " Pat " Pattle , one of the leading British aces of the war . Nicknamed " Ape " by his colleagues due to his imposing physique , he was described by a fellow pilot as " a big , smiling , long @-@ armed giant from Putney , with an irresistible offensive spirit and quite fearless " . 
 Cullen was " blooded " on 9 October 1940 , after being detailed to search single @-@ handedly for a missing Allied truck . Failing to locate the vehicle , he spotted five Italian Breda <unk> ground @-@ attack aircraft south of Sidi Barrani and immediately engaged them , gaining credit for probably destroying one , although the Italians reported all aircraft as returning to base . No. 80 Squadron redeployed to Greece the following month , to assist in resisting the Italian invasion . There Cullen achieved his first confirmed victory , over a Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.81 three @-@ engined bomber near the Kassandra Peninsula on 30 December . He was promoted to flight lieutenant the next day . 
 On 28 January 1941 , Cullen claimed his second " kill " . That day , while on an offensive patrol between <unk> and <unk> , over Albania , with fourteen Gladiators from No. 80 Squadron , he attacked four Fiat <unk> and five CANT Z.1007bis bombers of the Regia Aeronautica . He reported destroying a Z.1007bis but may have been firing at an aircraft that was shot down by Pattle 's section . Cullen claimed a Fiat CR.42 fighter and a Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bomber on successive days , 9 and 10 February respectively . He then recorded two victories in one mission on 20 February , over Albania . After sending a Fiat G.50 down in flames while escorting Allied bombers , he discovered two formations of CR.42s nearby and shot down one of them . Cullen later remarked , " The others made off at once . Just as well — I hadn 't any ammo left . " He had also been slightly wounded in the hand by a bullet . 
 Although the RAF claimed six Italian aircraft destroyed and two probables , including Cullen 's , on 20 February , Italian sources reported only the Fiat G.50 of Tenente Alfredo Fusco of the <unk> Squadriglia as shot down , killing the pilot , and the G.50 of Tenente Livio Bassi of <unk> Squadriglia as damaged in combat and later destroyed by fire in an attempted forced landing at Berat . On 23 February , Cullen attacked a CANT <unk> three @-@ engined floatplane as it was taking off at Preveza in Greece , at first simply attempting to prevent it from getting airborne but then , when it refused to stop , destroying it on a second pass . The result did not add to his official score , however , as the Italian plane was not in full flight at the time of its destruction . 
 = = = Hurricanes = = = 
 By the time No. 80 Squadron began re @-@ equipping with Hawker Hurricanes in February 1941 , Cullen 's total of aerial victories stood at six enemy aircraft destroyed , plus one probable . He had earned a reputation for extreme aggression and doggedness in the air . His favourite tactic was to duel head @-@ on with his intended victim , two aircraft firing at each other with a closing speed of over 500 miles per hour ( 800 km / h ) ; he was quoted as saying , " It 's always interesting to see who will pull away first " . His colleagues reportedly said of him , " He never came out of a fight while a single enemy aircraft was left in the sky to give battle . He came home only when his guns were empty . " Cullen opened his score in the Hurricane on 27 February , shooting down a Fiat CR.42 while escorting Bristol Blenheim light bombers to Valona , Albania . The day after , in what has been described as " the greatest air battle of this period " , he was officially credited with shooting down five Italian planes in the one engagement , a record for his unit . His combat report read : 
 The battle <unk> right across Albania . First , I found four Breda 20s . I got one , which went down in flames . There we found three formations of <unk> I took on one and aimed at the starboard engine . It caught fire and crashed in flames . I climbed and dived on the next . He too crashed in flames . Then we attacked ten CR.42s , climbing to get above them . I got behind one , and he caught fire and went down in flames . Up again immediately – dived , fired into the cockpit and another one took fire , rolled over and crashed . I had to come home then – no more ammo . 
 For his achievements on 28 February , the RAF 's most successful day of the campaign , Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) . Italian sources recorded that a Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 was only damaged on 28 February , not shot down , and that the Breda 20s claimed by the RAF were in fact Fiat <unk> Cullen claimed another multiple kill on 3 March , when he and one of his comrades chased a group of CANT Z.1007bis that had just bombed Larissa , Greece . Catching the retreating bombers south @-@ west of Corfu , No. 80 Squadron claimed six destroyed and one probable . Cullen was credited with destroying four <unk> and probably destroying another , though the Italians reported that only two CANT bombers were lost . 
 The following day , 4 March , flying Hurricane <unk> , Cullen was escorting a group of Blenheims near Himarë in southern Albania . Once the Blenheims had bombed their target ( five Italian warships ) and were on their return flight , Flight Lieutenant Pattle ordered the Hurricanes to hunt in pairs over the warships , where a number of Italian fighters were seen . At once a lone G.50bis attacked Pattle and his wingman , on this occasion Cullen . Pattle reported shooting down the Fiat and watching it spiral into a mountainside , but at this moment a second Fiat jumped Cullen 's Hurricane and he was not seen again . His aircraft crashed near Himarë , and the Australian was killed ; he was twenty @-@ three years old . The citation for his DFC was promulgated in the London Gazette on 14 March : 
 In February , 1941 , this officer was pilot of one of a formation of aircraft which attacked a large force of enemy bombers escorted by at least 30 fighters . Displaying remarkable skill , Flight Lieutenant Cullen shot down five of the enemy 's aircraft in the ensuing action . He has now destroyed 11 enemy aircraft and has consistently shown great resource and courage . 
 Although the official history of Australia in the war puts the number of Cullen 's victories at thirteen , his total score is more commonly estimated as sixteen , or sixteen @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half . He is buried in Tirana Park Memorial Cemetery , Tirana , Albania . His name appears on the Commemorative Roll at the Australian War Memorial , Canberra .

 Interstate 705 ( abbreviated I @-@ 705 , also known as the Tacoma Spur ) is a short Interstate Highway spur route of Interstate 5 located entirely within Tacoma , Pierce , Washington , United States . I @-@ 705 serves as the connector between Interstate 5 , Downtown Tacoma , Tacoma 's waterfront , North Tacoma , and the Tacoma Dome . I @-@ 705 was the last portion of the Interstate Highway System to be constructed in Washington . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The Tacoma Spur begins as a continuation of Washington State Route 7 ( SR 7 ) underneath I @-@ 5 in Tacoma , and has a posted speed limit of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) for the entire length ( 1 @.@ 5 Miles ) . 
 Traveling northbound as a continuation of SR 7 , the first exit is for South 26th Street , which provides access to the Tacoma Dome , the Tacoma Dome transit hub and the Tacoma Amtrak station . A single @-@ point urban interchange ( SPUI ) with SR 509 ( South 21st Street ) provides access to the University of Washington Tacoma campus , as well as the Port of Tacoma via the East 21st Street Bridge . The left two lanes of I @-@ 705 separate , providing access to A Street , as well as South 15th Street / Pacific Avenue , however travelers merging onto northbound I @-@ 705 can not access this exit . The Bridge of Glass , linking the Museum of Glass on the <unk> to downtown Tacoma , passes over I @-@ 705 as it continues north , paralleling the Thea Foss Waterway to the east , and <unk> Park to the west . A signalled at @-@ grade intersection with Stadium Way marks the end of I @-@ 705 northbound . 
 Traveling southbound towards I @-@ 5 , I @-@ 705 begins with on ramps from Stadium Way South and from Schuster Parkway . Passing <unk> Park on the south , traffic from South 9th Street and A Street merge onto I @-@ 705 . Traffic coming from Bates Technical College and South 13th Street join the freeway , as well as traffic from South A Street . A SPUI with SR 509 ( South 21st Street ) is the only exit in Tacoma , before either exiting onto I @-@ 5 southbound towards Portland , Oregon , I @-@ 5 northbound towards Seattle and Vancouver , British Columbia , or onto SR 7 . 
 Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that as few as 26 @,@ 000 cars used the spur at the continuation point from SR 7 , and as many as 72 @,@ 000 cars between the onramp from I @-@ 5 and SR 509 . The entire Tacoma Spur is listed on both the WSDOT List of Highways of Statewide Significance , which marks the highway as a critical to connecting major communities in the state , and the National Highway System , a system of roads that are important to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility .

 The Tacoma Spur was first codified into law by the Washington State Legislature in 1979 ; however due to federal budget cuts , construction on the freeway was not completed until 1990 . The highway was the last Interstate to be completed in the state of Washington . The Tacoma City Council in 1992 proposed to name the freeway Martin Luther King Way , however that name was finally applied to nearby K Street . Work on the single @-@ point urban interchange , costing $ 29 @.@ 4 million ( equivalent to $ 48 million in 2016 ) , was completed in 1993 to accommodate the changes that were made to SR 509 through Tacoma .

 = George Harrison = 
 George Harrison , MBE ( 25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001 ) was an English guitarist , singer , songwriter , and music and film producer who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles . Often referred to as " the quiet Beatle " , Harrison embraced Indian mysticism and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music . Although the majority of the Beatles ' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions . His songs for the group included " Taxman " , " Within You Without You " , " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " , " Here Comes the Sun " and " Something " , the last of which became the Beatles ' second @-@ most covered song . 
 Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt ; Carl Perkins , Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences . By 1965 he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on " Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) " . Having initiated the band 's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967 , he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement . After the band 's break @-@ up in 1970 , Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass , a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single , " My Sweet Lord " , and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist , the slide guitar . He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar , a precursor for later benefit concerts such as Live Aid . In his role as a music and film producer , Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles ' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974 and co @-@ founding HandMade Films in 1978 . 
 Harrison released several best @-@ selling singles and albums as a solo performer , and in 1988 co @-@ founded the platinum @-@ selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys . A prolific recording artist , he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger , Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston , and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan , Eric Clapton , Ringo Starr and Tom Petty , among others . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the " 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time " . He is a two @-@ time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988 , and ( posthumously ) for his solo career in 2004 . 
 Harrison 's first marriage , to model Pattie Boyd in 1966 , ended in divorce in 1977 . The following year he married Olivia Harrison ( née Arias ) , with whom he had one son , Dhani . Harrison died in 2001 , aged 58 , from lung cancer . He was cremated and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India , in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition . He left an estate of almost £ 100 million . 
 = = Early years : 1943 – 57 = = 
 Born in Liverpool , England , on 25 February 1943 , Harrison was the youngest of four children of Harold Hargreaves Harrison and his wife Louise ( née French ) . He had one sister , Louise , and two brothers , Harry and Peter . His mother was a shop assistant from a Catholic family with Irish roots , and his father was a bus conductor who had worked as a ship 's steward on the White Star Line . His future wife , the model Pattie Boyd , described Harrison 's parents as " quite short and very Liverpudlian " . According to Boyd , Harrison 's mother was particularly supportive : " All she wanted for her children is that they should be happy , and she recognized that nothing made George quite as happy as making music . " An enthusiastic music fan , she was known among friends for her loud singing voice , which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons ' windows . While pregnant with George , she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India . Harrison 's biographer Joshua Greene wrote , " Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas , hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb . " 
 Harrison was born and lived the first six years of his life at 12 Arnold Grove , Wavertree , Liverpool ; a terraced house in a dead end street . The home had an outdoor toilet and its only heat came from a single coal fire . In 1949 the family were offered a council house and moved to 25 Upton Green , Speke . In 1948 , at the age of five , Harrison enrolled at Dovedale Primary School . He passed the eleven plus exam and attended Liverpool Institute High School for Boys from 1954 to 1959 . Though the institute did offer a music course , Harrison was disappointed with the absence of guitars , and felt the school " moulded [ students ] into being frightened " . 
 Harrison 's earliest musical influences included George Formby , Cab Calloway , Django Reinhardt and Hoagy Carmichael ; by the 1950s , Carl Perkins and Lonnie Donegan were significant influences . In early 1956 he had an epiphany : while riding his bicycle , he heard Elvis Presley 's " Heartbreak Hotel " playing from a nearby house , and the song piqued his interest in rock and roll . He often sat at the back of the class drawing guitars in his schoolbooks , and later commented , " I was totally into guitars . " Harrison cited Slim Whitman as another early influence : " The first person I ever saw playing a guitar was Slim Whitman , either a photo of him in a magazine or live on television . Guitars were definitely coming in . " 
 Although apprehensive about his son 's interest in pursuing a music career , in late 1956 Harrison 's father bought him a Dutch Egmond flat top acoustic guitar . A friend of his father 's taught Harrison how to play " Whispering " , " Sweet Sue " and " Dinah " , and , inspired by Donegan 's music , Harrison formed a skiffle group called the Rebels with his brother Peter and a friend , Arthur Kelly . On the bus to school Harrison met Paul McCartney , and the pair bonded over their shared love of music . 
 = = The Beatles : 1958 – 70 = = 
 Harrison became part of the Beatles when they were still a skiffle group called the Quarrymen , with McCartney and John Lennon as members . McCartney told Lennon about his friend George Harrison , who could play " Raunchy " on his guitar . In March 1958 , Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen at Rory Storm 's Morgue Skiffle Club , playing Arthur " Guitar Boogie " Smith 's " Guitar Boogie Shuffle " , but Lennon felt that Harrison , having just turned 15 , was too young to join the band . During a second meeting , arranged by McCartney , he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental " Raunchy " on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus . He began socialising with the group , filling in on guitar as needed , and became accepted as a member . Although his father wanted him to continue his education , Harrison left school at 16 and worked for several months as an apprentice electrician at <unk> , a local department store . During their first tour of Scotland , in 1960 , Harrison used the pseudonym " Carl Harrison " , in reference to Carl Perkins . 
 In 1960 , promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band , now calling themselves the Beatles , to play at the Kaiserkeller club in Hamburg owned by Bruno Koschmider . The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles , as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group , laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet , professional role within the group ; he was later known as " the quiet Beatle " . The band 's first residency in Hamburg ended prematurely when Harrison was deported for being too young to work in nightclubs . When Brian Epstein became their manager in December 1961 , he polished their image and secured them a recording contract with EMI . The group 's first single , " Love Me Do " , peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart , and by the time their debut album , Please Please Me , was released in early 1963 , Beatlemania had arrived . Their second album , With the Beatles ( 1963 ) , included " Don 't Bother Me " , Harrison 's first solo writing credit . 
 By 1965 's Rubber Soul , Harrison had begun to lead the other Beatles into folk rock through his interest in the Byrds and Bob Dylan , and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on " Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) " . He later called Rubber Soul his " favourite [ Beatles ] album " . Revolver ( 1966 ) included three of his compositions : " Taxman " , " Love You To " and " I Want to Tell You " . His introduction of the drone @-@ like tambura part on Lennon 's " Tomorrow Never Knows " exemplified the band 's ongoing exploration of non @-@ Western instruments . The tabla @-@ driven " Love You To " was the Beatles ' first genuine foray into Indian music . According to the ethnomusicologist David Reck , the song set a precedent in popular music as an example of Asian culture being represented by Westerners respectfully and without parody . Harrison continued to develop his interest in non @-@ Western instrumentation , playing swarmandal on " Strawberry Fields Forever " . 
 By late 1966 Harrison 's interests had moved away from the Beatles , as reflected in his choice of Eastern gurus and religious leaders for inclusion on the album cover for Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967 . His sole composition on the album was the Indian @-@ inspired " Within You Without You " , to which no other Beatle contributed . He played sitar and tambura on the track , backed by musicians from the London Asian Music Circle on dilruba , swarmandal and tabla . He later commented on the Sgt. Pepper album : " It was a millstone and a milestone in the music industry ... There 's about half the songs I like and the other half I can 't stand . " 
 In 1968 his song " The Inner Light " was recorded at EMI 's studio in Bombay , featuring a group of local musicians playing traditional Indian instruments . Released as the B @-@ side to McCartney 's " Lady Madonna " , it was the first Harrison composition to appear on a Beatles single . Derived from a quotation from the Tao Te Ching , the song 's lyric reflected Harrison 's deepening interest in Hinduism and meditation , while musically it embraced the Karnatak discipline of Indian music , rather than the Hindustani style of his previous work in the genre . During the recording of The Beatles that same year , tensions within the group ran high , and drummer Ringo Starr quit briefly . Harrison 's songwriting contributions to the double album included " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " , which featured Eric Clapton on lead guitar , " Piggies " , " Long , Long , Long " and " Savoy Truffle " . 
 Dylan and the Band were a major musical influence on Harrison at the end of his career with the Beatles . While on a visit to Woodstock in late 1968 , he established a friendship with Dylan and found himself drawn to the Band 's sense of communal music @-@ making and to the creative equality among the band members , which contrasted with Lennon and McCartney 's domination of the Beatles ' songwriting and creative direction . This coincided with a prolific period in his songwriting and a growing desire to assert his independence from the band . Tensions among the Beatles surfaced again in January 1969 , during the filming of rehearsals at Twickenham Studios for what became the album Let It Be . Frustrated by the poor working conditions in the cold and sterile film studio , as well as by what he perceived as Lennon 's creative disengagement from the Beatles and a domineering attitude from McCartney , Harrison quit the group on 10 January , but agreed to return twelve days later . 
 Relations among the Beatles were more cordial , though still strained , during sessions for their final recorded album , Abbey Road . The LP included two of Harrison 's most respected Beatles compositions : " Here Comes the Sun " and " Something " , which became one half of the Beatles ' first number one double A @-@ side single , Harrison 's first A @-@ side , and the first Harrison song to reach the top of the charts . In 1969 Frank Sinatra recorded " Something " , and later dubbed it " the greatest love song of the past fifty years " . Lennon considered it the best song on Abbey Road , and it became the Beatles ' second most covered song after " Yesterday " . Author Peter Lavezzoli wrote : " Harrison would finally achieve equal songwriting status ... with his two classic contributions to the final Beatles ' LP " . 
 In April 1970 when Harrison 's " For You Blue " was released in America as a double A @-@ side with McCartney 's " The Long and Winding Road " , it became the band 's second chart @-@ topping double A @-@ side and " For You Blue " became Harrison 's second number one hit . His increased productivity and the Beatles ' reluctance to include his songs on their albums meant that by the time of their break @-@ up he had amassed a stockpile of unreleased compositions . While Harrison grew as a songwriter , his compositional presence on Beatles albums remained limited to two or three songs , increasing his frustration , and significantly contributing to the band 's break @-@ up . Harrison 's last recording session with the Beatles was on 4 January 1970 , when he , McCartney and Starr recorded the Harrison song " I Me Mine " .

 Before the Beatles ' break @-@ up , Harrison had already recorded and released two solo albums : Wonderwall Music and Electronic Sound , both of which contain mainly instrumental compositions . Wonderwall Music , a soundtrack to the 1968 film Wonderwall , blends Indian and Western instrumentation , while Electronic Sound is an experimental album that prominently features a Moog synthesizer . Released in November 1968 , Wonderwall Music was the first solo album by a Beatle and the first LP released by Apple Records . Indian musicians Aashish Khan and Shivkumar Sharma performed on the album , which contains the experimental sound collage " Dream Scene " , recorded several months before Lennon 's " Revolution 9 " . 
 In December 1969 , Harrison participated in a brief tour of Europe with the American group Delaney & Bonnie and Friends . During the tour that included Clapton , Bobby Whitlock , drummer Jim Gordon and band leaders Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett , Harrison began to write " My Sweet Lord " , which became his first single as a solo artist . Delaney Bramlett inspired Harrison to learn slide guitar , significantly influencing his later music . 
 = = = All Things Must Pass : 1970 = = = 
 After years of being restricted in his songwriting contributions to the Beatles ' albums , Harrison released All Things Must Pass , a triple album , with two discs of his songs and the third of recordings of Harrison jamming with friends . Regarded by many as his best work , the album topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic . The LP produced the number @-@ one hit single " My Sweet Lord " and the top @-@ ten single " What Is Life " . The album was co @-@ produced by Phil Spector using his " Wall of Sound " approach , and the musicians included Starr , Clapton , Gary Wright , Preston , Klaus Voormann , the whole of Delaney and Bonnie 's Friends band and the Apple group Badfinger . On release , All Things Must Pass was received with critical acclaim ; Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone described it as being " of classic <unk> proportions , Wagnerian , Brucknerian , the music of mountain tops and vast horizons " . Author and musicologist Ian Inglis considers the lyrics of the album 's title track " a recognition of the impermanence of human existence ... a simple and poignant conclusion " to Harrison 's former band . In 1971 Bright Tunes sued Harrison for copyright infringement over " My Sweet Lord " owing to its similarity to the 1963 Chiffons hit " He 's So Fine " . When the case was heard in the United States district court in 1976 , he denied deliberately plagiarising the song , but lost the case as the judge ruled that he had done so subconsciously . 
 In 2000 Apple Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of the album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion , giving an interview during which he reflected on the work : " It 's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles , really . It was me sort of getting out of the Beatles and just going my own way ... it was a very happy occasion . " He commented on the production : " Well , in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what I would do now . In fact , I don 't use reverb at all . I can 't stand it ... You know , it 's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now . " 
 = = = The Concert for Bangladesh : 1971 = = = 
 Responding to a request from Ravi Shankar , Harrison organised a charity event , the Concert for Bangladesh , which took place on 1 August 1971 , drawing over 40 @,@ 000 people to two shows in New York 's Madison Square Garden . The goal of the event was to raise money to aid starving refugees during the Bangladesh Liberation War . Shankar opened the show , which featured popular musicians such as Dylan , Clapton , Leon Russell , Badfinger , Preston and Starr . 
 A triple album , The Concert for Bangladesh , was released by Apple Corps that year , followed by a concert film in 1972 . Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds , but Harrison commented : " Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation ... The money we raised was secondary , and although we had some money problems ... they still got plenty ... even though it was a drop in the ocean . The main thing was , we spread the word and helped get the war ended . " The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large @-@ scale charity rock shows that followed , including Live Aid .

 Harrison would not again release an album that matched the critical and commercial achievements of All Things Must Pass ; however , his next solo album , 1973 's Living in the Material World , held the number one spot on the Billboard album chart for five weeks , and the album 's single , " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " , also reached number one in the US . In the UK , the LP achieved number two , spending 12 weeks on the charts with the single peaking at number 8 . The album was lavishly produced and packaged , and its dominant message was Harrison 's Hindu beliefs . In Greene 's opinion it " contained many of the strongest compositions of his career " . Stephen Holden , writing in Rolling Stone , felt the album was " vastly appealing " and " profoundly seductive " , and that it stood " alone as an article of faith , miraculous in its radiance . " Other reviewers were less enthusiastic , describing the release as awkward , sanctimonious and overly sentimental , a reaction that left Harrison despondent . 
 In November 1974 Harrison began his 45 @-@ date Dark Horse Tour , becoming the first ex @-@ Beatle to tour North America . In addition to performances by Harrison with an ensemble of musicians such as Preston , Tom Scott , Willie Weeks , Andy Newmark and Jim Horn , the tour also included traditional and contemporary Indian music performed by " Ravi Shankar , Family and Friends " . Despite numerous positive reviews the consensus reaction to the tour was negative , with complaints about the content , structure , and length ; the show 's duration of two and a half hours was seen as excessive at the time . Some fans found Shankar 's significant presence a bizarre disappointment , having expected to see only Harrison perform , and many were affronted by what Inglis described as Harrison 's " sermonizing " . Further , he reworked the lyrics to several Beatles songs , and some of the substitutions were seen as " gratuitously offensive " . His laryngitis @-@ affected vocals also disappointed fans and critics , who began calling the tour " dark hoarse " . Harrison was so deeply bothered by the caustic backlash that he did not tour again until the 1990s . The author Robert Rodriguez commented : " While the Dark Horse tour might be considered a noble failure , there were a number of fans who were tuned @-@ in to what was being attempted . They went away ecstatic , conscious that they had just witnessed something so uplifting that it could never be repeated . " Leng called the tour " groundbreaking " and " revolutionary in its presentation of Indian Music " . 
 In December Harrison released Dark Horse , an album that earned him the least favourable reviews of his career . Rolling Stone called it " the chronicle of a performer out of his element , working to a deadline , enfeebling his overtaxed talents by a rush to deliver a new ' LP product ' , rehearse a band , and assemble a cross @-@ country tour , all within three weeks " . The album reached number 4 on the Billboard chart and the single " Dark Horse " reached number 15 , but they failed to make an impact in the UK . The music critic Mikal Gilmore described Dark Horse as " one of Harrison 's most fascinating works – a record about change and loss " . 
 Harrison 's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was the soul music @-@ inspired Extra Texture ( Read All About It ) ( 1975 ) . He considered it the least satisfactory of the three he had recorded since All Things Must Pass . Leng identified " bitterness and dismay " in many of the album 's tracks ; his long @-@ time friend Klaus Voormann commented : " He wasn 't up for it ... It was a terrible time because I think there was a lot of cocaine going around , and that 's when I got out of the picture ... I didn 't like his frame of mind " . He released two singles from the LP : " You " , which reached the Billboard top 20 , and " This Guitar ( Can 't Keep from Crying ) " , Apple 's final original single release . 
 Thirty Three & 1 / 3 ( 1976 ) , Harrison 's first album release on his own Dark Horse Records label , produced the hit singles " This Song " and " Crackerbox Palace " , both of which reached the top 25 in the US . The surreal humour of " Crackerbox Palace " reflected Harrison 's association with Monty Python 's Eric Idle , who directed a comical music video for the song . With an emphasis on melody and musicianship , and a more subtle subject matter than the pious message of his earlier works , Thirty Three & 1 / 3 earned Harrison his most favourable critical notices in the US since All Things Must Pass . 
 In 1979 , following his second marriage and the birth of his son Dhani , he released George Harrison . The album and the single " Blow Away " both made the Billboard top 20 . The album marked the beginning of Harrison 's gradual retreat from the music business , and the fruition of ideas introduced on All Things Must Pass . In 1978 the death of his father in May and the birth of his son in August had influenced his decision to devote more time to his family than to his career . Leng described the album as " melodic and lush ... peaceful ... the work of a man who had lived the rock and roll dream twice over and was now embracing domestic as well as spiritual bliss " .

 The murder of Lennon on 8 December 1980 disturbed Harrison and reinforced his decades @-@ long concerns about stalkers . It was also a deep personal loss , although unlike McCartney and Starr , Harrison had had little contact with Lennon in the years before his death . Following the murder , Harrison commented : " After all we went through together I had and still have great love and respect for John Lennon . I am shocked and stunned . " 
 Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had written for Starr to make it a tribute song to Lennon . " All Those Years Ago " , which included vocal contributions from Paul and Linda McCartney , as well as Starr 's original drum part , peaked at number two in the US charts . The single was included on the album Somewhere in England in 1981 . Harrison did not release any new albums for five years after 1982 's Gone Troppo received little notice from critics or the public . 
 During this period he made several guest appearances , including a 1985 performance at a tribute to Carl Perkins titled Blue Suede Shoes : A Rockabilly Session . In March 1986 he made a surprise appearance during the finale of the Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert , an event organised to raise money for the Birmingham Children 's Hospital . The following year , he appeared at The Prince 's Trust concert at London 's Wembley Arena , performing " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " and " Here Comes the Sun " . In February 1987 he joined Dylan , John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two @-@ hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal . Harrison recalled : " Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal ... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more ... Bob says , ' Hey , why don 't we all get up and play , and you can sing ? ' But every time I got near the microphone , Dylan comes up and just starts singing this rubbish in my ear , trying to throw me . " 
 In November 1987 Harrison released the platinum album Cloud Nine . Co @-@ produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra , the LP included Harrison 's rendition of James Ray 's " Got My Mind Set on You " , which went to number one in the US and number two in the UK . The accompanying music video received substantial airplay , and another single , " When We Was Fab " , a retrospective of the Beatles ' career , earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988 . Recorded at his estate in Friar Park , Harrison 's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album , which included several of his long @-@ time musical collaborators , including Clapton , Jim Keltner , and Jim Horn , who recalled Harrison 's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions : " George made you feel at home , in his home ... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax , and they miked it at the end of the hall for a distant sound . I thought they were kidding ... Another time he stopped me in the middle of a sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea — again I thought he was kidding . " Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively , and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboard 's Mainstream Rock chart – " Devil 's Radio " , " This Is Love " and " Cloud 9 " .

 In 1988 Harrison formed the Traveling Wilburys with Jeff Lynne , Roy Orbison , Bob Dylan and Tom Petty . The band had gathered in Dylan 's garage to record a song for a Harrison European single release . Harrison 's record company decided the track , " Handle with Care " , was too good for its original purpose as a B @-@ side and asked for a full album . The LP , Traveling Wilburys Vol . 1 , was released in October 1988 and recorded under pseudonyms as half @-@ brothers , supposed sons of Charles Truscott Wilbury , Sr. Harrison 's pseudonym on the first album was " Nelson Wilbury " ; he used the name " Spike Wilbury " for their second album . 
 After Orbison 's death in December 1988 the group recorded as a four @-@ piece . Their second release , issued in October 1990 , was mischievously titled Traveling Wilburys Vol . 3 . According to Lynne , " That was George 's idea . He said , ' Let 's confuse the buggers . ' " It reached number 14 in the UK , where it went platinum with certified sales of more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 units . The Wilburys never performed live and the group did not record together again following the release of their second album . 
 In 1989 Harrison and Starr appeared in the music video for Tom Petty 's song " I Won 't Back Down " . Starr is filmed playing the drums , but did not play on the track ; Harrison played acoustic guitar and provided backing vocals . In December 1991 , Harrison joined Clapton for a tour of Japan . It was Harrison 's first since 1974 and no others followed . On 6 April 1992 , Harrison held a benefit concert for the Natural Law Party at the Royal Albert Hall , his first London performance since the Beatles ' 1969 rooftop concert . In October 1992 he performed at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City , playing alongside Dylan , Clapton , McGuinn , Petty and Neil Young . 
 = = = The Beatles Anthology : 1995 – 96 = = = 
 In 1994 Harrison began a collaboration with McCartney , Starr and producer Jeff Lynne for the Beatles Anthology project . This included the recording of two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles ' career . Released in December 1995 , " Free as a Bird " was the first new Beatles single since 1970 . In March 1996 , they released a second single , " Real Love " . Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song . He later commented on the project : " I hope somebody does this to all my crap demos when I 'm dead , make them into hit songs . " 
 Following the Anthology project , Harrison collaborated with Ravi Shankar on the latter 's Chants of India . Harrison 's final television appearance was a VH @-@ 1 special to promote the album , taped in May 1997 . In January 1998 , Harrison attended Carl Perkins 's funeral in Jackson , Tennessee , performing a brief rendition of Perkins 's song " Your True Love " . In June 1998 , he attended the public memorial service for Linda McCartney , and appeared on Starr 's album Vertical Man , playing guitar on two tracks . 
 = = Later life and death : 1997 – 2001 = = 
 In 1997 , Harrison was diagnosed with throat cancer and treated with radiotherapy , which was thought at the time to be successful . He publicly blamed years of smoking for the illness . On 30 December 1999 , Harrison and his wife were attacked at their home , Friar Park . A 36 @-@ year @-@ old , Michael Abram , broke in and attacked Harrison with a kitchen knife , puncturing a lung and causing head injuries before Olivia Harrison incapacitated the assailant by striking him repeatedly with a poker and a lamp . Following the attack , Harrison was hospitalised with more than forty stab wounds . He released a statement soon after regarding his assailant : " [ he ] wasn 't a burglar , and he certainly wasn 't auditioning for the Traveling Wilburys . " 
 In May 2001 , it was revealed that he had undergone an operation to remove a cancerous growth from one of his lungs , and in July , it was reported that he was being treated for a brain tumour at a clinic in Switzerland . While in Switzerland , Starr visited him , but had to cut his stay short to travel to Boston , where his daughter was undergoing emergency brain surgery , prompting Harrison to quip : " Do you want me to come with you ? " In November 2001 , he began radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City for non @-@ small cell lung cancer that had spread to his brain . When the news was publicised , Harrison bemoaned his physician 's breach of privacy , and his estate later claimed damages . On 12 November , in New York , Harrison , Starr , and McCartney came together for the last time . Three weeks later , on 29 November 2001 , Harrison died at a friend 's home in Los Angeles , aged 58 . He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery , his funeral was held at the Self @-@ Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in the Pacific Palisades , California , and his ashes were scattered in the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers near Varanasi , India , by his close family in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition . He left almost £ 100 million in his will . 
 Harrison 's final album , the posthumously released Brainwashed ( 2002 ) , was completed by his son Dhani and Jeff Lynne . Included in the album 's liner notes is a quotation from the Bhagavad Gita : " There never was a time when you or I did not exist . Nor will there be any future when we shall cease to be . " A media @-@ only single , " Stuck Inside a Cloud " , which Leng described as " a uniquely candid reaction to illness and mortality " , achieved number 27 on Billboard 's Adult Contemporary chart . The single " Any Road " , released in May 2003 , reached number 37 on the UK Singles Chart . " Marwa Blues " went on to receive the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance , while " Any Road " was nominated for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance .

 = = = Songwriting = = = 
 George Harrison wrote his first song , " Don 't Bother Me " , while sick in a hotel bed in Bournemouth during August 1963 , as " an exercise to see if I could write a song " , as he remembered . " Don 't Bother Me " appeared on the band 's second album , With the Beatles , later that year , then on Meet the Beatles ! in the US in early 1964 . In 1965 , he contributed " I Need You " and " You Like Me Too Much " to the album Help ! 
 Harrison 's songwriting ability improved throughout the Beatles ' career , but his material did not earn full respect from Lennon , McCartney and producer George Martin until near the group 's break @-@ up . In 1969 , McCartney told Lennon : " Until this year , our songs have been better than George 's . Now this year his songs are at least as good as ours " . Harrison often had difficulty getting the band to record his songs . Most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contain at least two Harrison compositions ; three of his songs appear on Revolver , " the album on which Harrison came of age as a songwriter " , according to Inglis . 
 Of the 1967 Harrison song " Within You Without You " , author Gerry Farrell claimed that Harrison had created a " new form " , calling the composition " a quintessential fusion of pop and Indian music " . Lennon called the song one of Harrison 's best : " His mind and his music are clear . There is his innate talent , he brought that sound together . " Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described " Something " as a masterpiece , and " an intensely stirring romantic ballad that would challenge ' Yesterday ' and ' Michelle ' as one of the most recognizable songs they ever produced " . According to Kenneth Womack , " Harrison comes into his own on Abbey Road ... ' Here Comes the Sun ' is matched – indeed , surpassed – only by ' Something ' , his crowning achievement " . Inglis considered Abbey Road a turning point in Harrison 's development as a songwriter and musician . He described Harrison 's contributions to the LP as " exquisite " , declaring them equal to any previous Beatles songs . During the album 's recording , Harrison asserted more creative control than before , proactively rejecting suggestions for changes to his music or lyrics , particularly from McCartney . 
 His interest in Indian music proved a strong influence on his songwriting and contributed to his innovation within the Beatles . According to Mikal Gilmore of Rolling Stone , " Harrison 's openness to new sounds and textures cleared new paths for his rock and roll compositions . His use of dissonance on ... ' Taxman ' and ' I Want to Tell You ' was revolutionary in popular music – and perhaps more originally creative than the avant @-@ garde mannerisms that Lennon and McCartney borrowed from the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen , Luciano Berio , Edgard Varèse and Igor Stravinsky ... " In 1997 , Gerry Farrell commented : " It is a mark of Harrison 's sincere involvement ... that , nearly thirty years on , the Beatles ' ' Indian ' songs remain the most imaginative and successful examples of this type of fusion . " 
 = = = Guitar work = = = 
 Harrison 's guitar work with the Beatles was varied and flexible ; although not fast or flashy , his lead guitar playing was solid and typified the more subdued lead guitar style of the early 1960s ; his rhythm guitar playing was as innovative , such as using a capo to shorten the strings on an acoustic guitar , as on the Rubber Soul album and " Here Comes the Sun " , to create a bright , sweet sound . Eric Clapton felt that Harrison was " clearly an innovator " as he was " taking certain elements of R & B and rock and rockabilly and creating something unique " . Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner described Harrison as " a guitarist who was never showy but who had an innate , eloquent melodic sense . He played exquisitely in the service of the song " . Harrison 's friend and former bandmate Tom Petty agreed : " He just had a way of getting right to the business , of finding the right thing to play . " The guitar picking style of Chet Atkins and Carl Perkins influenced Harrison , giving a country music feel to many of the Beatles ' recordings . He identified Chuck Berry as an early influence and Ry Cooder as an important later influence . 
 In 1961 the Beatles recorded " Cry for a Shadow " , a blues @-@ inspired instrumental co @-@ written by Lennon and Harrison , who is credited with composing the song 's lead guitar part , building on unusual chord voicings and imitating the style of other English groups such as the Shadows . The musicologist Walter Everett noted that while early Beatles compositions typically held close to the conventional patterns in rock music at the time , he also identified significant variations in their rhythm and tonal direction . Harrison 's liberal use of the diatonic scale in his guitar playing reveals the influence of Buddy Holly , and his interest in Berry inspired him to compose songs based on the blues scale while incorporating a rockabilly feel in the style of Perkins . Within this framework he often utilised syncopation , as during his guitar solos for the Beatles ' covers of Berry 's " Roll Over Beethoven " and " Too Much Monkey Business " . Another of Harrison 's musical techniques was the use of guitar lines written in octaves , as on " I 'll Be on My Way " . He was the first person to own a Rickenbacker 360 / 12 , a guitar with twelve strings , the low eight of which are tuned in pairs , one octave apart ; the higher four being pairs tuned in unison . The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve @-@ string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string . This , and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve @-@ string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles ' recordings . His use of this guitar during the recording of A Hard Day 's Night helped to popularise the model , and the jangly sound became so prominent that Melody Maker termed it the Beatles ' " secret weapon " . 
 Harrison wrote the chord progression of his first published song , " Don 't Bother Me " ( 1963 ) , almost exclusively in the Dorian mode , demonstrating an interest in exotic tones that eventually culminated in his embrace of Indian music . The dark timbre of his guitar playing on the track was accentuated by his use of uncomplicated yet effective C + 9 chord voicings and a solo in the minor pentatonic scale . By 1964 he had begun to develop a distinctive personal style as a guitarist , writing parts that featured the use of <unk> tones , as with the ending chord arpeggios on " A Hard Day 's Night " . In 1965 he used an expression pedal to control his guitar 's volume on " I Need You " , creating a syncopated <unk> effect with the melody resolving its dissonance through tonal displacements . He used the same volume @-@ swell technique on " Yes It Is " , applying what Everett described as " ghostly articulation " to the song 's natural harmonics . 
 Of Rubber Soul 's " If I Needed Someone " , Harrison said : " it 's like a million other songs written around the D chord . If you move your fingers about , you get various little melodies ... it amazes me that people still find new permutations of the same notes . " His other contribution to the album , " Think for Yourself " , features what Everett described as " ambiguous tonal coloring " , utilising chromaticism in G major with a " strange " mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic ; he called it a " tour de force of altered scale degrees " . In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver . He played backwards guitar on Lennon 's composition " I 'm Only Sleeping " and a guitar counter @-@ melody on " And Your Bird Can Sing " that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney 's bass <unk> . His guitar playing on " I Want to Tell You " exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Pepper 's " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " mirrors Lennon 's vocal line in much the same way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song . 
 Everett described Harrison 's guitar solo from " Old Brown Shoe " as " stinging [ and ] highly <unk> " . He identified two of the composition 's significant motifs : a bluesy trichord and a diminished triad with roots in A and E. Huntley called the song " a sizzling rocker with a ferocious ... solo " . In Greene 's opinion , Harrison 's demo for " Old Brown Shoe " contains " one of the most complex lead guitar solos on any Beatles song " . 
 Harrison 's playing on Abbey Road , and in particular on " Something " , marked a significant moment in his development as a guitarist . The song 's guitar solo shows a varied range of influences , incorporating the blues guitar style of Clapton and the styles of Indian <unk> . According to author and musicologist Kenneth Womack : " ' Something ' meanders toward the most unforgettable of Harrison 's guitar solos ... A masterpiece in simplicity , [ it ] reaches toward the sublime " . Harrison received an Ivor Novello award in July 1970 for " Something " , as " The Best Song Musically and Lyrically of the Year " . 
 After Delaney Bramlett inspired him to learn slide guitar , Harrison began to incorporate it into his solo work , which allowed him to mimic many traditional Indian instruments , including the sarangi and the dilruba . Leng described Harrison 's slide guitar solo on Lennon 's " How Do You Sleep ? " as a departure for " the sweet soloist of ' Something ' " , calling his playing " rightly famed ... one of Harrison 's greatest guitar statements " . Lennon commented : " That 's the best he 's ever fucking played in his life . " 
 A Hawaiian influence is notable in much of Harrison 's music , ranging from his slide guitar work on Gone Troppo ( 1982 ) to his televised performance of the Cab Calloway standard " Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea " on ukulele in 1992 . Lavezzoli described Harrison 's slide playing on the Grammy @-@ winning instrumental " Marwa Blues " ( 2002 ) as demonstrating Hawaiian influences while comparing the melody to an Indian sarod or veena , calling it " yet another demonstration of Harrison 's unique slide approach " . Harrison was an admirer of George Formby and a member of the Ukulele Society of Great Britain , and played a ukulele solo in the style of Formby at the end of " Free as a Bird " . He performed at a Formby convention in 1991 , and served as the honorary president of the George Formby Appreciation Society . Harrison played bass guitar on numerous tracks , including the Beatles songs " She Said She Said " , " Golden Slumbers " , " Birthday " and " Honey Pie " . He also played bass on several solo recordings , including " Faster " , " Wake Up My Love " and " Bye Bye Love " .

 When Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 his main guitar was a Höfner President Acoustic , which he soon traded for a Höfner Club 40 model . His first solid @-@ body electric guitar was a Czech @-@ built <unk> Futurama / <unk> . The guitars he used on early recordings were mainly Gretsch models , played through a Vox amplifier , including a Gretsch Duo Jet that he bought secondhand in 1961 , and posed with on the album cover for Cloud Nine ( 1987 ) . He also bought a Gretsch Tennessean and a Gretsch Country Gentleman , which he played on " She Loves You " , and during the Beatles ' 1964 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show . In 1963 he bought a Rickenbacker 425 <unk> , and in 1964 he acquired a Rickenbacker 360 / 12 guitar , which was the second of its kind to be manufactured . Harrison obtained his first Fender Stratocaster in 1965 and used it in recording Rubber Soul , notably on the song " Nowhere Man " . 
 In early 1966 Harrison , Lennon , and McCartney each purchased Epiphone Casinos , which they used on Revolver . Harrison also used a Gibson J @-@ <unk> and a Gibson SG Standard while recording the album . He later painted his Stratocaster in a psychedelic design that included the word " <unk> " above the pickguard and the guitar 's nickname , " Rocky " , on the headstock . He played this guitar in the Magical Mystery Tour film and throughout his solo career . In mid @-@ 1968 he acquired a Gibson Les Paul that he nicknamed " Lucy " . Around this time , he obtained a Gibson Jumbo J @-@ 200 , which he used for early demos of " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " . In late 1968 Fender Musical Instruments Corporation gave Harrison a custom @-@ made Fender Telecaster Rosewood prototype , made especially for him by Philip Kubicki ( who years later would start his own business , Factor ) , a Fender master builder who also crafted a prototype Stratocaster for Jimi Hendrix .

 From 1968 onward Harrison collaborated with other musicians ; he brought in Eric Clapton to play lead guitar on " While My Guitar Gently Weeps " for the 1968 Beatles ' White Album , and collaborated with John Barham on his 1968 debut solo album , Wonderwall Music , which included contributions from Clapton again , as well as Peter Tork from the Monkees . He played on tracks by Dave Mason , Nicky Hopkins , Alvin Lee , Ronnie Wood , Billy Preston and Tom Scott . Harrison co @-@ wrote songs and music with Dylan , Clapton , Preston , Doris Troy , David Bromberg , Gary Wright , Wood , Jeff Lynne , and Tom Petty , among others . Harrison 's music projects during the final years of the Beatles included producing Apple Records artists Doris Troy , Jackie Lomax and Billy Preston . 
 Harrison co @-@ wrote the song " Badge " with Clapton , which was included on Cream 's 1969 album , Goodbye . Harrison played rhythm guitar on the track , using the pseudonym " L 'Angelo Misterioso " for contractual reasons . In May 1970 he played guitar on several songs during a recording session for Dylan 's album New Morning . In addition to his own work , between 1971 and 1973 he co @-@ wrote and / or produced three top ten hits for Starr : " It Don 't Come Easy " , " Back Off Boogaloo " and " Photograph " . In 1971 he played electric slide guitar on " How Do You Sleep ? " and a dobro on " Crippled Inside " , both from Lennon 's Imagine album . Also that year , he produced and played slide guitar on Badfinger 's top ten hit " Day After Day " , and a dobro on Preston 's " I Wrote a Simple Song " . He worked with Harry Nilsson on " You 're Breakin ' My Heart " ( 1972 ) and with Cheech & Chong on " Basketball Jones " ( 1973 ) . In 1973 he produced and made a guest appearance on the album Shankar Family & Friends . 
 In 1974 Harrison founded Dark Horse Records . In addition to eventually releasing his own albums on the label , he initially used the company as an avenue for collaboration with other musicians . He wanted Dark Horse to serve as a creative outlet for artists , as Apple Records had for the Beatles . Harrison explained : " Most of the stuff will be what I produce " . Eric Idle commented : " He 's extremely generous , and he backs and supports all sorts of people that you 'll never , ever hear of . " The first acts signed to the new label were Ravi Shankar and Splinter , whose album Harrison produced , which provided Dark Horse with their first hit , " <unk> Town " . Other artists signed by Dark Horse include Attitudes , Henry McCullough , Jiva , and Stairsteps . 
 Harrison collaborated with Tom Scott on Scott 's album New York Connection ( 1976 ) , and in 1981 he played guitar on " Walk a Thin Line " , from Mick Fleetwood 's The Visitor . In 1996 he recorded " Distance Makes No Difference With Love " with Carl Perkins , and played slide guitar on the title track of Dylan 's Under the Red Sky album . In 2001 he performed as a guest musician on Jeff Lynne and Electric Light Orchestra 's comeback album Zoom , and on the song " Love Letters " for Bill Wyman 's Rhythm Kings . He also co @-@ wrote a new song with his son Dhani , " Horse to the Water " , which was recorded on 1 October , eight weeks before his death . It appeared on Jools Holland 's album Small World , Big Band . 
 = = = Sitar and Indian music = = = 
 During the Beatles ' American tour in August 1965 , Harrison 's friend David Crosby of the Byrds introduced him to Indian classical music and the work of sitar maestro Ravi Shankar . Harrison described Shankar as " the first person who ever impressed me in my life ... and he was the only person who didn 't try to impress me . " Harrison became fascinated with the sitar and immersed himself in Indian music . According to Lavezzoli , Harrison 's introduction of the instrument on the Beatles ' song " Norwegian Wood " " opened the floodgates for Indian instrumentation in rock music , triggering what Shankar would call ' The Great Sitar Explosion ' of 1966 – 67 " . Lavezzoli described Harrison as " the man most responsible for this phenomenon " . 
 In June 1966 Harrison met Shankar at the home of Mrs Angadi of the Asian Music Circle , asked to be his student , and was accepted . On 6 July , Harrison travelled to India to buy a sitar from <unk> Ram & Sons in New Delhi . Lavezzoli described Harrison 's sitar playing on the Revolver track " Love You To " as an " astonishing improvement " over " Norwegian Wood " and " the most accomplished performance on sitar by any rock musician " . In September , he returned to India to study sitar with Shankar . He initially stayed in Bombay , then moved to a houseboat on a remote lake where Shankar taught him for six weeks . After Shankar , he received tutelage from Shambu Das . 
 Harrison studied the instrument until 1968 , when an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to put down the instrument and return to guitar playing . He commented : " I decided ... I should get back to the guitar because I 'm not getting any better at it , and I 'm not going to be a great sitar player ... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier . "

 = = = Hinduism = = = 
 By the mid @-@ 1960s Harrison had become an admirer of Indian culture and mysticism , introducing it to the other Beatles . During the filming of Help ! in the Bahamas , they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga , Swami Vishnu @-@ <unk> , who gave each of them a signed copy of his book , The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga . Between the end of the last Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions , he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie ; there , he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar , met several gurus , and visited various holy places . In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi . Harrison 's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism . He commented : " For me , it was like a flash . The first time I had acid , it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me , and I realized a lot of things . I didn 't learn them because I already knew them , but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them . From the moment I had that , I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas , and Ravi 's music . " 
 In line with the Hindu yoga tradition , Harrison became a vegetarian in the late 1960s . After being given various religious texts by Shankar in 1966 , he remained a lifelong advocate of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda – yogis and authors , respectively , of Raja Yoga and Autobiography of a Yogi . In mid @-@ 1969 , he produced the single " Hare Krishna Mantra " , performed by members of the London Radha Krishna Temple . Having also helped the Temple devotees become established in Britain , Harrison then met their leader , A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada , whom he described as " my friend … my master " and " a perfect example of everything he preached " . Harrison embraced the Hare Krishna tradition , particularly japa @-@ yoga chanting with beads , and became a lifelong devotee . 
 Regarding other faiths he once remarked : " All religions are branches of one big tree . It doesn 't matter what you call Him just as long as you call . " He commented on his beliefs : 
 Krishna actually was in a body as a person ... What makes it complicated is , if he 's God , what 's he doing fighting on a battlefield ? It took me ages to try to figure that out , and again it was Yogananda 's spiritual interpretation of the Bhagavad Gita that made me realise what it was . Our idea of Krishna and Arjuna on the battlefield in the chariot . So this is the point – that we 're in these bodies , which is like a kind of chariot , and we 're going through this incarnation , this life , which is kind of a battlefield . The senses of the body ... are the horses pulling the chariot , and we have to get control over the chariot by getting control over the reins . And Arjuna in the end says , " Please Krishna , you drive the chariot " because unless we bring Christ or Krishna or Buddha or whichever of our spiritual guides ... we 're going to crash our chariot , and we 're going to turn over , and we 're going to get killed in the battlefield . That 's why we say " Hare Krishna , Hare Krishna " , asking Krishna to come and take over the chariot . 
 Before his religious conversion , the only British performer known for similar activities had been Cliff Richard , whose conversion to Christianity in 1966 had gone largely unnoticed by the public . " By contrast , " wrote Inglis , " Harrison 's spiritual journey was seen as a serious and important development that reflected popular music 's increasing maturity ... what he , and the Beatles , had managed to overturn was the paternalistic assumption that popular musicians had no role other than to stand on stage and sing their hit songs . "

 Harrison married the model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966 , with McCartney as best man . Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day 's Night , in which the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl . They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977 . Boyd said her decision to end their marriage and leave Harrison was due largely to his repeated infidelities , culminating in an affair with Starr 's wife Maureen , which Boyd called " the final straw " . She characterised the last year of their marriage as " fuelled by alcohol and cocaine " , and she stated : " George used coke excessively , and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart . " She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton , and they married in 1979 . 
 Harrison married Dark Horse Records ' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978 . They had met at the Dark Horse offices in Los Angeles in 1974 , and together had one son , Dhani Harrison , born on 1 August 1978 . 
 He restored the English manor house and grounds of Friar Park , his home in Henley @-@ on @-@ Thames , where several of his music videos were filmed including " Crackerbox Palace " ; the grounds also served as the background for the cover of All Things Must Pass . He employed ten workers to maintain the 36 @-@ acre ( 150 @,@ 000 m2 ) garden . Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism : " Sometimes I feel like I 'm actually on the wrong planet , and it 's great when I 'm in my garden , but the minute I go out the gate I think : ' What the hell am I doing here ? ' " His autobiography , I , Me , Mine , is dedicated " to gardeners everywhere " . The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book , which said little about the Beatles , focusing instead on Harrison 's hobbies , music and lyrics . Taylor commented : " George is not disowning the Beatles ... but it was a long time ago and actually a short part of his life . " 
 Harrison had an interest in sports cars and motor racing ; he was one of the 100 people who purchased the McLaren F1 road car . He had collected photos of racing drivers and their cars since he was young ; at 12 he had attended his first race , the 1955 British Grand Prix at Aintree . He wrote " Faster " as a tribute to the Formula One racing drivers Jackie Stewart and Ronnie Peterson . Proceeds from its release went to the Gunnar Nilsson cancer charity , set up after the Swedish driver 's death from the disease in 1978 . Harrison 's first extravagant car , a 1964 Aston Martin DB5 , was sold at auction on 7 December 2011 in London . An anonymous Beatles collector paid £ 350 @,@ 000 for the vehicle that Harrison had bought new in January 1965 . 
 = = = Relationships with the other Beatles = = = 
 For most of the Beatles ' career the relationships in the group were close . According to Hunter Davies , " the Beatles spent their lives not living a communal life , but communally living the same life . They were each other 's greatest friends . " Harrison 's ex @-@ wife Pattie Boyd described how the Beatles " all belonged to each other " and admitted , " George has a lot with the others that I can never know about . Nobody , not even the wives , can break through or even comprehend it . " 
 Starr said , " We really looked out for each other and we had so many laughs together . In the old days we 'd have the biggest hotel suites , the whole floor of the hotel , and the four of us would end up in the bathroom , just to be with each other " . He added , " there were some really loving , caring moments between four people : a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness . Just four guys who loved each other . It was pretty sensational . " 
 Lennon stated that his relationship with Harrison was " one of young follower and older guy ... [ he ] was like a disciple of mine when we started . " The two later bonded over their LSD experiences , finding common ground as seekers of spirituality . They took radically different paths thereafter , Harrison finding God and Lennon coming to the conclusion that people are the creators of their own lives . In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate : " John Lennon is a saint and he 's heavy @-@ duty , and he 's great and I love him . But at the same time , he 's such a bastard – but that 's the great thing about him , you see ? " 
 Harrison and McCartney were the first of the Beatles to meet , having shared a school bus , and often learned and rehearsed new guitar chords together . McCartney stated that he and Harrison usually shared a bedroom while touring . McCartney was best man at Harrison 's wedding in 1966 , and was the only Beatle in attendance . McCartney has referred to Harrison as his " baby brother " . In a 1974 BBC radio interview with Alan Freeman , Harrison stated : " [ McCartney ] ruined me as a guitar player " . Perhaps the most significant obstacle to a Beatles reunion after the death of Lennon was Harrison and McCartney 's personal relationship , as both men admitted that they often got on each other 's nerves . Rodriguez commented : " Even to the end of George 's days , theirs was a volatile relationship " . 
 = = = Humanitarian work = = = 
 Harrison was involved in humanitarian and political activism throughout his life . In the 1960s , the Beatles supported the civil rights movement and protested against the Vietnam War . After the band 's break @-@ up , Ravi Shankar consulted Harrison about how to provide aid to the people of Bangladesh after the 1970 Bhola cyclone and the Bangladesh Liberation War . Harrison recorded the song " Bangla Desh " , and pushed Apple Records to release his song alongside Shankar 's " Joy Bangla " in an effort to raise funds . Shankar then asked for Harrison 's advice about planning a small charity event in the US . Harrison responded by organising the Concert for Bangladesh , which raised more than $ 240 @,@ 000 . In June 1972 , UNICEF honoured Harrison and Shankar with the " Child Is the Father of Man " award at an annual ceremony in recognition of their fundraising efforts for Bangladesh . 
 The George Harrison Humanitarian Fund for UNICEF , a joint effort between the Harrison family and the US Fund for UNICEF , aims to support programmes that help children caught in humanitarian emergencies . In December 2007 , they donated $ 450 @,@ 000 to help the victims of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh . On 13 October 2009 , the first George Harrison Humanitarian Award went to Ravi Shankar for his efforts in saving the lives of children , and his involvement with the Concert for Bangladesh . 
 = = HandMade Films = = 
 In 1973 Peter Sellers introduced Harrison to Denis O 'Brien . Soon after , the two went into business together . In 1978 , in an effort to produce Monty Python 's Life of Brian , they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films . Harrison explained : " The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke . I 'd been to <unk> Hole in Somerset ... [ near ] an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper . So I bought a few rolls , and they had this watermark ' British Handmade Paper ' ... So we said ... we 'll call it Handmade Films . " 
 Their opportunity for investment came after EMI Films withdrew funding at the demand of their Chief Executive , Bernard Delfont . Harrison financed the production of Life of Brian in part by mortgaging his home , which Idle later called " the most anybody 's ever paid for a cinema ticket in history . " The film grossed $ 21 million at the box office in the US . The first film distributed by HandMade Films was The Long Good Friday ( 1980 ) , and the first they produced was Time Bandits ( 1981 ) , co @-@ scripted project by Monty Python 's Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin . The film featured a new song by Harrison , " Dream Away " , in the closing credits . Time Bandits became one of HandMade 's most successful and acclaimed efforts ; with a budget of $ 5 million , it earned $ 35 million in the US within ten weeks of its release . 
 Harrison served as executive producer for 23 films with HandMade , including Mona Lisa , Shanghai Surprise and Withnail and I. He made several cameo appearances in these films , including a role as a nightclub singer in Shanghai Surprise , for which he recorded five new songs . According to author and musicologist Ian Inglis , Harrison 's " executive role in HandMade Films helped to sustain British cinema at a time of crisis , producing some of the country 's most memorable movies of the 1980s . " A series of box office bombs in the late 1980s caused HandMade to cease operations in 1991 ; three years later , the company was sold .

 In June 1965 , Harrison and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) . They received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October . In 1971 the Beatles received an Academy Award for the best Original Song Score for the film Let It Be . The minor planet <unk> Harrison , discovered in 1984 , was named after him , as was a variety of Dahlia flower . In December 1992 he became the first recipient of the Billboard Century Award , an honour presented to music artists for significant bodies of work . Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the " 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time " . 
 In 2002 , on the first anniversary of his death , the Concert for George was held at the Royal Albert Hall . Clapton organised the event , which included performances by many of Harrison 's friends and musical collaborators , including McCartney and Starr . Eric Idle , who described Harrison as " one of the few morally good people that rock and roll has produced " , performed Monty Python 's " Lumberjack Song " . The profits from the concert went to Harrison 's charity , the Material World Charitable Foundation . 
 In 2004 , Harrison was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist by his former bandmates Lynne and Petty , and into the Madison Square Garden Walk of Fame in 2006 for the Concert for Bangladesh . On 14 April 2009 , the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front of the Capitol Records Building . McCartney , Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled . Harrison 's widow Olivia , the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony , and Harrison 's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra . 
 A documentary film entitled George Harrison : Living in the Material World , directed by Martin Scorsese , was released in October 2011 . The film features interviews with Olivia and Dhani Harrison , Klaus Voormann , Terry Gilliam , Starr , Clapton , McCartney , Keltner and Astrid Kirchherr . 
 Harrison was posthumously honoured with The Recording Academy 's Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the Grammy Awards in February 2015 .

 = George Moore ( novelist ) = 
 George Augustus Moore ( 24 February 1852 – 21 January 1933 ) was an Irish novelist , short @-@ story writer , poet , art critic , memoirist and dramatist . Moore came from a Roman Catholic landed family who lived at Moore Hall in Carra , County Mayo . He originally wanted to be a painter , and studied art in Paris during the 1870s . There , he befriended many of the leading French artists and writers of the day . 
 As a naturalistic writer , he was amongst the first English @-@ language authors to absorb the lessons of the French realists , and was particularly influenced by the works of Émile Zola . His writings influenced James Joyce , according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann , and , although Moore 's work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature , he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Family origins = = = 
 George Moore 's family had lived in Moore Hall , near Lough Carra , County Mayo for almost a century . The house was built by his paternal great @-@ grandfather — also called George Moore — who had made his fortune as a wine merchant in Alicante . The novelist 's grandfather was a friend of Maria Edgeworth , and author of An Historical Memoir of the French Revolution . His great @-@ uncle , John Moore , was president of the short @-@ lived Republic of Connacht during the Irish Rebellion of 1798 . The novelist 's father , George Henry Moore , sold his stable and hunting interests during the Great Irish Famine , and from 1847 – 1857 , served as an Independent Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Mayo in the British House of Commons . George Henry was renowned as a fair landlord , fought to uphold the rights of tenants , and was a founder of the Catholic Defence Association . His estate consisted of 5000 ha ( 50 km ² ) in Mayo , with a further 40 ha in County Roscommon . 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 George Moore was born in Moore Hall in 1852 . As a child , Moore enjoyed the novels of Walter Scott , which his father read to him . He spent a good deal of time outdoors with his brother , Maurice George Moore , and also became friendly with the young Willie and Oscar Wilde , who spent their summer holidays at nearby <unk> . Oscar was to later quip of Moore : " He conducts his education in public " . 
 His father had again turned his attention to horse breeding and in 1861 brought his champion horse , <unk> Patrick , to England for a successful racing season , together with his wife and nine @-@ year @-@ old son . For a while George was left at Cliff 's stables until his father decided to send George to his alma mater facilitated by his winnings . Moore 's formal education started at St. Mary 's College , Oscott , a Catholic boarding school near Birmingham where he was the youngest of 150 boys . He spent all of 1864 at home , having contracted a lung infection brought about by a breakdown in his health . His academic performance was poor while he was hungry and unhappy . In January 1865 , he returned to St. Mary 's College with his brother Maurice , where he refused to study as instructed and spent time reading novels and poems . That December the principal , Spencer Northcote , wrote a report that : " he hardly knew what to say about George . " By the summer of 1867 he was expelled , for ( in his own words ) ' idleness and general worthlessness ' , and returned to Mayo . His father once remarked , about George and his brother Maurice : " I fear those two redheaded boys are stupid " , an observation which proved untrue for all four boys . 
 = = = London and Paris = = = 
 In 1868 , Moore 's father was again elected MP for Mayo and the family moved to London the following year . Here , Moore senior tried , unsuccessfully , to have his son follow a career in the military though , prior to this , he attended the School of Art in the South Kensington Museum where his achievements were no better . He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870 . Moore , though still a minor , inherited the family estate that was valued at £ 3 @,@ 596 . He handed it over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873 , on attaining his majority , moved to Paris to study art . It took him several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil . Monsieur Jullian , who had previously been a shepherd and circus masked man , took him on for 40 francs a month . At Académie Jullian he met Lewis Weldon Hawkins who became Moore 's flat @-@ mate and whose trait , as a failed artist , show up in Moore 's own characters . He met many of the key artists and writers of the time , including Pissarro , Degas , Renoir , Monet , Daudet , Mallarmé , Turgenev and , above all , Zola , who was to prove an influential figure in Moore 's subsequent development as a writer . 
 While still in Paris his first book , a collection of lyric poems called The Flowers of Passion , was self @-@ published in 1877 . The poems were derivative , maliciously reviewed by the critics who were offended by some of the <unk> in store for moralistic readers and was withdrawn by Moore . He was forced to return to Ireland in 1880 to raise £ 3 @,@ 000 to pay debts incurred on the family estate due to his tenants refusing to pay their rent and the drop in agricultural prices . During his time back in Mayo , he gained a reputation as a fair landlord , continuing the family tradition of not evicting tenants and refusing to carry firearms when travelling round the estate . While in Ireland , he decided to abandon art and move to London to become a professional writer . There he published his second poetry collection , Pagan Poems , in 1881 . These early poems reflect his interest in French symbolism and are now almost entirely neglected . In 1886 Moore published Confessions of a Young Man , a lively and energetic memoir about his 20s spent in Paris and London among bohemian artists . It contains a substantial amount of literary criticism for which it has received a fair amount of praise , for instance The Modern Library chose it in 1917 to be included in the series as " one of the most significant documents of the passionate revolt of English literature against the Victorian tradition . " 
 = = = Controversy in England = = = 
 During the 1880s , Moore began work on a series of novels in a realist style . His first novel , A Modern Lover ( 1883 ) was a three @-@ volume work , as preferred by the circulating libraries , and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real . The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero . At this time the British circulating libraries , such as Mudie 's Select Library , controlled the market for fiction and the public , who paid fees to borrow their books , expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels available . His next book , a novel in the realist style , A Mummers Wife ( 1885 ) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie 's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news @-@ stalls . Despite this , during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity garnered by its opponents . The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du <unk> in July – October 1886 . His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie 's and Smith 's . In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets ; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals . In these , he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction . 
 Moore 's publisher Henry Vizetelly began to issue unabridged mass @-@ market translations of French realist novels that endangered the moral and commercial influence of the circulating libraries around this time . In 1888 , the circulating libraries fought back by encouraging the House of Commons to implement laws to stop ' the rapid spread of demoralising literature in this country ' . However , Vizetelly was brought to court by the National Vigilance Association ( NVA ) for ' obscene libel ' . The charge arose due to the publication of the English translation of Zola 's La Terre . A second case was brought the following year in order to force implementation of the original judgement and to remove all of Zola 's works . This led to the 70 @-@ year @-@ old publisher becoming involved in the literary cause . Throughout Moore stayed loyal to Zola 's publisher , and on 22 September 1888 , about a month before the trial , wrote a letter that appeared in the St. James Gazette . In it Moore suggested it was improper that Vizetelly 's fate be determined by a jury of twelve tradesmen , explaining it would be preferable to be judged by three novelists . Moore pointed out that the NVA could make the same claims against such books as Madame Bovary and Gautier 's Mademoiselle de Maupin , as their morals are equivalent to Zola 's , though their literary merits might differ . 
 Because of his willingness to tackle such issues as prostitution , extramarital sex and lesbianism , Moore 's novels were initially met with disapprobation . However , as the public 's taste for realist fiction grew , this subsided . Moore began to find success as an art critic with the publication of books such as Impressions and Opinions ( 1891 ) and Modern Painting ( 1893 ) — which was the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience . By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work . 
 Other realist novels by Moore from this period include A Drama in Muslin ( 1886 ) , a satiric story of the marriage trade in Anglo @-@ Irish society that hints at same @-@ sex relationships among the unmarried daughters of the gentry , and Esther Waters ( 1894 ) , the story of an unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover . Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication . His 1887 novel A Mere Accident is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences . He also published a collection of short stories : <unk> ( 1895 ) . 
 = = = Dublin and the Celtic Revival = = = 
 In 1901 , Moore returned to Ireland to live in Dublin at the suggestion of his cousin and friend , Edward Martyn . Martyn had been involved in Ireland 's cultural and dramatic movements for some years , and was working with Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats to establish the Irish Literary Theatre . Moore soon became deeply involved in this project and in the broader Irish Literary Revival . He had already written a play , The Strike at Arlingford ( 1893 ) , which was produced by the Independent Theatre . The play was the result of a challenge between Moore and George Robert Sims over Moore 's criticism of all contemporary playwrights in Impressions and Opinions . Moore won the one hundred pound bet made by Sims for a stall to witness an " unconventional " play by Moore , though Moore insisted the word " unconventional " be excised . 
 The Irish Literary Theatre staged his satirical comedy The Bending of the Bough ( 1900 ) , adapted from Martyn 's The Tale of a Town , originally rejected by the theatre but unselfishly given to Moore for revision , and Martyn 's Maeve . Staged by the company who would later become the Abbey Theatre , The Bending of the Bough was a historically important play and introduced realism into Irish literature . Lady Gregory wrote that it : " hits impartially all round " . The play was satire on Irish political life , and as it was unexpectedly nationalist , was considered the first to deal with a vital question that had appeared in Irish life . Diarmuid and Grania , a poetic play in prose co @-@ written with Yeats in 1901 , was also staged by the theatre , with incidental music by Elgar . After this production Moore took up pamphleteering on behalf of the Abbey , and parted company with the dramatic movement . 
 Moore published two books of prose fiction set in Ireland around this time ; a second book of short stories , The Untilled Field ( 1903 ) and a novel , The Lake ( 1905 ) . The Untilled Field deal with themes of clerical interference in the daily lives of the Irish peasantry , and of the issue of emigration . The stories were originally written for translation into Irish , in order to serve as models for other writers working in the language . Three of the translations were published in the New Ireland Review , but publication was then paused due to a perceived anti @-@ clerical sentiment . In 1902 the entire collection was translated by Tadhg Ó <unk> and Pádraig Ó <unk> , and published in a parallel @-@ text edition by the Gaelic League as An @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> . Moore later revised the texts for the English edition . These stories were influenced by Turgenev 's A Sportsman 's Sketches , a book recommended to Moore by W. K. Magee , a sub @-@ librarian of the National Library of Ireland , and had earlier suggested that Moore " was best suited to become Ireland 's Turgenev " . The tales are recognised by some as representing the birth of the Irish short story as a literary genre . 
 In 1903 , following a disagreement with his brother Maurice over the religious upbringing of his nephews , Moore declared himself to be Protestant . His conversion was announced in a letter to the Irish Times newspaper . Moore remained in Dublin until 1911 . In 1914 , he published a gossipy , three @-@ volume memoir of his time there under the collective title Hail and Farewell , which entertained its readers but infuriated former friends . Moore himself said of these memoirs , " Dublin is now divided into two sets ; one half is afraid it will be in the book , and the other is afraid that it won 't " . 
 In his later years he was increasingly friendless , having quarreled bitterly with Yeats and Osborn Bergin , among others : Oliver St. John Gogarty said : " It was impossible to be a friend of his , because he was incapable of gratitude " . 
 = = = Later life = = = 
 Moore returned to London in 1911 , where , with the exception of frequent trips to France , he was to spend much of the rest of his life . In 1913 , he traveled to Jerusalem to research for his next novel , The Brook <unk> ( 1916 ) . The book saw Moore once again embroiled in controversy , as it was based on the supposition that a non @-@ divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health . Other books from this period include a further collection of short @-@ stories called A Storyteller 's Holiday ( 1918 ) , a collection of essays called Conversations in Ebury Street ( 1924 ) and a play , The Making of an Immortal ( 1927 ) . Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions . 
 Partly due to Maurice 's pro @-@ treaty activity , Moore Hall was burnt by anti @-@ treaty forces in 1923 , during the final months of the Irish Civil War . Moore eventually received compensation of £ 7 @,@ 000 from the government of the Irish Free State . By this time George and Maurice had become estranged , mainly because of an unflattering portrait of the latter which appeared in Hail and Farewell . Tension also arose as a result of religious differences : Maurice frequently made donations to the Roman Catholic Church from estate funds . Moore later sold a large part of the estate to the Irish Land Commission for £ 25 @,@ 000 . 
 Moore was friendly with many members of the expatriate artistic communities in London and Paris , and had a long @-@ lasting relationship with Maud , Lady Cunard . Moore took a special interest in the education of Maud 's daughter , the well @-@ known publisher and art patron , Nancy Cunard . It has been suggested that Moore , rather than Maud 's husband , Sir Bache Cunard , was Nancy 's father , but this is not generally credited by historians , and it is not certain that Moore 's relationship with Nancy 's mother was ever more than platonic . Moore was believed by some to be impotent and was described as " one who told but didn 't kiss " . Moore 's last novel , <unk> in Aulis , was published in 1930 . 
 He died at his home at Ebury Street in the London district of Pimlico in early 1933 , leaving a fortune of £ 70 @,@ 000 . He was cremated in London at a service attended by Ramsay MacDonald among others . An urn containing his ashes was interred on Castle Island in Lough Carra in view of the ruins of Moore Hall .
