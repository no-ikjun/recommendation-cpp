 From the 1920s to 1946 , the <unk> relay race was held with start and finish at Dælenenga . The route ran through various streets in eastern Oslo and was a counter @-@ measure to <unk> in the western part of town . From 1929 Dælenenga became a center of velodrome cycling . During the Second World War , <unk> was used for sports training in football and handball by the German Wehrmacht . After the war ended , the clubs in the neighborhood went through a consolidation process . In 1952 , the clubs Spero , Strong and B @-@ 14 merged to create Grüner IL , which became the dominant club at the venue . Speedway events took place between 1947 and 1968 , with Dælenenga growing to become a prime national venue , especially during the 1950s . The most notable regular local drivers were Basse <unk> , Henry Andersen , Werner Lorentzen and Aage Hansen . 
 As of 2012 , Grüner Fotball remains the football venue 's tenant . Their main football team plays in Third Division . Grüner Hockey uses the hockey rink , with their main men 's team playing in the First Division . The club house is used by <unk> av 1909 , Grüner IL and Fighter <unk> .

 The first speed skating competition took place on 24 January 1917 , and the stadium remained in use for speed skating until 1929 . AIF arranged their Norwegian championships in speed skating at Dælenenga in 1926 and 1929 . Finland 's Clas Thunberg set two unofficial world records in 1 @,@ 000 meters of 1 : 31 @.@ 60 twice in 1921 .

 Dælenenga was one of five ice hockey rinks used during the 1952 Winter Olympics . Hosting 8 of 37 matches , it the second @-@ most use venue after Jordal Amfi . It was also the only hockey venue other than Jordal to be located in Oslo . 
 Bandy was arranged as a demonstration sport at the 1952 Winter Olympics . Two of the three matches were conducted at Dælenenga . 
 = Æthelric II = 
 Æthelric ( called Æthelric II to distinguish him from an earlier Æthelric who was also bishop of Selsey and also spelled <unk> ; died c . 1076 ) was the second to last medieval Bishop of Selsey in England before the see was moved to Chichester . Consecrated a bishop in 1058 , he was deposed in 1070 for unknown reasons and then imprisoned by King William I of England . He was considered one of the best legal experts of his time , and was even brought from his prison to attend the trial on Penenden Heath where he gave testimony about English law before the Norman Conquest of England . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Æthelric was a monk at Christ Church Priory at Canterbury prior to his becoming a bishop . Several historians opine that he might have been the same as the Æthelric who was a monk of Canterbury and a relative of Godwin , Earl of Wessex . That Æthelric was elected by the monks of Canterbury to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1050 , but was not confirmed by King Edward the Confessor who insisted on Robert of Jumièges becoming archbishop instead . The evidence is not merely that they shared the same name , because the name was a relatively common one in Anglo @-@ Saxon England . Other evidence pointing to the possibility of them being the same person includes the fact that he was felt to have been unfairly deposed in 1070 as well as the bishop 's great age in 1076 . 
 Æthelric was consecrated bishop in 1058 by Stigand , the Archbishop of Canterbury . Æthelric was consecrated by Stigand , unlike most of the English bishops of the time period , because at that point , Stigand held a valid pallium , or symbol of an archbishop 's authority and ability to consecrate bishops . 
 = = Deposition = = 
 Æthelric was deposed by the Council of Windsor on 24 May 1070 and imprisoned at Marlborough , being replaced by Stigand ( not the same as the archbishop ) , who later moved the seat of the diocese to Chichester . It is possible , that his deposition was tied to the fact that about that time , King Harold of England 's mother and sister took refuge with the count of Flanders . If Æthelric was related to the Godwin 's , King William I of England may have feared that the bishop would use his diocese to launch a rebellion . Other reasons put forward include the fact that Æthelric had been consecrated by Stigand , but the other bishop that Stigand had consecrated , Siward the Bishop of Rochester was not deposed . Æthelric was a monk , and while not having a great reputation for sanctity , he was not held to be immoral either . The pope did not feel that his deposition had been handled correctly , so his deposition was confirmed at the Council of Winchester on 1 April 1076 . It continued to be considered uncanonical , but Æthelric was never restored to his bishopric . 
 = = Penenden Heath = = 
 He was carted from imprisonment to the Trial of Penenden Heath of Odo of Bayeux , earl of Kent . This took place sometime between 1072 and 1076 . At that time , he was the most prominent legalist in England . He helped clarify Anglo @-@ Saxon land laws , as the trial was concerned with the attempts of Lanfranc to recover lands from Odo . The medieval writer Eadmer also consulted Æthelric for information on Eadmer 's Life of St Dunstan . 
 Presumably Æthelric died soon after the trial , as he was already an old man when he attended the trial .

 German submarine U @-@ 255 was a Type VIIC U @-@ boat that served in Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine during World War II . The submarine was laid down on 21 December 1940 at the Bremer Vulkan yard at Bremen @-@ Vegesack , launched on 8 October 1941 and commissioned on 29 November 1941 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Reinhart Reche . 
 One of the most successful U @-@ boats to operate in Arctic waters , she operated from Norway during 1942 – 1943 , and then from France in 1944 – 1945 , sailing on 15 combat patrols , sinking ten merchant ships totalling 47 @,@ 640 GRT and damaging another of 7 @,@ 191 GRT enough for it to be written off as a total loss .

 German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines . U @-@ 255 had a displacement of 769 tonnes ( 757 long tons ) when at the surface and 871 tonnes ( 857 long tons ) while submerged . She had a total length of 67 @.@ 10 m ( 220 ft 2 in ) , a pressure hull length of 50 @.@ 50 m ( 165 ft 8 in ) , a beam of 6 @.@ 20 m ( 20 ft 4 in ) , a height of 9 @.@ 60 m ( 31 ft 6 in ) , and a draught of 4 @.@ 74 m ( 15 ft 7 in ) . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft <unk> four @-@ stroke , six @-@ cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of 2 @,@ 800 to 3 @,@ 200 metric horsepower ( 2 @,@ 060 to 2 @,@ 350 kW ; 2 @,@ 760 to 3 @,@ 160 shp ) for use while surfaced , two AEG GU 460 / 8 – 27 double @-@ acting electric motors producing a total of 750 metric horsepower ( 550 kW ; 740 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1 @.@ 23 m ( 4 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) . 
 The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 17 @.@ 7 knots ( 32 @.@ 8 km / h ; 20 @.@ 4 mph ) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 @.@ 6 knots ( 14 @.@ 1 km / h ; 8 @.@ 7 mph ) .

 On 15 June 1942 , U @-@ 255 sailed from Kiel , under the command of Kptlt . Reche , arriving at Narvik on the 20th . She then departed on her first patrol on 23 June , sailing into the Barents Sea , north of Russia . 
 She made her first kill on 6 July , sinking the 7 @,@ 191 ton American Liberty ship John Witherspoon about 20 miles off Novaya Zemlya . The ship , en route from Baltimore to Arkhangelsk with 8 @,@ 575 tons of ammunition and tanks aboard , had been a part of Convoy PQ 17 which had dispersed on Admiralty orders in the Barents Sea on 4 July . After being hit by four torpedoes , the ship broke in two , and sank within minutes . The crew abandoned ship , and one seaman fell overboard and drowned . U @-@ 255 questioned the survivors , offered food and water , gave directions to the nearest land , and left . The crew were picked up by Royal Navy ships on 9 July . 
 The next day , 7 July , she sank the 5 @,@ 116 ton American Hog Islander Alcoa Ranger , also from Convoy PQ 17 . A single torpedo struck the ship , causing the vessel to list heavily to starboard . The crew abandoned ship in three lifeboats within 15 minutes . After she questioned the crew , she began to shell the ship from a distance of about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) , firing at least 60 shells ( some survivors said as many as 150 ) until the ship sank . The crewmen were rescued by Soviet patrol boats later that day . 
 Early on 8 July , U @-@ 255 caught another ship from Convoy PQ 17 , the 6 @,@ 069 ton American merchant ship <unk> , loaded with 6 @,@ 000 tons of explosives , gasoline , and trucks as deck cargo . A single torpedo hit the ship , blowing out all the bulkheads , and killing seven of the crew . The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts , as U @-@ 255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship , which sank after 20 minutes . U @-@ 255 questioned the survivors , gave them a course to land , and asked if they had enough food and water before leaving . The survivors landed at Moller Bay , Novaya Zemlya , two days later . 
 On 13 July U @-@ 255 found the 7 @,@ 168 ton Dutch merchant ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting , with 2 @,@ 250 tons of general goods , ammunition , 34 tanks , 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard . The ship had been attacked by Ju 88 dive bombers of III . / KG 30 east @-@ north @-@ east of Bear Island on 5 July , the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed . The crew had abandoned the badly damaged ship , believing it was about to sink . All 76 of the crew had taken five days to reach land at Novaya Zemlya , eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel . After finding her the <unk> and two mates from U @-@ 255 boarded the ship , and attempted to start the engines , but the engine room was flooded . They then searched the vessel , taking blankets , cigarettes , and other useful materials , including confidential documents found on the bridge , and the ship 's ensign as a prize , before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo . U @-@ 255 returned to Narvik on 15 July .

Hit by two torpedoes , which blew off the stern post , propeller and rudder , and caused the after magazine to explode , the 48 crew and 16 passengers ( survivors from PQ 17 ) abandoned ship in two lifeboats and one raft . The ship was then shelled by the W class destroyer HMS Worcester and sank . The crew were later picked up by British ships , with one man dying of wounds later . 
 Three days later , on 23 September , U @-@ 255 was attacked by a Catalina patrol aircraft of No. 210 Squadron RAF south of Jan Mayen . After being badly damaged by two depth charges , she was forced to return to Bergen , arriving on the 25th .

 On 29 September 1942 U @-@ 255 sailed from Bergen , arriving back at Kiel on 3 October . There the submarine was fitted with a Schnorchel underwater @-@ breathing apparatus before sailing again on 7 January 1943 , and arriving at Hammerfest in northern Norway on the 18th . 
 Returning to her old hunting grounds north of Norway , U @-@ 255 sailed from Hammerfest on 23 January 1943 , and on the 26th , U @-@ 255 likely sank the 2 @,@ 418 ton Soviet merchant ship Krasnyj Partizan with two torpedoes west of Bear Island . The Russian ship had just evaded the pursuing U @-@ 625 when it went missing . She was probably sunk by U @-@ 255 because the submarine recorded a loss the same day . After the sinking of the unknown merchant ship that was likely Krasnyj Partizan , U @-@ 255 surfaced and tried to question the survivors . They only spoke Russian and could not be understood . As a result , the crew of U @-@ 255 were unable to confirm the identity of the vessel . On 29 January , she sank another Russian freighter , the 1 @,@ 892 ton Ufa , south of Bear Island . Both Krasnyj Partizan and Ufa were loaded with timber destined for the United States , and no survivors were found from either ship unless the survivors from the unknown Russian merchant vessel that was sunk by U @-@ 255 were indeed crew members of Krasnyj Partizan . 
 On the afternoon of 3 February , about 600 miles northeast of Iceland , U @-@ 255 fired a salvo of torpedoes at Convoy RA @-@ 52 , en route from Murmansk to New York , and hit the 7 @,@ 460 ton American merchant ship Greylock .

 The Executive was struck on the starboard side ; the explosion demolished the booms , engine , dynamos and all equipment in the immediate area . One hold rapidly flooded and the ship began to settle by the stern . Nine of the crew were killed , the remaining 53 abandoned ship in three lifeboats and a raft . The ship was sunk by gunfire from a destroyer about an hour after the attack . 
 The Richard Bland was struck by a torpedo which did not explode , but passed through the ship , making 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) holes on either side . The ship remained with the convoy with only a slightly reduced speed , but on the night of 6 March lost contact in gale force winds and rough seas , and proceeded alone towards Iceland . Five days later , on 10 March , U @-@ 255 found the vessel about 35 miles off <unk> , Iceland , and hit her with two more torpedoes , breaking the ship in two just forward of the bridge . The crew abandoned ship , and of the total of 69 on board , the master , five officers , 13 crewmen and 15 armed guards were lost , when their lifeboats were swamped in heavy seas . The stern section was torpedoed by U @-@ 255 again and sank , but the forward section was towed to Akureyri in Iceland , where the ship was declared a total loss .

 Son of Beast was a record @-@ breaking wooden roller coaster located at Kings Island in Mason , Ohio . Built and designed by the now defunct Roller Coaster Corporation of America , it opened to the public on May 26 , 2000 , and was themed as a sequel to one of the park 's other signature attractions , The Beast . In addition to breaking the world record for speed , Son of Beast was the first wooden hypercoaster in the world with a 214 @-@ foot ( 65 m ) drop and was the first wooden coaster to feature an inversion . 
 Son of Beast is also known for two major , non @-@ fatal accidents . In 2006 , damage to the track caused one of the trains to stop abruptly . Another setback occurred in 2009 , when a woman claimed to have suffered a head injury . The ride was closed indefinitely , and all references to the ride were later removed from the park . On July 27 , 2012 , the closure was made permanent , as Kings Island announced that the roller coaster would be dismantled and removed from the park . 
 = = History = = 
 The Roller Coaster Corporation of America discussed the idea of a building the world 's first wooden hypercoaster with Kings Island in 1997 . The park announced plans to build Son of Beast on May 11 , 1999 . As part of a marketing campaign for the ride before its debut , a box was placed next to a footpath in the park . Beastly growling and snarling noises came from inside the box as it shook violently . During the announcement , the box was revealed to the audience along with a model of the roller coaster and a list of seven world records that would be broken when it came into operation . The sign at the ride 's entrance featured a large wooden box covered with chains , rope , and metal straps . The front was ripped open with the name " Son of Beast " centered inside the box . Problems plagued the ride from the start and as a result , Paramount Parks , the park 's then @-@ owner , fired <unk> before construction was completed . The park had to make several design corrections during Son of Beast 's initial year . 
 The ride originally operated with three trains designed by Premier Rides . Each one consisted of six cars for a total capacity of thirty @-@ six . The trains were shortened to five cars before the 2006 season . After the ride 's first major incident , the trains were replaced altogether with lighter models before the ride reopened the following season . The loop was also removed during this time . 
 After another major incident occurred in 2009 , it was announced that Son of Beast would be closed indefinitely . References to Son of Beast were removed from the park 's website and map in early 2010 . All signage , including the box at the entrance , was also removed . 
 On March 15 , 2010 , the General Manager of Kings Island , Greg Scheid , stated that the park had spent nearly $ 30 million on the ride to date , and that it would not reopen for the 2010 season . Another Kings Island spokesperson , Don Helbig , announced in 2011 that the ride would again be closed for the 2011 season , and that the ride 's future had not yet been decided . " No decision has been made concerning the ride 's future , " spokesman Don Helbig said . " It would be inappropriate to speculate on when a decision might be made . There 's nothing else to talk about . " Kings Island announced on April 24 , 2012 , that there are no plans to operate Son of Beast in 2012 , and they 're still evaluating options . 
 On July 27 , 2012 , following a thorough evaluation of the roller coaster , Kings Island announced that Son of Beast will be removed from the park to make room for future expansion . Demolition began in mid @-@ September 2012 . On November 20 , one of the last remaining parts of the structure , the lift hill , was demolished . A new roller coaster called Banshee was completed in April 2014 and is now in the same location previously occupied by Son of Beast .

 After loading the train , riders left the station making a 51 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) left @-@ hand drop into a series of short hops before turning into the 218 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 66 m ) lift hill . At the crest of the lift hill , the track made a left @-@ hand turn over to the first drop , where it dropped 214 feet ( 65 m ) to the ground followed by a 70 @-@ degree banked turn to the right . Riders then descended 168 feet ( 51 m ) down a second drop into a left @-@ hand double helix . Coming out of the helix , the train passed through a mid @-@ course brake run dropping into a straight section of track ( where the vertical loop was prior to 2006 ) , before entering another helix , riding a series of short <unk> and ending at the final brake run . One cycle of the ride lasted about 2 minutes and 20 seconds .

 At the time of its introduction in 2000 , Son of Beast was the only wooden roller coaster nationally ranked in the top 10 for track height , track length , drop height , and speed . It set several world records becoming the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world , as well as becoming the second longest following its predecessor , The Beast . Son of Beast was also the only wooden roller coaster to feature a vertical loop , though the loop was later removed after an accident in 2006 . Prior to its removal , the vertical loop also made Son of Beast the longest roller coaster in the world to contain one . Following its removal , California Screamin ' at Disney California Adventure acquired the title . 
 The seven world records held at its introduction were : 
 Tallest wooden roller coaster 
 Longest wooden roller coaster drop

 On July 9 , 2006 at 4 : 45 pm , a structural failure in the ' Rose Bowl ' section of the ride created a bump on the track that caused a train to come to an abrupt stop . Twenty @-@ seven injuries were reported in the accident and rescue units were required to evacuate the riders . Most of the injuries were of the chest or neck . Seventeen people were released from the hospital within five hours of the accident , and two were admitted . None of the injuries were life @-@ threatening . After an inspection the following day , the park stated that the accident was caused by a crack or split in the wood . The ride was shut down for an extended period of time , while the park worked with the State of Ohio to complete a full investigation . The park completed repairs of the ride but the state asked for extensive testing to be done to ensure it would not happen again . The park indicated that the ride would not reopen until the 2007 season . 
 Two trains designed by Gerstlauer from the demolished Hurricane : Category 5 coaster at the Myrtle Beach Pavilion were purchased by Kings Island to serve as lighter replacements for original Son of Beast trains . The lighter trains were used to reduce the overall load on the wooden structure . The loop was also removed during this time to assist the lighter trains in completing the circuit . The park also claimed that the changes helped make the ride more comfortable . 
 In late June 2007 , reports circulated that the park was testing the new Gerstlauer trains . Eyewitnesses reported red and blue trains running on the track with test dummies in the seats . On July 4 , 2007 , Son of Beast reopened for the first time since the accident the year before .

 On June 16 , 2009 , a woman claimed to have suffered a head injury from riding Son of Beast during her visit to the park on May 31 , 2009 . She did not report the incident to Kings Island officials prior to June 16 . She claimed to have suffered from a burst blood vessel in her brain , after riding Son of Beast , that required admission to an intensive care unit at a nearby hospital . " The first we heard of this was on June 16 . Her visit was on May 31 and there 's no record of going to first aid for anything here at the park , " said Don Helbig , public relations manager for Kings Island . Helbig also pointed out that there were no other reports of injuries on the ride that year . The Son of Beast was shut down as a precaution , however , during the investigation . " At this point it would be inappropriate to speculate on an exact date when the ride may reopen . We 're going to do a thorough maintenance review . We 're going to work with the state of Ohio on that , " said Helbig . 
 An investigation followed , and no irregularities were found with the ride . A summary of that investigation was released later , on July 29 . Despite the findings , the roller coaster remained closed and never reopened .

 " A Night of Neglect " is the seventeenth episode of the second season of the American musical television series Glee , and the thirty @-@ ninth episode overall . It was written by Ian Brennan , directed by Carol Banker , and aired on Fox in the United States on April 19 , 2011 . It features the McKinley High glee club , New Directions , fundraising for a fellow extracurricular activity group by holding a benefit concert , while cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) attempts to thwart them . 
 Thirteen guest stars appeared in the episode , including Gwyneth Paltrow in her final season two appearance . Several cast members returned after extended absences : Jessalyn Gilsig , Cheyenne Jackson and Stephen Tobolowsky as members of Sue 's anti @-@ New Directions " League of Doom " , and Charice as student Sunshine Corazon . Four songs were covered and released as singles , and a fifth featured as a dance performance . 
 Upon its initial airing , the episode was viewed by 9 @.@ 80 million American viewers , and garnered a 3 @.@ 8 / 11 Nielsen rating / share in the 18 – 49 demographic . Critical commentary was generally negative . Reviewers generally disliked the storyline centered on the under @-@ appreciation of student Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) , though commended her performance of Aretha Franklin 's " Ain 't No Way " . The episode 's comedy moments attracted some praise , though the guest stars and League of Doom plot were ill @-@ received , as was the cutting short of a solo by Jenna Ushkowitz , and a rendition of Adele 's " Turning Tables " by Paltrow , which critics found inferior to the original . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Low on funds for an upcoming competition trip , glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) suggests that the club members sell saltwater taffy to raise money . New Directions members Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , Artie Abrams ( Kevin McHale ) and Tina Cohen @-@ Chang ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) reveal they are on the academic decathlon team , which is also having funding problems . Brittany Pierce ( Heather Morris ) is the fourth , stand @-@ in member , and proves surprisingly knowledgeable about cat diseases . Will 's girlfriend , substitute teacher Holly Holliday ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) , suggests holding a benefit concert for the decathlon team instead of selling additional taffy . Former McKinley student Sunshine Corazon ( Charice ) , who defected to rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline , is awarded the closing number at the concert after promising to bring her six hundred Twitter followers . 
 Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) creates a " League of Doom " , with members that include Will 's ex @-@ wife Terri Schuester ( Jessalyn Gilsig ) , Vocal Adrenaline coach Dustin Goolsby ( Cheyenne Jackson ) , and former McKinley High teacher Sandy Ryerson ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) , to destroy the glee club . Tasked with breaking up Will and Holly , Dustin makes a failed attempt at seducing her . The targeted relationship begins to crumble anyway , when Will helps his former love Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) with her stress @-@ worsened OCD , after she reveals that her husband Carl Howell has asked for an annulment . 
 Former New Directions member Kurt Hummel ( Chris Colfer ) attends the concert , accompanied by his boyfriend Blaine Anderson ( Darren Criss ) . They are confronted by closeted homophobic bully Dave Karofsky ( Max Adler ) , who is forced to back down by Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) , in retribution for previously throwing a slushie in her face . Sunshine and her followers pull out of the concert on Dustin 's orders , and Sandy and McKinley students Jacob Ben Israel ( Josh Sussman ) , Azimio ( James Earl ) and Becky Jackson ( Lauren Potter ) — the only other members of the audience — heckle the glee club . Tina is reduced to tears by their booing ; Mike fares better as the hecklers are given taffy to keep their mouths full . During the intermission , Holly talks with the three students about the hidden cost of insults and suggests they cheer as opposed to jeering , but they opt to leave instead . Holly performs Adele 's " Turning Tables " to Will . Mercedes Jones ( Amber Riley ) , who on the advice of Lauren Zizes ( Ashley Fink ) has spent the lead @-@ up to the concert making outrageous demands on her fellow club members to gain greater respect from them , performs the final number : a powerhouse version of Aretha Franklin 's " Ain 't No Way " . She wows a stoned Sandy , who donates some of his drug profits to fund the academic decathlon team . 
 Holly takes a job in Cleveland , leaving Will free to pursue Emma , while Sue decides to bring Terri further into the game . The episode ends on the academic decathlon final 's tiebreaker question , which is in the category " hermaphrodite Nazi sympathizers " , a topic earlier taught in an irreverent history lesson by Holly .

 Thirteen guest stars were featured in " A Night of Neglect " , including Paltrow , who made her third and final second season appearance as substitute teacher Holly Holliday , following " The Substitute " and " Sexy " . Having previously appeared in the second season 's first episode , Jackson and Charice also returned , as Vocal Adrenaline 's Dustin and Sunshine , respectively . Additional recurring guest characters who appeared were New Directions members Mike Chang , Sam Evans ( Chord Overstreet ) and Lauren Zizes , school bullies Dave Karofsky and Azimio , school reporter Jacob Ben Israel , cheerleader Becky Jackson , local news anchor Rod Remington ( Bill A. Jones ) , and Blaine Anderson , lead singer of the Dalton Academy Warblers . 
 The musical focus of the episode was , according to cast member Cory Monteith , " artists that may have been neglected or under @-@ appreciated over the years " . He revealed that the series ' attempt to clear music licensing rights to a song by Icelandic singer @-@ songwriter Björk was complicated by the fact that she apparently did not have a telephone number . She eventually declined the request , as later revealed by Glee creator Ryan Murphy , because she felt the song would not have been appropriate to use in its proposed accompanying scene , but remained open to future suggestions as she mentioned that she had enjoyed the show . The songs covered in the episode were Aretha Franklin 's " Ain 't No Way " performed by Riley ; Celine Dion 's cover of Eric Carmen 's " All by Myself " performed by Charice ; Lykke Li 's " I Follow Rivers " , performed by Ushkowitz ; and Adele 's " Turning Tables " , performed by Paltrow . This marks the second time " All by Myself " , a song Charice previously performed in concert , was covered on the series , the first being in the first season episode " Showmance " . Jack Johnson 's " Bubble Toes " also featured in the episode , as a dance routine performed by Shum , Jr . All four vocal performances were released as digital singles , though only " All by Myself " and " Turning Tables " charted . The former peaked at number eighty @-@ seven on the Billboard Hot 100 , while the latter reached number sixty @-@ six in both the US and Canada .

 " A Night of Neglect " received generally negative reviews . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone deemed it a " very predictable episode " , which neglected to take risks with its musical numbers and left her with a " stale feeling " . Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was confused by the message presented . She approved of the Will – Emma plot and Holly 's departure , but was dismayed by the lack of Kurt and Blaine , and criticized Mercedes ' storyline for its repetitive nature . The Washington Post 's Lisa de Moraes lambasted the League of Doom plot , which , she wrote , consisted of " [ two characters ] whom viewers will barely remember , one who is super creepy , and another who fans despised " . She suggested that they were included for contractual , rather than storyline reasons , though lauded Jackson 's talent for " steal [ ing ] every scene he 's in . " Futterman also praised Jackson 's " long @-@ overdue return " . 
 CNN 's Lisa Respers France said the episode failed to meet her expectations . She was concerned that Mercedes ' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable , and criticized Holly 's sudden departure . Though she enjoyed Sunshine 's return , seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes ' solo , she noted " all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show . " Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a " quirky mixed bag , packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional ( or musical ) oomph . " . Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club graded the episode " C " . He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show : the under @-@ use of its supporting cast members , and the " maniacal behavior " of Sue . McNutt wrote , " not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst , but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary . This episode was not a step in the right direction so much as it was an escalator to nowhere : A week from now , the chances of any of this resonating in the show itself is slim to none . " He felt that Mercedes has become a prop , rather than a character , and criticized the episode for attributing her blame for the marginalization the writers have subjected her to . 
 MTV 's Aly Semigran enjoyed the comedy and conclusion of Holly 's plot , in what she deemed a " pretty decent " episode , though found Charice 's appearance extraneous . IGN 's Robert Canning gave " A Night of Neglect " 8 @.@ 5 / 10 , and called it " a bright and funny installment " . He too praised the comedy storylines , particularly the League of Doom plot and the academic decathlon scenes , as : " it 's this type of off @-@ topic shenanigans ( read : not about fitting in or Rachel Berry becoming a star ) that breathes refreshing life into Glee and keeps reminding us how funny and entertaining this series can be . " He was less impressed with the benefit concert , which he felt harmed the episode 's pacing , and as with Gonzalez , found the nature of Mercedes ' storyline repetitive . 
 = = = = Musical performances = = = = 
 Musical performance in the episode , which Entertainment Weekly 's Emily Exton observed failed to fit the " neglected " criteria , also attracted mixed reviews . Futterman wrote that Charice " pull [ ed ] out all the stops " , with her cover of " All By Myself " , which reached " power notes [ that provided ] a viable threat to Rachel and Mercedes ' diva singing " . The Wall Street Journal 's Raymund Flandez commended her vocal " control and efficiency belying her young age " , Semigran called it a " stirring rendition " , and Gonzalez gave it an " A " , her joint highest grade of the episode . Her second " A " was awarded to " Bubble Toes " , which she called " one of the best [ performances ] of the season . " Semigran concurred , " [ Mike 's ] dancing is awesome . " 
 Critics disapproved of the continuing trend for cutting short Tina 's solos . Gonzalez gave her rendition of " I Follow Rivers " a " B " and commented : " Will Tina ever get to finish a song ? Well , judging by the 20 seconds we saw , she certainly deserves to . " Futterman called her performance " mostly spot @-@ on " , and TVLine 's Michael Slezak pointed out : " Why is it that every time Tina sings — remember her sobbing " My Funny Valentine " — things end weirdly ? I wish we 'd gotten a little more vocal and a little less booing in an episode about the club 's underappreciated talents . " Exton suggested , " Maybe she 'll get a chance to do a non @-@ comedic relief song in its entirety by season 5 ? " Flandez disliked her performance ; he commented that she sounded " like a flailing white swan , a poor man 's Bjork . " 
 Holly 's performance of " Turning Tables " was considered inferior to the original . Futterman named it her least @-@ favorite of Paltrow 's covers to date and said that her vocals " lacked the texture that made Adele 's version so heartbreaking . " Gonzalez gave it her lowest grade of the episode , a " B – " , and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is " a nice enough singer , " she " in no way has the chops " the song requires . While Flandez called it a " scene @-@ stealing turn " and commended it visually and vocally , he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele 's veracity . 
 Mercedes ' " Ain 't No Way " was named the best performance of the episode by both Futterman , who enjoyed her " powerhouse vocals " , and the New York Post 's Jarett Wieselman , who called it " unbelievable " , and praised the focus placed on Mercedes following a season which failed to showcase her . Flandez described the number as being " glamorously sung like [ the ] star she is " , and hoped that she would be better used in future . In contrast , Reiter called it " a restrained rendition " , but " prettily sung nonetheless " , and Gonzalez struggled to connect with the " uncharacteristically average " song , though noted that for Mercedes that is " still 10 times better than a normal person " and awarded it a " B + " . 
 = 1964 Brinks Hotel bombing = 
 The Brinks Hotel in Saigon , also known as the Brink Bachelor Officers Quarters ( <unk> ) , was bombed by the Viet Cong on the evening of December 24 , 1964 , during the Vietnam War . Two Viet Cong operatives detonated a car bomb underneath the hotel , which housed United States Army officers . The explosion killed two Americans , an officer and an NCO , and injured approximately 60 , including military personnel and Vietnamese civilians . 
 The Vietcong commanders had planned the venture with two objectives in mind . First , by attacking an American installation in the center of the heavily guarded capital , the Vietcong intended to demonstrate their ability to strike in South Vietnam should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam . Second , the bombing would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection . 
 The bombing prompted debate within the administration of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson . Most of his advisers favored retaliatory bombing of North Vietnam and the introduction of American combat troops , while Johnson preferred the existing strategy of training the Army of the Republic of Vietnam to protect South Vietnam from the Vietcong . In the end , Johnson decided not to take retaliatory action . 
 = = Background and planning = = 
 Following World War II , the communist @-@ dominated Vietminh fought the French colonial forces in an attempt to gain Vietnamese independence . After the French defeat at the Battle of Dien Bien Phu in 1954 , Vietnam was partitioned at the 17th parallel , pending national reunification elections in 1956 . The elections were canceled , resulting in the long @-@ term existence of communist North Vietnam and anti @-@ communist South Vietnam as separate states . In the late @-@ 1950s , South Vietnamese guerrillas known as the Viet Cong — covertly supported by North Vietnam — began an insurgency with the aim of forcefully reunifying the country under communist rule . With the Cold War at its height , the United States — the main backer of South Vietnam — sent military advisers into the country to help train and guide the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) in their fight against the Vietcong . By 1964 , there were 23 @,@ 000 American military personnel in the country . The communists viewed the Americans as colonizers and the South Vietnamese as their puppets , and attacked both with force . 
 The bombing was planned and performed by two Vietcong agents who escaped uninjured and were never captured . Nguyen Thanh Xuan recollected his involvement to historian Stanley Karnow after the war had ended . In late @-@ November , Xuan and his comrade received orders from a Vietcong intermediary to bomb the Brinks Hotel . The building housed United States Army officers , including lieutenant colonels and majors , and attracted off @-@ duty personnel with its highly regarded food and drink , rooftop seating areas and movie screenings . It was a six @-@ story building and had 193 bedrooms . The Vietcong duo observed their target over the next month , mixing with the crowds in the busy street outside . Noting that South Vietnamese officers mingled freely with Americans , they obtained ARVN uniforms from Saigon 's black market , enabling them to get closer . Xuan disguised himself as a military chauffeur , while his partner dressed as a South Vietnamese major . They mingled with the real officers so that they could copy their mannerisms , speaking style and even their way of smoking . The Vietcong pair then procured the two cars and explosives needed for the operation . 
 The Vietcong commanders had planned the venture with two aims in mind . Firstly , by attacking an American institution in the heart of the heavily guarded capital , the bombing would demonstrate the Vietcong 's ability to strike against the Americans in Vietnam , should the United States decide to launch air raids against North Vietnam . Secondly , the attack would demonstrate to the South Vietnamese public that the Americans were vulnerable and could not be relied upon for protection . Xuan added that " all the crimes committed by the Americans were directed from this nerve center " . He recalled that the number of American officers at the Brinks Hotel had swelled on Christmas Eve because they were using the building to coordinate their celebrations , and that the attack would therefore cause more casualties than on a normal day . 
 = = Explosion = = 
 The bombers stashed explosives weighing approximately 90 kilograms ( 200 lb ) in the trunk of one of the cars , and set a timing device to trigger the bomb at 17 : 45 , during the happy hour in the officers ' bar at the hotel . The pair drove their vehicles into the hotel 's grounds . Knowing from their intelligence that a certain American colonel had returned to the US , the " major " lied and told the hotel clerk that he had an appointment with the American officer , claiming that the colonel would be coming from Da Lat . The clerk correctly replied that the colonel had left the country , but the " major " insisted that the clerk was mistaken . The " major " then parked his vehicle in the car park beneath the hotel , before ordering his chauffeur to leave and fetch the American with the other vehicle . He then left the hotel grounds , asking the guard to tell the American colonel to wait for him . The " major " claimed that he had not eaten all day and was going to a nearby café . 
 While the " major " was at the eatery , the bomb detonated , killing two Americans . The only officer killed was Lieutenant Colonel James Robert Hagen , who had served in the army for 20 years and was working for the MACV . The second victim was Staff Sergeant Benjamin Beltran Castañeda serving with the MACV and an army veteran of 20 years , who died of his wounds on January 23 , 1965 . 
 The injury reports are conflicting . Karnow reported that 58 people ( military and civilian ) were injured , Mark Moyar reported that 38 American officers were wounded along with 25 Vietnamese civilians , while journalist A. J. <unk> reported that 10 Americans and 43 Vietnamese were injured . Apart from the steel girders , which supported the building , the explosion completely destroyed the ground floor . The bottom four floors were all punctured by the blast and sustained significant damage . The damage was accentuated because several trucks were in the underground car park , with gas canisters ready for delivery . As a result , the explosion detonated the gas , creating a fireball . At the time , American entertainers , including Bob Hope , were in Saigon to perform for US personnel . It is unclear whether Hope was a target ; Moyar reported that Hope was targeted , but was delayed at the airport due to a luggage mishap , while Lawrence J. Quirk reported that the comedian and his troupe were staying in a hotel across the street and were not in range of the blast . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The attack surprised American officials and policymakers on Vietnam , who were confident that the South Vietnamese government was in control in Saigon and that the Vietcong were only a threat in rural areas . The South Vietnamese government was unstable , as it was the latest in a series of military juntas that had ruled for brief periods before being deposed . The infighting exasperated Maxwell Taylor , the US ambassador to South Vietnam and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , who felt that the disputes between the junta 's senior officers were derailing the war effort . Less than two weeks before the bombing , the generals had dissolved the High National Council , a civilian advisory body , prompting Taylor to summon the generals to his office . The ambassador then angrily denounced the generals , and the next day advised General Nguyen Khanh , the president , to resign and go into exile , as he had lost Taylor 's confidence . Khanh threatened to expel Taylor , who said that his forced departure would mean the end of US support for South Vietnam . On December 22 , Khanh announced on Radio Vietnam that " We make sacrifices for the country 's independence and the Vietnamese people 's liberty , but not to carry out the policy of any foreign country " . Khanh explicitly denounced Taylor in an interview published in the New York Herald Tribune on December 23 , and on the day of the bombing , he issued a declaration of independence from " foreign manipulation " . At the time , Khanh was also secretly negotiating with the communists , hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam . As a result , there was a suspicion among a minority that Khanh and his officers had been behind the attack , even though the Vietcong had claimed responsibility through a radio broadcast . 
 General William Westmoreland , who was the U.S. Army commander in South Vietnam , Taylor , and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington , D.C. urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to authorize reprisal bombings against North Vietnam . Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day , saying , " Hanoi will get the word that , despite our present tribulations , there is still bite in the tiger they call paper , and the U.S. stock in this part of the world will take sharp rise . Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate . " Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action , citing the animosity between himself and Khanh 's junta . 
 Johnson called his U.S.-based advisers to his Texas ranch for discussions on Christmas Day . Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara advised Johnson to reject Taylor 's proposal . Johnson declined to act , stating that an escalation during the Christmas period would be inappropriate , as it would damage public morale . He also noted that because of the political instability in Saigon , the international community and the American public were unlikely to believe that the Vietcong were behind the attack , feeling that they would instead blame local infighting for the bombing . This was despite the fact that the Vietcong had already claimed responsibility . Johnson administration officials concluded four days after the bombing that the Vietcong were responsible . Johnson believed that it was too late to retaliate and that any action taken more than 36 hours after the event constituted unprovoked aggression . The State Department cabled Taylor and the embassy , saying that " In view of the overall confusion in Saigon " , public U.S. and international opinion towards an American air strike would be that the Johnson administration was " trying to shoot its way out of an internal [ South Vietnamese ] political crisis " . Johnson said to Taylor that " Every time I get a military recommendation it seems to me that it calls for large @-@ scale bombing . I have never felt that this war will be won from the air . " At the time , Johnson was reluctant to accede to his officials ' calls for large @-@ scale bombing of North Vietnam , a strategy that eventually became policy . 
 In January 1965 , the Vietcong secretly held their 3rd Conference in South Vietnam and concluded that in failing to retaliate , " the Americans lacked the will to strike North Vietnam or shield South Vietnam from the mortal blow " . At the time , North Vietnam vigorously denied ever sending troops or equipment into South Vietnam . In reality , both sides violated the 1954 Geneva Accords by covertly infiltrating the other 's borders to carry out hostile military activity . Meanwhile , South Vietnam 's government had imposed media censorship in November 1964 and closed ten newspapers for sympathizing with the communists . 
 The attack fomented feelings of insecurity among American policymakers about communist attacks . Johnson hoped that the continuing presence of American military advisers would be sufficient to strengthen the ARVN so that it could stabilize the Saigon government , but many of his defense department advisers felt that American combat troops were needed on the ground . This increased the tension between the president 's civilian and military officials , before the Americans became directly involved in fighting in 1965 . David Tucker of the United States Army War College said that the bombing was " insignificant for the conventional military balance but important for the political struggle that was the primary focus of the enemy [ Vietcong ] " . The facility was repaired and American officers continued to stay there until the fall of Saigon on April 30 , 1975 , when the communists overran South Vietnam and reunified the country under their rule . 
 Today , the site is a Park Hyatt hotel built along French Colonial architectural lines , and there is a memorial to the bombing on site . 
 = Komodo dragon = 
 The Komodo dragon ( Varanus komodoensis ) , also known as the Komodo monitor , is a large species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands of Komodo , Rinca , Flores , Gili <unk> , and Padar . A member of the monitor lizard family <unk> , it is the largest living species of lizard , growing to a maximum length of 3 metres ( 10 ft ) in rare cases and weighing up to approximately 70 kilograms ( 150 lb ) . 
 Their unusually large size has been attributed to island gigantism , since no other carnivorous animals fill the niche on the islands where they live . However , recent research suggests the large size of Komodo dragons may be better understood as representative of a relict population of very large varanid lizards that once lived across Indonesia and Australia , most of which , along with other megafauna , died out after the Pleistocene . Fossils very similar to V. komodoensis have been found in Australia dating to greater than 3 @.@ 8 million years ago , and its body size remained stable on Flores , one of the handful of Indonesian islands where it is currently found , over the last 900 @,@ 000 years , " a time marked by major faunal turnovers , extinction of the island 's megafauna , and the arrival of early hominids by 880 ka [ <unk> ] . " 
 As a result of their size , these lizards dominate the ecosystems in which they live . Komodo dragons hunt and ambush prey including invertebrates , birds , and mammals . It has been claimed that they have a venomous bite ; there are two glands in the lower jaw which secrete several toxic proteins . The biological significance of these proteins is disputed , but the glands have been shown to secrete an anticoagulant . Komodo dragon group behaviour in hunting is exceptional in the reptile world . The diet of big Komodo dragons mainly consists of deer , though they also eat considerable amounts of carrion . Komodo dragons also occasionally attack humans in the area of West <unk> Regency where they live in Indonesia . 
 Mating begins between May and August , and the eggs are laid in September . About 20 eggs are deposited in abandoned <unk> nests or in a self @-@ dug nesting hole . The eggs are incubated for seven to eight months , hatching in April , when insects are most plentiful . Young Komodo dragons are vulnerable and therefore dwell in trees , safe from predators and cannibalistic adults . They take 8 to 9 years to mature , and are estimated to live up to 30 years . 
 Komodo dragons were first recorded by Western scientists in 1910 . Their large size and fearsome reputation make them popular zoo exhibits . In the wild , their range has contracted due to human activities , and they are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN . They are protected under Indonesian law , and a national park , Komodo National Park , was founded to aid protection efforts . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The Komodo dragon is also known as the Komodo monitor or the Komodo Island monitor in scientific literature , although this is not very common . To the natives of Komodo Island , it is referred to as ora , <unk> <unk> ( land crocodile ) , or <unk> <unk> ( giant monitor ) . 
 = = Evolutionary history = = 
 The evolutionary development of the Komodo dragon started with the Varanus genus , which originated in Asia about 40 million years ago and migrated to Australia . Around 15 million years ago , a collision between Australia and Southeast Asia allowed the varanids to move into what is now the Indonesian archipelago , extending their range as far east as the island of Timor . The Komodo dragon was believed to have differentiated from its Australian ancestors 4 million years ago . However , recent fossil evidence from Queensland suggests the Komodo dragon evolved in Australia before spreading to Indonesia . Dramatic lowering of sea level during the last glacial period uncovered extensive stretches of continental shelf that the Komodo dragon colonised , becoming isolated in their present island range as sea levels rose afterwards . 
 = = Description = = 
 In the wild , an adult Komodo dragon usually weighs around 70 kg ( 150 lb ) , although captive specimens often weigh more . According to the Guinness Book of World Records , an average adult male will weigh 79 to 91 kg ( 174 to 201 lb ) and measure 2 @.@ 59 m ( 8 @.@ 5 ft ) , while an average female will weigh 68 to 73 kg ( 150 to 161 lb ) and measure 2 @.@ 29 m ( 7 @.@ 5 ft ) . The largest verified wild specimen was 3 @.@ 13 m ( 10 @.@ 3 ft ) long and weighed 166 kg ( 366 lb ) , including undigested food . The Komodo dragon has a tail as long as its body , as well as about 60 frequently replaced , serrated teeth that can measure up to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) in length . Its saliva is frequently blood @-@ tinged , because its teeth are almost completely covered by gingival tissue that is naturally lacerated during feeding . It also has a long , yellow , deeply forked tongue . Komodo dragon skin is reinforced by armoured scales , which contain tiny bones called osteoderms that function as a sort of natural chain @-@ mail . This rugged hide makes Komodo dragon skin poorly suited for making into leather . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 As with other varanids , Komodo dragons have only a single ear bone , the stapes , for transferring vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea . This arrangement means they are likely restricted to sounds in the 400 to 2 @,@ 000 hertz range , compared to humans who hear between 20 and 20 @,@ 000 hertz . It was formerly thought to be deaf when a study reported no agitation in wild Komodo dragons in response to whispers , raised voices , or shouts . This was disputed when London Zoological Garden employee Joan Proctor trained a captive specimen to come out to feed at the sound of her voice , even when she could not be seen . 
 The Komodo dragon can see objects as far away as 300 m ( 980 ft ) , but because its retinas only contain cones , it is thought to have poor night vision . The Komodo dragon is able to see in colour , but has poor visual discrimination of stationary objects . 
 The Komodo dragon uses its tongue to detect , taste , and smell stimuli , as with many other reptiles , with the vomeronasal sense using the Jacobson 's organ , rather than using the nostrils . With the help of a favorable wind and its habit of swinging its head from side to side as it walks , a Komodo dragon may be able to detect carrion from 4 – 9 @.@ 5 km ( 2 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 9 mi ) away . It only has a few taste buds in the back of its throat . Its scales , some of which are reinforced with bone , have sensory plaques connected to nerves to facilitate its sense of touch . The scales around the ears , lips , chin , and soles of the feet may have three or more sensory plaques . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The Komodo dragon prefers hot and dry places , and typically lives in dry , open grassland , savanna , and tropical forest at low elevations . As an <unk> , it is most active in the day , although it exhibits some nocturnal activity . Komodo dragons are solitary , coming together only to breed and eat . They are capable of running rapidly in brief sprints up to 20 km / h ( 12 mph ) , diving up to 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) , and climbing trees proficiently when young through use of their strong claws . To catch out @-@ of @-@ reach prey , the Komodo dragon may stand on its hind legs and use its tail as a support . As it matures , its claws are used primarily as weapons , as its great size makes climbing impractical . 
 For shelter , the Komodo dragon digs holes that can measure from 1 to 3 m ( 3 @.@ 3 to 9 @.@ 8 ft ) wide with its powerful forelimbs and claws . Because of its large size and habit of sleeping in these burrows , it is able to conserve body heat throughout the night and minimise its basking period the morning after . The Komodo dragon hunts in the afternoon , but stays in the shade during the hottest part of the day . These special resting places , usually located on ridges with cool sea breezes , are marked with droppings and are cleared of vegetation . They serve as strategic locations from which to ambush deer . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Komodo dragons are carnivores . Although they eat mostly carrion , they will also ambush live prey with a stealthy approach . When suitable prey arrives near a dragon 's ambush site , it will suddenly charge at the animal and go for the underside or the throat . It is able to locate its prey using its keen sense of smell , which can locate a dead or dying animal from a range of up to 9 @.@ 5 km ( 5 @.@ 9 mi ) . Komodo dragons have been observed knocking down large pigs and deer with their strong tails . 
 Komodo dragons eat by tearing large chunks of flesh and swallowing them whole while holding the carcass down with their forelegs . For smaller prey up to the size of a goat , their loosely articulated jaws , flexible skulls , and expandable stomachs allow them to swallow prey whole . The vegetable contents of the stomach and intestines are typically avoided . Copious amounts of red saliva the Komodo dragons produce help to lubricate the food , but swallowing is still a long process ( 15 – 20 minutes to swallow a goat ) . A Komodo dragon may attempt to speed up the process by ramming the carcass against a tree to force it down its throat , sometimes ramming so forcefully , the tree is knocked down . A small tube under the tongue that connects to the lungs allows it to breathe while swallowing . After eating up to 80 % of its body weight in one meal , it drags itself to a sunny location to speed digestion , as the food could rot and poison the dragon if left undigested for too long . Because of their slow metabolism , large dragons can survive on as few as 12 meals a year . After digestion , the Komodo dragon regurgitates a mass of horns , hair , and teeth known as the gastric pellet , which is covered in malodorous mucus . After regurgitating the gastric pellet , it rubs its face in the dirt or on bushes to get rid of the mucus , suggesting it does not relish the scent of its own excretions . 
 The largest animals eat first , while the smaller ones follow a hierarchy . The largest male asserts his dominance and the smaller males show their submission by use of body language and rumbling hisses . Dragons of equal size may resort to " wrestling " . Losers usually retreat , though they have been known to be killed and eaten by victors . 
 The Komodo dragon 's diet is wide @-@ ranging , and includes invertebrates , other reptiles ( including smaller Komodo dragons ) , birds , bird eggs , small mammals , monkeys , wild boar , goats , deer , horses , and water buffalo . Young Komodos will eat insects , eggs , geckos , and small mammals . Occasionally , they attack and bite humans ( see first paragraphs of this article ) . Sometimes they consume human corpses , digging up bodies from shallow graves . This habit of raiding graves caused the villagers of Komodo to move their graves from sandy to clay ground and pile rocks on top of them to deter the lizards . The Komodo dragon may have evolved to feed on the extinct dwarf elephant <unk> that once lived on Flores , according to evolutionary biologist Jared Diamond . 
 The Komodo dragon drinks by sucking water into its mouth via buccal pumping ( a process also used for respiration ) , lifting its head , and letting the water run down its throat . 
 = = = Saliva = = = 
 Although previous studies proposed that Komodo dragon saliva contains a variety of highly septic bacteria that would help to bring down prey , research in 2013 suggested that the bacteria in the mouths of Komodo dragons are ordinary and similar to those found in other carnivores . They actually have surprisingly good mouth hygiene . As Bryan Fry put it : " After they are done feeding , they will spend 10 to 15 minutes lip @-@ licking and rubbing their head in the leaves to clean their mouth ... Unlike people have been led to believe , they do not have chunks of rotting flesh from their meals on their teeth , cultivating bacteria . " The observation of prey dying of sepsis would then be explained by the natural instinct of water buffalos , who are not native to the islands where the Komodo dragon lives , to run into water when attacked . The warm , faeces @-@ filled water would then cause the infections . The study used samples from 16 captive dragons ( 10 adults and six neonates ) from three U.S. zoos . 
 = = = Venom = = = 
 In late 2005 , researchers at the University of Melbourne speculated the <unk> ( Varanus giganteus ) , other species of monitors , and <unk> may be somewhat venomous . The team believes the immediate effects of bites from these lizards were caused by mild envenomation . Bites on human digits by a lace monitor ( V. varius ) , a Komodo dragon , and a spotted tree monitor ( V. <unk> ) all produced similar effects : rapid swelling , localised disruption of blood clotting , and shooting pain up to the elbow , with some symptoms lasting for several hours . 
 In 2009 , the same researchers published further evidence demonstrating Komodo dragons possess a venomous bite . MRI scans of a preserved skull showed the presence of two glands in the lower jaw . The researchers extracted one of these glands from the head of a terminally ill dragon in the Singapore Zoological Gardens , and found it secreted several different toxic proteins . The known functions of these proteins include inhibition of blood clotting , lowering of blood pressure , muscle paralysis , and the induction of hypothermia , leading to shock and loss of consciousness in <unk> prey . As a result of the discovery , the previous theory that bacteria were responsible for the deaths of Komodo victims was disputed . 
 Kurt Schwenk , an evolutionary biologist at the University of Connecticut , finds the discovery of these glands intriguing , but considers most of the evidence for venom in the study to be " meaningless , irrelevant , incorrect or falsely misleading " . Even if the lizards have venom @-@ like proteins in their mouths , Schwenk argues , they may be using them for a different function , and he doubts venom is necessary to explain the effect of a Komodo dragon bite , arguing that shock and blood loss are the primary factors . 
 Other scientists have stated that this allegation of venom glands " has had the effect of underestimating the variety of complex roles played by oral secretions in the biology of reptiles , produced a very narrow view of oral secretions and resulted in misinterpretation of reptilian evolution " . According to these scientists " reptilian oral secretions contribute to many biological roles other than to quickly dispatch prey " . These researchers concluded that , " Calling all in this clade venomous implies an overall potential danger that does not exist , misleads in the assessment of medical risks , and confuses the biological assessment of <unk> biochemical systems " . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Mating occurs between May and August , with the eggs laid in September . During this period , males fight over females and territory by grappling with one another upon their hind legs , with the loser eventually being pinned to the ground . These males may vomit or defecate when preparing for the fight . The winner of the fight will then flick his long tongue at the female to gain information about her receptivity . Females are antagonistic and resist with their claws and teeth during the early phases of courtship . Therefore , the male must fully restrain the female during coitus to avoid being hurt . Other courtship displays include males rubbing their chins on the female , hard scratches to the back , and licking . Copulation occurs when the male inserts one of his <unk> into the female 's cloaca . Komodo dragons may be monogamous and form " pair bonds " , a rare behavior for lizards . 
 Female Komodos lay their eggs from August to September and may use several types of locality ; in one study , 60 % laid their eggs in the nests of orange @-@ footed <unk> ( a <unk> or <unk> ) , 20 % on ground level and 20 % in hilly areas . The females make many camouflage nests / holes to prevent other dragons from eating the eggs . Clutches contain an average of 20 eggs , which have an incubation period of 7 – 8 months . Hatching is an exhausting effort for the neonates , which break out of their eggshells with an egg tooth that falls off soon after . After cutting themselves out , the hatchlings may lie in their eggshells for hours before starting to dig out of the nest . They are born quite defenseless and are vulnerable to predation . Sixteen youngsters from a single nest were on average 46 @.@ 5 cm long and weighed 105 @.@ 1 grams . 
 Young Komodo dragons spend much of their first few years in trees , where they are relatively safe from predators , including cannibalistic adults , as juvenile dragons make up 10 % of their diets . The habit of cannibalism may be advantageous in sustaining the large size of adults , as medium @-@ sized prey on the islands is rare . When the young approach a kill , they roll around in faecal matter and rest in the intestines of eviscerated animals to deter these hungry adults . Komodo dragons take approximately 8 to 9 years to mature , and may live for up to 30 years . 
 = = = = Parthenogenesis = = = = 
 A Komodo dragon at London Zoo named Sungai laid a clutch of eggs in late 2005 after being separated from male company for more than two years . Scientists initially assumed she had been able to store sperm from her earlier encounter with a male , an adaptation known as <unk> . On 20 December 2006 , it was reported that Flora , a captive Komodo dragon living in the Chester Zoo in England , was the second known Komodo dragon to have laid unfertilised eggs : she laid 11 eggs , and seven of them hatched , all of them male . Scientists at Liverpool University in England performed genetic tests on three eggs that collapsed after being moved to an incubator , and verified Flora had never been in physical contact with a male dragon . After Flora 's eggs ' condition had been discovered , testing showed Sungai 's eggs were also produced without outside fertilization . On 31 January 2008 , the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita , Kansas , became the first zoo in the Americas to document parthenogenesis in Komodo dragons . The zoo has two adult female Komodo dragons , one of which laid about 17 eggs on 19 – 20 May 2007 . Only two eggs were incubated and hatched due to space issues ; the first hatched on 31 January 2008 , while the second hatched on 1 February . Both hatchlings were males . 
 Komodo dragons have the ZW chromosomal sex @-@ determination system , as opposed to the mammalian XY system . Male progeny prove Flora 's unfertilised eggs were haploid ( n ) and doubled their chromosomes later to become diploid ( 2n ) ( by being fertilised by a polar body , or by chromosome duplication without cell division ) , rather than by her laying diploid eggs by one of the meiosis reduction @-@ divisions in her ovaries failing . When a female Komodo dragon ( with ZW sex chromosomes ) reproduces in this manner , she provides her progeny with only one chromosome from each of her pairs of chromosomes , including only one of her two sex chromosomes . This single set of chromosomes is duplicated in the egg , which develops parthenogenetically . Eggs receiving a Z chromosome become ZZ ( male ) ; those receiving a W chromosome become WW and fail to develop , meaning that only males are produced by parthenogenesis in this species . 
 It has been hypothesised that this reproductive adaptation allows a single female to enter an isolated ecological niche ( such as an island ) and by parthenogenesis produce male offspring , thereby establishing a sexually reproducing population ( via reproduction with her offspring that can result in both male and female young ) . Despite the advantages of such an adaptation , zoos are cautioned that parthenogenesis may be detrimental to genetic diversity .

 Komodo dragons were first documented by Europeans in 1910 , when rumors of a " land crocodile " reached Lieutenant van Steyn van <unk> of the Dutch colonial administration . Widespread notoriety came after 1912 , when Peter <unk> , the director of the Zoological Museum at Bogor , Java , published a paper on the topic after receiving a photo and a skin from the lieutenant , as well as two other specimens from a collector . The first two live Komodo dragons to arrive in Europe were exhibited in the Reptile House at London Zoo when it opened in 1927 . Joan Beauchamp Procter made some of the earliest observations of these animals in captivity and she demonstrated the behaviour of one of these animals at a Scientific Meeting of the Zoological Society of London in 1928 . The Komodo dragon was the driving factor for an expedition to Komodo Island by W. Douglas Burden in 1926 . After returning with 12 preserved specimens and 2 live ones , this expedition provided the inspiration for the 1933 movie King Kong . It was also Burden who coined the common name " Komodo dragon . " Three of his specimens were stuffed and are still on display in the American Museum of Natural History . 
 = = = Studies = = = 
 The Dutch , realizing the limited number of individuals in the wild , outlawed sport hunting and heavily limited the number of individuals taken for scientific study . Collecting expeditions ground to a halt with the occurrence of World War II , not resuming until the 1950s and 1960s , when studies examined the Komodo dragon 's feeding behavior , reproduction , and body temperature . At around this time , an expedition was planned in which a long @-@ term study of the Komodo dragon would be undertaken . This task was given to the Auffenberg family , who stayed on Komodo Island for 11 months in 1969 . During their stay , Walter Auffenberg and his assistant Putra <unk> captured and tagged more than 50 Komodo dragons . The research from the Auffenberg expedition would prove to be enormously influential in raising Komodo dragons in captivity . Research after that of the Auffenberg family has shed more light on the nature of the Komodo dragon , with biologists such as Claudio <unk> continuing to study the creatures . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The Komodo dragon is a vulnerable species and is on the IUCN Red List . The Komodo National Park was founded in 1980 to protect Komodo dragon populations on islands including Komodo , Rinca , and Padar . Later , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> Reserves were opened on Flores to aid with Komodo dragon conservation . 
 Komodo dragons avoid encounters with humans . Juveniles are very shy and will flee quickly into a hideout if a human comes closer than about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) . Older animals will also retreat from humans from a shorter distance away . If cornered , they will react aggressively by gaping their mouth , hissing , and swinging their tail . If they are disturbed further , they may start an attack and bite . Although there are anecdotes of unprovoked Komodo dragons attacking or preying on humans , most of these reports are either not reputable or caused by defensive bites . Only a very few cases are truly the result of unprovoked attacks by abnormal individuals , which lost their fear towards humans . 
 Volcanic activity , earthquakes , loss of habitat , fire , loss of prey due to poaching , tourism , and illegal poaching of the dragons themselves have all contributed to the vulnerable status of the Komodo dragon . Under Appendix I of CITES ( the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ) , commercial trade of skins or specimens is illegal . 
 In 2013 , total population in the wild was assessed as 3 @,@ 222 individuals , declining to 3 @,@ 092 in 2014 and 3 @,@ 014 in 2015 . Populations remained relatively stable on the bigger islands ( Komodo and Rinca ) , but decreased on smaller island such as Nusa Kode and Gili <unk> , likely due to diminishing prey availability . On Padar , a former population of the Komodo dragon became extinct , of which the last individuals were seen in 1975 . It is widely assumed that the Komodo dragon died out on Padar after a strong decline of the populations of large ungulate prey , for which poaching was most likely responsible . 
 = = = In captivity = = = 
 Komodo dragons have long been great zoo attractions , where their size and reputation make them popular exhibits . They are , however , rare in zoos because they are susceptible to infection and parasitic disease if captured from the wild , and do not readily reproduce . As of May 2009 , there were 13 European , 2 African , 35 North American , 1 Singaporean , and 2 Australian institutions that kept Komodo dragons . 
 The first Komodo dragons were displayed at London Zoo in 1927 . A Komodo dragon was exhibited in 1934 at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , but it lived for only two years . More attempts to exhibit Komodo dragons were made , but the lifespan of these animals was very short , averaging five years in the National Zoological Park . Studies done by Walter Auffenberg , which were documented in his book The Behavioral Ecology of the Komodo Monitor , eventually allowed for more successful managing and reproducing of the dragons in captivity . 
 A variety of behaviors have been observed from captive specimens . Most individuals are relatively tame within a short time , and are capable of recognising individual humans and discriminating between familiar keepers . Komodo dragons have also been observed to engage in play with a variety of objects , including shovels , cans , plastic rings , and shoes . This behavior does not seem to be " food @-@ motivated predatory behavior " . 
 Even seemingly docile dragons may become unpredictably aggressive , especially when the animal 's territory is invaded by someone unfamiliar . In June 2001 , a Komodo dragon seriously injured Phil Bronstein , the then husband of actress Sharon Stone , when he entered its enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo after being invited in by its keeper . Bronstein was bitten on his bare foot , as the keeper had told him to take off his white shoes and socks , which the keeper stated could potentially excite the Komodo dragon as they were the same colour as the white rats the zoo fed the dragon . Although he escaped , Bronstein needed to have several tendons in his foot reattached surgically .

 Martin St. Louis ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ̃ sɛ ̃ lwi ] ; born June 18 , 1975 ) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player . An undrafted player , St. Louis played over 1 @,@ 000 games and scored 1 @,@ 000 points in an NHL career that began with the Calgary Flames in 1998 and ended with the New York Rangers in 2015 . St. Louis also played for the Tampa Bay Lightning from 2000 until being traded to the Rangers in 2014 , and briefly with HC Lausanne of the Swiss National League A. He was a member of the Tampa Bay Lightning Stanley Cup championship team . 
 St. Louis was a standout player in college for the Vermont Catamounts , earning East Coast Athletic Conference ( ECAC ) and National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) all @-@ star honours for three consecutive seasons between 1995 and 1997 . He was the ECAC player of the year in 1995 . As a professional , St. Louis has been named to an NHL All @-@ Star Team on five occasions and played in six All @-@ Star Games . He was voted the recipient of the Lester B.

 A smaller player than his peers – St. Louis was listed at five feet nine inches tall in college – he often struggled to gain recognition for his ability . He was passed over for a provincial team at a midget age tournament despite leading his league in scoring , while major junior teams showed little interest in him . He was heavily recruited by National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) schools to play for their programs , however . He played one season of junior A hockey with the Hawkesbury Hawks of the Central Junior Hockey League ( CJHL ) in 1992 – 93 where he scored 37 goals and 87 points in just 31 games . The University of Vermont Catamounts convinced St. Louis to join their hockey program . He had 51 points in 33 games in his freshman season of 1993 – 94 and was named to the East Coast Athletic Conference 's All @-@ Rookie Team . 
 In his sophomore season ( 1994 – 95 ) , St. Louis was among the top scorers in the NCAA . He had 71 points in 35 games and was named both an ECAC First Team All @-@ Star and NCAA All @-@ American for the first of three consecutive seasons . Additionally , he was named the ECAC Player of the Year . Named team captain for his junior season , St. Louis scored 85 points in 35 games . He tied friend and teammate Éric Perrin for the NCAA scoring lead and the pair , along with goaltender Tim Thomas , led the Catamounts to the first ECAC hockey championship in school history . Named an all @-@ star at the 1996 NCAA Division I Men 's Ice Hockey Tournament , St. Louis scored the winning goal in a 2 – 1 victory over Lake Superior State to reach the Final Four . The Catamounts lost the national semifinal to Colorado College , 4 – 3 in double overtime . 
 A finalist for the Hobey Baker Award for the first of two consecutive seasons , St. Louis earned interest from National Hockey League ( NHL ) teams in the summer of 1996 . Teams offered signing bonuses of up to $ 150 @,@ 000 hoping to convince him to leave Vermont and turn professional . Believing he could attract similar offers the following year , he chose to complete his final year of college eligibility . His offensive numbers slipped in 1996 – 97 as he scored 59 points in 36 games . St. Louis finished as Vermont 's all @-@ time leading scorer with 267 points , a record he continues to hold as of 2014 , as well as his school mark of 176 assists . He won the J. Edward Donnelly Award as the top male senior athlete at the University of Vermont in 1997 and was named to the ECAC 's all @-@ decade team of the 1990s . The University of Vermont inducted him into its athletics Hall of Fame in 2007 , and in 2012 he was presented with the school 's Alumni Achievement Award . On January 8 , 2016 the University of Vermont retired his jersey number 8 at <unk> Fieldhouse in front of a sold out crowd .

 The NHL offers St. Louis anticipated never materialized as teams lost interest in him . Only the Ottawa Senators offered him a tryout prior to the 1997 – 98 NHL season . When they released him , St. Louis signed a two @-@ year contract with the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League ( IHL ) that included a clause allowing him to leave the team if offered an NHL contract . He had 50 points in 56 games for Cleveland , catching the attention of the Calgary Flames who signed him to a contract on February 18 , 1998 . He was assigned to their American Hockey League ( AHL ) affiliate , the Saint John Flames , where he scored 26 points in 25 regular season games . He then added 20 points in 20 playoff games as Saint John reached the Calder Cup finals , losing in six games to the Philadelphia Phantoms . 
 St. Louis earned a spot on the Calgary roster to begin the 1998 – 99 season and made his NHL debut on October 9 , 1998 , against the San Jose Sharks . He scored his first goal on October 20 against Dallas Stars ' goaltender Roman Turek . He began the season playing with Calgary 's top forward , Theoren Fleury , but was quickly demoted to the fourth line , and often sat out of the lineup . He appeared in only 13 games in Calgary , spending the majority of the season in Saint John where he led the AHL squad with 28 goals and 62 points . He began the 1999 – 2000 season with Saint John , but earned a recall to Calgary after scoring 26 points in 17 games . St. Louis completed his first full NHL season with 3 goals and 18 points in 56 games . Pleased with his progress , general manager Al Coates picked up St. Louis ' contract option for the 2000 – 01 season . However , the organization fired Coates and his staff that summer and the new management team was not interested in retaining St. Louis . The Flames exposed him in the 2000 NHL Expansion Draft , but after he went unselected , the team bought out his contract and made him an unrestricted free agent .

 A few teams expressed interest in St. Louis . He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed they were the most likely to give him playing time in the NHL . He made his debut with the team on October 6 , 2000 . He struggled at first , failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times . Realizing that he was at a career crossroads , St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him , trusting his own instincts . He scored his first goal of the season in late November , and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1 . 
 While leading the team with 16 goals midway through the 2001 – 02 season , St. Louis suffered a broken leg following an awkward check by Josef <unk> of the Pittsburgh Penguins in a late January game . Consequently , he appeared in only 53 of Tampa Bay 's 82 games , finishing with 35 points . He had a breakout season in 2002 – 03 , finishing fourth in team scoring with 70 points and tying Vincent Lecavalier for the team lead with 33 goals . He led the team in plus @-@ minus at + 10 and appeared in his first NHL All @-@ Star Game . St. Louis won the puck control relay event and finished second in the fastest skater events of the 2003 All @-@ Star Game 's skills competition . He scored his first career hat trick on January 30 , 2003 , in a game against the Carolina Hurricanes . In the postseason , Tampa Bay won its first playoff series in franchise history when it eliminated the Washington Capitals . Three of St. Louis ' seven goals were game @-@ winners , including the overtime goal in the sixth game that won the series . He led the team with 12 points in 11 playoff games . 
 St. Louis exceeded his previous season in 2003 – 04 , capturing the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL 's leading scorer with 94 points . He finished fourth overall with 38 goals and his plus @-@ minus of + 38 led the league . St. Louis scored his 100th career goal on February 17 , 2004 , against the Philadelphia Flyers . He led the 2004 Stanley Cup Playoffs with 15 assists and finished with 24 post @-@ season points in 23 games . He led the Lightning to the Stanley Cup Final against Calgary , against whom he scored the overtime winning goal in game six to force a deciding seventh game of the series . The Lightning won the game , 2 – 1 , and secured the franchise 's first Stanley Cup championship . St. Louis won several post @-@ season awards : He was named a First Team All @-@ Star and voted recipient of the Lester B.

St. Louis was only the eighth player in NHL history to win the Art Ross and Hart Trophies and the Stanley Cup in the same season , and the first to do so since Wayne Gretzky in 1986 – 87 . 
 While the 2004 – 05 NHL season was ultimately cancelled by a labour dispute , St. Louis spent it playing in Europe . He signed a contract with HC Lausanne of Switzerland 's National League A. He scored 25 points in 23 games . When the NHL resumed in 2005 – 06 , St. Louis signed a six @-@ year contract extension with the Lightning worth US $ 31 @.@ 5 million . He finished with his third 30 @-@ goal season , but scored only 61 points on the campaign .

He played in his 500th career game on February 9 , 2007 , against the New York Rangers and after becoming the first Lightning player to appear in three All @-@ Star Games , became the first to score a goal in the mid @-@ season event . He was named to the Second All @-@ Star Team following the season . An injury to Tim Taylor resulted in St. Louis being named an alternate captain in 2007 – 08 . St. Louis made his fourth All @-@ Star Game appearance in 2007 – 08 amidst an 83 @-@ point campaign . He scored his 500th career point with a goal against the Buffalo Sabres on March 19 , 2008 . Leading the Lightning with 30 goals , 50 assists and 80 points in 2008 – 09 , St. Louis earned his fifth All @-@ Star appearance . 
 St. Louis finished fifth in the league with 94 points in 2009 – 10 . He had two 11 @-@ game point streaks during the season , the longest in franchise history , and was named to the second All @-@ Star Team . Finishing with only 12 penalty minutes on the season , he was voted the recipient of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the league 's most gentlemanly player . It was the fifth time he had been named a finalist for the award . He won the award for a second time in 2010 – 11 , the culmination of a season in which St. Louis made his sixth All @-@ Star Game appearance , was named to the second All @-@ Star Team for the third time and finished second in league scoring with 99 points . He was a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy for the second time , losing out to Corey Perry . 
 The 2011 – 12 season was the first under a four @-@ year contract extension signed during the previous campaign . Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman praised St. Louis ' importance to the organization when announcing the signing : " Marty means so much to this franchise , both on and off the ice . His hard work and dedication are unsurpassed and we are thrilled that he will finish his career here in Tampa Bay . " A durable player , St. Louis held the NHL 's third longest " ironman " streak among active players , having played every game since 2005 . The streak came to an end at 499 consecutive games played in early December 2011 when he was struck in the face by a shot from teammate Dominic Moore during practice . Despite suffering facial and sinus fractures , he missed only five games due to the injury . The 36 @-@ year @-@ old St. Louis finished the season with 74 points in 77 games . 
 In the lockout @-@ shortened 2012 – 13 season , St. Louis led the NHL with 43 assists , and his 60 points were enough to capture his second Art Ross Trophy as the league 's leading scorer . After the season he was named a Second Team All @-@ Star . With only 14 penalty minutes on the season , St. Louis also won his third Lady Byng Trophy . 
 The Lightning named St. Louis the ninth captain in franchise history prior to the 2013 – 14 season . He replaced Vincent Lecavalier , who departed Tampa in the off @-@ season . St. Louis played his 1,000th NHL game on November 19 , 2013 , against the Los Angeles Kings . He is the 286th player in league history to reach the milestone , but only the 16th undrafted player to do so since the creation of the universal NHL Entry Draft in 1969 . St. Louis set a career high and tied a Lightning franchise record by scoring four goals in a January 18 , 2014 , game against the San Jose Sharks . His 600th career assist came two weeks later in a 5 – 3 loss to the Ottawa Senators on January 30 .

 In January , Lightning general manager Steve Yzerman , who also served as the general manager for Canada 's team at the 2014 Winter Olympics , elected not to include St. Louis on Canada 's roster . St. Louis was ultimately named to the team as an injury replacement after Steven Stamkos was not medically cleared to play . At the same time , St. Louis requested a trade from Tampa Bay . The no movement clause in his contract gave St. Louis control over where he could be moved and he reportedly consented to only being traded to the New York Rangers , a request that he first made in 2009 . The Lightning honoured his request . St. Louis was sent to New York along with a conditional 2015 second @-@ round pick on March 5 , 2014 , in exchange for Ryan Callahan , a 2015 first round draft pick , a conditional 2014 second @-@ round pick ( which became a first @-@ round pick ) , and a conditional 2015 seventh @-@ round pick . Ironically , both of the first @-@ round draft picks acquired by the Lightning in this trade were eventually traded to the New York Islanders . Though reluctant to speak of his reasons for requesting the trade , he eventually admitted that the initial Olympic snub was the primary cause . He felt a lack of respect when Yzerman initially left him off the Canadian team . St. Louis also expressed his regret over the damage the events caused to his relationship with the fans in Tampa . 
 St. Louis struggled offensively in his first games with the Rangers as he went 14 games without scoring a goal . He scored only one in 19 regular season games – finishing the season with 30 combined between Tampa Bay and New York – and added seven assists to finish with 69 points on the season . The death of his mother , France , of a heart attack on May 8 , left St. Louis ' participation in Games 5 and 6 of New York 's second @-@ round playoff series against the Pittsburgh Penguins in doubt . He chose to play after speaking with his father . The Rangers players rallied around St. Louis as he became the team 's focus . He led the Rangers as they overcame a 3 – 1 series deficit against Pittsburgh to win the series in seven games en route to reaching the 2014 Stanley Cup Final . St. Louis led the team with 8 goals in the playoffs and finished second with 15 points , but the Rangers lost the final to the Los Angeles Kings in five games . 
 St. Louis faced the Lightning for the first time following the trade on November 17 , 2014 , a 5 – 1 loss . He scored the lone goal for the Rangers and has now scored at least one goal against all 30 franchises in the NHL . He made his first return to Tampa a week later , a 5 – 4 loss on November 26 , during which the Lightning honoured his tenure with the organization via a video tribute . Two days later , St. Louis recorded a goal and an assist against the Philadelphia Flyers to reach 1 @,@ 000 points in his career . He became the sixth undrafted player in NHL history to reach the milestone . 
 On July 2 , 2015 , St. Louis announced his retirement as a player in the NHL .

 Following his MVP season in the NHL , St. Louis joined Team Canada for the first time , appearing at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey . With a goal and an assist , he led Canada to an opening game , 2 – 1 victory over the United States . Overall , he scored four points in six games as Canada won the World Cup . The majority of that team returned for the 2006 Winter Olympic tournament , and St. Louis played in his first Olympic Games . The team struggled offensively throughout the tournament , finishing in seventh place . St. Louis scored two goals and added an assist in six games . 
 St. Louis has twice played in the World Championships . He first played in the 2008 tournament , held in Canada . He appeared in all nine games for Team Canada , scoring ten points . Canada reached the final , but were forced to settle for the silver medal after a 5 – 4 overtime loss to Russia . Returning for the 2009 World Championship in Switzerland , St. Louis led the tournament in scoring with 15 points . Canada met Russia in a rematch of the 2008 final , however St. Louis and his teammates were again relegated to the silver medal , dropping a 2 – 1 decision . St. Louis was named to the tournament 's all @-@ star team at forward . He was selected as a reserve by Team Canada for the 2010 Winter Olympics . On February 6 , 2014 , he was selected to replace injured former Lightning teammate Steven Stamkos for representation at the 2014 Winter Olympics and played in five of Canada 's six games . St. Louis won an Olympic Gold Medal with Team Canada in a 3 @-@ 0 victory over Sweden in the gold medal game .

 Listed at five @-@ foot @-@ eight inches tall during his playing days , St. Louis found himself to be one of the smallest players in the NHL . Hockey Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman credited St. Louis ' desire to succeed as being his primary attribute : " His long suit is his passion . Small players have to have some special attribute that makes them stand out . He 's got great acceleration and hockey sense . " St. Louis was also a durable player throughout his career , missing only seven games between 2002 and 2012 . 
 An offensive minded player throughout his amateur and minor professional career , St. Louis was forced into a checking @-@ line role by the Calgary Flames . He credits the experience for rounding out his game : " I played a true third @-@ line role , killing penalties and playing against the other team 's top lines . For me , it was like a five @-@ month crash course on developing my defensive game . My whole life , I had been an offensive player , and suddenly I was in the role of trying to be smart without the puck . I think those fifty @-@ six games helped me develop into a complete player .

 = Kingdom Hearts II = 
 Kingdom Hearts II ( Japanese : <unk> , Hepburn : Kingudamu Hātsu Tsū ) is an action role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square Enix in 2005 for the PlayStation 2 video game console . The game is a sequel to Kingdom Hearts , which combined Disney and Square elements into an action role @-@ playing game , though it is somewhat darker in tone than its predecessor . The game 's popularity has resulted in a novel and manga series based upon it and an international version called Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , released in March 2007 . 
 Kingdom Hearts II is the third game in the Kingdom Hearts series . It picks up one year after the events of Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories . Sora , the protagonist of the first two games , returns to search for his lost friends . Like the previous games , Kingdom Hearts II features a large cast of characters from Disney films and Final Fantasy games . Organization XIII , a group introduced in Chain of Memories , also reappears to impede Sora 's progress . 
 The game was well @-@ received and earned year @-@ end awards from numerous video gaming websites . In Japan , it shipped more than one million copies within a week of its release . One month after its North American release , it had sold over one million copies and was the second best @-@ selling game of 2006 . By March 31 , 2007 , the game had shipped over 4 million copies worldwide . 
 The game was actor Pat Morita 's final voice role before his death in November 2005 . The Final Mix version of the game was re @-@ released in high definition for Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 5 Remix for the PlayStation 3 , along with Kingdom Hearts : Birth by Sleep Final Mix and Kingdom Hearts Re : coded . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The gameplay of Kingdom Hearts II is similar to that of Kingdom Hearts , though developers made an effort to address numerous complaints with the previous game . The player directly controls Sora from a third @-@ person camera angle , though first @-@ person perspective is available via Select button . Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place . The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next , usually told via cutscenes , though there are numerous side @-@ quests available that provide bonuses to characters . 
 Like many traditional role @-@ playing video games , Kingdom Hearts II features an experience point system which determines character development . As enemies are defeated , the player and allies culminate experience to " level up " , in which the playable characters grow stronger and gain access to new abilities . 
 Combat in Kingdom Hearts II is in real @-@ time and involves button presses which initiate attacks by the on @-@ screen character . A role @-@ playing game menu on the screen 's bottom left , similar to those found in Final Fantasy games , provides other combat options such as using magic or items , summoning beings to assist in battle , or executing combination attacks with other party members . A new feature is the " Reaction Command " , special enemy @-@ specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle . Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage , and are sometimes necessary to complete a boss battle . In addition to the main character , two party members are usually present who also participate in combat . Although these characters are computer @-@ controlled , the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen , such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets . 
 In response to criticism , the " Gummi Ship " feature of the first game was re @-@ imagined to be " more enjoyable " . Although retaining its basic purpose of travel , the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of rail shooter and " Disney theme park ride " . In the world map , the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a top @-@ down view and fly to the world the player wishes to enter . Worlds are no longer open from the beginning — the player must unlock the routes to them by entering a new level , controlling the ship from a third @-@ person point of view , and battling enemy ships . After the route is opened , travel to the world is unimpeded , unless it is blocked again due to a plot @-@ related event . The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes , which is also a new feature from the first game . 
 = = = Drive Gauge = = = 
 One of the new features is a meter known as the " Drive Gauge " . The Drive Gauge has dual functions : to transform Sora into a " Drive Form " or to summon a special character . While in a Drive Form , Sora bonds with party members to become more powerful and acquire different attributes ; all but two Forms also allow the use of two Keyblades . When a Drive is executed , Sora 's combat statistics are heightened . Drive Forms also give Sora new abilities that can be used in normal form , called " Growth Abilities . " Sora 's first two Drive Forms only combine power with one party member ; later @-@ obtained Drive Forms require him to bond with both party members . When allies are used in a Drive , they are temporarily removed from battle for its duration . Unlike the HP and MP gauges , the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points . 
 Like in the first game , Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle . Summons will replace the two computer @-@ controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows , or until Sora 's HP runs out . Instead of being limited to only one action , Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora . These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button . The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria ; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms , access to new abilities .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 Kingdom Hearts II begins one year after the events of Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories . The game 's setting is a collection of various levels ( referred to in @-@ game as " worlds " ) that the player progresses through . As in the first game , Kingdom Hearts II allows the player to travel to locales from various Disney works , along with original worlds specifically created for the series . While in the first game , Disney @-@ based worlds were primarily derived from the Disney animated features canon , Kingdom Hearts II introduces worlds that are based on Disney live @-@ action films as well . Each world varies in appearance and setting , depending on the Disney film on which it is based . The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films . Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately ; with few exceptions , players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship . 
 Some worlds featured in the previous games reappear , but with new and expanded areas . There are also new worlds that are introduced , including the Land of Dragons , a fictionalized version of ancient China from the film Mulan ; Beast 's Castle , an 18th @-@ century @-@ style French castle based on Beauty and the Beast ; Timeless River , a past version of Disney Castle that features Steamboat Willie @-@ style animation ; Port Royal from Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl ; Pride Lands , a great savannah from The Lion King ; and Space <unk> , a digital world based on Tron within Hollow Bastion 's computer network . Twilight Town , an original world first seen in Chain of Memories , has a greater role as the introductory world . The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The three protagonists of the game are : Sora , a 15 @-@ year @-@ old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade , a mystical key @-@ shaped weapon that can combat darkness ; Donald Duck , the court magician of Disney Castle ; and Goofy , the captain of the Disney Castle guards . Both Donald and Goofy were ordered to find and stay with the " key " , which was revealed to be Sora and his Keyblade . They befriended Sora during Kingdom Hearts , and draw strength from this friendship . Other original characters include Riku and Kairi , Sora 's friends from his home world of Destiny Islands ; Roxas , a boy who can also wield the Keyblade playable in the beginning ; and DiZ , a man in red robes with a vendetta against Organization XIII , who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise , the mentor of Master Xehanort . 
 As in the previous games , there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works . While some make a return from Kingdom Hearts , new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced , such as Scar from The Lion King and Scrooge <unk> . Pete appears as a persistent enemy who works with the resurrected Maleficent . Nearly twenty characters from Final Fantasy games appear , notably Auron of Final Fantasy X , Tifa from Final Fantasy VII , and the return of Squall Leonhart , Cloud , and Sephiroth . It was stated that although the first game strictly stuck to characters Tetsuya Nomura designed , this time around they were going to " take some risks " , implying that characters not directly designed by Nomura might make an appearance . Other new characters to series are Vivi of Final Fantasy IX and Setzer of Final Fantasy VI . 
 The various worlds that Sora explores often have an optional party character from the film on which the world is based . Such party members include Fa Mulan , the woman who passes as a man in order to take her ailing father 's place in the army ; Jack Sparrow , a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship , the Black Pearl ; Simba , the self @-@ exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land ; and Tron , a security program in Hollow Bastion 's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program . 
 Organization XIII , a group of powerful Nobodies ( the " empty shell [ s ] " left over when a strong @-@ hearted person becomes a Heartless ) introduced in Chain of Memories , is established as the primary group of antagonists early on . Xemnas , the leader of Organization XIII , serves as the main antagonist and final boss of the game . Villains unique to the worlds are still prevalent , and are often presented as challenges that Sora 's group must overcome . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Sora , Donald , and Goofy have been in suspended animation for the past year to regain their memories lost in Chain of Memories . Meanwhile , Roxas , Sora 's Nobody , is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town , created by DiZ to merge Roxas with his original self to restore Sora 's power . DiZ 's plans are threatened when Organization XIII 's Nobodies , led by Axel , Roxas 's former friend in the Organization , infiltrate the virtual town , but Roxas is able to repel the hostiles and finally merges with Sora . Sora , Donald , and Goofy wake up in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and Yen Sid , who send them on another journey . Their goal is to find Riku and stop the plans of Organization XIII , who control the Nobodies — the heartless shell left over when a person with a strong heart is turned into a Heartless . Afterward , Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power . 
 Sora travels to many Disney @-@ themed worlds , old and new , and resolves several problems caused by Organization XIII , the Nobodies , the Heartless , Maleficent , Pete and local villains . During a visit to Hollow Bastion , they again meet King Mickey , who reveals the true nature of Ansem , the antagonist of Kingdom Hearts . The Ansem whom Sora defeated was actually the Heartless of Xehanort , a student of the real Ansem the Wise ; and that the leader of the Organization is Xehanort 's Nobody , Xemnas . Organization XIII 's plan is also revealed — they seek the power of Kingdom Hearts , the sum of all the hearts that Sora released by destroying the Heartless with his Keyblade , to regain their lost hearts . Sora revisits the worlds to solve lingering problems and new complications , while seeking a path to Organization XIII 's base of operations . Throughout his endeavors , Sora is secretly aided by a mysterious hooded figure whom Sora believes to be Riku . 
 Following a lead , Sora , Donald , and Goofy enter a passageway through Twilight Town and encounter Axel , who sacrifices himself to create a passageway to " The World That Never Was " , the headquarters of Organization XIII , with Kingdom Hearts looming overhead as a heart @-@ shaped moon . Sora finds Kairi and Riku , whose appearance has been changed by the darkness to that of Xehanort 's Heartless . Riku explains to Sora the nature of his connection to Roxas . King Mickey encounters DiZ , who reveals himself to be Ansem the Wise . Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts ' power , but a system overload causes the device to self @-@ destruct , both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form . At the top of the Castle That Never Was , Sora and company battle Xemnas , who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to power his multiple forms . After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas , the two are reunited with their friends at their home , Destiny Islands . A post @-@ credits scene shows Sora , Kairi , and Riku reading a letter from Mickey , its contents hidden from the player . 
 = = Development = = 
 Development plans for Kingdom Hearts II began around the completion of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix , but specific details were undecided until July 2003 . Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel . One such obstacle was the development team 's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more , which required Disney 's approval . The game was developed by Square Enix 's Product Development Division @-@ 1 , with most of the original staff from the first game . The game was originally supposed to have been released after Kingdom Hearts . Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained . To bridge the gap between the two games , Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories was developed . To explain the loss of all the abilities from the first game at the beginning of Kingdom Hearts II , Nomura had Sora 's memories scrambled in Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories . 
 Many aspects of the gameplay were reworked for this sequel . Some changes were made due to user feedback and others were meant to be included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints . The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked . The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game . Because Sora had matured , Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that . Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles . The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles . The inclusion of worlds based on live @-@ action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live @-@ action pictures . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 = = = = Musical score = = = = 
 Like the first game , Kingdom Hearts II features music by Yoko Shimomura and Hikaru Utada . The Original Soundtrack for Kingdom Hearts II was composed by Shimomura and released on January 25 , 2006 . The opening orchestration and ending credits theme were arranged and orchestrated by Kaoru Wada and performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra . The main vocal theme for the original Japanese release was " Passion " , written and performed by Utada . The English version of " Passion " , " Sanctuary " , was used in the Western releases . Utada 's involvement was announced on July 29 , 2005 . According to Nomura , the vocal theme ties in even more closely with the game 's story than " Hikari " ( " Simple and Clean " ) did with Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories . The CD single for " Passion " was released on December 14 , 2005 and " Sanctuary " was first previewed on MTV 's official website in early 2006 . 
 = = = = Voice cast = = = = 
 Kingdom Hearts II features well @-@ known voice actors for both the Japanese and English versions . Many of the original voice actors from the first Kingdom Hearts reprised their roles ; Miyu Irino and Haley Joel Osment as Sora , Mamoru Miyano and David Gallagher as Riku , and Risa Uchida and Hayden Panettiere as Kairi . New voice actors included Kōki Uchiyama and Jesse McCartney as Roxas , Iku Nakahara and Brittany Snow as Naminé , and Genzō Wakayama and Christopher Lee as DiZ . A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in Kingdom Hearts II . Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game , including American actors Ming @-@ Na , James Woods , Pat Morita ( in his final voice role before his death ) , Bruce Boxleitner , and Zach Braff , and Japanese actors Takashi <unk> , Kōichi Yamadera , Yū <unk> , and Hiroshi Fujioka . Some voice actors from the related television series or direct @-@ to @-@ video sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable , such as Robert Costanzo as Philoctetes rather than Danny DeVito . Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version ; Ansem , Aerith , Leon , Sephiroth and Hercules , who were originally voiced by Billy Zane , Mandy Moore , David Boreanaz , Lance Bass , and Sean Astin respectively in the first game , were voiced by Richard Epcar , Mena Suvari , Doug Erholtz , George Newbern , and Tate Donovan ( Hercules ' original voice actor ) , and newcomer Tifa was voiced by Rachael Leigh Cook . 
 = = = Content editing = = = 
 Besides English translation and localization , the international version of Kingdom Hearts II differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes . The Hydra boss in the Hercules @-@ themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version ( which was taken from the film ) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version . In one cutscene , Hercules was fighting the Hydra and used his sword on its head which eventually released green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version , this was later changed into drool in the English version . Also , the scene in Disney Castle where , after chasing Donald around for missing a date , Daisy Duck pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version while she merely tells him off <unk> in the English version . 
 Xigbar 's telescopic sight was changed from a crosshair and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles . An attack animation was also altered ; in the Japanese version , Xigbar combines his two hand @-@ held guns to create a sniper rifle , which is used to shoot the player 's party during the telescoping sight sequence . In the English version , Xigbar does not combine his guns , but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun . The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited ; in the original , he bursts into flames during his suicide attack , while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power . 
 Port Royal , based on Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl , contains the most content edits . Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence , such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck , as in the film . Unlike the Japanese version , the undead Pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows , though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 An unlockable trailer in Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts Final Mix hinted at the possibility of a sequel . Rumors for a sequel on the PlayStation 2 were spurred in Japan when the video game website <unk> stated that " an internal ( and anonymous source ) at Square Japan " confirmed that development of Kingdom Hearts II had begun . It was not until Kingdom Hearts II was announced , along with Chain of Memories , at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2003 that rumors were confirmed . Initial details were that it would take place some time after Chain of Memories , which takes place directly after the first game . Other details included the return of Sora , Donald , and Goofy , as well as new costumes . Information about Mickey Mouse 's involvement was kept to a minimum . 
 At the 2004 Square Enix E3 Press conference , producer Shinji Hashimoto said that many mysteries of the first game would be answered . Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005 , followed by the English website in December 2005 . The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds . Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game . Although the game was announced in September 2003 , a release date for the game was not set until two years later . Nomura admitted that the game was announced too early and information regarding the game was not released until a debut period was in sight .

 = = Versions and merchandise = = 
 Kingdom Hearts II has been released in four different versions . The first three are the normal regional releases in Japan , North America , and PAL regions , which only differ nominally in content editing and localization . The European and Australian PAL releases were reformatted to run at 50 Hz to fit the definition size of PAL encoding systems . The fourth version has additional content and was released under the title Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix . Like the previous titles , both Square and Disney released numerous types of merchandise before and after the game came out . Merchandise ranged from toys and figurines to clothing items and books . The game has also been adapted into both manga and novel series . Prior to the game 's release , an Ultimania book titled Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~ Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II ~ came out . It provides extended information on the first two Kingdom Hearts games , as well as information on the unreleased Kingdom Hearts II . After the release of the game , Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania , which focuses on the game itself , came out . Another book , titled Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix + Ultimania , was released after the Final Mix version came out . Released along with Final Mix , Kingdom Hearts -Another Report- was a hardback book which includes game information , visuals by Shiro Amano , and a director interview . In North America , BradyGames published two strategy guides — a standard guide and a limited edition version . The latter version was available in four different covers and included a copy of Jiminy 's Journal along with 400 stickers .

 Because the first game was re @-@ released , there was speculation whether Tetsuya Nomura would do the same with Kingdom Hearts II . In a Weekly Shōnen Jump interview with Nomura , he expressed interest in a possible international version of Kingdom Hearts II , although there were no definite plans . He said that should a " Final Mix " version arise , he had a " trump card " in mind , with such features as the Mushroom Heartless found in the first Kingdom Hearts game . In September 2006 , Square Enix announced Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix , featuring new scenes and gameplay elements . Like the first re @-@ release , this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the " Sanctuary " theme song instead of " Passion " . New cutscenes , however , used Japanese voice acting , as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories who did not yet have English voice actors . 
 Kingdom Hearts II was re @-@ released in Japan on March 29 , 2007 as a 2 @-@ disc set titled Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix + . The first disc contains Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix with a new secret movie and additional battles and items . The second disc contains Kingdom Hearts Re : Chain of Memories , a 3D PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts : Chain of Memories with extra scenes and voice acting . The battle system maintains the card gameplay , with the addition of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II . Like the first game 's Final Mix , the two games serve as a canonical update to the series . The book Kingdom Hearts -Another Report- was included along with the game for those who reserved a copy . Based on Amazon.com figures , Final Mix + was the number one PlayStation 2 game in sales during the week of its release in Japan . Nomura cited the presence of Kingdom Hearts Re : Chain of Memories to explain why Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix + was so popular . Nevertheless , in a Famitsu poll in July 2011 , Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix was voted the most popular entry so far . 
 It was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2 @.@ 5 Remix .

 A manga series based on the game started its serialization in the June 2006 issue of the magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan , published by Square Enix . The artist is Shiro Amano , who also did the Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories manga series . The first volume was released in Japan in December 2006 . As a result of Amano working in the Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days manga , the series has been on hiatus and resumed publication in October 2012 . Tokyopop licensed the manga and released volume one in North America on July 3 , 2007 . The second volume was released the following year . 
 The game has also been novelized by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano . The first volume , titled " Roxas — Seven Days " , was released on April 22 , 2006 and covers Roxas ' story to when Sora wakes up and leaves Twilight Town . The novel depicts extra scenes that were added in the Final Mix version , such as interaction between Organization XIII members and between Axel , Naminé and Riku . The second book , " The Destruction of Hollow Bastion " , was released on July 16 , 2006 , the third book , " Tears of Nobody , " revolving around Roxas ' past , was released on September 29 , 2006 , and the fourth book , " Anthem — Meet Again / Axel Last Stand , " came out in February 2007 .

 " Phyllis ' Wedding " is the sixteenth episode of the third season of the American comedy television series The Office , and the show 's 44th overall . It first aired on February 8 , 2007 on NBC . The episode was written by staff writer Caroline Williams and directed by Ken Whittingham . Actors Creed Bratton , Rashida Jones , and Bobby Ray Shafer guest star . 
 The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company . In this episode , the office attends Phyllis Lapin 's ( Phyllis Smith ) wedding to Bob Vance ( Shafer ) , and Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) becomes upset with how many similarities there are between her canceled wedding and Phyllis ' . Meanwhile , Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) embarrasses the bride and groom , and Pam reconnects with her ex @-@ fiance Roy Anderson ( David Denman ) . 
 Brian Baumgartner 's character appears as a drum player in the episode , forcing the actor to take lessons for the instrument and rely on a stunt musician . According to Nielsen Media Research , an estimated 8 @.@ 8 million viewers watched the episode at the time of broadcast . It received mixed reviews from television critics , as some reviewers found Michael 's actions unrealistic and cartoonish . " Phyllis ' Wedding " won a NAACP Image Award for Whittingham 's directional work and received a nomination from the Writers Guild of America .

 Phyllis Lapin ( Phyllis Smith ) has asked Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) to push her father 's wheelchair down the aisle at her wedding , a role that she gave him to secure six weeks off for her honeymoon . Michael assumes that his doing so will be the wedding 's highlight . Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) is upset that many details of Phyllis ' wedding , from the invitations to the wedding gown , were copied from her own canceled wedding . 
 During the procession , Michael becomes petulant when Phyllis ' father " upstages " him by walking under his own power . Goaded by Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) , Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) hunts down wedding <unk> . He <unk> Phyllis ' Uncle Al , who fails to pass Dwight 's questioning due to dementia . 
 Michael makes several attempts to recapture the limelight , including an embarrassing toast at the wedding banquet , which gets him kicked out of the reception hall by Phyllis ' husband Bob Vance ( Bobby Ray Shafer ) . Dwight does not let him re @-@ enter , and Michael must sit outside listening to Uncle Al 's ramblings . Pam stares as Jim and Karen Filippelli ( Rashida Jones ) dance together , and when Jim catches her eye , his face turns to sadness as she looks away . 
 Roy Anderson ( David Denman ) pays " Scrantonicity " , the Kevin Malone @-@ led ( Brian Baumgartner ) wedding band to play his and Pam 's song , " You Were Meant for Me " . The two dance and leave together to Jim 's obvious dismay . However , Jim soon states that " Here 's a non @-@ hypothetical : I 'm really happy I 'm with Karen . " When Phyllis leaves the reception hall with Bob Vance , she thanks Michael for finding her Uncle Al , and the newlyweds ride off in a Vance Refrigeration van .

 " Phyllis ' Wedding " was written by staff writer Caroline Williams and directed by Ken Whittingham , his fifth such credit for the series . Recurring guest stars Creed Bratton , Rashida Jones , and Bobby Ray Shafer appeared in the episode . The episode is the first of the series to revolve around a wedding . In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Baumgartner described the episode , " Michael plays a very important role in that wedding . He is to walk Phyllis ' dad down the aisle by pushing him in a wheelchair , which in his mind is him walking Phyllis down the aisle , a very important position of authority . Of course , Phyllis has asked him to do this only so she can get six weeks of vacation time . But for him it 's a place of honor , and from there , things don 't go quite the way that he hopes . " 
 The episode features Kevin Malone playing the drums in a band , which had been an idea circulated since the first season , when allusions to him being in a Steve Miller tribute band were written ; the scenes had to be removed from the series due to issues negotiating with the singer . The crew later decided to have Kevin be in a Police tribute band called Scrantonicity because he " talks so low , and has very little expression , and there is no band that sings higher and with more expression than the Police . " While Kevin was always intended to be the band 's lead singer , executive producer Greg Daniels approached Baumgartner about possibly playing an instrument , but the actor replied he could not play anything . Daniels and Baumgartner then discussed instruments that would be " funny " to play and brought up harmonicas , saxophones , and drums . They ultimately decided on the latter because they deemed a " drumming lead singer [ to ] be the funniest choice , " regardless of the fact that the actor had " absolutely no drumming experience , and it 's a difficult instrument . " Baumgartner took some drum lessons , but found filming of the episode to be " the hardest thing that I 've ever done artistically . " He was aided by a stunt musician who hid behind a curtain near the band .

According to Nielsen Media Research , an estimated 8 @.@ 8 million viewers watched the episode , and it earned a 4 @.@ 4 / 11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49 . In other words , it was seen by 4 @.@ 4 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds , and 11 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . 
 AOL TV 's Jay Black called the episode " amazing " , partly because he believed the out @-@ of @-@ office setting made Michael 's " social awkwardness and emotional neediness a lot more enjoyable . " Black observed that the " main romantic plotline had some nice movement tonight as well , " and praised the Pam @-@ Roy and Jim @-@ Karen storylines in particular for their realism . Writing for IGN , Brian Zoromski rated " Phyllis ' Wedding " with 7 out of 10 , an indication of a " good " episode . He asserted that the episode contained some " great moments " such as Jim 's <unk> prank on Dwight and Michael 's conversation with Phyllis ' amnesiac uncle . In contrast to Black however , Zoromski believed Michael 's " over @-@ the @-@ top cartoonishness " actions stretched " the believability of the show 's " illusion as reality , especially because they occurred outside of the office . 
 Give Me My Remote 's Kath Skerry speculated that after several episodes of a " semi @-@ normal " Michael , the writers " were aching to bring back cringe worthy Michael . " She criticized the decision , calling his behavior " borderline ridiculous ( and not in a good way ) . It just seems implausible that someone could be so very clueless that they would act like that in public . " Skerry however did find high points , such as the opening sequence and any scene with Dwight and Angela . Television Without Pity graded the episode with an " A " . 
 Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West praised Smith for " again proving how sly her seemingly diffident character really is " by manipulating Michael . West also noted that she ended up " feel [ ing ] a little sorry " for Michael after the episode , due to the revelations learned from his childhood . Carell later recalled that many fans " hated " Michael for disrupting Phyllis ' wedding . For his work in the episode , Whittingham won a NAACP Image Award in the " Directing in a Comedy Series " category . Along with two other Office episodes , for her work on this episode , Caroline Williams was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy . 
 = The Restoration ( 1910 film ) = 
 The Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film focuses on Hugh Logan , a single father who leaves his little girl , May , at home when he goes on a business trip . On the way to the city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road . He is found and taken in , but he suffers from amnesia . He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her . Due to the prolonged absence of her father , May is taken to an orphan asylum , but she escapes . May goes to the city and ends up stopping to sleep on the doorstep of the Neals ' home . Maud finds her and takes her in , where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back . Little is known of the production credits , but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl . It was released on August 5 , 1910 and was met with mixed reviews . The film is presumed lost . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6 , 1910 . It states : " Hugh Logan is a widower who lives with his only child , a little girl , in a small cottage in the country . Logan is a commercial traveler and , as the play opens , is preparing to leave on a business trip . He takes the train to the city , where he is attacked by footpads , who leave him unconscious in the roadway . He is found by Maud Neal and her father , who are passing in an auto , and they take him into their home . There he revives , but the shock has affected his memory , and he is unable to recall anything of his past life . The kindly Neal secures him employment , and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud . He finally proposes to her and it is accepted . In the meantime , little May has been waiting in vain for her father . As no word is received from him , and she has no other relatives , Bridget , the servant , takes her to the orphan asylum , where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates . May dislikes the place . In the end she escapes from it . But , gaining the city , she gets lost there and , tired and hungry , goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals ' . There she is found by Maud , who takes her into the house . Maud is much attracted by the child 's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her . She tells Logan of her decision and he objects . They quarrel . Feeling himself in the wrong , Logan returns and asks Maud 's pardon . He meets May , who recognizes her father . At the sight of her , his memory returns . <unk> he determines to retain May from out of the things of the old life , and Maud from out of the new . " 
 = = Production = = 
 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . Lonergan liked to use the deus ex machina dramatic technique in the conclusion of the plots and this production was no exception . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . The only cast credit claimed by Bowers is that of Marie Eline as the little girl . Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions . Known and more prominent members of the cast to appear in productions include the leading ladies , Anna Rosemond and Violet Heming , and the leading man was Frank H. Crane . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 The single reel drama , approximately 1000 feet long , was released on August 5 , 1910 . Curiously , The Moving Picture World makes a reference to aphasia instead of amnesia in advertising the film , " The Friday release ( August 5 ) is a gripping heart @-@ drama , by name The Restoration . It is a curious , a novel thing ; in a sense a study in aphasia - one of those weird plots you expect a Thanhouser picture to unfold . " The film likely had a wide national release as evidenced by numerous advertisements , including theaters in Maryland , Indiana , and Kansas . Some advertisements for The Restoration were not specific and may refer to D. W. Griffith 's 1909 The Restoration . These advertisements are noted in Oregon , Washington , and North Carolina . 
 The film received mixed reviews , but also criticism for several aspects of the production . The Morning Telegraph stated , " The photography at the beginning of the film is poor . It seems queer that the child should be able to escape from the orphan asylum in such an easy manner and that no search be made by the institution . It seemed very theatrical and hardly possible that the child should make the first stop at the house of the father 's intended . Why did not the producer have the child make a few more stops or have something happen to her instead of making the first stop at the woman 's house ? " The The Moving Picture World spared little coverage of the actual film in its review , noting that the emotional story might be a plausible . The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a detailed review that found the acting favorable , but found the plot and its resolution to be fantastical by stating , " The manifest absurdity of this plot lies in the adoption . No girl just betrothed would ever adopt a runaway orphan . " 
 = Lexington @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The Lexington @-@ class aircraft carriers were a pair of aircraft carriers built for the United States Navy ( USN ) during the 1920s . The ships were built on hulls originally laid down as battlecruisers after World War I , but under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , all U.S. battleship and battlecruiser construction was cancelled . The Treaty , however , allowed two of the unfinished ships to be converted to carriers . They were the first operational aircraft carriers in the USN and were used to develop carrier aviation tactics and procedures before World War II in a series of annual exercises . 
 They proved extremely successful as carriers and experience with the Lexington class convinced the Navy of the value of large carriers . They were the largest aircraft carriers in the USN until the Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers were completed beginning in 1945 . The ships served in World War II , seeing action in many battles . Although Lexington was sunk in the first carrier battle in history ( the Battle of the Coral Sea ) in 1942 , Saratoga served throughout the war , despite being torpedoed twice , notably participating in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in mid @-@ 1942 where her aircraft sank the Japanese light carrier Ryūjō . She supported Allied operations in the Indian Ocean and South West Pacific Areas until she became a training ship at the end of 1943 . Saratoga returned to combat to protect American forces during the Battle of Iwo Jima in early 1945 , but was badly damaged by kamikazes . The continued growth in the size and weight of carrier aircraft made her obsolete by the end of the war . In mid @-@ 1946 , the ship was sunk during nuclear weapon tests in Operation Crossroads . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Lexington @-@ class was originally designed as battlecruisers , with heavy guns , high speed , and moderate armor protection . The Navy laid down six ships of the class in 1919 – 20 . When the battlecruisers were cancelled under the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 , two of the unfinished ships were designated for completion as carriers . Lexington and Saratoga were selected since they were the most advanced of the six ships in construction . 
 Conversion became a series of compromises and mixed blessings which would not have arisen had they been " specifically designed carriers " from the outset . On the plus side , the ships would have better anti @-@ torpedo protection , larger magazines for aircraft bombs and , with the after elevator 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) higher than otherwise , more room for aircraft landings . On the minus side , a converted battlecruiser would be 0 @.@ 5 knots ( 0 @.@ 93 km / h ; 0 @.@ 58 mph ) slower than a specifically designed carrier , have 16 percent less hangar space , less emergency fuel and , with " narrower lines " aft , not as wide a runway for which to aim . Costs were similar . A brand @-@ new aircraft carrier was estimated at $ 27 @.@ 1 million . Conversion of a Lexington class was $ 22 @.@ 4 million , not counting the $ 6 @.@ 7 million already sunk into them . Added together , the figure rose to $ 28 @.@ 1 million . 
 The bottom line , with the signing of the treaty , was that any capital ships under construction by the five signatories ( the United States , Great Britain , France , Italy and Japan ) had to be canceled and scrapped . For battlecruisers , this encompassed the United States ' Lexington class , Japan 's Amagi class , and Great Britain 's G3 battlecruisers . For the U.S. Navy , the choice seemed clear . If it scrapped all six Lexingtons in accordance with the treaty , it would throw away $ 13 @.@ 4 million that could otherwise go toward aircraft carriers . The Navy opted for the latter course . 
 The next challenge the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair faced was the tonnage cap set by the treaty . Carriers were to be no more than 27 @,@ 000 tons . An exception , spearheaded by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt Jr. and added to the treaty , allowed capital ships under conversion to go up to 33 @,@ 000 tons , an increase of 6000 tons . This would almost not be enough for a conversion without removing half the power plant , something the Navy General Board did not consider an option . Creative interpreting of a clause in the treaty allowed a potential way out of this situation . The clause ( Chapter II , Part III , Section I , ( d ) ) read : 
 No retained capital ships or aircraft carriers shall be reconstructed except for the purpose of providing means of defense against air and submarine attack , and subject to the following rules : The Contracting Powers may , for that purpose , equip existing tonnage with bulge or blister or anti @-@ air attack deck protection , providing the increase of displacement thus effected does not exceed 3 @,@ 000 tons ( 3 @,@ 048 metric tons ) displacement for each ship . 
 Without this clause , conversion might not have been feasible . Estimates made in 1928 estimates for the two ships put Lexington at an actual tonnage of 35 @,@ 689 tons and Saratoga at 35 @,@ 544 . On official lists , the number given was 33 @,@ 000 tons , with the footnote , " [ this number ] does not include weight allowance under Ch . 11 , pt . 3 , Sec . 1 , art . ( d ) of Washington Treaty for providing means against air and submarine attack " . This tonnage was used by these ships for their entire careers . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 = = = General description = = = 
 The ships had an overall length of 888 feet ( 270 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of 106 feet ( 32 @.@ 3 m ) , and a draft of 30 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load . Saratoga had a standard displacement of 36 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 578 t ) , and 43 @,@ 055 long tons ( 43 @,@ 746 t ) at deep load . 
 One of their innovative features was a relatively new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow , named after its inventor , Rear Admiral David W. Taylor , who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result of a series of towing tests begun in 1910 , this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds , supported the forecastle and reduced bending stress on the hull . A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds , although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area . 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 These ships were given a 866 @.@ 17 @-@ by @-@ 105 @.@ 9 @-@ foot ( 264 @.@ 0 by 32 @.@ 3 m ) teak flight deck . Their hangar had a clear height of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) and encompassed 33 @,@ 528 square feet ( 3 @,@ 114 @.@ 9 m2 ) . It was the largest enclosed space afloat , civilian or military , when built . The hangar was 424 feet ( 129 @.@ 2 m ) long and its width varied from 68 to 74 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 to 22 @.@ 6 m ) , constrained by the bulky funnel uptakes and boat compartments . The height of the hangar was not exceeded on an American aircraft carrier until the Forrestal @-@ class ships appeared in the mid @-@ 1950s . Aircraft repair shops , 108 @-@ foot ( 32 @.@ 9 m ) long , were aft of the hangar and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft , 128 feet ( 39 @.@ 0 m ) long . The hangar was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator . 
 The carriers were fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on their centerline . The forward elevator was 30 @-@ by @-@ 60 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 18 @.@ 3 m ) and had a capacity of 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 257 @.@ 5 kg ) . A 20 @-@ by @-@ 26 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 by 7 @.@ 9 m ) section of the flight deck adjoining the rear edge of the elevator could split down the centerline to lift aircraft otherwise too long . Carrying 12 @,@ 000 pounds ( 5 @,@ 400 kg ) , it moved at a speed of 2 feet per second ( 0 @.@ 61 m / s ) . The aft elevator measured 30 @-@ by @-@ 36 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 by 11 @.@ 0 m ) and could only lift 6 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 721 @.@ 6 kg ) . Munitions were delivered from the magazines by two hydraulically powered bomb lifts and one torpedo lift . A folding crane with a capacity of 10 long tons ( 10 t ) was positioned on the flight deck forward of the gun turrets . Aviation gasoline was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system and their capacity has been quoted as either 132 @,@ 264 US gallons ( 500 @,@ 670 l ; 110 @,@ 133 imp gal ) or 163 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 620 @,@ 000 l ; 136 @,@ 000 imp gal ) . A flywheel @-@ powered aircraft catapult , 155 feet ( 47 @.@ 2 m ) long , was fitted at the bow ; it could launch a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 536 kg ) aircraft at a speed of 48 knots ( 89 km / h ; 55 mph ) . It was removed in 1934 as unnecessary . 
 The Lexington @-@ class ships were designed to carry 78 aircraft of various types , including 36 bombers , but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar . In 1936 , her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F @-@ 1 and 18 Boeing F4B @-@ 4 fighters , plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve . Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares . Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians , plus one in reserve , and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft . This amounted to 79 aircraft , plus 30 spares . 
 In early December 1941 , Lexington was ferrying 18 U.S. Marine Corps Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers to Midway Atoll and at that time she embarked 65 of her own aircraft , including 17 Brewster F2A Buffalo fighters . During the Wake Island relief expedition later that month , Saratoga 's air group consisted of 13 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters , 42 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers , and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers . The ship also carried 14 Marine Corps Buffalos for delivery at Wake . Before the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in mid @-@ 1942 , Saratoga 's air group consisted of 90 aircraft , comprising 37 Wildcats , 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers . In early 1945 , the ship carried 53 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 17 Avengers . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Turbo @-@ electric propulsion had been chosen for the battlecruisers because American companies struggled to produce the very large geared turbines necessary for such big ships and was retained when they were converted into aircraft carriers . One advantage of turbo @-@ electric drive was that the substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam @-@ lines allowed the motors to be mounted further to the stern of the ship ; this reduced vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts . Another was the ability to go astern at full power without needing a separate reverse turbine to do so , simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors . Other benefits were the ability to operate all four propellers if one of the turbo generators failed , and the possibility of operating only some of the generators at low speed with suitably higher loading and greater efficiency . " [ Turbo @-@ electric drive ] was efficient , rugged and always reliable . But it was also heavy , intricate , and not easy to maintain and keep tuned up . " The machinery also required special ventilation measures to dissipate heat and to keep out any salt air . Even with this and elaborate insulation measures , protection from moisture or from flooding due to battle damage or other causes remained problematic and it posed the danger of high voltage to the crew if damaged . 
 Each propeller was 14 feet 9 inches ( 4 @.@ 50 m ) in diameter and each of the four propeller shafts was powered by two 22 @,@ 500 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) electric motors acting in tandem . These motors were about five times the size of any earlier electric motor . Four General Electric turbo generators powered each propeller shaft and each was rated at 35 @,@ 200 kilowatts ( 47 @,@ 200 hp ) , 5000 volts and 4620 amps of direct current ( DC ) . Each of the four AC alternators produced 40 @,@ 000 kVA . Sixteen water @-@ tube boilers , each in their own individual compartment , provided steam for the generators at a working pressure of 295 psi ( 2 @,@ 034 kPa ; 21 kgf / cm2 ) and a temperature of 460 ° F ( 238 ° C ) . The turbo @-@ electric machinery of the Lexington @-@ class ships was designed to produce a total of 180 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 130 @,@ 000 kW ) and propel the ships at 33 @.@ 25 knots ( 61 @.@ 58 km / h ; 38 @.@ 26 mph ) , but each ship reached over 202 @,@ 000 shp ( 151 @,@ 000 kW ) and 34 @.@ 5 knots ( 63 @.@ 9 km / h ; 39 @.@ 7 mph ) in sea trials in 1928 . Six 750 @-@ kilowatt ( 1 @,@ 010 hp ) DC turbo generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments . 
 The ships carried a maximum of 6 @,@ 688 long tons ( 6 @,@ 795 t ) of fuel oil , but only 5 @,@ 400 long tons ( 5 @,@ 500 t ) of that was usable as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns . They demonstrated a range of 9 @,@ 910 nautical miles ( 18 @,@ 350 km ; 11 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 @.@ 7 knots ( 19 @.@ 8 km / h ; 12 @.@ 3 mph ) with 4 @,@ 540 long tons ( 4 @,@ 610 t ) of oil . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Bureau of Construction and Repair was not then convinced that aircraft could be an effective and sufficient armament for a warship . Thus the design as carriers included a substantial gun battery of eight 8 " / 55 caliber guns in four twin gun turrets , two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the island . These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side , two before the bridge , and two behind the funnel . The guns in theory could fire to both sides , but it is probable that if they were fired to port ( across the deck ) the blast would have damaged the flight deck . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to + 41 ° ; they were loaded at an angle of + 9 ° . They fired 260 @-@ pound ( 118 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 800 ft / s ( 850 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 31 @,@ 860 yards ( 29 @,@ 133 m ) . 
 The Lexington class ' anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament consisted of a dozen 5 " / 25 caliber guns , six on each side of the ship on single mounts . They had a maximum elevation of + 85 ° . They fired 53 @.@ 85 @-@ pound ( 24 @.@ 43 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 110 ft / s ( 640 m / s ) . Their maximum range against surface targets was 17 @,@ 700 yards ( 16 @,@ 200 m ) at + 30 ° elevation . 
 As built , the ship were not fitted with any light AA guns , but a few .50 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) water @-@ cooled M2 Browning anti @-@ aircraft machine guns were fitted shortly after commissioning and the numbers gradually increased over the 1930s . Lexington had 24 of these guns aboard when she was sunk in early 1942 . Their 1 @.@ 6 @-@ ounce ( 45 g ) projectiles had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 930 ft / s ( 890 m / s ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 600 yards ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . They had a rate of fire of 550 – 700 rounds per minute and were exceedingly reliable , however , their shells were too light and too short ranged so they were replaced by license @-@ built Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon beginning in 1942 . The Oerlikon fired a 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) , .272 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 123 kg ) high @-@ explosive shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 750 ft / s ( 840 m / s ) . Its maximum range was 4 @,@ 800 yards ( 4 @,@ 400 m ) although the effective range was under 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) . The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute , but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload magazines . Saratoga mounted 52 of these guns in late 1942 . 
 The Navy had been developing a quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch light AA gun since the early 1930s , but it was delayed with teething problems , so five single 3 " / 50 caliber Mk 10 AA guns were installed in 1940 as temporary replacements . They fired 13 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 9 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) . At + 85 ° elevation they had an anti @-@ aircraft ceiling of 29 @,@ 800 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) . 
 The Navy made plans to remove the eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) gun turrets in 1940 and replace them with four twin 5 " / 38 caliber dual @-@ purpose gun turrets ( the standard mounting on U.S. battleships and cruisers ) . At the same time , the five @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) 25 @-@ caliber guns were to be replaced with more 5 " / 38 guns on a two for three basis to compensate for their greater weight . The guns fired 55 @-@ pound ( 25 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) at a rate of fire up to 20 rounds per minute . Against surface targets they had a range of 18 @,@ 200 yards ( 16 @,@ 600 m ) . 
 Five quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mounts were finally fitted aboard the Lexington @-@ class ships in late 1941 and early 1942 . The .9 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 41 kg ) projectiles had a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) and an effective range of 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) . The maximum rate of fire was 150 rounds per minute although the frequent need to reload the eight @-@ round magazines reduced that . The gun was not successful in service and it was replaced by the license @-@ built Bofors 40 mm autocannon beginning in late 1942 . The 40 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) , 1 @.@ 98 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 90 kg ) high @-@ explosive shell was fired at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 890 ft / s ( 880 m / s ) . Its maximum range was 11 @,@ 000 yards ( 10 @,@ 000 m ) although the effective range was around 4 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 – 4 @,@ 600 m ) . The cyclic rate of fire was 160 rounds per minute . The guns were fitted in quadruple and twin gun mounts in increasing numbers over the war . Saratoga had 23 quadruple and two twin mounts in early 1944 . 
 Lexington 's eight @-@ inch gun turrets were removed in early 1942 , but they were replaced by seven additional quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mounts as a temporary measure . The ship was sunk before her five @-@ inch guns could be replaced and the turrets installed . Saratoga 's armament was upgraded in early 1942 while she was under repair after she had been torpedoed . 
 = = = Fire control and electronics = = = 
 The two superfiring eight @-@ inch turrets had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control , but the guns were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire @-@ control directors , one each on the fore and aft spotting tops . A 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors . Each group of three 5 @-@ inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director , two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops . Plans were made before the war to replace the obsolete Mk 19 directors with two heavier Mk 33 directors , one each on the fore and aft five @-@ inch spotting tops , but these plans were cancelled when the dual @-@ purpose guns replaced the main armament in early 1942 . 
 Saratoga received a RCA CXAM @-@ 1 early warning radar in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton . The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial , replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there . She also received two FC ( Mk 3 ) surface fire @-@ control radars in late 1941 , although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942 . The new dual @-@ purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors , each mounting an FD ( Mk 4 ) anti @-@ aircraft gunnery radar . When the 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch guns were replaced by 40 mm guns in 1942 , the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors . Additional radars were added during 1942 and the ship 's electronics were modernized during her refit in January 1944 . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 The waterline belt of the Lexington @-@ class ships tapered 7 – 5 inches ( 178 – 127 mm ) in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11 ° outwards at the top . This angle increased the armor 's relative thickness to horizontal , close @-@ range fire , albeit at the cost of reducing its relative height which increased the chance of plunging shellfire going over or under it . It covered the middle 530 feet ( 161 @.@ 5 m ) of the ships . Forward , the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness . Aft , it terminated at a seven @-@ inch bulkhead . This belt had a height of 9 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 8 m ) . The third deck over the ships ' machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel ( STS ) totaling 2 inches ( 51 mm ) in thickness . The steering gear , however , was protected by two layers of STS that totaled 3 inches ( 76 mm ) on the flat and 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) on the slope . 
 The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with .75 inches ( 19 mm ) of armor . The conning tower was 2 – 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 51 – 57 mm ) of STS , and it had a communications tube with two @-@ inch sides ran from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck . The torpedo defense system of the Lexington @-@ class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from .375 to .75 inches ( 10 to 19 mm ) in thickness . The spaces between them could be left empty or used as fuel tanks to absorb the detonation of a torpedo 's warhead .

 Lexington and Saratoga were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II . On more than one occasion these included successfully staged surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Lexington 's turbo @-@ electric propulsion system allowed her to supplement the electrical supply of Tacoma , Washington , in a drought from late 1929 to early 1930 . She also delivered medical personnel and relief supplies to Managua , Nicaragua , after an earthquake in 1931 . 
 Lexington was at sea when the Pacific War began on 7 December 1941 , ferrying fighter aircraft to Midway Island . Her mission was cancelled and she returned to Pearl Harbor a week later . After a few days , she was sent to create a diversion from the force en route to relieve the besieged Wake Island garrison by attacking Japanese installations in the Marshall Islands . The island was forced to surrender before the relief force got close enough , and the mission was cancelled . A planned attack on Wake Island in January 1942 had to be cancelled when a submarine sank the oiler required to supply the fuel for the return trip . Lexington was sent to the Coral Sea the following month to block any Japanese advances into the area . The ship was spotted by Japanese search aircraft while approaching Rabaul , New Britain , and her aircraft shot down most of the Japanese bombers that attacked her . Together with the carrier Yorktown , she successfully attacked Japanese shipping off the east coast of New Guinea in early March . 
 Lexington was briefly refitted in Pearl Harbor at the end of the month and rendezvoused with Yorktown in the Coral Sea in early May . A few days later the Japanese began Operation MO , the invasion of Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea , and the two American carriers attempted to stop the invasion forces . They sank the light aircraft carrier Shōhō on 7 May in the Battle of the Coral Sea , but did not encounter the main Japanese force of the carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku until the next day . Aircraft from Lexington and Yorktown succeeded in badly damaging Shōkaku , but the Japanese aircraft crippled Lexington . Vapors from leaking aviation gasoline tanks sparked a series of explosions and fires that could not be controlled , and the carrier had to be scuttled by an American destroyer on the evening of 8 May to prevent her capture . 
 Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Saratoga was the centerpiece of the unsuccessful American effort to relieve Wake Island and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine a few weeks later . After lengthy repairs , the ship supported forces participating in the Guadalcanal Campaign and her aircraft sank the light carrier Ryūjō in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942 . She was again torpedoed the following month and returned to the Solomon Islands area after repairs were completed . 
 In 1943 , Saratoga supported Allied forces involved in the New Georgia Campaign and invasion of Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands and her aircraft twice attacked the Japanese base at Rabaul in November . Early in 1944 , her aircraft provided air support in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign before she was transferred to the Indian Ocean for several months to support the Royal Navy 's Eastern Fleet as it attacked targets in Java and Sumatra . After a brief refit in mid @-@ 1944 , the ship became a training ship for the rest of the year . 
 In early 1945 , Saratoga participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a dedicated night fighter carrier . Several days into the battle , she was badly damaged by kamikaze hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs . While under repair , the ship , now increasingly obsolete , was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her hangar deck converted into classrooms . Saratoga remained in this role for the rest of the war and was used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August . In July 1946 , she was used as a target for atomic bomb tests in Operation Crossroads , and sank at Bikini Atoll . Her wreck is easily accessible to scuba divers and organized dive tours are available .

 = Crex = 
 Crex is a small genus of birds in the rail family . It contains two species , the corn crake , C. crex , which breeds across Europe and Asia and winters in southern Africa , and the African crake , C. egregia , which migrates within Africa . Both are short @-@ billed rails with blackish @-@ brown upperparts , mainly blue @-@ grey underparts , and barring on the flanks . The corn crake is significantly larger than its relative , and has a distinctive chestnut patch on its wings . Unusually for their family , these are birds of dry habitats rather than wetlands ; the Eurasian species mainly breeds in hay meadows , and the African crake in dry grassland . The African crake is sometimes given its own genus , Crecopsis , but is now more usually placed in Crex . 
 Both species have distinctive loud grating calls used for advertising and territorial purposes in the breeding season , although the corn crake is silent on its African wintering grounds . They are mainly active during the day ; they walk with a high @-@ stepping action , and when disturbed they can run swiftly through grass or fly a short distance to cover . Migration takes place at night , and the ability to undertake these journeys is innate , not learned from adults . The nest is a shallow cup of grass lined with finer vegetation and built in a well hidden depression . The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching , and fledge after four to six weeks . These are ground @-@ feeding omnivores , but mainly eat invertebrates . They may be killed by a variety of mammals and large birds , and infected by parasites . 
 The two Crex species have huge breeding ranges and large populations and are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . The corn crake was formerly classified as near @-@ threatened because of serious declines in western Europe , but improved monitoring shows that numbers have remained stable further east in Russia and Kazakhstan . In much of the western half of the corn crake 's breeding range , there have been long @-@ term declines that are expected to continue . The main cause of the decline is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing . Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth , made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers , and the move from manual grass @-@ cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers . Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake . <unk> and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows . In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies , and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The rails are a bird family comprising nearly 150 species . Although the origins of the group are lost in antiquity , the largest number of species and the most primitive forms are found in the Old World , suggesting that this family originated there . The genus Crex was created by German naturalist and ornithologist Johann Matthäus Bechstein in 1803 . Originally it held only the corn crake , C. crex , which Bechstein moved from its original name , Rallus crex , given to it by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 . 
 The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated , but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake , C. egregia . This was first described as <unk> <unk> by Wilhelm Peters in 1854 from a specimen obtained in Mozambique , and has variously been placed in the genus Porzana or its own genus , Crecopsis , but is now more usually placed in Crex . The Porzana crakes are the closest relatives of the Crex genus , particularly the ash @-@ throated crake , Porzana albicollis , which has occasionally also been allocated to Crex . 
 The genus name is onomatopoeic , referring to the repetitive grating call of the corn crake . Although these species occur in fairly open habitats , they lack the pure white undertail used for signalling in open @-@ water or gregarious species like the coots and moorhens . 
 = = Description = = 
 Both Crex crakes are short @-@ billed birds with blackish @-@ brown upperparts and mainly blue @-@ grey underparts . The belly is white , and there is barring on the flanks and the underside of the short tail . The corn crake is significantly larger than its relative , at 27 – 30 cm ( 11 – 12 in ) long with a wingspan of 42 – 53 cm ( 17 – 21 in ) , compared to the African crake 's 20 – 23 cm ( 7 @.@ 9 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) length and a 40 – 42 cm ( 16 – 17 in ) wingspan . The corn crake is sympatric with the African crake on its wintering grounds , but can be distinguished by its larger size , paler upperparts , chestnut @-@ coloured patch on the upperwing and different underparts pattern . In flight , it has longer , less rounded wings , and shallower wingbeats than its African relative , and shows a white leading edge to the inner wing . 
 The sexes of each species are similar in appearance , although the females are slightly smaller and duller than the males , with a less contrasting head pattern . Juveniles of both species are duller than the adults , and browner underneath . Adults undergo a complete moult after breeding . No subspecies have been recognised of either Crex crake . Although corn crakes become paler and greyer towards the east of the range , the change is clinal , and there is great individual variation in colour within all populations . 
 The two Crex crakes are unlikely to be confused with other rails , since most sympatric short @-@ billed rails are smaller , with white markings on the upperparts , different underparts patterns and shorter bills . The European water rail and the African rail have long pointed bills . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 Like other rails , the Crex species have a wide range of vocalisations . The males of both crakes have a loud territorial and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated two or three times a second for several minutes . The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising , with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open . Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season , mainly at night for the corn crake , but in the day for its African cousin . The corn crake 's call may be repeated more than 20 @,@ 000 times a night , with a peak between midnight and 3 am . 
 The advertising calls of both crakes are readily distinguished from the quite dissimilar calls of potentially sympatric rails such as the spotted crake , striped crake , Baillon 's crake , or water rail . The calls of the two Crex species cannot be confused , since the corn crake is silent in Africa . Both sexes may give distinctive territorial or alarm calls , and females and chicks communicate with <unk> and <unk> . The African crake can be attracted to within 10 m ( 33 ft ) of a human by imitation of its <unk> threat call , and the male corn crake by mechanical imitations of their advertising call , including rubbing a piece of wood down a notched stick , or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip @-@ fastener . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The corn crake is a long distance migrant , breeding across temperate Eurasia from the British Isles east to central Siberia and western China . It winters in Africa from Zaire and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa , mainly KwaZulu @-@ Natal and the former Transvaal Province . Small numbers of birds may winter in the milder areas of western Europe , or halt their migration and stay in North Africa . 
 The African crake occurs throughout sub @-@ Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Kenya and south to KwaZulu @-@ Natal , except in arid areas of south and southwest Africa where the annual summer rainfall is less than 300 mm ( 12 in ) . It is widespread and locally common in most of its range , apart from the rainforests and the drier regions . Nearly all the South African population of about 8 @,@ 000 birds occur in KwaZulu @-@ Natal and the former Transvaal Province . This crake is only a vagrant to the drier zones on the southern edges of South Africa 's northern and eastern Cape Province and North West Province , and southern Botswana . 
 Both species are nocturnal migrants . Most corn crakes migrate through Egypt , with smaller numbers crossing at the western end of the Mediterranean . It has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges , including much of west Africa , and those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa . Further afield , it has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka , Vietnam and Australia , the Seychelles , Bermuda , Canada , the United States , Greenland , and the North Atlantic islands . 
 The African species is a partial migrant , but its movements are complex , seasonal and poorly studied . It is mainly a wet @-@ season breeder , and many birds move away from the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere . Southward movement is mainly from November to April , the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again . This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries , and in equatorial regions , but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements ; internal north – south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria , Senegal , The Gambia , Côte d 'Ivoire and Cameroon . This crake has also wandered further afield . It is rare on Bioko Island ( Equatorial Guinea ) , and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife , the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western <unk> . 
 Most rails are wetland birds , but the two Crex species prefer drier habitats . The African crake is found mainly in grassland , ranging from wetland edges and seasonal floodlands to savanna , lightly wooded dry grassland , and grassy forest clearings . It also frequents maize , rice and cotton crops , derelict farmland and sugarcane plantations close to water . A wide range of grass species are used , with a preferred height of 0 @.@ 3 – 1 m ( 0 @.@ 98 – 3 @.@ 28 ft ) tall but vegetation is acceptable up to 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) tall . The corn crake is mainly a lowland species , but breeds up to 1 @,@ 400 m ( 4 @,@ 600 ft ) altitude in the Alps , 2 @,@ 700 m ( 8 @,@ 900 ft ) in China and 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) in Russia . When breeding in Eurasia , the corn crake 's habitats would originally have included river meadows with tall grass and meadow plants , but it is now mainly found in cool moist grassland used for the production of hay , particularly moist traditional farmland . It also utilises other treeless grasslands in mountains or taiga , on coasts , or where created by fire . Very wet habitats are avoided , as are open areas and those with vegetation more than 50 cm ( 20 in ) tall , or too dense for the birds to walk through . 
 While wintering in Africa , the corn crake occupies dry grassland and savanna habitats , occurring in vegetation 30 – 200 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 6 @.@ 56 ft ) tall , including seasonally burnt areas and occasionally sedges or reed beds . It is also found on fallow and abandoned fields , uncut grass on airfields , and the edges of crops . It occurs at up to at least 1 @,@ 750 m ( 5 @,@ 740 ft ) altitude in South Africa . Although it sometimes occurs with the African crake , that species normally prefers moister and shorter grassland habitats than does the corn crake . On migration , the corn crake may also occur in wheatfields and around golf courses . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 Both Crex crakes are mainly active during the day , especially at dawn , dusk , during light rain , or after heavier rain . The African crake is less skulking and easier to flush from cover than other crakes , and is often seen at the edges of roads and tracks , but the corn crake is a much more difficult bird to see in its breeding sites , usually being hidden by vegetation and rarely emerging into the open . Both crakes are territorial on both the breeding and non @-@ breeding grounds ; the male threat displays involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the wings , flanks and belly like a fan . Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking . 
 Both species walk with a high @-@ stepping action , and can run swiftly through grass with the body held horizontal and laterally flattened . When disturbed , they typically fly less than 50 m ( 160 ft ) , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket , and then go into a crouch . In short grass , they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability , running with the body held almost horizontal . The typical flight is weak and fluttering , especially that of the African crake , but for longer flights , such as migration , the corn crake has a steadier , stronger action with its legs drawn up . Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration , sometimes associating with common quails . Migration takes place at night , and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites . The ability to migrate is innate , not learned from adults ; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild @-@ bred young . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Both crakes were formerly believed to be monogamous , but the male corn crake may have a shifting home range , and mate with two or more females , moving on when laying is almost complete . The breeding display consists of a short chase of the female by the male . The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves and lined with finer grasses , built in a depression and well hidden in the grass . The clutch size is from 3 to 11 pink eggs for the African species , and 6 – 14 – usually 8 – 12 – for the European breeder . The corn crake 's eggs are oval , slightly glossy , creamy or tinted with green , blue or grey , and blotched red @-@ brown . They average 37 mm × 26 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in × 1 @.@ 0 in ) and weigh about 13 – 16 g ( 0 @.@ 46 – 0 @.@ 56 oz ) , of which 7 % is shell . 
 The first egg is often laid when the nest is little more than a pad of grass , and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day . Both sexes incubate the eggs , which start hatching after about 14 days ; all hatch with 48 hours despite the extended laying period . The black , downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents . Fledging occurs after four to six weeks , and the young can fly before they are fully grown . It is not known whether the African crake has a second brood , but the corn crake usually does . Where grass is not tall enough at the start of the season , the first nest may be constructed in herby or marsh vegetation , with the second brood in hay . The second nest may also be at a higher altitude that the first , to take advantage of the later @-@ developing grasses further up a hill . 
 Although survival in undisturbed sites is high , at 80 – 90 % , the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices , since mechanised mowing can kill 38 – 95 % of chicks in a given site . The influence of weather on corn crake chick survival is limited : although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather , the effects are relatively small . Unlike many precocial species , chicks are fed by their mother for a few days until they become independent , and this may cushion them from adverse conditions . The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather , with lower survival in large broods . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Both Crex crakes are omnivorous , but mainly feed on invertebrates , including earthworms , slugs and snails , spiders , beetles , dragonflies , grasshoppers and other insects . The corn crake may take pests such as <unk> weevils , <unk> and wireworms . In Africa , termites , cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed . These opportunist hunters will take the occasional vertebrate such as a small frog , rodent or fish . Food is taken from the ground , low @-@ growing plants and from inside grass tussocks ; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill , and run in pursuit of active prey . In Africa , both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads . Plant material is eaten , especially grass seeds , but also green shoots , leaves and other seeds . As with other rails , grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach . Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets . Chicks are fed mainly on animal food . Crex crakes forage singly , in pairs or in family groups , sometimes in association with the other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes , blue quails and common quails . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Predators of the corn crake on its European breeding grounds include feral and domestic cats , introduced American mink , feral ferrets , otters and red foxes , and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow . In Lithuania , the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes . When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing , they may be taken by large birds including the white stork , harriers and other birds of prey , gulls and corvids . At undisturbed sites , nests and broods are rarely attacked , which is reflected in the high breeding success . 
 In Africa , Crex species may be hunted by the leopard , serval , cats , the black @-@ headed heron , dark chanting goshawk , African hawk @-@ eagle , Wahlberg 's eagle , and black sparrowhawk . In South Africa , newly hatched African crake chicks were taken by a <unk> . 
 Parasites recorded in this genus include the widespread fluke <unk> ovatus ( which lives in the oviducts of birds ) , the parasitic worm <unk> elegans , the larvae of parasitic flies , the feather mite <unk> elongatus , and hard ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis and Ixodes . During the reintroduction of corn crakes to England in the 2003 breeding season , enteritis and ill health in pre @-@ release birds was due to bacteria of a pathogenic Campylobacter species . Subsequently , microbiology tests were done to detect infected individuals and to find the source of the bacteria in their environment . 
 = = Status = = 
 Both Crex species have huge breeding ranges , estimated at 15 @,@ 700 @,@ 000 km2 ( 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 mi2 ) for the African crake and 12 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 km2 ( 4 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 mi2 ) for the corn crake . The population size of the African species is unknown , but it is common in most of its range , and its numbers appear to be stable . The European bird has an estimated 1 @.@ 3 – 2 @.@ 0 million breeding pairs in Europe , three @-@ quarters of which are in European Russia , and a further 515 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 240 @,@ 000 pairs in Asiatic Russia ; the total Eurasian population has been estimated at between 5 @.@ 45 and 9 @.@ 72 million individuals . Both species are classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . The corn crake was formerly classified as near @-@ threatened because of serious declines in Europe , but improved monitoring in Russia indicates that anticipated losses there have not occurred and numbers have remained stable or possibly increased in Russia and Kazakhstan . Although most rails in the Old World are covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) , neither Crex species is listed , being too terrestrial to be classed as wetland species . 
 Overgrazing , agriculture and the loss of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas , such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu @-@ Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane . In other areas , grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared . This crake is considered to be good eating , and is killed for food in some regions . Despite these adverse factors , it appears to be under no real threat . 
 In much of the western half of the corn crake 's breeding range , there have been long @-@ term declines that are expected to continue , although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries , including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland , the UK and the Netherlands . The breeding population had begun to decline in the 19th century , but the process gained pace after World War II . The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing . Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth , made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers , and the move from manual grass @-@ cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers , at first horse @-@ drawn and later pulled by tractors . Mechanisation also means that large areas can be cut quickly , leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone , or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed . The pattern of mowing , typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre , gives little chance of escape for the chicks , which are also exposed to potential animal predators . Adults can often escape the mowers , although some incubating females sit tight on the nest , with fatal results . 
 Loss of habitat is the other major threat to the corn crake , since drained and fertilised silage fields are less suitable for breeding than traditional hay meadows . In western Europe the conversion of grassland to arable land has been aided by subsidies , and further east the collapse of collective farming has led to the abandonment and lack of management of much land in this important breeding area . More localised threats include floods in spring , and disturbance by roads or wind farms , and the loss of many birds – up to 14 @,@ 000 a year – in Egypt , where migrating birds are captured in nets set for the quail with which they often migrate . Although this may account for 0 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 7 % of the European population , the losses to this form of hunting are less than when the targeted species were more numerous and predictable . 
 Most European countries have taken steps to conserve the corn crake and produce national management policies ; there is also an overall European action plan . The focus of conservation effort is to monitor populations and ecology and to improve survival , principally through changing the timing and method of hay harvesting . Later cutting gives time for breeding to be completed , and leaving uncut strips at the edges of fields and cutting from the centre outwards reduces the casualties from mowing . Implementing these changes is predicted to stop the population decline if the measures are applied on a sufficiently large scale . Reduction of illegal hunting , and protection in countries where hunting is still allowed , are also conservation aims . Reintroduction of the corn crake is being attempted in England , and breeding sites are scheduled for protection in many other countries . Where breeding sites impinge on urban areas , there are cost implications , estimated in one German study at several million euros per corn crake . The corn crake does not appear to be seriously threatened on its wintering grounds and may benefit from deforestation , which creates more open habitats .

 Twin tunnels form the Wheeling Tunnel in Wheeling , Ohio County , West Virginia . The tunnels are 0 @.@ 27 miles ( 430 m ) long , cutting though Wheeling Hill , and each carries two lanes of Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250 . The tunnels originally took three years to construct , costing $ 6 @.@ 9 million .

 The Wheeling Tunnel sits between exits 1A and 1B on Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 250 , which run concurrent through the city of Wheeling . The tunnel cuts through Wheeling Hill , and has two travel lanes in each tube . Due to the closeness of exit 1A to the western end of the tunnels , the tunnels ' right lanes function as acceleration and deceleration lanes . Through traffic is restricted to the left lane in each tunnel and lane changes are prohibited . 
 A series of accidents involving semi @-@ trailer trucks prompted local political candidates to push for trucks to be banned from the tunnel , diverting them to the nearby I @-@ 470 .

 The twin tunnels , which cost $ 6 @.@ 9 million ( equivalent to $ 53 million in 2016 ) to construct , are lined with a total of 13 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m2 ) of industrial tile . Then governor William Wallace Barron , and the state roads commissioner broke ground on the tunnel on August 22 , 1963 , which he stated was the largest single construction project in the state 's Interstate Highway program . The construction contract was awarded to C.J. <unk> & Son , Inc. located in Baltimore , Maryland . Several workers became ill after being exposed to high amounts of carbon monoxide fumes , which brought construction to a halt in 1964 until ventilation fans were installed . The tunnel officially opened to traffic on December 7 , 1966 .

 Plans for the reconstruction of the tunnel were formed in 2005 , with reconstruction work beginning in January 2007 . Reconstruction of the tunnel was planned to take 3 months , but reconstruction of the eastbound tunnel , which was not totally completed , took over eleven months . After the issues with the reconstruction work , local politicians suggested closing the tunnels altogether , and to just build the freeway over Wheeling Hill , however after opposition from the NAACP and other groups , the suggestions were dropped . Completion of the eastbound tunnel reconstruction begin in July 2008 , when the tiles were replaced for the first time with new tiles fabricated by a German tile manufacturer . The Division of Highways had to award the contract to the German company because no other company could complete the request within the time frame required . The original tiles were made by a now @-@ defunct company based in Cleveland . During the second round of eastbound tunnel reconstruction , the westbound tunnel was also closed overnight for construction work . The eastbound tunnel reconstruction was completed on October 31 , 2008 . The westbound tube was closed in February 2010 , and opened a month ahead of schedule in September 2010 . The total cost of the project was over double the original bid , totaling $ 13 @.@ 7 million , due to the delays . 
 = The Kite Runner = 
 The Kite Runner is the first novel by Afghan @-@ American author Khaled Hosseini . Published in 2003 by Riverhead Books , it tells the story of Amir , a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul , whose closest friend is Hassan , his father 's young Hazara servant . The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events , from the fall of Afghanistan 's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention , the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States , and the rise of the Taliban regime . 
 Hosseini has commented that he considers The Kite Runner to be a father – son story , emphasizing the familial aspects of the narrative , an element that he continued to use in his later works . Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel , with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent . The latter half of the book centers on Amir 's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan 's son over two decades later . 
 The Kite Runner became a bestseller after being printed in paperback and was popularized in book clubs . It was a number one New York Times bestseller for over two years , with over seven million copies sold in the United States . Reviews were generally positive , though parts of the plot drew significant controversy in Afghanistan . A number of adaptations were created following publication , including a 2007 film of the same name , several stage performances , and a graphic novel . 
 = = Composition and publication = = 
 Khaled Hosseini worked as a medical internist at Kaiser Hospital in Mountain View , California for several years before publishing The Kite Runner . In 1999 , Hosseini learned through a news report that the Taliban had banned kite flying in Afghanistan , a restriction he found particularly cruel . The news " struck a personal chord " for him , as he had grown up with the sport while living in Afghanistan . He was motivated to write a 25 @-@ page short story about two boys who fly kites in Kabul . Hosseini submitted copies to Esquire and The New Yorker , both of which rejected it . He rediscovered the manuscript in his garage in March 2001 and began to expand it to novel format at the suggestion of a friend . According to Hosseini , the narrative became " much darker " than he originally intended . His editor , Cindy Spiegel , " helped him rework the last third of his manuscript " , something she describes as relatively common for a first novel . 
 As with Hosseini 's subsequent novels , The Kite Runner covers a multigenerational period and focuses on the relationship between parents and their children . The latter was unintentional ; Hosseini developed an interest in the theme while in the process of writing . He later divulged that he frequently came up with pieces of the plot by drawing pictures of it . For example , he did not decide to make Amir and Hassan brothers until after he had " doodled it " . 
 Like Amir , the protagonist of the novel , Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left the country as a youth , not returning until 2003 . Thus , he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book . In response , he said , " When I say some of it is me , then people look unsatisfied . The parallels are pretty obvious , but ... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy . " Having left the country around the time of the Soviet invasion , he felt a certain amount of survivor 's guilt : " Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt . A lot of my childhood friends had a very hard time . Some of our cousins died . One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [ an incident that Hosseini <unk> in The Kite Runner ] . Talk about guilt . He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites . His father was shot . " Regardless , he maintains that the plot is fictional . Later , when writing his second novel , A Thousand Splendid Suns ( then titled Dreaming in Titanic City ) , Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it " should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all " . 
 Riverhead Books published The Kite Runner , ordering an initial printing of 50 @,@ 000 copies in hardback . It was released on May 29 , 2003 , and the paperback edition was released a year later . Hosseini took a year @-@ long absence from practicing medicine to promote the book , signing copies , speaking at various events , and raising funds for Afghan causes . Originally published in English , The Kite Runner was later translated into 42 languages for publication in 38 countries . In 2013 , Riverhead released the 10th anniversary edition with a new gold @-@ rimmed cover and a foreword by Hosseini . That same year , on May 21 , Khaled Hosseini published another book called And the Mountains Echoed . 
 Following The Kite Runner 's success , Hosseini continued to work as a physician for another year and a half before becoming a full @-@ time writer . " Medicine was an arranged marriage , writing is my mistress , " he explains , employing a quote from Chekhov . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 = = = Part I = = = 
 Amir , a well @-@ to @-@ do Pashtun boy , and Hassan , a Hazara who is the son of Ali , Amir 's father 's servant , spend their days kite fighting in the hitherto peaceful city of Kabul . Hassan is a successful " kite runner " for Amir ; he knows where the kite will land without watching it . Amir 's father , a wealthy merchant Amir affectionately refers to as Baba , loves both boys , but is often critical of Amir , considering him weak and lacking in courage . Amir finds a kinder fatherly figure in Rahim Khan , Baba 's closest friend , who understands him and supports his interest in writing . 
 Assef , an older boy with a sadistic taste for violence , mocks Amir for socializing with a Hazara , which is , according to Assef , an inferior race whose members belong only in Hazarajat . One day , he prepares to attack Amir with brass knuckles , but Hassan defends Amir , threatening to shoot out Assef 's eye with his slingshot . Assef backs off but swears to get revenge . 
 One triumphant day , Amir wins the local kite fighting tournament and finally earns Baba 's praise . Hassan runs for the last cut kite , a great trophy , saying to Amir , " For you , a thousand times over . " However , after finding the kite , Hassan encounters Assef in an alleyway . Hassan refuses to give up the kite , and Assef beats him severely and rapes him . Amir witnesses the act but is too scared to intervene . He knows that if he fails to bring home the kite , Baba would be less proud of him . He feels incredibly guilty but knows his cowardice would destroy any hopes for Baba 's affections , so he keeps quiet about the incident . Afterwards , Amir keeps distant from Hassan ; his feelings of guilt prevent him from interacting with the boy . 
 Amir begins to believe that life would be easier if Hassan were not around , so he plants a watch and some money under Hassan 's mattress in hopes that Baba will make him leave ; Hassan falsely confesses when confronted by Baba . Although Baba believes " there is no act more wretched than stealing " , he forgives him . To Baba 's sorrow , Hassan and Ali leave anyway . Amir is freed of the daily reminder of his cowardice and betrayal , but he still lives in their shadow . 
 = = = Part II = = = 
 In 1979 , five years later , the Soviet Union militarily intervenes in Afghanistan . Amir and Baba escape to Peshawar , Pakistan , and then to Fremont , California , where they settle in a run @-@ down apartment . Baba begins work at a gas station . After graduating from high school , Amir takes classes at San Jose State University to develop his writing skills . Every Sunday , Baba and Amir make extra money selling used goods at a flea market in San Jose . There , Amir meets fellow refugee Soraya Taheri and her family . Baba is diagnosed with terminal cancer but is still capable of granting Amir one last favor : he asks Soraya 's father 's permission for Amir to marry her . He agrees and the two marry . Shortly thereafter Baba dies . Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage , but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children . 
 Amir embarks on a successful career as a novelist . Fifteen years after his wedding , Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan , who is dying , asking him to come to Peshawar . He enigmatically tells Amir , " There is a way to be good again . " Amir goes . 
 = = = Part III = = = 
 From Rahim Khan , Amir learns that Ali was killed by a land mine and that Hassan and his wife were killed after Hassan refused to allow the Taliban to confiscate Baba and Amir 's house in Kabul . Rahim Khan further reveals that Ali , being sterile , was not Hassan 's biological father . Hassan was actually Baba 's son and Amir 's half @-@ brother . Finally , he tells Amir that the reason he called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab , Hassan 's son , from an orphanage in Kabul . 
 Amir , accompanied by Farid , an Afghan taxi driver and veteran of the war with the Soviets , searches for Sohrab . They learn that a Taliban official comes to the orphanage often , brings cash , and usually takes a girl away with him . Occasionally he chooses a boy , recently Sohrab . The director tells Amir how to find the official , and Farid secures an appointment at his home by claiming to have " personal business " with him . 
 Amir meets the man , who reveals himself as Assef . Sohrab is being kept at Assef 's house . Assef agrees to relinquish him if Amir can beat him in a fight . Assef then badly beats Amir , breaking several bones , until Sohrab uses a slingshot to fire a brass ball into Assef 's left eye . Sohrab helps Amir out of the house , where he passes out and wakes up in a hospital . 
 Amir tells Sohrab of his plans to take him back to America and possibly adopt him . However , American authorities demand evidence of Sohrab 's orphan status . Amir tells Sohrab that he may have to temporarily break his promise until the paperwork is completed , and Sohrab attempts suicide . Amir eventually manages to take him back to the United States . After his adoption , Sohrab refuses to interact with Amir or Soraya until the former reminisces about Hassan and kites and shows off some of Hassan 's tricks . In the end , Sohrab only gives a lopsided smile , but Amir takes it with all his heart as he runs the kite for Sohrab , saying , " For you , a thousand times over . " 
 = = Characters = = 
 Amir is the narrator of the novel . Khaled Hosseini acknowledged that the character is " an unlikable coward who failed to come to the aid of his best friend " for much of the duration of the story ; consequently , Hosseini chose to create sympathy for Amir through circumstances rather than the personality he was given until the last third of the book . Born into a Pashtun family in 1963 , his mother died giving birth . As a child , he enjoys storytelling and is encouraged by Rahim Khan to become an author . At age 18 , he and his father flee to America following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , where he pursues his dream of being a writer . 
 Hassan is Amir 's closest childhood friend . He is described as having a China doll face , green eyes , and a <unk> . Hosseini regards him as a flat character in terms of development ; he is " a lovely guy and you root for him and you love him but he 's not complicated " . The reader eventually discovers that Hassan is actually the son of Baba and <unk> , although Hassan never discovers this during his lifetime . Moreover , it would make Hassan a Pashtun according to tribal law and not Hazara as he 's actually the son of Baba , and ironic for Assef to bully him as both Assef and Hassan are half Pashtuns . Hassan is later killed by the Taliban for refusal to abandon Amir 's property . 
 Assef is the son of a Pashtun father and a German mother , and believes that Pashtuns are superior to Hazaras , despite himself not being full Pashtun . As a teenager , he is a neighborhood bully and is described as a " sociopath " by Amir . He rapes Hassan as a means of getting revenge against Amir . As an adult , he joins the Taliban and sexually abuses Hassan 's son , Sohrab . 
 Baba is Amir 's father and a wealthy businessman who aids the community by creating businesses for others and building a new orphanage . He is the biological father of Hassan , a fact he hides from both of his children , and seems to favor him over Amir . Similar to Hosseini 's father , Baba does not endorse the religiosity demanded by the clerics in the religion classes attended by Amir in school . In his later years , after fleeing to America , he works at a gas station . He dies from cancer in 1987 , shortly after Amir and Soraya 's wedding . 
 Ali is Baba 's servant , a Hazara believed to be Hassan 's father . In his youth , Baba 's father adopted him after his parents were killed by a drunk driver . Before the events of the novel , Ali had been struck with polio , rendering his right leg useless . Because of this , Ali is constantly tormented by children in the town . He is later killed by a land mine in Hazarajat . 
 Rahim Khan is Baba 's loyal friend and business partner , as well as a mentor to Amir . Rahim persuades Amir to come to Pakistan to inform him that Hassan is his half brother and that he should rescue Sohrab . 
 Soraya is a young Afghan woman whom Amir meets and marries in America . Hosseini originally scripted the character as an American woman , but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable for her role in the story . The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III . In the final draft , Soraya lives with her parents , Afghan general Taheri and his wife , and wants to become an English teacher . Before meeting Amir , she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia , which , according to Afghan tradition , made her unsuitable for marriage . Because Amir also had his own regrets , he loves and marries her anyway . 
 Sohrab is the son of Hassan . After his parents are killed and he is sent to an orphanage , Assef buys and abuses the child . Amir saves and later adopts him . After being brought to the United States , he slowly adapts to his new life . Sohrab greatly resembles a young version of his father Hassan . 
 <unk> is Ali 's wife and the mother of Hassan . Shortly after Hassan 's birth , she runs away from home and joins a group of traveling dancers . She later returns to Hassan in his adulthood . To make up for her neglect , she provides a grandmother figure for Sohrab , Hassan 's son . 
 Farid is a taxi driver who is initially abrasive toward Amir , but later befriends him . Two of Farid 's seven children were killed by a land mine , a disaster which mutilated three fingers on his left hand and also took some of his toes . After spending a night with Farid 's brother 's impoverished family , Amir hides a bundle of money under the mattress to help them . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Because its themes of friendship , betrayal , guilt , redemption and the uneasy love between fathers and sons are universal themes , and not specifically Afghan , the book has been able to reach across cultural , racial , religious and gender gaps to resonate with readers of varying backgrounds . 
 Khaled Hosseini identifies a number of themes that appear in The Kite Runner , but reviewers have focused on guilt and redemption . As a child , Amir fails to save Hassan in an act of cowardice and afterwards suffers from an all @-@ consuming guilt . Even after leaving the country , moving to America , marrying , and becoming a successful writer , he is unable to forget the incident . Hassan is " the all @-@ sacrificing Christ @-@ figure , the one who , even in death , calls Amir to redemption " . Following Hassan 's death at the hands of the Taliban , Amir begins to redeem himself through the rescue of Hassan 's son , Sohrab . Hosseini draws parallels during the search for Sohrab to create an impression of poetic justice ; for example , Amir sustains a split lip after being severely beaten , similar to Hassan 's <unk> . Despite this , some critics questioned whether the protagonist had fully redeemed himself . 
 Amir 's motivation for the childhood betrayal is rooted in his insecurities regarding his relationship with his father . The relationship between parents and their children features prominently in the novel , and in an interview , Hosseini elaborated : 
 Both [ The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns ] are multigenerational , and so the relationship between parent and child , with all of its manifest complexities and contradictions , is a prominent theme . I did not intend this , but I am keenly interested , it appears , in the way parents and children love , disappoint , and in the end honor each other . In one way , the two novels are corollaries : The Kite Runner was a father @-@ son story , and A Thousand Splendid Suns can be seen as a mother @-@ daughter story . 
 When adapting The Kite Runner for the theatre , Director Eric Rose stated that he was drawn into the narrative by the " themes of betraying your best friend for the love of your father " , which he compared to Shakespearean literature . Throughout the story , Amir craves his father 's affection ; his father , in turn , loves Amir but favors Hassan , going as far as to pay for plastic surgery to repair the latter 's cleft lip .

 In the first two years following its publication , over 70 @,@ 000 hardback copies of The Kite Runner were sold along with 1 @,@ 250 @,@ 000 paperback copies .

By the publication of Khaled Hosseini 's third novel in 2013 , over seven million copies had been sold in the United States . The book received the South African <unk> Prize in 2004 . It was voted the Reading Group Book of the Year for 2006 and 2007 and headed a list of 60 titles submitted by entrants to the Penguin / Orange Reading Group prize ( UK ) . 
 Critically , the book was well @-@ received , albeit controversial . Erika <unk> from Salon praised it as " beautifully written , startling and heart wrenching " . Tony Sims from Wired Magazine wrote that the book " reveals the beauty and agony of a tormented nation as it tells the story of an improbable friendship between two boys from opposite ends of society , and of the troubled but enduring relationship between a father and a son " . Amelia Hill of The Guardian opinionated , " The Kite Runner is the shattering first novel by Khaled Hosseini " that " is simultaneously devastating and inspiring . " A similarly favorable review was printed in Publishers Weekly . Marketing director Melissa Mytinger remarked , " It 's simply an excellent story . Much of it based in a world we don 't know , a world we 're barely beginning to know . Well @-@ written , published at the ' right time ' by an author who is both charming and thoughtful in his personal appearances for the book . " Indian @-@ American actor Aasif Mandvi agreed that the book was " amazing storytelling . ... It 's about human beings . It 's about redemption , and redemption is a powerful theme . " First Lady Laura Bush commended the story as " really great " . Said Tayeb Jawad , the 19th Afghan ambassador to the United States , publicly endorsed The Kite Runner , saying that the book would help the American public to better understand Afghan society and culture . 
 Edward <unk> from The New York Times analyzed the portrayal of Afghanistan before and after the Taliban : 
 Hosseini 's depiction of pre @-@ revolutionary Afghanistan is rich in warmth and humor but also tense with the friction between the nation 's different ethnic groups . Amir 's father , or Baba , personifies all that is reckless , courageous and arrogant in his dominant Pashtun tribe ... The novel 's canvas turns dark when Hosseini describes the suffering of his country under the tyranny of the Taliban , whom Amir encounters when he finally returns home , hoping to help Hassan and his family . The final third of the book is full of haunting images : a man , desperate to feed his children , trying to sell his artificial leg in the market ; an adulterous couple stoned to death in a stadium during the halftime of a football match ; a <unk> young boy forced into prostitution , dancing the sort of steps once performed by an organ grinder 's monkey . 
 Meghan O 'Rouke , Slate Magazine 's culture critic and advisory editor , ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre , writing , " This is a novel simultaneously striving to deliver a large @-@ scale informative portrait and to stage a small @-@ scale redemptive drama , but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions . People experience their lives against the backdrop of their culture , and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely <unk> Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place , he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room , in the end , for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans . " Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end . She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs . 
 = = = Controversies = = = 
 The Kite Runner has been accused of ' hindering ' Western understanding of the Talibans by portraying its members as representatives of various social and doctrinal evils that the Talibans and their supporters do not consider typical and which they feel portray Talibans in an unfavourable light . Examples of this would be : Assef 's pedophilia , Nazism , drug abuse , and sadism , and the fact that he is an executioner . The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most @-@ challenged books of 2008 , with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to " offensive language , sexually explicit , and unsuited to age group . " Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed . Hosseini responded in an interview , " They never say I am speaking about things that are untrue . Their beef is , ' Why do you have to talk about these things and embarrass us ? Don 't you love your country ? ' " 
 The film generated more controversy through the 30 @-@ second rape scene , with threats made against the child actors , who originated from Afghanistan . <unk> <unk> , the 12 @-@ year @-@ old actor who portrayed Amir , had to be removed from school after his Hazara classmates threatened to kill him , and Paramount Pictures was eventually forced to relocate three of the children to the United Arab Emirates .

 Four years after its publication , The Kite Runner was adapted as a motion picture starring Khalid Abdalla as Amir , <unk> <unk> as Baba , and Ahmad Khan <unk> as Hassan . It was initially scheduled to premiere in November 2007 , but the release date was pushed back six weeks to evacuate the Afghan child stars from the country after they received death threats . Directed by Marc Forster and with a screenplay by David Benioff , the movie won numerous awards and was nominated for an Academy Award , the BAFTA Film Award , and the Critics Choice Award in 2008 . While reviews were generally positive , with Entertainment Weekly deeming the final product " pretty good " , the depiction of ethnic tensions and the controversial rape scene drew outrage in Afghanistan . <unk> <unk> , the child rights commissioner for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission , commented , " They should not play around with the lives and security of people . The Hazara people will take it as an insult . " 
 Hosseini was surprised by the extent of the controversy caused by the rape scene and vocalized that Afghan actors would not have been cast had studios known that their lives would be threatened . He believed that the scene was necessary to " maintain the integrity " of the story , as a physical assault by itself would not have affected the audience as much .

 The novel was first adapted to the stage in March 2007 by Bay Area playwright Matthew Spangler where it was performed at San Jose State University . Two years later , David Ira Goldstein , artistic director of Arizona Theater Company , organized for it to be performed at San Jose Repertory Theatre . The play was produced at Arizona Theatre Company in 2009 , Actor 's Theatre of Louisville and Cleveland Play House in 2010 , and The New Repertory Theatre of Watertown , Massachusetts in 2012 . The theatre adaption premiered in Canada as a co @-@ production between Theatre Calgary and the Citadel Theatre in January 2013 . In April 2013 , the play premiered in Europe at the Nottingham Playhouse , with Ben Turner acting in the lead role . 
 Hosseini was approached by <unk> , his Italian publisher , about converting The Kite Runner to a graphic novel in 2011 . Having been " a fan of comic books since childhood " , he was open to the idea , believing that The Kite Runner was a good candidate to be presented in a visual format . Fabio Celoni provided the illustrations for the project and regularly updated Hosseini on his progress before its release in September of that year . The latter was pleased with the final product and said , " I believe Fabio Celoni 's work vividly brings to life not only the mountains , the bazaars , the city of Kabul and its kite @-@ dotted skies , but also the many struggles , conflicts , and emotional highs and lows of Amir 's journey . " 
 = House of Plantagenet = 
 The House of Plantagenet ( / <unk> / ) was a royal house which originated from the lands of Anjou in France . The name Plantagenet is used by modern historians to identify four distinct royal houses – the Angevins who were also Counts of Anjou , the main body of the Plantagenets following the loss of Anjou , and the houses of Lancaster and York , the Plantagenets ' two cadet branches . The family held the English throne from 1154 , with the accession of Henry II , until 1485 , when Richard III died . 
 Under the Plantagenets , England was transformed , although this was only partly intentional . The Plantagenet kings were often forced to negotiate compromises such as Magna Carta . These constrained royal power in return for financial and military support . The king was no longer just the most powerful man in the nation , holding the prerogative of judgement , feudal tribute and warfare . He now had defined duties to the realm , underpinned by a sophisticated justice system . A distinct national identity was shaped by conflict with the French , Scots , Welsh and Irish , and the establishment of English as the primary language . 
 In the 15th century , the Plantagenets were defeated in the Hundred Years ' War and beset with social , political and economic problems . Popular revolts were commonplace , triggered by the denial of numerous freedoms . English nobles raised private armies , engaged in private feuds and openly defied Henry VI . 
 The rivalry between the House of Plantagenet 's two cadet branches of York and Lancaster brought about the Wars of the Roses , a decades @-@ long fight for the English succession , culminating in the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 , when the reign of the Plantagenets and the English Middle Ages both met their end with the death of King Richard III . Henry VII , a Lancastrian , became king of England ; two years later , he married Elizabeth of York , thus ending the Wars of the Roses , and giving rise to the Tudor dynasty . The Tudors worked to centralise English royal power , which allowed them to avoid some of the problems that had plagued the last Plantagenet rulers . The resulting stability allowed for the English Renaissance , and the advent of early modern Britain .

 = = = Plantagenet = = = 
 Richard of York , 3rd Duke of York , adopted Plantagenet as his family name in the 15th century . " Plantegenest " ( or " Plante Genest " ) had been a 12th @-@ century nickname for his ancestor Geoffrey , count of Anjou and duke of Normandy . One of many popular theories suggests the common broom , planta genista in medieval Latin , as the source of the nickname . It is uncertain why Richard chose this specific name , although during the Wars of the Roses it emphasised Richard 's status as Geoffrey 's patrilineal descendant . The retrospective usage of the name for all of Geoffrey 's male descendants was popular during the subsequent Tudor dynasty , perhaps encouraged by the further legitimacy it gave to Richard 's great @-@ grandson , Henry VIII . It was only in the late 17th century that it passed into common usage among historians . 
 = = = Angevins = = = 
 The three Angevin kings ( French for " from Anjou " ) were Henry II , Richard I and John ; " Angevin " can also refer to the period of history in which they reigned . Many historians identify the Angevins as a distinct English royal house . " Angevin " is also used in reference to any sovereign or government derived from Anjou . As a noun , it refers to any native of Anjou or an Angevin ruler , and specifically to : other counts and dukes of Anjou , including the ancestors of the three kings that formed the English royal house ; their cousins , who held the crown of Jerusalem ; and to unrelated members of the French royal family who were later granted the titles and formed different dynasties , such as the Capetian House of Anjou and the Valois House of Anjou . Consequently , there is disagreement between those who consider Henry III to be the first Plantagenet monarch and those who do not distinguish between Angevins and Plantagenets and therefore consider the first Plantagenet to be Henry II . 
 The term " Angevin Empire " was coined by Kate Norgate in 1887 . There was no known contemporary collective name for the territories to which circumlocutions such as " our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be " or " the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father " may have referred . The " Empire " portion of " Angevin Empire " has been controversial . In 1986 a convention of historians concluded that there had not been an Angevin state , and therefore no " Angevin Empire " , but that the term " espace Plantagenet " , Plantagenet space in English , was acceptable . Nonetheless , historians have continued to use " Angevin Empire " . 
 = = Origin = = 
 The later counts of Anjou , including the Plantagenets , descended from Geoffrey II , Count of Gâtinais , and his wife Ermengarde of Anjou . In 1060 the couple inherited the title via cognatic kinship from an Angevin family that was descended from a noble named Ingelger , whose recorded history dates from 870 . 
 During the 10th and 11th centuries , power struggles occurred between rulers in northern and western France including those of Anjou , Normandy , Brittany , Poitou , Blois , Maine , and the kings of France . In the early 12th century Geoffrey of Anjou married Empress Matilda , King Henry I 's only surviving legitimate child and heir to the English throne . As a result of this marriage , Geoffrey 's son Henry II inherited the English throne as well as Norman and Angevin titles , thus marking the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties . 
 The marriage was the third attempt of Geoffrey 's father , Fulk V , Count of Anjou , to build a political alliance with Normandy . He first espoused his daughter , Alice , to William Adelin , Henry I 's heir . After William drowned in the wreck of the White Ship Fulk married another of his daughters , Sibylla , to William Clito , son of Henry I 's older brother , Robert Curthose . Henry I had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William 's rival claim to Normandy . Finally Fulk achieved his goal through the marriage of Geoffrey and Matilda . Fulk then passed his titles to Geoffrey and became king of Jerusalem .

 When Henry II was born in 1133 , his grandfather , Henry I , was reportedly delighted , saying that the boy was " the heir to the kingdom " . The birth reduced the risk that the King 's realm would pass to his son @-@ in @-@ law 's family , which might have occurred if the marriage of Matilda and Count Geoffrey had proved childless . The birth of a second son , also named Geoffrey , increased the likelihood that , in accordance with French custom , Henry would receive the English maternal inheritance and Geoffrey the Angevin paternal inheritance . This would separate the realms of England and Anjou . In order to secure an orderly succession , Geoffrey and Matilda sought more power from Henry I , but quarrelled with him after the King refused to give them power that might be used against him . When he died in November 1135 , the couple were in Anjou , allowing Matilda 's cousin Stephen to seize the crown of England . Stephen 's contested accession initiated the widespread civil unrest later called the Anarchy . 
 Count Geoffrey had little interest in England . Instead he commenced a ten @-@ year war for the duchy of Normandy , but it became clear that to bring this conflict to a successful conclusion Stephen would need to be challenged in England so in 1139 Matilda and her half @-@ brother , Robert invaded England . From the age of nine , Henry was repeatedly sent to England to be the male figurehead of the campaigns , since it became apparent that he would become king if England was conquered . In 1141 Stephen was captured at the Battle of Lincoln and later exchanged for Robert who had also been captured . Geoffrey continued the conquest of Normandy and in 1150 transferred the duchy to Henry while retaining the primary role in the duchy 's government . 
 Three events allowed the Angevins ' successful termination of the conflict : 
 Count Geoffrey died in 1151 before finalizing the division of his realm between Henry and Henry 's younger brother Geoffrey , who would have inherited Anjou . According to William of Newburgh , who wrote in the 1190s , Count Geoffrey decided that Henry would receive England and Anjou for as long as he needed the resources for the conflict against Stephen . Count Geoffrey instructed that his body should not be buried until Henry swore an oath that the young Geoffrey would receive Anjou when England and Normandy were secured . W. L. Warren cast doubt on this account on the grounds that it was written later based on a single contemporary source , it would be questionable that either Geoffrey or Henry would consider such an oath binding and it would break the inheritance practice of the time . The young Geoffrey died in 1158 , before receiving Anjou , but he had become count of Nantes when the citizens of Nantes rebelled against their ruler . Henry had supported the rebellion . 
 Louis VII of France was granted an annulment of his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine on 18 March 1152 , and she married Henry ( who would become Henry II ) on 18 May 1152 . Consequently , the Angevins acquired the Duchy of Aquitaine . 
 Stephen 's wife and elder son , Eustace , died in 1153 leading to the Treaty of Wallingford . The treaty agreed the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142 , recognised Henry as Stephen 's heir , guaranteed Stephen 's second son William his father 's estates and allowed Stephen to be king for life . Stephen died soon afterwards , and Henry acceded to the throne in late 1154 . 
 = = = Angevin zenith = = = 
 Of Henry 's siblings , William and Geoffrey died unmarried and childless , but the tempestuous marriage of Henry and Eleanor , who already had two daughters ( Marie and Alix ) through her first marriage to King Louis , produced eight children in thirteen years : 
 William , Count of Poitiers ( 1153 – 1156 ) 
 Henry the Young King ( 1155 – 1183 ) 
 Matilda , Duchess of Saxony ( 1156 – 1189 ) — married Henry the Lion , Duke of Bavaria . The eldest amongst the couple 's children , <unk> , is probably the daughter English chroniclers call Matilda , who was left in Normandy with her grandparents in 1185 and married firstly to Geoffrey , count of Perche , and secondly to Enguerrand de Coucy . The eldest son , Henry , became duke of Saxony and count palatine of the Rhine . His brother Otto was nominated by his uncle Richard I as earl of York and count of Poitiers before being elected emperor in opposition to the Hohenstaufen candidate . Otto was crowned in Rome but he was later excommunicated and declared deposed . Childless , Otto lost power following the defeat of the Welf and Angevin forces at the Battle of Bouvines . The youngest child , William of Winchester married Helena daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark . Their only son , also called Otto , was the sole male heir of his uncle Henry . The ducal house of Brunswick @-@ Lüneburg and the British royal house of Windsor both descend from him . 
 King Richard the Lionheart ( 1157 – 1199 ) . He had no legitimate offspring , but is thought to have had two illegitimate sons , of whom little is known , called Fulk and Phillip , Lord of Cognac . 
 Geoffrey , Duke of Brittany ( 1158 – 1186 ) — married Constance daughter of Duke Conan of Brittany and became duke of Brittany by right of his wife . The couple 's son Arthur was a competitor to John for the Angevin succession . 
 Eleanor , Queen of Castile ( 1161 – 1214 ) — married King Alfonso VIII of Castile . The couple 's children included King Henry of Castile and four queen consorts , Berengaria of Leon , <unk> of Portugal , Blanche of France and Eleanor of Aragon . 
 Joan , Queen of Sicily ( 1165 – 1199 ) — married firstly King William II of Sicily and secondly Count Raymond VI of Toulouse . Her children included Raymond VII of Toulouse . 
 King John Lackland ( 1166 – 1216 ) 
 Henry also had illegitimate children with several mistresses , possibly as many as twelve . These children included Geoffrey , William , Peter and four children who died young by Alice , the daughter of Louis VII , while she was betrothed to his son Richard . William ’ s many competencies and importance as a royal bastard led to a long and illustrious career . 
 Henry reasserted and extended previous suzerainties to secure possession of his inherited realm . In 1162 he attempted to re @-@ establish what he saw as his authority over the English Church by appointing his friend Thomas Becket as Archbishop of Canterbury upon the death of the incumbent archbishop , Theobald . Becket 's defiance as Archbishop alienated the king and his counsellors . Henry and Becket had repeated disputes over issues such as church tenures , the marriage of Henry 's brother , and taxation . Henry reacted by getting Becket and other English bishops to recognise sixteen ancient customs in writing for the first time in the Constitutions of Clarendon , governing relations between the king , his courts and the church . When Becket tried to leave the country without permission , Henry tried to ruin him by filing legal cases relating to Becket 's previous tenure as chancellor . Becket fled and remained in exile for five years . Relations later improved , and Becket returned , but they declined again when Henry 's son was crowned as coregent by the Archbishop of York , which Becket perceived as a challenge to his authority . Becket later excommunicated those who had offended him . When he received this news , Henry said : " What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low @-@ born clerk . " Four of Henry 's knights killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral after Becket resisted a failed arrest attempt . Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket 's death throughout Christian Europe . This made Henry a pariah ; in penance , he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral , where he was severely whipped by monks . 
 From 1155 Henry claimed that Pope Adrian IV had given him authorisation to reform the Irish church by assuming control of Ireland , but Professor Anne Duggan 's research indicates that the Laudabiliter is a falsification of an existing letter and that was not in fact Adrian 's intention . It originally allowed Henry 's brother William some territory . Henry did not personally act on this until 1171 by which time William was already dead . He invaded Ireland to assert his authority over knights who had accrued autonomous power after they recruited soldiers in England and Wales and colonised Ireland with his permission . Henry later gave Ireland to his youngest son , John . In 1172 Henry gave John the castles of Chinon , Loudun and Mirebeau as a wedding gift . This angered Henry 's eighteen @-@ year @-@ old son , Henry the Young King , who believed these were his . A rebellion by Henry II 's wife and three eldest sons ensued . Louis VII of France supported the rebellion . William the Lion , king of the Scots , and others joined the revolt . After eighteen months , Henry subdued the rebels . 
 In Le Mans in 1182 , Henry II gathered his children to plan a partible inheritance : his eldest surviving son , Henry , would inherit England , Normandy and Anjou ; Richard ( his mother 's favourite ) would inherit the Duchy of Aquitaine ; Geoffrey would inherit Brittany ; and John would inherit Ireland . This resulted in further conflict . The younger Henry rebelled again , but died of dysentery . Geoffrey died in 1186 after an accident in a tournament . In 1189 , Richard and Philip II of France reasserted their various claims exploiting the aging Henry 's failing health . Henry was forced to accept humiliating peace terms , including naming Richard his sole heir . The old King died two days later , defeated and miserable . French and English contemporary moralists viewed this fate as retribution for the murder of Becket ; even his favourite legitimate son , John , had rebelled although the constantly loyal illegitimate son Geoffrey remained with Henry until the end . 
 Following Richard 's coronation he quickly put the kingdom 's affairs in order and departed on a Crusade for the Middle East . Opinion of Richard has fluctuated . Although he was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners , he had rejected and humiliated the sister of the king of France , deposed the king of Cyprus and later sold the island , he made enemies on the Third Crusade such as Leopold V , Duke of Austria by showing disrespect to his banners as well as refusing to share the spoils of war , and was rumoured to have arranged the assassination of Conrad of Montferrat . His ruthlessness was demonstrated by his massacre of 2 @,@ 600 prisoners in Acre . He obtained victories during the Third Crusade , but failed to capture Jerusalem . According to Steven Runciman Richard was " a bad son , a bad husband and a bad king " . Jonathan Riley @-@ Smith described him as " vain ... devious and self @-@ centred " . In an alternate view John Gillingham points out that for centuries Richard was considered a model king . 
 Returning from the crusade with a small band of followers , Richard was captured by Leopold and was passed to Emperor Henry VI . Henry held Richard captive for eighteen months ( 1192 – 1194 ) for a ransom valued at 100 @,@ 000 marks . In Richard 's absence , Philip II overran large portions of Normandy and John acquired control of Richard 's English lands . After returning to England , Richard forgave John and re @-@ established his authority in England . He left again in 1194 and battled Philip for five years , attempting to regain the lands seized during his captivity . When close to complete victory , he was injured by an arrow during a siege and died ten days later . 
 = = = Decline and the loss of Anjou = = = 
 Richard 's failure to provide an heir caused a succession crisis and conflict between supporters of the claim of his nephew , Arthur , and John . Guillaume des Roches led the magnates of Anjou , Maine , and Touraine declaring for Arthur . Once again Philip II of France attempted to disturb the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland by supporting his vassal Arthur 's claim to the English crown . John won a significant victory while preventing Arthur 's forces from capturing his mother , seizing the entire rebel leadership at the Battle of Mirebeau . Foolishly John disregarded his allies ' opinions on the fate of the prisoners , many of them their neighbours and kinsmen . Instead ' he kept his prisoners so <unk> and in such evil distress that it seemed shameful and ugly to all those who were with him and who saw this cruelty ' according to the L 'Histoire de Guillaume le Marechal . As a result of John 's behaviour the powerful Thouars , Lusignan , and des Roches families rebelled and John lost control of Anjou , Maine , Touraine , and northern Poitou . His son , King Henry III , maintained the claim to the Angevin territories until December 1259 when he formally surrendered them and in return was granted Gascony as duke of Aquitaine and a vassal of the king of France . John ’ s reputation was further damaged by the rumour , described in the Margam annals , that while drunk he himself had murdered Arthur and if not true it is almost certain John ordered the killing . There are two contrasting schools of thought explaining the sudden collapse of John 's position . Sir James Holt suggests this was the inevitable result of superior French resources . John Gillingham identifies diplomatic and military mismanagement and points out that Richard managed to hold the Angevin territory with comparable finances . Nick Barratt has calculated that Angevin resources available for use in the war were 22 per cent less than those of Phillip , putting the Angevins at a disadvantage . 
 By 1214 John had re @-@ established his authority in England and planned what Gillingham has called a grand strategy to recapture Normandy and Anjou . The plan was that John would draw the French from Paris , while another army , under his nephew Otto IV , the Holy Roman Emperor , and his half @-@ brother William attacked from the north . The plan failed when John 's allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines . Otto retreated and was soon overthrown , William was captured by the French and John agreed to a five @-@ year truce . John 's defeat weakened his authority in England , and his barons forced him to agree to the Magna Carta , which limited royal power . Both sides failed to abide by the terms of the Magna Carta , leading to the First Barons ' War , in which rebellious barons invited Prince Louis , the husband of Blanche , Henry II 's granddaughter , to invade England . Louis did so but in October 1216 , before the conflict was conclusively ended , John died . The official website of the British Monarchy presents John 's death as the end of the Angevin dynasty and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty .

 All subsequent English monarchs were descendants of the Angevin line via John , who had five legitimate children with Isabella : 
 Henry III – king of England for most of the 13th @-@ century 
 Richard – king of the Romans in the Holy Roman Empire 
 Joan – queen consort of Alexander II of Scotland 
 Isabella – wife of the Holy Roman Emperor , Frederick II 
 Eleanor – wife of William Marshal 's son ( also named William ) , and later the English rebel Simon de Montfort . 
 John also had illegitimate children with several mistresses . These children probably included nine sons called Richard , Oliver , Henry , Osbert Gifford , Geoffrey , John FitzJohn or Courcy , Odo or Eudes FitzRoy , Ivo , Henry , Richard the constable of Wallingford Castle and three daughters called Joan , Matilda the abbess of Barking and Isabella la Blanche . Joan was the best known of these , since she married Prince Llewelyn the Great of Wales . 
 William Marshal , 1st Earl of Pembroke , was appointed regent for the nine @-@ year @-@ old King Henry on King John 's death . Thereafter , support for Louis declined , and he renounced his claims in the Treaty of Lambeth after Marshal 's victories at the battles of Lincoln and Sandwich in 1217 . The Marshal regime issued an amended Magna Carta as a basis for future government . Despite the Treaty of Lambeth , hostilities continued and Henry was forced to compromise with the newly crowned Louis VIII of France and Henry 's stepfather , Hugh X of Lusignan . They both overran much of Henry 's remaining continental lands , further eroding the Angevins ' power on the continent . In his political struggles , Henry perceived many similarities between himself and England 's patron saint , Edward the Confessor . Consequently , he named his first son Edward and built the existing magnificent shrine for the Confessor . 
 In early 1225 a great council approved a tax of £ 40 @,@ 000 to dispatch an army , which quickly retook Gascony . During an assembly feudal prerogatives of the king were challenged by the barons , bishops and magnates who demanded that the King reissue the Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest in exchange for support . Henry declared that the charters were issued of his own " spontaneous and free will " and confirmed them with the royal seal , giving the new Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest of 1225 much more authority than any previous versions . 
 Henry III had nine children : 
 Edward ( 1239 – 1307 ) 
 Margaret of England ( 1240 – 1275 ) . Her three children predeceased her husband , Alexander III of Scotland ; consequently , the crown of Scotland became vacant on the death of their only grandchild , Margaret , Maid of Norway in 1290 . 
 Beatrice , Countess of Richmond ( 1242 – 1275 ) . She initially married John de Montfort of Dreux , and later married John II , Duke of Brittany . 
 Edmund Crouchback ( 1245 – 1296 ) , who was granted the titles and estates of Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester and the earldom of Leicester after Henry defeated Montfort in the Second Barons ' War . Henry later granted Edmund the earldoms of Lancaster and Ferrers . From 1276 , through his wife , Edmund was Count of Champagne and Brie . Later Lancastrians would attempt to use Henry IV 's maternal descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne , spuriously claiming that Edmund was the eldest son of Henry III but had not become king due to deformity . Through his second marriage to Blanche , the widow of Henry I of Navarre , Edmund was at the centre of European aristocracy . Blanche 's daughter , Joan , was queen regnant of Navarre and queen consort of France through her marriage to Philip IV . Edmund 's son Thomas became the most powerful nobleman in England , adding to his inheritance the earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury through his marriage to the heiress of Henry de Lacy , 3rd Earl of Lincoln . 
 Four others who died as children : Richard ( 1247 – 1256 ) , John ( 1250 – 1256 ) , William ( c . 1251 / 1252 – 1256 ) , Katherine ( c . 1252 / 3 – 1257 ) and Henry ( no recorded dates ) . 
 Henry was bankrupted by his military expenditure and general extravagance . The pope offered Henry 's brother Richard the Kingdom of Sicily , but the military cost of displacing the incumbent Emperor Frederick was prohibitive . Matthew Paris wrote that Richard stated : " You might as well say , ' I make you a present of the moon — step up to the sky and take it down ' . " Instead , Henry purchased the kingdom for his son Edmund , which angered many powerful barons . The barons led by Henry 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Simon de Montfort forced him to agree to the Provisions of Oxford , under which his debts were paid in exchange for substantial reforms . In France , with the Treaty of Paris , Henry formally surrendered the territory of his Angevin ancestors to Louis IX of France , receiving in return the title duke of Aquitaine and the territory of Gascony as a vassal of the French king . 
 Disagreements between the barons and the king intensified . The barons , under Simon de Montfort , 6th Earl of Leicester , captured most of southeast England in the Second Barons ' War . At the Battle of Lewes in 1264 , Henry and Prince Edward were defeated and taken prisoner . De Montfort assembled the Great Parliament , recognized as the first Parliament because it was the first time the cities and boroughs had sent representatives . Edward escaped , raised an army and defeated and killed de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 . Savage retribution was inflicted upon the rebels , and authority restored to Henry . With the realm now peaceful , Edward left England to join Louis IX on the Ninth Crusade ; he was one of the last crusaders . Louis died before Edward 's arrival , but Edward decided to continue . The result was disappointing ; Edward 's small force only enabled him to capture Acre and launch a handful of raids . After surviving an assassination attempt , Edward left for Sicily later in the year , never to participate in a crusade again . When Henry III died , Edward acceded to the throne ; the barons swore allegiance to him even though he did not return for two years . 
 = = = Constitutional change and the reform of feudalism = = = 
 Edward married Eleanor of Castile , daughter of King Ferdinand of Castile , a great grandson of Henry II through his second daughter Eleanor in 1254 . Edward and Eleanor had sixteen children ; five daughters survived to adulthood , but only one son survived Edward : 
 Eleanor , Countess of Bar ( 1264 / 69 − 1298 ) 
 Three daughters ( Joan , Alice , and Juliana / Katherine ) and two sons ( John and Henry ) born between 1265 and 1271 . They died between 1265 and 1274 with little historical trace . 
 Joan , Countess of Gloucester ( 1272 – 1307 ) 
 Alphonso , Earl of Chester ( 1273 – 1284 ) 
 Margaret , Duchess of Brabant ( 1275 – 1333 ) 
 Mary of Woodstock ( 1278 – 1332 ) , who became a nun 
 Isabella ( 1279 – 1279 ) 
 Elizabeth , firstly Countess of Holland and on widowhood , secondly Countess of Hereford ( 1282 – 1316 ) . Among her eleven children were the earls of Hereford , Essex , and Northampton , and the countesses of Ormond and Devon . 
 King Edward II 
 Two other daughters ( Beatrice and Blanche ) , who died as children . 
 Following Eleanor 's death in 1290 , Edward married Margaret of France , daughter of Philip III of France , in 1299 . Edward and Margaret had two sons , who both lived to adulthood , and a daughter who died as a child : 
 Thomas ( 1300 – 1338 ) , whose daughter Margaret inherited his estates . Margaret 's grandson , Thomas Mowbray , was the first duke of Norfolk , but Henry IV exiled him and stripped him of his titles . 
 Edmund , Earl of Kent ( 1301 to 1330 ) . Edmund 's loyalty to his half @-@ brother , Edward II , resulted in his execution by order of the rebel Mortimer and his lover , Edward 's queen , Isabella . His daughter , Joan , inherited his estates and married her own cousin , Edward the Black Prince ; together , they had Richard , who later became the English king . 
 Eleanor ( 1306 – 1311 ) . 
 Evidence for Edward 's involvement in legal reform is hard to find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change . Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s . With the Statutes of Mortmain , Edward imposed his authority over the Church ; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church , asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges , promoted the uniform administration of justice , raised income and codified the legal system . His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294 , Edward needed funds to wage war in France . When Edward summoned a precedent @-@ setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance , he included lesser landowners and merchants . The resulting parliament included barons , clergy , knights , and burgesses for the first time . 
 = = = Expansion in Britain = = = 
 On his accession , Edward I sought to organise his realm , enforcing his claims to primacy in the British Isles . Llywelyn ap Gruffudd claimed to rule North Wales " entirely separate from " England but Edward viewed him to be " a rebel and disturber of the peace " . Edward 's determination , military experience and skilful naval manoeuvres ended what was to him rebellion . The invasion was executed by one of the largest armies ever assembled by an English king , comprising Anglo @-@ Norman cavalry and Welsh archers and laying the foundation for future victories in France . Llywelyn was driven into the mountains , later dying in battle . The Statute of Rhuddlan established England 's authority over Wales , and Edward 's son was proclaimed the first English Prince of Wales upon his birth . Edward spent vast sums on his two Welsh campaigns with a large portion of it spent on a network of castles . 
 Edward asserted that the king of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance , and intended to unite the two nations by marrying his son Edward to Margaret , the sole heir of King Alexander III . When Margaret died in 1290 , competition for the Scottish crown ensued . By invitation of Scottish magnates , Edward I resolved the dispute , ruling in favour of John Balliol , who duly swore loyalty to him and became king . Edward insisted that he was Scotland 's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol 's judgements , undermining Balliol 's authority . Balliol allied with France in 1295 ; Edward invaded Scotland the following year , deposing and exiling Balliol . 
 Edward was less successful in Gascony , which was overrun by the French . With his resources depleting , Edward was forced to reconfirm the Charters , including Magna Carta , to obtain the necessary funds . In 1303 the French king restored Gascony to Edward by signing the Treaty of Paris . Meanwhile , William Wallace rose in Balliol 's name and recovered most of Scotland . Wallace was defeated at the Battle of Falkirk , after which Robert the Bruce rebelled and was crowned king of Scotland . Edward died while travelling to Scotland for another campaign . 
 King Edward II 's coronation oath on his succession in 1307 was the first to reflect the king 's responsibility to maintain the laws that the community " shall have chosen " ( " aura eslu " ) . He was not unpopular initially but faced three challenges : discontent over the financing of wars ; his household spending ; and the role of his favourite Piers Gaveston . When Parliament decided that Gaveston should be exiled the king was left with no choice but to comply . Edward engineered Gaveston 's return , but was forced to agree to the appointment of Ordainers , led by his cousin Thomas , 2nd Earl of Lancaster , to reform the royal household with Piers Gaveston exiled again . When Gaveston returned again to England , he was abducted and executed after a mock trial . The ramifications of this drove Thomas and his adherents from power . Edward 's humiliating defeat by Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn , confirming Bruce 's position as an independent king of Scots , leading to Lancaster being appointed head of the king 's council . Edward finally repealed the Ordinances after defeating and executing Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 . 
 The French monarchy asserted its rights to encroach on Edward 's legal rights in Gascony . Resistance to one judgement in Saint @-@ Sardos resulted in Charles IV declaring the duchy forfeit . Charles 's sister , Queen Isabella , was sent to negotiate and agreed a treaty that required Edward to pay homage in France to Charles . Edward resigned Aquitaine and Ponthieu to his son Edward , who travelled to France to give homage in his stead . With the English heir in her power , Isabella refused to return to England unless Edward II dismissed his favourites , and she became the mistress of Roger Mortimer . The couple invaded England and , with Henry , 3rd Earl of Lancaster , captured the king . Edward II abdicated on condition that his son would inherit the throne rather than Mortimer . Although there is no historical record of the cause of death , he is popularly believed to have been murdered at Berkeley Castle by having a red @-@ hot poker thrust into his bowels . A coup by Edward III ended four years of control by Isabella and Mortimer . Mortimer was executed . Though removed from power , Isabella was treated well , and lived in luxury for the next 27 years . 
 = = = Conflict with the House of Valois = = = 
 In 1328 Charles IV of France died without a male heir . Queen Isabella made a claim to throne of France on behalf of her son Edward on the grounds that he was a matrilineal grandson of Philip IV of France . However , the precedents set by Philip V 's succession over his niece Joan II of Navarre and Charles IV 's succession over his nieces meant that the senior grandson of Philip III in the male line , Phillip of Valois , became king . Not yet in power , Edward paid homage to Phillip as Duke of Aquitaine . 
 In 1337 Phillip confiscated Aquitaine and Ponthieu from Edward alleging he was harbouring Phillip ’ s fugitive cousin and enemy , Robert of Artois . In response , Edward proclaimed himself king of France to encourage the Flemish to rise in open rebellion against the French king . The conflict , later known as the Hundred Years ' War , included a significant English naval victory at the Battle of Sluys , and a victory on land at Crécy , leaving Edward free to capture the important port of Calais . A subsequent victory against Scotland at the Battle of Neville 's Cross resulted in the capture of David II and reduced the threat from Scotland . The Black Death brought a halt to Edward 's campaigns by killing perhaps a third of his subjects . The only Plantagenet known to have died from the Black Death was Edward III 's daughter Joan in Bordeaux . 
 Edward , the Black Prince resumed the war with destructive chevauchées starting from Bordeaux . His army was caught by a much larger French force at Poitiers , but the ensuing battle was a decisive English victory resulting in the capture of John II of France . John agreed a treaty promising the French would pay a four million écus ransom . The subsequent Treaty of Brétigny was demonstrably popular in England , where it was both ratified in parliament and celebrated with great ceremony . To reach agreement , clauses were removed that would have had Edward renounce his claim to the French crown in return for territory in Aquitaine and the town of Calais . These were entered in another agreement to be effected only after the transfer of territory by November 1361 but both sides prevaricated over their commitments for the following nine years . Hostages from the Valois family were held in London while John returned to France to raise his ransom . Edward had restored the lands of the former Angevin Empire holding Normandy , Brittany , Anjou , Maine and the coastline from Flanders to Spain . When the hostages escaped back to France , John was horrified that his word had been broken and returned to England , where he eventually died . 
 Fighting in the Hundred Years ' War spilled from the French and Plantagenet lands into surrounding realms , including the dynastic conflict in Castile between Peter of Castile and Henry II of Castile . The Black Prince allied himself with Peter , defeating Henry at the Battle of Nájera . Edward and Peter fell out when Peter was unable to reimburse Edward ’ s military expenses leaving him bankrupt . The Plantagenets continued to interfere , and John of Gaunt , 1st Duke of Lancaster , the Black Prince 's brother , married Peter 's daughter Constance , claiming the Crown of Castile in her name . He invaded with an army of 5000 men . Fighting was inconclusive before Gaunt agreed a treaty with King Juan of Castile . Terms of the treaty included the marriage of John of Gaunt 's daughter Katherine to Juan 's son , Enrique . 
 Charles V of France maintained the terms of the treaty of Brétigny but encouraged others in Aquitaine to challenge the authority of the Plantagenets in Aquitaine . The prince , who had suffered a debilitating illness for nearly a decade which often restricted his movement to being carried in a litter , returned to England , where he soon died . John of Gaunt assumed leadership in France with limited success , and peace negotiations over several years were inconclusive .

 Philippa ( 1355 – 1378 / 81 ) — through Philippa , the House of York , by cognatic kinship , asserted that its claim to the throne was superior to the House of Lancaster 's . Philippa 's granddaughter and heir , Anne Mortimer , married Richard of Conisburgh , 3rd Earl of Cambridge , the Duke of York 's heir . The earls of Northumberland and Clifford , significant supporters of the Lancasters during the Wars of the Roses , were descendants of Philippa through her other daughter , Elizabeth Mortimer . 
 John of Gaunt ( 1340 – 1399 ) — married Blanche of Lancaster , the heiress to the duchy of Lancaster and a direct descendent of Henry III , and had six children with her : 
 Philippa ( 1360 – 1415 ) — married John I of Portugal . 
 John ( c . 1362 / 1364 ) — died as an infant . 
 Elizabeth ( 1364 – 1426 ) — married John Hastings , 3rd Earl of Pembroke , John Holland , 1st Duke of Exeter , and John Cornwall , 1st Baron Fanhope , respectively . 
 Edward of Lancaster ( 1365 – 1365 ) 
 John of Lancaster ( 1366 ) — died as an infant . 
 Henry ( 1367 – 1413 ) 
 Isabella of Lancaster ( b . 1368 ) — died as a child . 
 After Blanche 's death in 1369 , John married Constance of Castile , trying unsuccessfully to obtain the throne of Castile . The marriage produced two children : 
 Catherine of Lancaster ( 1372 – 1418 ) — married Henry III of Castile , with whom she was a great @-@ grandmother of Catherine of Aragon , first wife of Henry VIII of England . 
 John ( 1374 – 1375 ) 
 Constance died in 1394 , after which John married Katherine Swynford on 13 January 1396 . Their four children were born before they married . The pope legitimised them in 1396 , as did Richard II by charter , on the condition that their children could not ascend the throne : 
 John ( c . 1371 / 1372 – 1410 ) — grandfather of Margaret Beaufort , Henry VII 's mother . 
 Henry ( 1375 – 1447 ) 
 Thomas ( 1377 – 1427 ) 
 Joan ( 1379 – 1440 ) — Joan 's son , Richard Neville , 5th Earl of Salisbury , and her grandson , Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick , were leading supporters of the House of York . 
 Edmund ( 1341 – 1402 ) — founder of the House of York . He had three children with Isabella of Castile : 
 Edward ( 1373 – 1415 ) — killed at the Battle of Agincourt . 
 Constance ( 1374 – 1416 ) 
 Richard — ( 1375 – 1415 ) 
 Blanche ( 1342 ) — died as a child . 
 Mary of Waltham ( 1344 – 1362 ) — married John V , Duke of Brittany . No issue . 
 Margaret ( 1346 – 1361 ) — married John Hastings , 2nd Earl of Pembroke . No issue . 
 Joan ( b . 1351 ) 
 Thomas ( 1355 – 1397 ) — murdered or executed for treason by order of Richard II ; his daughter , Anne , married Edmund Stafford . 
 Edward ’ s long reign had forged a new national identity , reinforced by Middle English beginning to establish itself as the spoken and written language of government . As a result he is considered by many historians in cultural respects the first ‘ English ’ post @-@ conquest ruler . 
 = = = Demise of the main line = = = 
 The Black Prince 's ten @-@ year @-@ old son succeeded as Richard II of England on the death of his grandfather , nominally exercising all the powers of kingship supported by various councils . His government levied poll taxes to finance military campaigns and combined with the poor state of the economy resulted in the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 , followed by brutal reprisals against the rebels . 
 The king 's uncle Thomas of Woodstock , 1st Duke of Gloucester , Richard FitzAlan , 11th Earl of Arundel , and Thomas de Beauchamp , 12th Earl of Warwick , became known as the Lords Appellant when they sought to impeach five of the king 's favourites and restrain what was increasingly seen as tyrannical and capricious rule . Later they were joined by Henry Bolingbroke , the son and heir of John of Gaunt , and Thomas de Mowbray , 1st Duke of Norfolk . Initially , they were successful in establishing a commission to govern England for one year , but they were forced to rebel against Richard , defeating an army under Robert de Vere , Earl of Oxford , at the skirmish of Radcot Bridge . 
 Richard was reduced to a figurehead with little power . As a result of the Merciless Parliament , de Vere and Michael de la Pole , 1st Earl of Suffolk , who had fled abroad , were sentenced to death in their absence . Alexander Neville , Archbishop of York , had all his possessions confiscated . Several of Richard 's council were executed . On John of Gaunt 's return from Spain , Richard was able to re @-@ establish his power , having Gloucester murdered in captivity in Calais . Warwick was stripped of his title . Bolingbroke and Mowbray were exiled . 
 When John of Gaunt died in 1399 , Richard disinherited John 's son , Henry , who invaded England in response with a small force that quickly grew in numbers . Meeting little resistance , Henry deposed Richard to have himself crowned Henry IV of England . Richard died in captivity early the next year , probably murdered , bringing an end to the main Plantagenet line . None of Henry 's heirs were free from challenge on the grounds of not being the true heir of Richard II and that the Lancastrian dynasty had gained the throne by an act of usurpation . 
 = = House of Lancaster = = 
 Henry married his Plantagenet cousin Mary de Bohun , who was paternally descended from Edward I and maternally from Edmund Crouchback . They had seven children : 
 Edward ( b . 1382 ; died as a child ) — buried at Monmouth Castle , Monmouth . 
 Henry ( 1386 – 1422 ) — had one son : 
 Henry ( 1421 – 1471 ) — also had one son : 
 Edward ( 1453 – 1471 ) 
 Thomas ( 1387 – 1421 ) — killed at the Battle of Baugé . His marriage to Margaret Holland proved childless ; he had an illegitimate son named John , also known as the Bastard of Clarence . 
 John ( 1389 – 1435 ) — had two childless marriages : to Anne of Burgundy , daughter of John the Fearless , and Jacquetta of Luxembourg . John had an illegitimate son and daughter , named Richard and Mary , respectively . 
 Humphrey ( 1390 – 1447 ) — died under suspicious circumstances while imprisoned for treason against Henry VI ; his death may have been the result of a stroke . 
 Blanche ( 1392 – 1409 ) — married Louis III , Count Palatine of the Rhine , in 1402 . 
 Philippa ( 1394 – 1430 ) — married Eric of Pomerania , king of Denmark , Norway and Sweden , in 1406 . 
 Henry went to convoluted legal means to justify his succession . Many Lancastrians asserted that his mother had had legitimate rights through her descent from Edmund Crouchback , who it was claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England , set aside due to deformity . As the grandson of Lionel of Antwerp , 1st Duke of Clarence , Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March , was the heir presumptive to Richard II and Henry used multiple rationales stressing his Plantagenet descent , divine grace , powerful friends , and the Richard 's misgovernment . In fact Mortimer never showed interest in the throne . The later marriage of his granddaughter Anne to Richard 's son consolidated his descendants ' claim to the throne with that of the more junior House of York . Henry planned to resume war with France , but was plagued with financial problems , declining health and frequent rebellions . He defeated a Scottish invasion , a serious rebellion by Henry Percy , 1st Earl of Northumberland in the North and Owain Glyndŵr 's rebellion in Wales . Many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with unknown but chronic illnesses . 
 Henry IV died in 1413 . His son and successor , Henry V of England , aware that Charles VI of France 's mental illness had caused instability in France , invaded to assert the Plantagenet claims and won a near total victory over the French at the Battle of Agincourt . In subsequent years Henry recaptured much of Normandy and secured marriage to Catherine of Valois . The resulting Treaty of Troyes stated that Henry 's heirs would inherit the throne of France , but conflict continued with the Dauphin . When Henry died in 1422 , his nine @-@ month @-@ old son succeeded him as Henry VI of England . During the minority of Henry VI the war caused political division among his Plantagenet uncles , Bedford , Humphrey of Lancaster , 1st Duke of Gloucester , and Cardinal Beaufort . Humphrey 's wife was accused of treasonable necromancy after two astrologers in her employ unwisely , if honestly , predicted a serious illness would endanger Henry VI 's life , and Humphrey was later arrested and died in prison . 
 <unk> stemming from the Black Death led to increased wages , static food costs and a resulting improvement in the standard of living for the peasantry . However , under Henry misgovernment and harvest failures depressed the English economy to a pitiful state known as the Great Slump . The economy was in ruins by 1450 , a consequence of the loss of France , piracy in the channel and poor trading relations with the Hanseatic League . The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country , spreading south in the 1440s , with the economy not recovering until the 1480s . It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock , which drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy . Certain groups were particularly badly affected : cloth exports fell by 35 per cent in just four years at the end of the 1440s , collapsing by up to 90 per cent in some parts of the South @-@ West . The Crown 's debts reached £ 372 @,@ 000 , Henry 's deficit was £ 20 @,@ 000 per annum , and tax revenues were half those of his father . 
 = = House of York = = 
 Edward III made his fourth son Edmund the first duke of York in 1362 . Edmund was married to Isabella , a daughter of King Peter of Castile and María de Padilla and the sister of Constance of Castile , who was the second wife of Edmund 's brother John of Gaunt . Both of Edmund 's sons were killed in 1415 . Richard became involved in the Southampton Plot , a conspiracy to depose Henry V in favour of Richard 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Edmund Mortimer . When Mortimer revealed the plot to the king , Richard was executed for treason . Richard 's childless older brother Edward was killed at the Battle of Agincourt later the same year . Constance of York was Edmund 's only daughter and was an ancestor of Queen Anne Neville . The increasingly interwoven Plantagenet relationships were demonstrated by Edmund 's second marriage to Joan Holland . Her sister Alianore Holland was mother to Richard 's wife , Anne Mortimer . Margaret Holland , another of Joan 's sisters , married John of Gaunt 's son . She later married Thomas of Lancaster , John of Gaunt 's grandson by King Henry IV . A third sister , Eleanor Holland , was mother @-@ in @-@ law to Richard Neville , 5th Earl of Salisbury — John 's grandson by his daughter Joan Beaufort , Countess of Westmorland . These sisters were all granddaughters of Joan of Kent , the mother of Richard II , and therefore Plantagenet descendants of Edward I. 
 Edmund 's son Richard was married to Anne Mortimer , the daughter of Roger Mortimer , 4th Earl of March and Eleanor Holland and great @-@ granddaughter of Edward III 's second surviving son Lionel . Anne died giving birth to their only son in September 1411 . Richard 's execution four years later left two orphans : Isabel , who married into the Bourchier family , and a son who was also called Richard . Although his earldom was forfeited , Richard ( the father ) was not attainted , and the four @-@ year @-@ old orphan Richard was his heir . Within months of his father 's death , Richard 's childless uncle , Edward Duke of York , was killed at Agincourt . Richard was allowed to inherit the title of Duke of York in 1426 . In 1432 he acquired the earldoms of March and Ulster on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March , who had died campaigning with Henry V in France , and the earldom of Cambridge which had belonged to his father . Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail , and by cognatic primogeniture arguably a superior claim . He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448 . Having inherited the March and Ulster titles , he became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England , second only to the king himself . Richard married Cecily Neville , a granddaughter of John of Gaunt , and had thirteen or possibly fifteen children : 
 Joan ( b . 1438 ; died as a child ) 
 Anne of York ( 1439 – 1476 ) — Mitochondrial DNA taken from a descendant of her second daughter , Anne St Leger , Baroness de Ros , was used in the identification of the remains of Richard III , which were found in 2012 . 
 Henry ( b . 1441 ; died as a child ) 
 Edward ( 1442 – 1483 ) 
 Edmund ( 1443 – 1460 ) 
 Elizabeth ( 1444 – 1503 ) — married John de la Pole , 2nd Duke of Suffolk ; she was the mother of several claimants to the throne . 
 Margaret ( 1446 – 1503 ) — married Charles the Bold , Duke of Burgundy . 
 William ( b . 1447 ; died as a child ) 
 John ( b . 1448 ; died as a child ) 
 George ( 1449 – 1478 ) 
 Thomas ( b . 1450 / 51 ; died as a child ) 
 Richard ( 1452 – 1485 ) 
 Ursula ( b . 1455 ; died as a child ) 
 In her will , Cecily stated that Katherine and Humphrey were her children , but they may have been her grandchildren through de la Pole . 
 When Henry VI had a mental breakdown , Richard was named regent , but the birth of a male heir resolved the question of succession . When Henry 's sanity returned , the court party reasserted its authority , but Richard of York and the Nevilles defeated them at a skirmish called the First Battle of St Albans . The ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted . York and the Nevilles fled abroad , but the Nevilles returned to win the Battle of Northampton , where they captured Henry . When Richard of York joined them he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne and forcing through the Act of Accord , which stated that Henry would remain as king for his lifetime , but would be succeeded by York . Margaret found this disregard for her son 's claims unacceptable , and so the conflict continued . York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his head set on display at Micklegate Bar along with those of Edmund , Earl of Rutland , and Richard Neville , Earl of Salisbury , who had been captured and beheaded . The Scottish queen Mary of Guelders provided Margaret with support but London welcomed York 's son Edward , Earl of March and Parliament confirmed that Edward should be made king . He was crowned after consolidating his position with victory at the Battle of Towton . 
 Edward 's preferment of the former Lancastrian @-@ supporting Woodville family , following his marriage to Elizabeth Woodville , led Warwick and Clarence to help Margaret depose Edward and return Henry to the throne . Edward and Richard , Duke of Gloucester , fled , but on their return , Clarence switched sides at the Battle of Barnet , leading to the death of the Neville brothers . The subsequent Battle of Tewkesbury brought the demise of the last of the male line of the Beauforts . The battlefield execution of Edward of Westminster , Prince of Wales , and the later probable murder of Henry VI extinguished the House of Lancaster . 
 By the mid @-@ 1470s , the victorious House of York looked safely established , with seven living male princes : Edward IV and his two sons , his brother George and George 's son , his brother Richard and Richard 's son . Edward and Elizabeth Woodville themselves had ten children , seven of whom survived him :
