 When the United States took over the Philippine Islands from the Spanish in 1898 after the Spanish – American War , President William McKinley began <unk> the former Spanish colony . In 1900 he appointed William Howard Taft to head the Philippine Commission to evaluate the needs of the new territory . Taft , who later became the Philippines ' first civilian Governor @-@ General , decided that Manila , the capital , should be a planned town . He hired as his architect and city planner Daniel Hudson Burnham , who had built Union Station and the Postal Square Building in Washington . In Manila , Burnham had in mind a long wide , tree @-@ lined boulevard along the bay , beginning at a park area dominated by a magnificent hotel . To execute Burnham 's plans , Taft hired William E. Parsons , a New York architect , who envisioned an impressive , comfortable hotel along the lines of a California mission but grander . The original design was an H @-@ shaped plan that focused on well @-@ ventilated rooms on two wings , providing grand vistas of the harbor , the Luneta , and Intramuros . The top floor was , in fact , a large viewing deck that was used for various functions , including watching the American navy steam into the harbor .

 During the start of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935 , President Manuel Quezon hired Paris @-@ trained Filipino architect Andres Luna de San Pedro , son of painter Juan Luna , to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel . It was done under the supervision of the renowned engineering firm Pedro <unk> and Company . The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth . Luna converted the hotel 's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air @-@ conditioned annex - and designed some key public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion , then the biggest function room of the hotel .

 The majority of John Smith 's sales are of the nitrogenated Extra Smooth product , although a cask conditioned variant is available nationally . A stronger variant called Magnet is also available in the North East of England . John Smith 's Cask and Magnet are produced under licence by Cameron 's in Hartlepool . 
 John Smith acquired the Backhouse & Hartley brewery in 1852 . Following a series of acquisitions in the post @-@ World War II period , the company became one of the largest regional brewers in the country , operating over 1 @,@ 800 licensed premises . The company was taken over by Courage in 1970 who extended distribution of the brewery 's products into the South of England .

 John Smith 's Extra Smooth and Original are produced at the Tadcaster brewery , as well as a range of Heineken products including <unk> 1664 and Newcastle Brown Ale . With a 3 @.@ 8 million <unk> capacity , the brewery is one of the largest in the country . 
 John Smith 's became well known for a series of highly successful " No Nonsense " -themed television advertising campaigns , featuring the dour Yorkshireman character " Arkwright " during the 1970s and 1980s ( shown only in the South of England ) , followed by the comedians Jack Dee during the 1990s and Peter Kay since 2002 .

 Stephen Hartley began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758 . In 1845 Jane Hartley mortgaged the brewery to David Backhouse and John Hartley . In 1847 , Samuel Smith of Leeds arranged for his son John to enter the business . Jane Hartley died in 1852 , and John Smith acquired the business , enlisting his brother William to help him . The timing was to prove fortuitous ; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice , and Tadcaster 's hard water proved to be well @-@ suited for brewing the new style . The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s , together with the arrival of the railways , realised greater opportunities for brewers , and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise . 
 The operations became sizeable during the last quarter of the nineteenth century . Smith died in 1879 , leaving an estate valued at under £ 45 @,@ 000 ( around £ 4 @.@ 1 million in 2016 adjusted for inflation ) , and his assets were jointly inherited by his two brothers , William and Samuel Smith ( a tanner ) . William purchased Samuel 's share of his brother 's personal estate , and built a modern brewery in 1883 – 4 at the cost of £ 130 @,@ 000 ( £ 9 @.@ 7 million in 2013 ) . By this time the company had a staff of over 100 . William Smith died in 1886 , and the firm was inherited in partnership by his two nephews , Henry Herbert ( 1863 – 1911 ) and Frank Riley , henceforth known as Riley @-@ Smith under the terms of his will . 
 The firm expanded throughout the 1880s by creating an agency network , establishing sixteen offices in nearby settlements , and offering free trade discounts on their beer of 20 percent or higher . By 1889 , the brewery was producing 150 @,@ 000 barrels annually . In 1889 , the company 's first scientifically @-@ trained head brewer was appointed , Percy Clinch , son of Charles Clinch of the Eagle Brewery in Witney . In 1892 , the partnership became a limited company called John Smith 's Tadcaster Brewery Company Limited , with Henry Herbert Riley @-@ Smith as chairman . In 1899 the company acquired Simpson & Co of Market Weighton , with 51 public houses , and converted the brewery into a maltings . 
 By the turn of the century the brewery was considered to be one of the best @-@ run in Britain , " a byword for first @-@ class management " . In 1907 , John Marples of Sheffield , the wines and spirits distributor , was acquired . In 1907 , the company began to bottle its own beer , in Tadcaster . In 1912 , the company owned over 250 horses , 41 of which saw service during the First World War . Artificially carbonated beer was first bottled in 1923 . Paired horse drays were phased out by 1929 . During and for some time after the World Wars , the Government raised the duty on beer , and forced brewers to lower their beer strength . During this period , substitutes for malted barley had to be used for brewing , including flaked barley , oats and rye . 
 The last of the company 's dray horses was retired in 1947 . Horses had delivered beer to all the areas surrounding the brewery , as far afield as <unk> Bridge . From 1948 the company exported beer to Belgium where it was bottled and distributed by <unk> brewery . In 1950 there was a general strike in Belgium , and John Smith 's hired two Handley Page Halifax heavy bomber aircraft to carry 7 ton loads twice @-@ daily of their beers into the country in order to ensure supply . In 1953 the firm became a public company , with fixed assets of around £ 5 million , 1 @,@ 000 licensed premises and around 1 @,@ 100 employees . In 1958 , Whitworth , Son & Nephew of <unk> @-@ upon @-@ Dearne was acquired with 165 licensed houses , and the brewery was immediately closed down . In 1959 the company began to bottle imported <unk> lager at Tadcaster , in response to growing customer demand . In 1961 the company also began to bottle Carlsberg lager . By 1960 the company had an estate of 909 public houses . 
 In 1961 , John Smith 's acquired the Barnsley Brewery Company , adding 250 licensed properties to their growing estate . In 1962 the company acquired Warwicks & Richardsons of Newark @-@ on @-@ Trent . Whilst some product rationalisation took place , popular lines such as Warwicks ' Milk Maid Stout were retained . John Smith 's closed down all the breweries it acquired , apart from Barnsley , where it invested in the brewery , and added production of John Smith beers to the site , as well as increasing the distribution of Barnsley Bitter . As a result of acquisitions , by 1967 John Smith 's was the third largest regional brewer in the country after Courage and Scottish & Newcastle , with fixed assets of £ 30 million . Acquisitions diluted the Riley @-@ Smith family stake in the company to around 10 percent . 
 = = = 1970 @-@ present : Courage takeover and the growth of John Smith 's Bitter = = = 
 In October 1970 , Courage purchased John Smith 's in a friendly takeover which valued the company at £ 40 million ( £ 557 @,@ 992 @,@ 520 in 2016 adjusted for inflation ) . By this time John Smith 's owned around 1 @,@ 800 licensed premises throughout the north of England , and as far south as Lincolnshire , Nottinghamshire and parts of Cambridgeshire and Shropshire . The merged company held assets worth £ 137 million . By combining Courage 's strength in the South of England , and John Smith 's in the North , a national brewing company was created . John Smith 's bottled Magnet Pale Ale was selected for nationwide distribution across the group , and the takeover facilitated the wider distribution of Courage brands such as Tavern Keg . 
 The Tadcaster brewery was substantially redeveloped and expanded throughout 1974 . Courage closed down the Barnsley brewery in 1976 with the loss of 200 jobs , and the 200 Barnsley public houses were supplied from Tadcaster . Courage argued that modernization of the Barnsley site would have required " massive " investment . It was reported in The Times that landlords were generally indifferent to the change , as the taste profiles of John Smith 's bitter and Barnsley bitter were similar . 
 After successful test marketing from 1974 , John Smith 's Bitter was distributed in the South of England from 1979 onwards , accompanied by an extensive marketing budget . As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior , the beer was sold there under the name John Smith 's Yorkshire Bitter . Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing to the increase in free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer . By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom . 
 In 1982 , the John Smith 's brands included Yorkshire Bitter , Magnet Pale Ale , Export Pale , Sweet Stout , Double Brown and Magnet Old . In December 1983 , John Smith 's Cask ( 3 @.@ 8 % ABV ) was re @-@ introduced , seven years after it had been phased out . By June 1985 , John Smith 's produced 1 @.@ 7 million hectolitres of beer annually . In November that year , a new brewhouse was opened , at the cost of £ 5 million . Production of Foster 's lager began in 1987 . 
 In 1993 , John Smith 's Extra Smooth was launched in cans . It was introduced in kegs in February 1995 , and distributed to 10 @,@ 000 pubs and venues . It is a nitrogenated version of the pasteurised beer , which was renamed to John Smith 's Original in order to differentiate the two products . 
 In 2005 , Scottish & Newcastle claimed that John Smith 's was available in 40 @,@ 000 outlets across the United Kingdom . In 2007 , Scottish & Newcastle moved production of John Smith 's Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington , and production of John Smith 's Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool . In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery . In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned John Smith 's Magnet , although it remains available in kegs . By 2011 , production of John Smith 's Cask had moved to Cameron 's . As of 2012 , John Smith 's is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world . From February 2013 , John Smith 's Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 6 % ABV . According to Heineken , the decision was taken in order to bring the product in line with the strength of its major competitors such as Tetley , Boddingtons and Worthington .

 Slate Yorkshire Square brewing vessels were used at the brewery from 1913 until 1975 . Stainless steel Yorkshire Squares were in use by at least 1953 , but were removed in the 1980s , and the brewery now uses conical tanks . By 1953 , the brewery site occupied 20 acres . 
 Wooden casks were still in use in the 1960s . The cask beer line was removed in 1976 , but restored in 1984 . In 1984 the original brewhouse was converted into a brewery museum . In November 1985 a new £ 5 million brewhouse opened . Production of Foster 's Lager began in 1987 . By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1 @.@ 2 million barrels per annum . Scottish & Newcastle used the John Smith 's Brewery to brew many of its ale brands . In 2004 , a new £ 24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004 , described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe .

 = 1977 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1977 Atlantic hurricane season had the fewest tropical storms since the 1965 season . The season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The first tropical depression of the season developed on June 13 , 12 days after the start of the season , in the western Caribbean Sea . After a succession of three other tropical depressions , the first tropical storm of the season , Hurricane Anita , finally became a named storm on August 29 – the latest date since the satellite era began in the 1960s . Anita struck Mexico as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale , bringing strong winds and heavy rainfall . At least 25 @,@ 000 people were left homeless and 11 fatalities were reported . 
 In addition to Anita , another notable tropical cyclone of this season was Hurricane Babe . The storm caused coastal flooding in southeastern Louisiana , resulting in $ 10 million ( 1977 USD ) in damage . After moving inland , it spawned 14 tornadoes throughout Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina . In addition to Anita and Babe , five other tropical cyclones – hurricanes Clara , Dorothy , and Evelyn , as well as Tropical Storm Frieda and Tropical Depression Nine – left only minor impacts on land . Overall , the tropical cyclones of the season collectively caused 11 fatalities and at least $ 13 million in damage , excluding the remnants of Tropical Depression Nine , which led to 53 deaths and $ 203 million in losses due to flooding in the Southeastern United States , New Jersey , and New York . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 1977 . Activity began several days later with the formation of a tropical depression on June 13 . Although 16 tropical depressions formed , it was a below average season because only 6 of them strengthened into tropical storms . In terms of named storms , this was the least active season since 1965 . Five of these attained hurricane status . In addition , one tropical cyclone eventually attained major hurricane status , which is Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The inactivity was attributed to a El Niño that began developing in August . Three hurricanes and one tropical storm made landfall during the season , causing 11 deaths and $ 13 million in damage . The last storm of the season , Tropical Depression Thirteen , dissipated on November 7 , over three weeks before the official end of the season on November 30 . 
 Tropical cyclogenesis in the 1977 Atlantic hurricane season began with the development of a tropical depression on June 13 . Activity briefly halted , until two other tropical depression developed in the second half of July . A fourth tropical depression formed in early August . Later that month , Hurricane Anita developed on August 29 . As September is the climatological peak of hurricane season , it was the most active month . Five tropical cyclones developed , including two tropical depressions , and hurricanes Babe , Clara , and Dorothy . There were also five tropical cyclone in October – three tropical depressions , Hurricane Evelyn , and Tropical Storm Frieda . The final tropical cyclone of the season , Tropical Depression Nine , developed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3 and dissipated by November 7 . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 25 , which was the lowest ACE value since 1946 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Subtropical storms are not included , therefore , the subtropical stage of Babe is omitted from the total ACE value .

 = = = Hurricane Anita = = = 
 A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on August 29 , while located about 230 miles ( 370 km ) south @-@ southwest of New Orleans , Louisiana . The depression moved west @-@ southwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita early on August 30 . Later that day , the storm had intensified into a hurricane . Although intensification briefly slowed , rapid deepening occurred from September 1 to the following day , when Anita peaked as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . The storm weakened slightly to a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall near Soto la Marina , Tamaulipas . It rapidly weakened inland , decreasing to tropical depression intensity early on September 3 . However , Anita remained intact across Mexico and reached the eastern Pacific Ocean as a depression . 
 Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone , the precursor to Anita dropped light rainfall in Florida . Gusty winds and storm surge effected Louisiana . At Grand Isle , storm tides 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) above normal resulted in hundreds of families being asked to evacuate . Numerous coastal highways in Texas , including portions of State Highway 87 , were closed due to above normal tides . Precipitation reached 4 @.@ 97 inches ( 126 mm ) in Rio Grande City . In Mexico , the hurricane caused strong winds and moderate rainfall . The winds caused extensive damage to villages in northeastern Mexico , with about 25 @,@ 000 people left homeless . The roofs of most buildings were destroyed near the location of Anita 's landfall . The highest amount of precipitation observed during the storm was 15 @.@ 2 inches ( 390 mm ) at Soto la Marina , Tamaulipas . Flooding and mudslides killed eleven people in the state . Overall damage is unknown . 
 = = = Hurricane Babe = = = 
 The interaction of a tropical wave and a cold upper low pressure area developed into a subtropical depression in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September 3 . It strengthened while gradually acquiring tropical characteristics and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Babe late on September 4 . The storm curved north @-@ northeastward and by early on the following day , it was upgraded to a hurricane . Around that time , Babe peaked with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Early on September 5 , Babe made landfall near Cocodrie , Louisiana at the same intensity . Later that day , it weakened to a tropical storm and then a tropical depression on September 6 . However , Babe continued to move northeastward and then east @-@ northeastward across the Southeastern United States until dissipating early on September 9 . 
 Babe produced light to moderate rainfall across much of the Southern United States . In Louisiana , precipitation peaked at 10 @.@ 99 inches ( 279 mm ) near Lafayette . Flooding damage was primarily to crops , mainly sugar cane . Six tornadoes were spawned in Louisiana , including one near Hammond that severely damage a country store and knocked six wood @-@ frame homes off their foundations . Damage from this tornado alone reached $ 2 @.@ 5 million . In other states , Babe brought flash flooding along its path due to rainfall exceeding 7 inches ( 180 mm ) in Mississippi , northwestern Georgia , and western North Carolina . Overall , Babe caused about $ 13 million in damage , but no deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Clara = = = 
 A convective cloud mass with a spiral band of gale @-@ force winds , associated with the development of Hurricane Babe , moved across the Southeastern United States in early September . The system developed a circulation by late on September 4 , while tracking across southeastern Georgia . After a slight drop in barometric pressure and an increase in wind speeds , a tropical depression formed inland near Charleston , South Carolina at 1200 UTC on September 5 . The depression initially drifted east @-@ northeastward and soon moved offshore . After passing south of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina on September 6 , it began to organize while accelerating just north of due east . At 0000 UTC on September 8 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Clara . The storm quickly strengthened , becoming a hurricane only 12 hours later . Strong wind shear caused Clara to weaken back to a tropical storm on September 9 . Thereafter , the storm executed a cyclonic loop near Bermuda . By late on September 10 , Clara accelerated northeastward and became extratropical at 1200 UTC on September 11 . 
 In its early stages , the storm dropped light rainfall in the Southeastern United States , peaking at 3 @.@ 53 inches ( 90 mm ) in Beaufort , South Carolina . Additionally , Clara produced 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) of precipitation in Bermuda . The remnants reached Canada and produced winds of 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) in Antigonish , Nova Scotia , which knocked over campers , uprooted trees , damaged barns , and caused power outages in the area . 
 = = = Hurricane Dorothy = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on September 15 . The system tracked westward at 17 to 23 mph ( 27 to 37 km / h ) and convection began organizing five days later . On September 21 , the wave crossed the Windward Islands , bringing wind gusts of 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) to Guadeloupe and Martinique and rainfall of 5 to 8 inches ( 130 to 200 mm ) on several islands . Although it was a strong tropical wave , the system weakened significantly while crossing Hispaniola on September 23 . Tracking steadily northward , it developed into a tropical depression northeast of the Bahamas on September 26 . A reconnaissance aircraft indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Dorothy at 1200 UTC on September 27 . 
 Shortly after becoming a tropical storm , Dorothy passed just south of Bermuda , though no damage was reported on the island . The storm quickly strengthened while tracking northeastward and strengthened into a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 28 . By early on September 29 , Dorothy attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( 29 inHg ) . Later that day , Dorothy transitioned into an extratropical storm while located south of Cape Race , Newfoundland . On September 30 , the extratropical remnants of Dorothy were absorbed by a frontal low pressure system located in the northern Atlantic Ocean . 
 = = = Hurricane Evelyn = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 3 . The system tracked westward at an abnormally low altitude of 6 ° N. However , because the Azores high pressure was abnormally weak , the system quickly curved northwestward . After a significant increase in convection , a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on October 13 , while located 400 miles ( 640 km ) south of Bermuda . A ship later reported gale force winds , prompting an upgrade of the depression to Tropical Storm Evelyn on October 14 . Early on the following day , a reconnaissance flight recorded winds of 83 mph ( 134 km / h ) , indicating that Evelyn became a hurricane . Later on October 15 , accelerated to the north @-@ northeast and made landfall on Cape Breton Island , Nova Scotia with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at 1200 UTC . Shortly after entering the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , Evelyn merged with a cold front at 1800 UTC on October 15 , near the tip of southeastern Newfoundland . 
 Impact on Bermuda was limited to light winds and a small amount of rainfall – 2 @.@ 60 inches ( 66 mm ) . On Sable Island , Evelyn produced tropical storm force winds , reaching 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) . In both Nova Scotia and Newfoundland , the storm dropped light rainfall , rarely exceeding 1 inch ( 25 mm ) . However , in Newfoundland , some areas experienced tropical storm force winds , mainly between Stephenville and St. John 's . However , this may have been in combination with the cold front that Evelyn merged with . In addition , a ship near the southwestern tip of Newfoundland reported sustained winds of 78 mph ( 126 km / h ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Frieda = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa on October 4 . The wave tracked uneventfully westward for about 10 days . On October 12 , the remnants of a cold front reached the northwestern Caribbean Sea . The wave began interacting with it and another cold front that entered the region by October 16 . Later that day , a reconnaissance aircraft reported a surface circulation near Swan Island , Honduras . Thus , a tropical depression developed at 1800 UTC on October 16 . The depression moved slowly westward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frieda on October 17 , while passing south of Swan Island . 
 Frieda continued to intensify until peaking with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1 @,@ 005 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) early on October 18 . Later that day , Frieda weakened and fell to tropical depression intensity . At 0000 UTC on October 19 , the storm made landfall near Belize City , Belize as a weak tropical depression . Frieda promptly dissipated . Belize City reported only minimal rainfall and light winds . Around that time , the storm passed south of Swan Island , where it produced 4 @.@ 46 inches ( 113 mm ) in a 30 ‑ hour period . On Grand Cayman , 5 @.@ 42 inches ( 138 mm ) of precipitation fell in 36 hours . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Nine = = = 
 A tropical depression formed between the Greater Antilles and Bermuda on November 3 . Initially , the depression moved northeastward , though on November 4 , a building high pressure area forced it to track north of due west . Eventually , an upper @-@ level low situated over the Southern United States caused the depression to re @-@ curve north @-@ northwestward . Late on November 7 , the depression made landfall near Cape Lookout , North Carolina . By early on the following day , the depression degenerated into a low pressure area while located over eastern Virginia . The remnants continued northeastward across the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England , before being absorbed by an extratropical cyclone while offshore of Maine on November 11 . 
 Moisture from Tropical Depression Nine and a low pressure area that tracked across the Southeastern United States resulted in heavy rainfall over western North Carolina and western Virginia , with up to 11 @.@ 63 inches ( 295 mm ) at Idlewild in the former . In North Carolina , flooding destroyed 384 homes , 382 miles ( 615 km ) of highways , and 12 dams . Flooding was considered the worst in Yancey County , where nearly every bridge was washed out . Sixteen counties in the western portions of the state were declared disaster areas . The depression also produced 5 to 9 inches ( 130 to 230 mm ) of rainfall in northern Georgia . Eighteen bridges were destroyed and twenty @-@ seven others were damaged . In Virginia , 100 homes were destroyed by flooding , with about the same amount suffering major damage . Similar impact was reported in Tennessee . Strong winds and storm tides in New Jersey caused extensive damage . Overall , the flooding event caused 53 deaths , 39 in Georgia , 13 in North Carolina , and 1 in Tennessee . Damage totaled $ 203 million , $ 100 million of which was incurred in New Jersey alone .

 In addition to the six named storm and Tropical Depression Nine , a total of nine other tropical depressions developed during the season . Later in June , a tropical depression formed in the west @-@ central Gulf of Mexico on June 13 . It headed north @-@ northwestward and made landfall in Texas by the following day . The system rapidly dissipated after moving inland . The third tropical depression of the season developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 17 . After tracking northward , the depression struck near Mobile , Alabama on July 18 . By the following day , it dissipated in central Mississippi . In late July , another depression developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on July 25 . No further strengthening occurred and by the following day , it dissipated north of the Yucatán Peninsula . 
 A tropical depression developed near the west coast of Africa on August 1 . The system tracked westward for three days without intensifying and dissipated on August 4 . The next tropical depression formed well west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde on September 17 . After remaining disorganized , it dissipated to the east @-@ southeast of the Lesser Antilles about three days later . Tropical Depression Four developed in the Bay of Campeche on September 22 . However , the depression remained weak and made landfall near Tampico , Tamaulipas at around 1000 UTC on September 23 . Later that day , it dissipated while barely inland . 
 By October 1 , another tropical depression formed east of the Lesser Antilles . It headed west @-@ northwestward and dissipated on October 3 , before reaching the Windward Islands . Tropical Depression Six developed in the central Atlantic Ocean on October 2 . It briefly headed east @-@ southeastward , before curving northwestward on October 4 . The system dissipated later that day . Another tropical depression developed in the Gulf of Mexico east of the Texas and Mexico border on October 24 . It tracked northeastward without intensification and made landfall in southeast Louisiana on October 25 , while still a tropical depression . The system quickly weakened and dissipated over southern Mississippi later that day .

His creative contribution to music has received praise from musicians and critics . He is noted for his dynamic drumming style and his energetic live performances . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Shannon Leto was born in Bossier City , Louisiana , to Constance Leto ( née <unk> ) . His mother has Cajun ancestry . " Leto " is a stepfather 's surname . His parents divorced when he was a child , and he and his younger brother Jared lived with their mother and their maternal grandparents William Lee <unk> and Ruby Russell . His father remarried and committed suicide when Shannon was ten . Leto moved frequently with his family from his native Louisiana to different cities around the country . He has two younger half @-@ brothers from his father 's second marriage . 
 Constance joined the hippie movement and encouraged her sons to get involved in the arts . Leto became interested in percussions from the moment he and his brother started playing music together at early age , and his models were artists of many different mediums . " I come from a pretty artistic family , " he explained , " There were canvases and paint everywhere , instruments , and all sorts of stuff . It just kind of made sense . I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age , so I just kind of flowed into it . It was just a natural progression . " He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself , developing his own style . 
 Leto has described his adolescence as a troubled time , in which he used drugs and dropped out of school . He said , " I was in a mess , I felt I didn 't belong anywhere " , calling himself as an " outsider " who hated conformity and rules , and " took any opportunity to break them . " Ultimately , Jared helped him recover from drugs . 
 = = Music career = = 
 Leto formed the rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars in 1998 in Los Angeles , California with his brother Jared . Their debut album had been in the works for a couple of years and was recorded in rural Wyoming during 2001 and early 2002 . Their work led to a number of record labels being interested in signing Thirty Seconds to Mars , which eventually signed to Immortal Records . The band worked with producers Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue on their debut album 30 Seconds to Mars , which was released on August 27 , 2002 in the United States through Immortal and Virgin . It reached number 107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers . Upon its release , 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews ; music critic Megan O 'Toole felt that the band has " managed to carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm . " The album was a slow @-@ burning success , and eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011 . 
 It took two years to record their next release A Beautiful Lie , with the band traveling to four different continents to accommodate Jared Leto 's acting career . A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30 , 2005 in the United States . It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries , with a sales total of over four million . The band heavily toured in support of the album and played at several major festivals , including Roskilde , Pinkpop , Rock am Ring , and Download . 
 In August 2008 , during the recording process of the band 's third studio album , Thirty Seconds to Mars attempted to sign with a new label , prompting EMI ( the parent label of Virgin ) , to file a $ 30 million breach of contract lawsuit . After nearly a year of legal battles , the band announced on April 28 , 2009 , that the suit had been settled following a defence based on the De Havilland Law . Thirty Seconds to Mars then signed a new contract with EMI and released their third album This Is War in December 2009 to critical acclaim . 
 This Is War reached the top ten of several national album charts and earned numerous music awards . The band began their Into the Wild Tour in February 2010 and was among the hardest @-@ working touring artists of the year . In December 2011 , they entered the Guinness World Records for most live shows during a single album cycle , with 300 shows . In September 2012 , Leto released a remixed version of " Night of the Hunter " , a track featured on This Is War . The musician explained that he wanted to " reinvent " the song , to " shed a different light on it by bringing a dance element to it . " 
 Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth album , Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams , in May 2013 through Universal . It received generally positive reviews and reached the top ten in more than fifteen countries , including the United Kingdom and the United States . The band promoted the album by embarking on their Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams Tour and the Carnivores Tour , co @-@ headlining with Linkin Park . In April 2014 , Thirty Seconds to Mars announced that they have parted from Virgin Records after tumultuous years with the label . 
 = = Artistry = = 
 Leto is known for his energetic live performances and his ability to blend traditional and experimental drum techniques . During the production of Thirty Seconds to Mars first studio album , he played almost exclusively electronic drums and drew influence from bands such as Pink Floyd , The Cure , Led Zeppelin , and The Who , which he considers " mostly big <unk> bands ; bands that had depth ; bands that were dynamic . " Bob Ezrin , producer of the album , felt that Leto is " one of the most inventive drummers I 've worked with . He isn 't satisfied with simply adding a beat ; his drum parts are an integral part of the orchestration of the record . He 's also a great live drummer who is lots of fun to watch , with a presence and energy level that are mesmerizing . " 
 Leto switched to a mostly acoustic set @-@ up on the band 's next release A Beautiful Lie . His equipment consists of a hybrid kit that combines both acoustic and electric elements . His drum technician Joseph Ciccone , better known as Kentucky , stated that Leto 's " sound is his technique . He 's an animal behind that kit , so I love giving him tons of things to beat up . " During the production of This Is War , Leto widened his style with an abundance of electronic sounds and synth textures created by himself . He wrote the instrumental track " <unk> " and played every instrument on it , including all guitars and a singing bowl . He experimented with different instruments and drew influences from a varied range of styles in Love , Lust , Faith and Dreams . Steve Lillywhite , who co @-@ produced two band 's albums , felt that Leto treats drumming " unlike most drummers do in rock bands . His cross rhythms explode in a guttural way ... very musical , extremely unique . " 
 Leto was largely an autodidact on drums ; " I 've always wanted to find my way of doing things , " he explained , " Discovering what I can contribute with my own voice . There were so many styles that I was into at a young age . I didn 't want to get locked into just one thing . " During his youth , Leto had been a devoted fan of progressive rock and blues music , listening to artists such as Fleetwood Mac , Janis Joplin , Jimi Hendrix , Pink Floyd , Led Zeppelin , and Boz Scaggs . He is inspired by electronic music , including Depeche Mode and The Cure . His major influences also include jazz band Steely Dan , as well as heavy metal groups Mountain , Iron Maiden and Kiss . According to Leto , these artists were commercially viable but also respected for their statements and contributions . He explained that he " never focused on the drummers , " saying that he felt more connected to music than a particular drummer . 
 When Thirty Seconds to Mars first started , the Leto brothers experimented to try and create a specific sound , whose process was described as " very organic " . They were attempting to produce a " feeling " rather than a sound , in order to recreate the sense of community that marked their childhood . Leto also stated that the band 's concerts are a direct reflection of that period of his early life . 
 Journalist Kelly King , a long @-@ time contributor with Drumhead magazine , opined that Leto is " energy and grace behind the drums , stoking the fire that drives his band . " He commented that the musician is both confident and aggressive on his kit , and felt that " his drive to push himself to the limit , to create and explore his own artistic capabilities is paramount . " Ryan Jones , writing for Alternative Addiction , described Leto as one of rock 's most dynamic drummers of present day . He received the Indie Drummer Award at the 2012 <unk> Awards . He was also nominated for Alternative Drummer in 2009 and 2011 .

 = Cal Neva Lodge & Casino = 
 Cal Neva Resort & Casino , previously known as the Calneva Resort , is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California on the shores of Lake Tahoe . The original building was constructed in 1926 , and became famous when the national media picked up a story about actress Clara Bow cancelling checks she owed to the Cal Neva worth $ 13 @,@ 000 in 1930 . After a fire , the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days . In 1960 , entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana . 
 Under Sinatra , the Celebrity Room was added alongside a helipad and it opened year round . His ownership gradually increased over the following two years until he owned 50 percent outright . But Giancana 's attendance at the property first provoked a rift between Sinatra and share holder Hank Sanicola , and later resulted in Sinatra 's gambling license being suspended by the Nevada Gaming Control Board . He initially leased the property to Jack L. Warner and later in 1968 to a group of investors . It passed through the hands of a series of investment groups until 1976 when it was bought by Kirk Kerkorian . The property is owned by Criswell @-@ Radovan , LLC , which closed the resort on September 5 , 2013 , for renovations and anticipates reopening it in 2016 .

 The Calneva Lodge was built in 1926 by real estate developer Robert P. Sherman . In 1929 , Canadian Army Colonel H. H. Betts went missing from his room at the Calneva ; his body was found over a year later some five miles away from the hotel . The lodge was first made nationally famous later that year when actress Clara Bow cancelled checks owed to the casino worth $ 13 @,@ 000 ; she claimed that she had believed that the chips she was using while playing blackjack were worth 50 cents when they were actually valued at $ 100 . 
 A group of investors bought the Calneva in 1935 , and recruited William " Bones " <unk> to act as its president and the pit manager of the casino . That year a 13 @-@ year @-@ old Judy Garland performed at Cal Neva for the first time . The original building burnt down in 1937 causing $ 200 @,@ 000 worth of damage ; the incident which was thought to have been arson but no charges were ever brought . The reconstruction effort took 30 days , with 500 men working on the project . State legislation was changed shortly afterwards to allow gambling , and following the purchase by developer Norman Blitz it became one of Nevada 's earliest legalized casinos and rumors abounded that there was an intention by the owners of the lodge to put a gambling boat on the lake . 
 Towards the end of the Second World War , the lodge was purchased from <unk> by Sanford Adler and a group of associates for $ 700 @,@ 000 ; Adler renamed the property to " Cal Neva " in order to match Adler 's Cal Neva hotel in Reno , Nevada . However , this formatting of the name had been in common use since before the fire . In 1946 , Xavier Cugat was paid a reported $ 22 @,@ 000 for a two @-@ week stint at Cal Neva Lodge — this was reportedly the first nationally famous band to perform there . 
 Ownership was transferred once again on March 21 , 1955 , when a group led by Bert " <unk> " <unk> purchased the lodge for $ 1 million . During this period , the hotel was frequented by members of the Kennedy family including John F. and his brother Robert . Author Scott Lankford claims that John F. used the lodge to carry on an " endless series of extramarital affairs with wealthy divorcees and Tahoe 's notoriously ubiquitous prostitutes " . The lodge served as accommodation during the 1960 Winter Olympics , held at nearby Squaw Valley Ski Resort . It has remained popular with skiers over the decades since . 
 = = = Ownership by Frank Sinatra = = = 
 Frank Sinatra first visited Cal Neva in 1951 ; his trip made the national press as he overdosed on sleeping pills and this was reported to the local sheriff . He continued to attend the lodge and <unk> would talk up his appearances to other guests such as when on one occasion , Sinatra played a jam session with big band leader Harry James and actress and singer Betty Grable . Sinatra publicly bought the resort in 1960 through his company , Park Lake Enterprises . Initially , he owned 25 percent of the property with Hank Sanicola and Paul " Skinny " D 'Amato who each held 13 percent . Other smaller shareholders included Dean Martin . Chicago mobster Sam Giancana was said to be a silent partner in the business ; D 'Amato acted as Giancana 's man . Sinatra gradually expanded his ownership of the casino ; by 1962 he owned more than 50 percent share , with Sanicola holding 33 percent and Sanford Waterman owning the remaining shares . 
 The shareholders decided to open the property year @-@ round ; it had only previously opened for the summer season . Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater and installed a helicopter pad on the roof . He re @-@ utilized prohibition @-@ era smuggling tunnels beneath the property to allow mob members to move around the property without being seen by the public . 
 The FBI already had the lodge under investigation at the time due to the connection to Joseph P. Kennedy , Sr. , who was staying there at the time that Sinatra 's deal was finalized . There were concerns that Kennedy was involved in the arrangement of a casino for use by the American mafia . The FBI suspected that the expansion was made using funds borrowed from Jimmy Hoffa . Following a request by Robert Kennedy , who had concerns over the press coverage of his and his brother 's relationships with Marilyn Monroe , Sinatra made accommodation available for her for a weekend prior to her death on August 4 , 1962 . During this period she was not allowed to leave and only Giancana was allowed to visit her . Even her former husband , Joe DiMaggio , was turned away . She attempted suicide through an overdose , but contacted the reception desk and was rushed to hospital where she had her stomach pumped . The cabin , known as Monroe 's , and another , known as Sinatra 's , are still part of the guest accommodation . Also in that year , a federal investigation took place into a prostitution ring being run from the foyer of the Cal Neva . 
 The Sinatra period saw extravagant parties and visits by celebrities such as Lucille Ball and Richard Crenna . However , his mood swings would sometimes determine how he responded to patrons . Journalist Herb Caen reported that he could be dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him . Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada , but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder . Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend , Phyllis McGuire , the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola 's friendship . After Giancana was spotted on the premises , Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board . Following this , Sinatra decided he wanted to get out of entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in the national press and pursued by law enforcement over illegal activities at the casino . The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros. Records and Sinatra gaining a one @-@ third ownership in the new company . 
 = = = Later period = = = 
 After leasing it to Warner for four years , Sinatra sought to sell the property to Howard Hughes in 1967 as part of the renewal of his contract at the Sands Hotel and Casino . Following a fallout between Hughes and Sinatra , the entertainer instead signed a contract with Caesars Palace . This included a requirement for Sinatra 's stake in Cal Neva to be purchased by his new employer for $ 2 million , but instead the lodge passed into the hands of the same owners as Reno 's Club Cal @-@ Neva in 1968 for $ 1 @.@ 4 million . 
 The new owners oversaw the construction of a ten @-@ storey expansion to the property . This added a further 200 rooms to the lodge , for which permission was given although the Nevada State Park Advisory Committee opposed the move . They sought to re @-@ open the Cal Neva on July 1 , 1969 , but instead it partly opened in May of that year with the new expansion opening the following month . The Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust purchased the lodge in 1970 for $ 6 million , with the aim to lease it to the U.S. Capital Corporation , who in turn sought to sublease it to Tahoe Crystal Bay Inc . The stockholders of the Ohio Real Estate Investment Trust filed a lawsuit against the company in 1973 , which resulted in the Cal Neva being placed into federal receivership . After opening year round since Sinatra purchased the lodge , it closed for the winter season in 1974 due to a drop in visitors blamed on the 1973 oil crisis . 
 The Cal Neva was sold in 1975 alongside the Crystal Bay Club to <unk> Corporation , who consisted of Everett <unk> , Charles Ketchum and Norman Jenson . The two clubs were purchased for a total of $ 9 million . But their licensing application for Cal Neva was turned down by the Nevada Gaming Commission due to a their lack of ongoing finances . The First National Bank of Nevada foreclosed on the property in early 1976 before selling it to Kirk Kerkorian , a significant shareholder in Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer . He owned the Cal Neva through his <unk> Investment Corporation , a different entity than the one through which he owns his MGM shares . As part of the re @-@ launch of the lodge , he convinced Dean Martin to return for a performance , for which Cary Grant was also in attendance . 
 Jon <unk> was arrested in 1985 for fraud after convincing Hibernia National Bank to loan him $ 23 million towards the purchase price of Cal Neva . He had claimed that he had the backing of Sheraton Hotels and Resorts . He was subsequently sentenced to 20 years in custody . That same year , the lodge was purchased by Chuck <unk> . Under the new owner , it was renovated and the exterior of the main building restored to how it looked in the 1960s . On September 10 – 12 , 1993 , the lodge hosted the second annual <unk> Aga Pow wow ( a local Native American meeting ) on Lake Tahoe . In 1998 the hotel was named " Nevada 's Best Getaway " and cited as one of America 's 50 Flagship Hotels . 
 In 2005 , <unk> sold the lodge onto Ezri <unk> . However the casino was in severe decline ; by 2009 the revenue was around half of that which it received in 1992 . Canyon Capital Advisors foreclosed on a $ 25 million loan , and an auction open across two states failed to result in any bidders . The area had seen several other casinos nearby close around the same time .

 The Cal Neva Lodge and Casino overlooks Lake Tahoe with the property split across the California / Nevada border near Crystal Bay . The main dining room has a white line indicating the state border running down the middle of the room , and continues outside through a swimming pool . The interior is decorated in the lodge @-@ style . The entrance had been replaced several times over the years , although the exterior of the buildings have remained almost the same since the reconstruction . Prior to the expansion under Sinatra , the lodge had 55 rooms and 11 lodges , but this was increased to 220 lake @-@ facing rooms following the expansion in 1969 . As of 1998 it had 182 rooms and suites and eight conference rooms , catering for up to 400 people .

 Constructed following the purchase by Sinatra and his associates , the Celebrity room and theater hosted both the singer and his Rat Pack friends as well as other singers of the day . It is located near to the casino area on the Nevada side of the border , and has sat up to 700 people . The Indian room featured Native American memorabilia and wood @-@ beamed ceilings , and is sited in the California side of the hotel . It acted as both a museum to the nearby Washoe people , as well as operating as a ballroom . The Indian room underwent renovation in the late 1980s , when it was described by Skiing magazine as being " a spacious area with a large fireplace " .

 Criswell @-@ Radovan , LLC , a Napa , California @-@ based development company which acquired the property in spring 2013 , closed it as a whole on September 5 , 2013 for a complete renovation . The development project was originally estimated to take at least a year and was to include an overhaul of the 10 @-@ story Cal Neva , including interior guest rooms , the Circle Bar , the casino , Frank Sinatra 's Celebrity Room theater and a complete exterior upgrade . The casino upgrade sought to restore the Cal Neva 's original 6 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot gaming floor , complete with a full slot machine display and the return of table games . Criswell @-@ Radovan was aiming to reopen the property in conjunction with what would have been Sinatra 's 99th birthday on December 12 , 2014 . However , reopening was first delayed to January 2015 , then summer 2015 , and then pushed into 2016 . They delays were attributed to a combination of factors : the need for construction to proceed carefully and the difficulties in obtaining financing . The company obtained a $ 29 million loan in November 2014 that allowed construction to begin . An additional $ 20 million equity line of credit is also financing the project .

 = Essjay controversy = 
 The Essjay controversy was an incident concerning a prominent Wikipedia participant and salaried Wikia employee , known by the username Essjay , who later identified himself as Ryan Jordan . Jordan held trusted volunteer positions within Wikipedia known as " administrator " , " bureaucrat " , and " arbitrator " . 
 On July 24 , 2006 , Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt started a thread titled " Who is Essjay ? " ( later retitled " Who is Essjay ? , Probably he 's Ryan Jordan " after Jordan 's self @-@ disclosure ) on the forum site Wikipedia Review . The ensuing discussion brought to light contradictions in claims Essjay made about his academic qualifications and professional experiences on his Wikipedia user page . Jordan claimed that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university . Five days later , The New Yorker published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the claims . Wikipedia Review found definitive proof that Jordan made false claims about his qualifications and experience , including that he was a " tenured professor " , a claim that was used to describe Essjay in the interview for The New Yorker . In January 2007 , Daniel Brandt contacted the author of the article in The New Yorker about the discrepancies in Jordan 's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content . 
 The controversy that ensued focused on his falsification of a persona and qualifications , the impact of this deception on perceptions of Wikipedia ( and its policies and credibility ) , and the quality of decisions made in his promotion , support , and employment . 
 Reactions to the disclosure were diverse , encompassing commentary and articles in the electronic , print , and broadcast media ; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay 's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project 's handling of personal identification . In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes . 
 Wikipedia co @-@ founder Jimmy Wales initially supported Essjay 's use of a persona , saying , " I regard it as a pseudonym and I don 't really have a problem with it . " Later , Wales withdrew his support and asked for Essjay 's resignation from his positions with Wikipedia and Wikia . Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned " that Essjay used his false credentials in content disputes " on Wikipedia .

 = = The New Yorker interview = = 
 Stacy Schiff , a Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning journalist writing for The New Yorker , interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia ( " Know It All " ; July 31 , 2006 ) after he was recommended to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation . According to The New Yorker , Essjay " was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page . " 
 During the interview , Jordan told The New Yorker and had previously stated on his Wikipedia user page that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university . It was later discovered that he was 24 years old , and had dropped out of community college with no qualifications . The New Yorker published a correction in February 2007 , which brought the issue to broader public attention . 
 The article said that Essjay spent some 14 hours or more a day on Wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends . It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz . He asserted that he required anonymity to avoid <unk> . 
 Jordan , as Essjay , claimed he sent an email to a college professor using his invented persona 's credentials , vouching for Wikipedia 's accuracy . In the message he wrote in part , " I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia . I am also a tenured professor of theology ; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia user page ( linked below ) to gain an idea of my background and credentials . " 
 = = = Identity revealed = = = 
 When Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007 , he changed his Wikia profile and " came clean on who he really was , " identifying himself as Ryan Jordan . Other Wikipedia editors questioned Essjay on his Wikipedia talk page about the apparent discrepancy between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials . Essjay posted a detailed explanation in response to the first inquiry , stating that : 
 There are a number of trolls , stalkers , and psychopaths who wander around Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects looking for people to harass , stalk , and otherwise ruin the lives of ( several have been arrested over their activities here ) ... You will eventually say something that will lead back to you , and the stalkers will find it ... I decided to be myself , to never hide my personality , to always be who I am , but to utilize disinformation with regard to what I consider unimportant details : age , location , occupation , etc ... 
 He later commented on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by " ... doing a good job playing the part . " 
 Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then wrote a letter reporting the identity discrepancy to Stacy Schiff and The New Yorker . In late February 2007 , the magazine updated its article with a correction indicating that " Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan , that he is twenty @-@ four and holds no advanced degrees , and that he has never taught . " 
 On March 3 , 2007 , Andrew Lih , Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong , said on his blog that a portion of Essjay 's comments on the incident entered " the dangerous domain of defamation and libel " against Stacy Schiff . Lih stated that on Essjay 's Wikipedia talk page , Essjay had written , " Further , she [ Schiff ] made several offers to compensate me for my time , and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so , she should donate to the Foundation instead . " Lih noted : 
 This is an accusation of the highest degree to make about a journalist . Paying a source for a story is an absolute no @-@ no in the normal practice of print journalism . And it struck me immediately how incredible it was he would accuse Stacy Schiff , a Pulitzer Prize winning author writing for The New Yorker , of this crime . We either have a serious breach of ethics with Ms. Schiff or another dubious statement claim from Essjay . 
 Lih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email . In it , Schiff stated that Essjay 's assertion was " complete nonsense " .

 = = = Wikipedia community = = = 
 Speaking personally about Jordan , Wales said , " Mr. Ryan [ sic ] was a friend , and still is a friend . He is a young man , and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology , which I have accepted . I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation . " 
 Essjay had responded at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page , in part reading : 
 ... I * am * sorry if anyone in the Wikipedia community has been hurt by my decision to use disinformation to protect myself . I 'm not sorry that I protected myself ; I believed , and continue to believe , that I was right to protect myself , in light of the problems encountered on the Internet in these trying times . I have spoken to all of my close friends here about this , and have heard resoundingly that they understand my position , and they support me . Jimbo and many others in Wikipedia 's hierarchy have made their support known as well ... 
 Reaction from within the Wikipedia community to the Essjay / Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp , voluminous , and mixed . While most editors denounced at least some of his actions , responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud . 
 As the controversy unfolded , the Wikipedia community began a review of Essjay 's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made . " People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments , " said Michael Snow , a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper , the <unk> . " Those will get looked at again . " For instance , Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies , a book granted the <unk> <unk> and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church . Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article <unk> : " This is a text I often require for my students , and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it 's [ sic ] credibility . " In another case ( a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms ) , he cited personal experience from " the Abbey of <unk> , where I was a monk . " 
 Jimmy Wales proposed a credential verification system on Wikipedia following the Essjay controversy , but the proposal was rejected . Wales was " reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes . " " I don 't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia , but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address , " Wales added . He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished . " We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition , so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle , " Wales commented . However , he also warned that " It 's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials , and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate . " However , Florence <unk> , chair of the Wikimedia Foundation , was not supportive of his credential proposal , saying , " I think what matters is the quality of the content , which we can improve by enforcing policies such as ' cite your source , ' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor . " A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community , like all previous such proposals . 
 As a follow @-@ up to his initial comments to The New Yorker , Wales wrote this apology to the magazine , which appeared in its March 19 , 2007 issue : 
 I am writing to apologize to The New Yorker and Stacy Schiff , and to give some follow @-@ up concerning Ryan Jordan ( Editors ' Note , March 5 ) . When I last spoke to The New Yorker about the fact that a prominent Wikipedia community member had lied about his credentials , I misjudged the issue . It was not O.K. for Mr. Jordan , or Essjay , to lie to a reporter , even to protect his identity . 
 Wales expressed his regret that Essjay had " made a series of very bad judgments . " He also commented that he hoped Wikipedia would improve as a result of the controversy . 
 = = = Wikipedia critics = = = 
 Andrew Orlowski , a frequent Wikipedia critic and writer for The Register — a British technology news and opinion website — criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture @-@ capital @-@ funded Wikia and for appointing him to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee after Essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false . Orlowski added that Essjay 's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within Wikipedia . 
 Others to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe , who asked " why lying about one 's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia , which proposes to help communities to record accurate information " and asked for additional details " such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing , as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements . " 
 Larry Sanger , co @-@ founder of Wikipedia who left the project in 2002 , called Essjay 's response " a defiant non @-@ apology " and elsewhere characterized Essjay 's actions as " identity fraud . " 
 Other comments : 
 BusinessWeek commented on proposals for credential verification : " Sadly , not everyone who posts to Wikipedia is concerned with the Ten Commandments . Some are concerned with revenge . Some with self @-@ aggrandizement . Some just have nothing better to do . We live in an age of fake IDs , fake money , fake e @-@ mails , fake URLs , fake IP addresses , and fake votes ... " However , the article argued that Wikipedia could not become a " net police " of reliability on the Internet . 
 Steve <unk> ( journalist , Maclean 's ) stated that the controversy could damage Wikipedia 's future as a media business operation , observing that Wikipedia 's model was supposedly built upon trust and credibility . 
 Cassandra Jardine , a Daily Telegraph contributor , opined that Essjay was " hooked on ' Wiki crack ' — devotees ' jargon for the thrill of seeing your efforts debated . " She further observed that " Essjay has provided a reminder that any given entry could have been written by someone as ignorant as ourselves . On the other hand , no one has taken issue with his edits , only his assumed persona , so perhaps the real lesson of this democratic medium is that college drop @-@ outs might be as authoritative as professors . " 
 Andrew Keen ( author , Cult of the Amateur ) described the controversy as an example of ignoring expert guidance in favor of the " dictatorship of idiots . " 
 Alex Beam ( columnist , Boston Globe ) criticized the Essjay affair as being part of what he characterizes as the problems of " crowdsourcing " and the " wisdom of crowds , " stating also that the crowd accepts authority unquestioningly : " Who would you rather have write your encyclopedia entries ? Bertrand Russell , T.H. Huxley , and Benedetto Croce , who wrote for the Britannica ? Or ... <unk> ? "

 Following the media coverage of the Essjay controversy , a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia . On March 2 , 2007 , a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education commented " the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia 's credibility — especially with professors who will now note that one of the site 's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud . " Ross Brann , a professor of Judeo @-@ Islamic studies at Cornell University in Ithaca , stated that Wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review , saying , " They could make up your life if they wanted to . " Brann also said that Wikipedia " has no place in the University , " and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia . Students at Cornell indicated that they may continue to use Wikipedia as a quick source of information , though they would not cite it in scholarly work . 
 Nicola Pratt , a lecturer in international relations at the University of East Anglia in England stated , " The ethos of Wikipedia is that anyone can contribute , regardless of status ... What 's relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers , not whether they are professors or not — and the fact the student [ Essjay ] was exposed shows it works . " In 2009 , a lengthy article was published by the National Council of Teachers of English discussing the challenges of determining textual origins in college compositions , using a detailed history of the Essjay incident to set the context . 
 = Battle of the Kalka River = 
 The Battle of the Kalka River ( Russian : Битва на <unk> <unk> , Ukrainian : Битва на <unk> <unk> ) was fought between the Mongol Empire — whose armies were led by Jebe and Subutai the Valiant — and a coalition of several Rus ' principalities , including Kiev and Galich , and the Cumans . They were under the joint command of Mstislav the Bold and Mstislav III of Kiev . The battle was fought on May 31 , 1223 on the banks of the Kalka River in present @-@ day Donetsk Oblast , Ukraine , and ended in a Mongol victory . 
 Following the Mongol invasion of Central Asia and the subsequent collapse of the Khwarezmian Empire , a Mongol force under the command of generals Jebe and Subutai advanced into Iraq @-@ i Ajam . Jebe requested permission from the Mongolian emperor , Genghis Khan , to continue his conquests for a few years before returning to the main army via the Caucasus . While waiting for Genghis Khan 's reply , the duo set out on a raid in which they attacked Georgia and killed its king . Genghis Khan granted the duo permission to undertake their expedition , and after making their way through the Caucasus , they defeated a coalition of Caucasian tribes before defeating the Cumans . The Cuman Khan fled to the court of his son @-@ in @-@ law , Prince Mstislav the Bold of Galich , whom he convinced to help fight the Mongols . Mstislav the Bold formed an alliance of the Rus ' princes including Mstislav III of Kiev . 
 The combined Rus ' army defeated the Mongol rearguard at first . The Rus ' pursued the Mongols — who were in a feigned retreat — for several days , which spread out their armies . The Mongols stopped and assumed battle formation on the banks of the Kalka River . Mstislav the Bold and his Cuman allies attacked the Mongols without waiting for the rest of the Rus ' army and were defeated . In the ensuing confusion , several other Rus ' princes were defeated , and Mstislav of Kiev was forced to retreat to a fortified camp . After holding for three days , he surrendered in return for a promise of safe conduct for himself and his men . Once they surrendered , however , the Mongols slaughtered them and executed Mstislav of Kiev . Mstislav the Bold escaped , and the Mongols went back to Asia , where they joined Genghis Khan . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1219 , in retaliation for the murders of his ambassadors , the Mongol Khan , Genghis Khan , invaded the Khwarezmian Empire . In a campaign that lasted three years , Genghis Khan and his generals destroyed the Khwarezmian armies and caused the empire to disintegrate . The Khwarezmian Sultan Ala ad @-@ Din Muhammad succumbed to disease on an island in the Caspian Sea , leaving his son , Jalal ad @-@ Din Mingburnu landless . 
 When Jebe ( one of the Mongol generals pursuing Muhammad ) heard of Ala ad @-@ Din Muhammad 's death , he asked Genghis Khan for a year or two to continue his conquests before returning to Mongolia via the Caucasus . 
 While awaiting Genghis ' reply , Jebe and Subutai ( another general pursuing Muhammad ) led their army of 20 @,@ 000 men , with each general commanding a <unk> . They left behind a trail of destruction as they moved through Persian Iraq ( Iraq @-@ i Ajam ) and Azerbaijan , sacking the cities of Rey , Zanjan and Qazvin . The city of Hamadan surrendered without a struggle . Meanwhile , <unk> , the Atabeg of Azerbaijan , saved his capital , Tabriz , and prevented his country 's destruction by offering to the Mongols a large amount of money , clothing and horses , which were the Mongols ' best weapons . 
 From Tabriz , the Mongols advanced north and made their winter base in the Mugan Steppes . There , the army was strengthened by the arrival of Kurdish and <unk> freebooters , who offered their services to the Mongols . 
 = = = Caucasus raid = = = 
 At the same time , Jebe 's and Subutai 's attention had turned elsewhere . In January and February 1221 , they made a reconnaissance into the Kingdom of Georgia , entering through the Kura River . The goal of the Mongols was not to conquer the country but to plunder it , and the Kurds and <unk> freebooters were sent off in the vanguard . However , the King of Georgia , George IV Lasha , advanced with 10 @,@ 000 men and drove the Mongols back near Tbilisi . The Mongols withdrew , but continued to launch counter @-@ attacks on the Georgian army . The Mongols then launched a full @-@ scale attack and defeated the Georgian army , which Richard Gabriel states was made up of 70 @,@ 000 men . 
 In March 1221 , the Mongols returned to Azerbaijan and besieged <unk> , using prisoners as the vanguard to take the brunt of each assault on the city . By the end of the month , they had captured the city and put most of the population to death . Jebe and Subutai planned to advance south and capture Baghdad , the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate , and hold it for ransom while the Caliph was in Iraq @-@ i Ajam with a small army . Instead , the Mongols turned once again to Hamadan . This time , however , the city 's leaders failed to surrender , and its defenders inflicted many casualties upon the Mongol forces before their capture and plunder of the city . 
 In late 1221 , the Mongols advanced north into Georgia once again , entering through the Kura River . A Georgian army was waiting near Tbilisi , and when Subutai advanced , he feigned retreat . At this point , the Georgian cavalry followed Subutai 's army into an ambush set by Jebe . The Georgian army suffered a heavy defeat , and King George was mortally wounded . The Mongols proceeded to plunder southern Georgia . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Genghis Khan eventually granted Jebe permission and with Subutai as his second @-@ in @-@ command , the Mongols advanced to the city of Derbent , which refused to surrender . Jebe promised to spare the city in return for the services of 10 guides to take them through the Caucasus . To warn the guides against playing any tricks , the Mongols executed one of them . The crossing of the Caucasus was costly for the Mongols , who had to abandon their siege engines and lost hundreds of men to the cold . 
 After making it through the Caucasus , the Mongols were met by an alliance consisting of the Lezgians , the Alans and the <unk> , tribes who were living north of the Caucasus who had mustered an army of around 50 @,@ 000 men . They were joined by the Cumans , a Turkic people who owned an expansive khanate stretching from Lake Balkhash to the Black Sea . The Cumans also convinced the Volga Bulgars and Khazars to join . The Cuman Khan , <unk> , placed his army under the command of his brother , Yuri , and his son , Daniel . The first battle between the league and the Mongols was indecisive , but the Mongols managed to persuade the Cuman to abandon the alliance by reminding them of the Turkic @-@ Mongol friendship and promising them a share of the booty gained from the Caucasian tribes . 
 With this arrangement settled , the Mongols attacked the alliance 's army and routed it . The Mongols then proceeded to attack the Cumans , who had split into two separate groups as they were returning home , destroying both armies and executing all the prisoners before sacking Astrakhan . The Mongols began pursuing the Cumans as they fled in a north @-@ westerly direction . 
 The Venetians sent a delegation to the Mongols , and they concluded an alliance in which it was agreed that the Mongols would destroy any other European trading post they came across . As the Mongols pursued the Cumans , Jebe sent a detachment to Crimea , where the Republic of Genoa had trading stations . The Mongols captured and plundered the Genoese city of <unk> . Meanwhile , <unk> fled to the court of his son @-@ in @-@ law , Prince Mstislav the Bold of Galich . He warned Mstislav : " Today the Mongols have taken our land and tomorrow they will take yours " . However , the Cumans were ignored for almost a year as the Rus had suffered from Cumans raids for decades . But when news reached Kiev that the Mongols were marching along the Dniester River , the Rus responded . Mstislav gathered an alliance of the Kievan Rus ' princes including Mstislav III of Kiev and Prince Yuri II of Vladimir @-@ Suzdal , who promised support . The Rus princes then began mustering their armies and going towards the rendezvous point .

 = = = Initial moves = = = 
 The number of men present at the battle is disputed . A major factor in this is the fact that no primary sources give the number of men present at the battle , which leaves modern historians to estimate the number of men . Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus ' army as 30 @,@ 000 , while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus ' army was 80 @,@ 000 @.@ de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20 @,@ 000 , while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23 @,@ 000 men . However , historian John Fennell , an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history , and one well @-@ versed in the primary sources , calls many of these figures into doubt , saying the numbers given in the Russian sources ( there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources , at least none that have survived , and other sources from other cultures , if they exist , are rather dubious ) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves . 
 The move by the Rus ' army was detected by the Mongols , who were on the east side of the Dnieper River waiting for reinforcements from Jochi , Genghis Khan 's eldest son , who was campaigning around the Aral Sea . Jochi , however , had become ill , which meant no reinforcements would be coming . 
 At the same time , the Rus ' attempted to trap the Mongols . The princes of Galich and Volhynia transported their armies south down the river , while the princes of Kiev and Chernigov advanced north up the river , and the army of Kursk advanced from the front . At the same time , the Cumans attempted to attack the Mongol army 's rear . When Jebe learned of this , he sent 10 envoys to the Prince of Kiev . The envoys stated that the Mongols had no feud with the Rus and were only attacking the Cumans ; they added that the Mongols were marching east , away from the Rus ' cities . Mstislav of Kiev had the envoys executed , and the Mongols responded by sending another set of ambassadors , who declared war . 
 When Jebe and Subutai heard of the Rus ' movements , they began moving east , away from the Rus , which was the only direction in which they could move . However , they left a rearguard of 1 @,@ 000 under the command of an officer , <unk> , to report of the Rus movements . Soon , Mstislav the Bold reached the river opposite the rearguard , and it became apparent that no prince had been appointed commander @-@ in @-@ chief . Thus , all the princes could act as they pleased . Eventually , Mstislav crossed the river under heavy arrow fire . When the Rus landed , however , their numbers were too great , and the Mongols were killed to the last man . 
 = = = Rus ' attack = = = 
 After drawing out the Rus armies for nine days in a feigned retreat , the Mongol army turned to face their pursuers along the Kalka River ( the river 's location is currently unknown , but it is thought to be the <unk> River which flows into the Sea of Azov ) . 
 The Russian primary sources give only a very general account of the battle itself and the pursuit of the princes back across the steppe . The chronicles name which princes took part and which died , but not much more in terms of the size of armies or casualties . As to the actual battle itself , the chronicles report that the Polovtsy broke and ran without having fought and that their flight through the Russian ranks led to mass confusion and resulted in their slaughter by the Mongols . 
 = = = Rus ' defeat = = = 
 The armies of Volhynia and Kursk made a gap in their line so that the fleeing Cumans could retreat . However , the Mongol heavy cavalry charged through the newly formed gap . The army of Chernigov , which was not aware that the battle had started , was advancing when they collided head @-@ on with the retreating Cumans . The Mongol cavalry took advantage of the confusion in the Chernigov line and attacked , causing the line to collapse . This , in turn , led to the death of Prince Mstislav of Chernigov . 
 At the same time , the Mongol wings closed around the shattered Rus ' army , cutting off its retreat . The surrounded Rus ' were hit by volley after volley , accompanied by occasional cavalry charges . As the Mongols were carrying this annihilation out , some of the army – led by Mstislav the Bold – managed to cut their way through the Mongol ring and escape . Mstislav of Kiev arrived to see what remained of the Rus ' army fleeing . With his contingent of 10 @,@ 000 men , he retreated to his stockaded camp , on a hill by the Dnieper . The pursuing Mongol army caught up with Mstislav of Kiev 's forces and started to besiege the camp .

 Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan army managed to hold out for three days , but were eventually forced to surrender to Ploscânea . But Ploscânea deceived the Slavs and gave them to Tatars ; Ploscânea initially was allied with Slavs and Cumans and was the leader of <unk> , people from a territory of today Moldova and Romania . Once in control of the camp , the Mongols slaughtered the Kievan army including Mstislav of Kiev and several other nobles prisoners . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle was a very costly defeat for the Rus ' princes , with Richard Gabriel claiming that they lost 50 @,@ 000 men , while the Mongol losses were minimal . Out of the Rus ' primary sources , The Primary Chronicle gives a number of 10 @,@ 000 killed while the much later ( and much less reliable ) <unk> Chronicle cites 60 @,@ 000 killed . The Novgorodian First Chronicle ( the most reliable ) , contemporary to the battle , gives no figures at all . Out of the Rus ' princes , the wounded Daniel of Volhynia and Mstislav the Bold managed to escape the battle . This battle was a significant defeat , given that many of the Rus principalities lost much of their armies , with the notable exception of Vladimir @-@ Suzdal . Historian Robert Marshall describes the raid as follows : " The rest of Subutai 's campaign has entered the annals of military history as one of the greatest adventures of cavalry warfare . " 
 The Mongols executed Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan nobles with the traditional Mongol caveat reserved for royalty and nobility : without shedding blood . Mstislav and his nobles were buried and suffocated under the Mongol general 's victory platform at the victory feast . Meanwhile , Mstislav the Bold managed to reach the western side of the Dnieper with what remained of his army . To stop the Mongols from crossing to the western side of the Dnieper , Mstislav destroyed all the boats he could find . 
 What the Rus ' feared would happen did not as the Mongols pursued the Prince of Galich and plundered a few towns in the south before turning around . The Mongol army crossed the Volga River near modern @-@ day <unk> and passed through Volga Bulgaria , where they were defeated in an ambush by the Bulgars . The Mongol army encountered the Bulgars in another battle in which they routed the Bulgars . The Mongols followed this up by attacking the <unk> Cumans , who had supported their fellow Cumans in the Caucasus a year before . They fought against the Cuman army near the Ural Mountains , defeating and killing the Khan before making them pay tribute . 
 Following this victory , the Mongols turned east and met Genghis Khan and the rest of the Mongol army in the steppes to the east of the Syr Darya River . Genghis Khan showed great appreciation for his general 's achievements and heaped praise on Jebe and Subutai . Jebe , however , did not survive the campaign long ; he died soon afterwards . The importance of the expedition was immense . The expedition was history 's longest cavalry raid , with the Mongols riding 5 @,@ 500 miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ) in three years . Subutai also stationed numerous spies in Russia , who provided frequent reports on what was happening in Europe and Russia . In 1237 Subutai together with Batu led another attack , and with 120 @,@ 000 men conquered the Kievan Rus ' .

 Drakengard , known as Drag @-@ On Dragoon in Japan , is a series of action role @-@ playing video games . The eponymous first game in the series was released in 2003 on the PlayStation 2 , and has since been followed by a sequel , a prequel and a spin @-@ off . It was conceived by Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki as a gameplay hybrid between Ace Combat and Dynasty Warriors 2 . The story was created by Shiba , Iwasaki , Taro Yoko and Sawako Natori , who were influenced by European folklore and popular anime series and movies of the day . Shiba , Yoko and Sawako have had involvement in every entry of the series since its debut . 
 The setting of the main series is a Northern European @-@ style dark fantasy world where humans and creatures from myth and legends live side by side , while the spin @-@ off game is set in an alternate reality leading from one of the first game 's possible endings . The stories generally focus on the fortunes and personalities of a small group of protagonists either directly or indirectly connected to and affected by the events of the story . Dark or mature plot and character themes and multiple endings have become a staple of the series . Their popularity in Japan has resulted in multiple adaptions and additional media in the form of novelizations and manga . 
 The series is considered highly popular in Japan , having sold well and gained a cult following , though it appears to be a niche series in Western territories . The main games have become noted for their dark storylines and mixture of ground @-@ based and aerial combat , while Nier stood out because of its mixture of gameplay styles . The series has received mixed to positive reception in both Japan and the West : the majority of praise has been given to its story and characters , while the gameplay has come in for criticisms for being repetitive or poorly designed . 
 = = Common elements = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 The Drakengard games take place in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard . Humans appear to be the predominant species , although races such as dragons , fairies and elves are shown to exist . The setting , mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe . The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance . The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers , entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure . The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals , which act to keep the world in balance : should the seals be destroyed , the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity . At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal , a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal : if all the seals are destroyed , all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself . A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact , a magical bond which links their souls and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait ( their voice , singing abilities , etc . ) . Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions , but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons . A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet , with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene . 
 The universe of the Drakengard series is split between multiple timelines . Events in those timelines are separate , but they can overlap . The core timeline is formed from Drakengard and its sequel . Drakengard 3 acts as the first game 's prequel , but most of its events take place in separate timelines leading to different outcomes . In Drakengard 3 , a malevolent flower uses servants called the Intoners , women gifted with the power to use magic through song , as instruments of humanity 's destruction . In Drakengard , which succeeds the a fifth version of Drakengard 3 's events detailed in a supplementary novel , the Watchers use a group known as the Cult of Watchers to spark a religious war and destroy the seals . In Drakengard 2 , the Watchers continue to use the former head of the cult to destroy the new seals , while the dragons prepare to usurp the gods and rule over the world . Nier is set in an alternate reality created by events stemming from Drakengard 's fifth ending : in this reality , the world was decimated by a plague created by the magical beings who came through the portal , bringing humanity to the brink of extinction . Nier : Automata takes place after the fourth ending of Nier , featuring appearances and mentions of characters from both Nier and the Drakengard games . 
 = = = Gameplay = = = 
 The Drakengard games feature a mix of action @-@ based hack @-@ and @-@ slash combat during ground @-@ based battles and aerial combat mixed in with RPG leveling mechanics . In the original , the player guides the characters around ground @-@ based battles to combat small groups of enemy units . In aerial combat , the player takes control of the protagonist 's dragon partner . In these situations , the dragon can either lock onto a target and unleash a barrage of small fireballs , or the player can manually aim and fire large bursts of flame , which do more damage but do not home in on a target . Basic gameplay changed little for Drakengard 2 , but there are some differences and additions , such as weapon types being tied to the character they are associated with , with changing them also swapping the character . The dragon gameplay remained virtually unchanged , apart from the ability , during air @-@ ground missions , for the dragon to swoop down on a group of enemies in a special attack depicted in a short cutscene . 
 In Nier and Drakengard 3 , the player controls the main protagonist with two other characters acting as AI @-@ controlled supports . Drakengard 3 was designed to be a faster experience than the previous games , with the protagonist being given a special hyper @-@ mode and the ability to freely switch between weapons without pausing the action . Aerial gameplay was also changed , with the dragon now capable of ground combat . Nier , while featuring similar hack @-@ and @-@ slash combat , also includes other gameplay types such as a top @-@ down view for puzzle areas , 2D style areas for buildings or similar structures . Side @-@ quests were also added , which often involved fetch quests , fishing and farming . 
 = = = Themes and influences = = = 
 One of the running narrative themes for the main series is Immorality , which also became the key character theme and was expressed through their personalities and actions . The second game also focused on themes of war and death . The theme for the world of Drakengard 3 , as described by composer Keiichi Okabe , is " the sense of contrast " . Multiple anime series have influenced the series ' characters over the years , including Neon Genesis Evangelion , Sister Princess and Puella Magi Madoka Magica . The series writer , Sawako Natori , drew inspiration for her writing from shōnen manga . The original game world was designed around Celtic and Norse myths , together with Japanese @-@ style revisionism . The team for the original game were influenced by Asian epic movies and western action @-@ adventure films such as the 1999 remake of The Mummy and Dragonheart . While developing Nier , the team drew inspiration from the God of War series , while the narrative structure was inspired by the September 11 attacks and the War on Terror . The central theme of Nier : Automata is struggling out of a bad situation , defined by the game 's staff using the Japanese word " <unk> " .

 The games received multiple adaptations and additional story content in the form of novelizations , manga and supplementary material . The first game received two novelizations : Drag @-@ On Dragoon : Side Story on November 28 , 2003 , and Drag @-@ On Dragoon : Magnitude " Negative " on January 23 , 2004 . The first book was written by Emi Nagashima , writing under her penname of Jun Eishima , and the second by Takashi Aizawa . The novelization of Drakengard 2 , written again by Nagashima , was released on September 30 , 2005 . 
 Nagashima wrote character stories and manga for Drakengard 3 leading up to that game 's release . The manga were Drag @-@ On Dragoon : Utahime Five , a prequel following the game 's main antagonists , and Drag @-@ On Dragoon : Shi ni Itaru Aka , which acts as a sequel although for the branch A as it along with branch 's B , C , and D lead to alternative timelines . A book detailing the narrative connection between Drakengard 3 and Drakengard , titled Drag @-@ On Dragoon 3 Story Side , which serves as the fifth branch similar to the events of B and D , narrated by Brother One was released on 28 August 2014 . Drag @-@ On Dragoon 3 Complete Guide + Setting , a complete guide to the game with extra features explaining the game chronology and a novella set after the events of Shi ni Itaru Aka , was published by ASCII Media Works in 2014 . 
 Nier was expanded after release with a CD drama which told of events immediately after the events of Drakengard 's fifth ending , and a supplementary book titled Grimoire Nier containing extra stories and concept art alongside a fifth ending for the game . Square Enix also paired up with WildStorm to create a digital comic which detailed the backstories of the game 's characters and world . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = History = = = 
 The idea for Drakengard originated in 1999 between Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki . The gameplay was conceived as a blend of elements from Ace Combat and Dynasty Warriors 2 . The team developing the game went under the moniker " Project <unk> " . The team was joined by director Taro Yoko , who was the main drive behind the game 's dark atmosphere . It was Shiba 's first project as a producer . As Yoko was told there would not be a sequel , multiple endings were created . When it was localized and released in the west , references to things such as sexual taboos were censored . In addition , the title was changed , as Drag @-@ On Dragoon was considered wrong for a western audience . Drakengard was considered enough of a success that a sequel was commissioned . Multiple staff members returned for the creation of the second game , although Yoko was mostly tied up with other projects and was replaced as director by Akira Yasui . Yoko still had a role in development , and he and Yasui had creative clashes during development . Yasui ended up making Drakengard 2 the thematic opposite of the previous game , employing a lighter tone and broader color palate . 
 Nier originated when Yoko and Shiba teamed up to create a third Drakengard game . As the project continued , it became more detached from the main continuity and eventually developed into a spin @-@ off . Despite what it became , Yoko has stated that he considers Nier to be the true Drakengard 3 . After the release of Nier , Cavia closed down and was absorbed by AQ Interactive , then Taro Yoko left the company to pursue a wider range of projects . A stalled attempt to begin production of further games in the series at AQ Interactive was blamed by Shiba on a prevalent trend at the time for light @-@ weight games for the general gaming community . Later , Yoko and Shiba came together again to create a proper second sequel to Drakengard , with the intention of creating a hard core RPG for the fanbase . Unlike the previous games in the series , Drakengard 3 was developed by Access Games , a developer whose noted games included Deadly Premonition , and brought in team members used to creating action games . During the run @-@ up to Drakengard 3 's release , both Yoko and Shiba expressed their willingness to continue the series on the PlayStation 4 if the latest game was enough of a success . Speaking in 2014 after the game 's release , Yoko stated that the series was on hold due to lack of funds . A new Nier game was revealed to be in development at Square Enix and PlatinumGames .

 The stories of the original game 's characters were written by Yoko , Shiba and Iwasaki , while the main game script was written by Sawako Natori , who would go on to co @-@ write the main scenarios for future Drakengard games . Yoko designed the darker elements to both contrast and actively compete with the likes of Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy . Yoko conceived the " insane " characters around the premise that people who killed hundreds of people in pursuit of their goals and took satisfaction from it were naturally insane . During the production of Nier , his focus changed to writing a story where everyone believed they were in the right whatever their actions . Through the series , Yoko has also been attempting to answer the question of why people are driven to kill . Although some of the dark narrative themes were kept for Drakengard 2 , many of the other narrative elements were made more mainstream . Drakengard 3 was intended to return to a dark aesthetic , but also to include moments of humor and tie in with Nier . 
 The character designer for nearly all entries in the series is Kimihiko Fujisaka . Initially a minor staff member at Cavia , the team were impressed by his skill as an amateur artist and he was recommended for the post of character designer for the game . The designs for both the characters and the world were influenced by armor and clothing of Medieval Europe . He returned in the same capacity for Drakengard 2 , and later for Nier . Disliking some of his initial designs for Drakengard , he took the opportunity to remodel them more to his liking for the arcade game Lord of Vermilion . For Nier 's international release , the protagonist was redesigned from a teenager to an adult character . This was because the publishers felt an older character would appeal more to western players . In Drakengard 3 , Fujisaka designed the protagonist Zero around the dark themes of the game , although some unusual elements were nearly cut . The other female characters were inspired by Puella Magi Madoka Magica , while the male characters , considered a low priority , were designed around male archetypes and approved quickly . For Nier : Automata , the designs were handled by Akihiko Yoshida , an artist noted for his work on the Final Fantasy series . While he was initially expected to refuse , he agreed as several staff at his company <unk> were fans of Nier . For his designs , Yoko requested he focus on smooth outlines and black coloring . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 The first game 's soundtrack was created by Nobuyoshi Sano and Takayuki Aihara . The two created the score using samples from well @-@ known classical composers . The second game 's soundtrack was composed by Ryoki Matsumoto and Aoi Yoshiki , who had never before been involved with video game soundtracks . The game 's Japanese theme song , Hitori , was sung by Mika Nakashima . The music for Nier was composed by Keiichi Okabe , who composed the soundtrack as something different from the main series , and to directly reflect the sombre tone of the game 's setting and story . Singer Emi Evans ( Emiko Rebecca Evans ) wrote and sung the vocal tracks , and performed many tracks in different languages , including an invented one for one of the tracks . Okabe returned to compose the soundtrack for Drakengard 3 : in an interview , he stated that , in composing the music , he tried to emulate the work of the earlier composer without imitating them . He also commented that the result was very unlike the traditional Square Enix game . The game features two theme songs : " Black Song " , performed by Eir Aoi , and " This Silence is Mine " , the game 's theme song proper , written and sung by Chihiro Onitsuka . Okabe is again providing the music for Nier Automata , with singer Emi Evans also returning .

 The Drakengard series has received mixed to positive reviews over the years . So far , the original Drakengard has received the most positive response . Nier has the highest aggregate score overall so far for the PS3 version of the game and slightly lower scores for the Xbox 360 version . Drakengard 2 and Drakengard 3 have received lower scores . Each title in the series has received favorable review scores from Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu . 
 The common point of praise for the series through most of its life has been the story . While individual aspects have come in for criticism , the dark atmospheres , unconventional characters and general scenarios have been cited as one of each game 's strengths . Despite some mixed feelings from reviewers either for the story as a whole or certain aspects of it , the characters and plot of Drakengard 3 have also been praised . The major exception is Drakengard 2 : the story 's lighter tone and more traditional narrative were noted and sometimes criticized for being overly simplistic or too similar to other games in the genre . The Drakengard characters have remained popular in Japan , with Dengeki holding a popularity contest for those characters to celebrate the series ' tenth anniversary and the announcement of Drakengard 3 . Among the most popular characters were the first game 's main protagonists , Caim and Angelus ( the former having earned the nickname Prince ( <unk> , <unk> ) among fans ) . The characters of Drakengard 3 have also proved to be highly popular . 
 The gameplay has so far come in for major criticism , with the original title 's aerial and ground @-@ based gameplay being seen as repetitive and dull , although some reviewers found it entertaining . Drakengard 2 also came in for such criticism , although minor improvements were cited . In contrast , the gameplay of Drakengard 3 was generally praised or seen as an improvement upon the previous two entries , though the dragon @-@ riding segments came in for criticisms for difficult controls . Opinions were divided on Nier 's unconventional mix of gameplay styles from multiple game genres , with some praising the variety and others seeing it as poorly executed . The series as a whole has gained a cult following in Japan . 
 Each game has sold relatively well in its home market . The original game was a commercial success , selling over 120 @,@ 000 units in the first week of release and eventually selling over 240 @,@ 000 copies in Japan . Drakengard 2 's first @-@ week sales were similarly impressive , selling 100 @,@ 000 units . It sold over 203 @,@ 000 copies by the end of 2005 . Drakengard 3 sold just over 15 @,@ 000 units in its first week , and over 150 @,@ 000 units by May 2014 . The two versions of Nier — Gestalt and Replicant — sold roughly 12 @,@ 500 and 60 @,@ 000 copies in their first week respectively . Replicant eventually sold over 121 @,@ 000 in Japan by the end of May 2010 . The series has sold over 770 @,@ 000 units in Japan as of May 2014 . Sales figures for western regions are unavailable . The first two games in the main series have both been included in Square Enix 's Ultimate Hits series , re @-@ releases of popular titles developed or published by them . 
 = Wong Fu Productions = 
 Wong Fu Productions is an Asian American filmmaking group composed of Wesley Chan ( born April 27 , 1984 ) , Ted Fu ( born October 26 , 1981 ) , and Philip Wang ( born October 28 , 1984 ) . The trio met at the University of California , San Diego in 2004 and produced a number of music videos and short films released on their website and later YouTube before establishing a professional media company , Sketchbook Media , after their graduation . Their works have been featured at a number of national and international film festivals , including the Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival , San Diego Asian Film Festival and the Cannes Film Festival . 
 As of August 31 , 2015 , Wong Fu Productions ' YouTube channel has over 2 @.@ 5 million subscribers and over 384 million video views . 
 = = History = = 
 According to Philip Wang , Wong Fu Productions was unofficially established in 2001 during his high school junior year at Northgate High School ( Walnut Creek , California ) . Wang mainly utilised his family 's digital camcorder to film school projects in collaboration with classmates . The name Wong Fu is a nickname that Philip was given when he was in the seventh grade . In his first year as an undeclared freshman at the University of California , San Diego ( UCSD ) , Wang and his friends released a music video of Justin Timberlake 's song " Señorita " . It was the first music video produced by Wang and , although he did not actively promote it , the video was quickly circulated among other fellow college students . The video was circulated in its original computer file format because it was released prior to the advent of the video sharing website YouTube . 
 In 2004 , Wang met classmates Wesley Chan ( graduated from Mills High School in 2002 ) and Ted Fu through a school production , and the trio began working on small scale projects in their spare time and for class assignments . They did not originally consider filmmaking as a career when they entered university ; Chan explored an interest in animation , Fu had been a student in electrical engineering and Wang considered a career in economics . After graduation in 2006 , the three moved to the Los Angeles area and continued their venture under the professional name Sketchbook Media . 
 After approximately five years , Wong Fu Productions garnered 1 million subscribers in 2011 . On June 8 , 2013 , Wong Fu Productions celebrated their 10 year anniversary and produced a 13 minute short on June 29 featuring Christine Chen , the surrounding cast of Wong Fu , and many familiar faces , including Ryan Higa , Dominic Sandoval ( D @-@ Trix ) , Kevin Wu ( KevJumba ) , Freddie Wong , Brandon Laatsch , Joe Penna ( <unk> ) and the Fung Brothers . 
 = = Notable productions = = 
 Wong Fu Productions was initially known for its independent music videos of contemporary hit songs such as Maroon 5 's " Sunday Morning " and Jason Mraz 's " I 'm Yours " . Wong Fu released its first major short film called Yellow Fever on January 25 , 2006 . The film , which satirized the topic of interracial dating between Asian Americans and White Americans , brought Wong Fu into recognition among many college students in the United States . 
 A Moment with You , the group 's first feature @-@ length film , premiered on June 3 , 2006 , at their alma mater . It was also screened at the San Diego Asian Film Festival on October 18 , 2006 . The film revolves around two neighbors who share similar romantic situations , in which one person in each relationship cannot let go of his or her past . " A Moment with You " was promoted through a screening tour at high schools and universities around the United States and Canada . In a review for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's student newspaper The Tech , Tina Ro wrote , " Despite its large Asian fan base , <unk> 's [ sic ] movie has a cast of equal numbers of Asians and Caucasians . Furthermore , all the characters were shaped by their own characteristics rather than by their race , a refreshing concept for a movie . " According to The Daily Texan 's Katherine Fan , A Moment with You featured a " more mature , introspective mood than their previous work . " 
 Following the success of A Moment with You , Wong Fu was approached to create a second film called Sleep Shift . However , the project was abandoned after producers disagreed with casting an Asian male in the film 's lead role . Since the end of its first tour , Wong Fu has created music videos for rising artists and continued producing short films . The group 's merchandise line , which included original T @-@ shirt designs , was launched in conjunction with the 2007 film Just a Nice Guy . The short film The Spare was featured at the 2008 San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival , and two additional short films — At Musing 's End and A Peace of Home — were shown at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival Short Films Corner . In September 2009 , Wong Fu released the short film Poser ! , a mockumentary on the history of the peace sign . As of November 2009 , Wong Fu Productions has created more than 130 short films and music videos . Because the group does not require a fee to view its films , it gains a salary from being a YouTube partner , draws profits from merchandise sales , public speaking on university campuses , and music video production for rising Asian American artists . 
 In May 2010 , Wong Fu Productions and Ryan Higa opened talks about creating a major film . The movie was filmed in a one @-@ week period during the summer , and was released to the public on November 23 , while being released on YouTube a day later as Agents of Secret <unk> starring Ryan Higa and Arden Cho . 
 On September 7 , 2011 , Wong Fu Productions announced that they have been hired by multiplatinum Taiwanese pop singer Wang <unk> to direct his upcoming music video " Still In Love With You " . 
 = = = International Secret Agents = = = 
 In the addition to the group 's filmmaking career , Wong Fu Productions has organized a series of multidisciplinary concerts in California . The concert series , International Secret Agents ( ISA ) , featured musical disciplines from urban dance to deejaying with Asian American guest artists such as Far East Movement . Additional guest performances included America 's Best Dance Crew champions Quest Crew and Poreotics , Ryan Higa ( aka Nigahiga ) , Kevin Wu ( aka KevJumba ) , Jay Park , and singers – songwriters David Choi and Kina Grannis . According to Chinese American rapper Jin , " ISA is about self @-@ branding and viral marketing — using YouTube , MySpace , Facebook , and the Internet to promote yourself as an artist . " He asserted , " We as artists are aware of this and make ourselves available [ on these mediums ] . " Far East Movement member <unk> <unk> said , " We want to give back to the community to show that Asians can have an influence today in the U.S. " Additionally , <unk> believed that ISA presented the opportunity to present Asian American talent as cool and mainstream . 
 The first ISA concert was held in September 2008 at the San Gabriel Mission Playhouse in Los Angeles . A second concert was held in March 2009 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco , and both events were attended by a sold @-@ out crowd . The concert returned to Los Angeles in September 2009 and was sponsored by department store J. C. Penney . In 2010 , ISA was held in New York City for the first time . Wong Fu has also expressed interest in holding future ISA concerts in Washington , D.C. They also had another ISA concert in Los Angeles on September 5 . Playing up the name " International Secret Agents , " The LA leg of the 2010 ISA Concert was filled with surprises as secret guests like Nick Cannon showed up to join the performers on stage . 
 On March 30 , 2013 , ISA held and filmed their first game show at YouTube Space Los Angeles . The event had several famous YouTubers including Anthony Lee , Brandon Laatsch , Clara C , David Choi , Freddie Wong , Jen Chae Buescher ( <unk> ) , Mike Song , Ted Fu , Wesley Chan as players , Kevin Wu as the gamemaster named Yoshi , and Amy Okuda and Philip Wang as the hosts .

 Everything Before Us is the first feature film of Wong Fu Productions . Released 23 April 2015 over Vimeo , the film was directed by Phillip Wang and Wesley Chan . The film tells the story of two couples in the near future where the Department of Emotional Integrity ( <unk> ) issues ' relationship scores ' , somewhat like a credit score , that affect couples ' everyday choices . With a nearly all @-@ Asian cast , some of its stars include Aaron Yoo , Brittany Ishibashi , Brandon Soo Hoo , Victoria Park , Randall Park , and Ki Hong Lee .

 Short films released by Wong Fu Productions have received , cumulatively , millions of views , and the group has several thousand fans . According to Wang , the group 's website received 5 @,@ 000 daily hits in 2009 . He expected the audience size to grow " as online video becomes part of everyday life for the up @-@ and @-@ coming generation of movie @-@ watchers " but believed that movie theaters will not become obsolete . University of Southern California digital media expert David Wertheimer also believed that " Wong Fu 's use of new media to tell their community stories and build a business is the wave of the future . " The group 's success has allowed for growth in the popularity of Asian American comedians who promote themselves primarily through YouTube , such as Kevin Wu ( KevJumba ) , Ryan Higa ( Nigahiga ) , Christine <unk> ( <unk> ) , and David Choi . Although grateful for the group 's success and popularity , Wang said , " Some people who go to film school , they 'll make something great but it 's only seen by like , two hundred people [ ... ] It 's kind of not fair . " 
 In a feature by CNN , newscaster Ted Rowlands reported that Wong Fu 's primary audience were " young Asian Americans who often can 't find accurate depictions of themselves in mainstream media " . Through its films , Wong Fu Productions hoped to break the different stereotypes of Asian Americans . 
 Despite this goal , Wong Fu 's films were inspired by the members ' life experiences rather than racial experiences . The group also does not promote political messages through their works but , rather , raises " many APA issues that we feel would fit our brand and image . " They are often considered role models for Asian Americans aspiring to enter the entertainment industry . In response to this , group member Ted Fu said , " We actually didn 't set out to be the ' heroes ' of Asian Americans . It just happened by accident . But now that we 're given this huge responsibility , almost , I feel like it 's our duty to take it seriously . " Wong Fu presented " one of the most <unk> workshops " on sustaining an independent production company at the 2008 Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association Midwest Conference . They were also the keynote speakers at the Intercollegiate Taiwanese American Students Association 2010 West Coast Conference , which was hosted at their alma mater , UC San Diego . 
 In February 2012 , Wang and Chan flew from Los Angeles to Malaysia for the first leg of their Southeast Asia Tour , meeting and greeting over 1000 fans . They were also aired LIVE on <unk> fm , Malaysia 's leading English @-@ language station . In July 2012 , Chan gave the commencement speech at UC San Diego to the graduating class . In June 2016 , Philip Wang gave the commencement speech at UCSD to its graduating class . 
 = Wing Coaster = 
 A Wing Coaster is a type of steel roller coaster manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard where pairs of riders sit on either side of a roller coaster track in which nothing is above or below the riders . Development of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008 leading to the opening of Raptor at Gardaland , the world 's first Wing Coaster , on 1 April 2011 . There are currently eight Wing Coasters operating worldwide . 
 = = History = = 
 According to Walter Bolliger , development of the Wing Coaster began between 2007 and 2008 . In 2010 , Bolliger & Mabillard announced a prototype Wing Coaster design that would be built at Merlin Entertainments ' Gardaland . It became known as Raptor , which opened on 1 April 2011 . A year later , Merlin Entertainments opened a second Wing Coaster on 15 March 2012 , called The Swarm at Thorpe Park . 
 In the United States , the first Wing Coaster to be announced was X @-@ Flight , which opened at Six Flags Great America on 16 May 2012 . Dollywood 's Wild Eagle actually opened earlier on 24 March 2012 , making it the first Wing Coaster in North America . On 13 August 2012 , Cedar Point announced plans to build a new Wing Coaster called GateKeeper , which set new records for a Wing Coaster including longest track length , fastest speed and drop height . The first Wing Coaster in Asia , Parrot Coaster , opened at Ocean Kingdom on 25 January 2014 . Thorpe Park announced that the last two rows of The Swarm would be turned backwards – a first for a Wing Coaster – for the 2013 season . On 24 July 2014 , Holiday World & <unk> ' Safari announced Thunderbird , the first launched Wing Coaster . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design of a Wing Coaster differs from many traditional steel roller coaster . Unlike many roller coasters , the trains for a Wing Coaster are not located above or below the track but rather on the sides . With the trains in this configuration , there is nothing above or below the riders giving the feeling that they are flying freely . Also , because there is nothing on top of the track and only steel beams holding each ends of the train together , all current Wing Coasters have an object ( that relates to the theme ) that covers the steel beams and adds to the experience . The restraints on the trains are also different . Instead of simply having the traditional over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraint bar as used on many inverted roller coasters , the Wing Coaster uses similar restraints as Bolliger & Mabillard 's Flying Coaster which includes a " cover " and a restraint that sits on the rider 's waist holding them in place with bars on the side for the rider to hold on to . The differences are not only within the train but also the layout of the station . This is because the layout of the station for a Wing Coaster requires the queue to split in two halves . This allows riders to board the train where the seats sit level with the track .

 Bolliger & Mabillard has built eight Wing Coasters as of November 2015 . The roller coasters are listed in order of opening dates . 
 = = Similar rides = = 
 Prior to the development of the Wing Coaster , in 2007 , Intamin debuted a version of their Accelerator Coaster with modified trains similar to those used on 4th Dimension roller coasters and Wing Coasters . Known as a Wing Rider Coaster , Furius Baco at PortAventura was the first and currently only ride of its type . It launches riders from 0 to 135 kilometres per hour ( 84 mph ) in 3 @.@ 5 seconds with trains that seat six rows of four people ( two on either side of the track ) . 
 In addition to the Wing Rider Coaster , Intamin has also introduced a model named Wing Coaster . The first installation was <unk> at Hersheypark in 2012 . The trains feature 2 seats are still positioned over the track and have a floor , while 2 hang over the side which are the " wings " . 
 The Wing Coaster is also similar to John F. Mares ' 4th Dimension roller coaster concept from the 1990s . However , unlike 4th Dimension roller coasters , cars on a Wing Coaster train do not spin — they are locked in place . Examples of 4th Dimension roller coasters include X2 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and <unk> at Fuji @-@ Q Highland .

Jules is able to relate well to Glenn , particularly because Glenn seems to have a mother @-@ son bond with her son , Gabriel , as close as Jules has with Travis . Ellie ( Christa Miller ) is skeptical about Glenn 's qualifications , and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her . 
 Grayson ( Josh Hopkins ) decides that he wants to spend a day away from Jules for some space , sending Jules spiralling . She starts tracking down Glenn outside of therapy sessions to talk .

 Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest appearance on " All Mixed Up " . Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year prior to the confirmation , and upon hearing of it , Cougar Town co @-@ creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations . Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series , but had not contacted her or her representatives . Eventually , Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that " nothing 's happened yet " . He continued in his interview with E !

I would love it to happen and the second it did I would tell everybody in the world , but nothing 's happened . " 
 Lawrence confirmed her appearance in July 2010 and revealed that Aniston attained the role of Bonnie , the psychiatrist for Jules . " Kind of a get @-@ too @-@ involved @-@ in @-@ her @-@ life @-@ type of therapist , " he retorted . " Those guys are so close in real life they kind of do that for each other anyway . Bonnie has the life Jules wishes she has . " Aniston had previously worked with Courteney Cox in the American sitcom Friends , and again on the serial drama Dirt . Aniston became the second cast member from Friends to appear on the television series , succeeding Lisa Kudrow , who previously appeared in the season one episode " Rhino Skin " , also playing the role of a medical professional ( specifically , a dermatologist ) . 
 Cox wanted the show to establish itself before opting for an appearance by Aniston . Lawrence stated that it took a considerable length of time to lay on the foundation of Cougar Town ; " And once we did and once it was clicking , I think that not only did Courteney feel comfortable talking to Jen about doing it , but comfortable in how funny she thinks the show is and that Jen would like it and fit into this world really well . " He added : " It starts and ends with Courteney and Jennifer being really great friends and excited to work together again — especially doing comedy together . Every day that those two talk they have more ideas about [ the role ] . It 's definitely something they ’ re both involved in creatively . " 
 Bill Lawrence expressed that he hoped that Aniston 's guest appearance would mark a turning point in viewership opinions , and felt that the show had distanced itself from its original concept . " I want as many people as I can get to see what the show kind of became last year , " Lawrence articulated . " It went from a typical TV show trying to find itself to something that I ’ m really proud of and like and think is really funny . "

 " All Mixed Up " was well received by television critics . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V.

He asserted : " Cougar Town hasn 't taken as big of a step up from season one to season two as it did from the first part of season one to the last part of season one . But the step from ' average ' to ' good ' was the easy part . Season two is the season where viewers are going to find out if the show has what it takes to make the small steps needed to get from ' good ' to ' great ' . There 's every indication that it 's on the way there in the premiere because it 's finally started to wrestle with some of the <unk> questions at its center .

" 
 Commentators cited Jennifer Aniston 's appearance as the highlight of the episode . Entertainment Weekly 's Annie Barrett lauded the interactions between Aniston and Cox ; " Their interactions were along the lines of what I imagine it would have been like if Rachel 's character had suddenly decided she had become a wizard . " Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic echoed synonymous thoughts , and felt that Aniston 's performance reminded the audience of her star power . Fallon wrote : " Aniston 's performance was delightfully weird and offbeat — and comedically sharp , a welcome change from the generic and bland film roles she 's played in the years since Friends ended . Last night 's performance spotlighted her gifts as a character actress — and served as a frustrating reminder of what we 've been missing since she has [ all but ] abandoned that niche of acting .

It was produced and co @-@ written by Lloyd Webber and directed by Joel Schumacher . It stars Gerard Butler in the title role , Emmy Rossum as Christine Daaé , Patrick Wilson as Raoul , Miranda Richardson as Madame Giry , and Minnie Driver as Carlotta Giudicelli . 
 The film was announced in 1989 but production did not start until 2002 due to Lloyd Webber 's divorce and Schumacher 's busy career . It was shot entirely at Pinewood Studios , with scenery created with miniatures and computer graphics . Rossum , Wilson , and Driver had singing experience , but Butler had none and so had music lessons . The Phantom of the Opera grossed approximately $ 154 million worldwide , despite receiving mixed to negative reviews , which praised the visuals and acting but criticized the writing and directing .

The Vicomte de <unk> purchases a papier @-@ mâché music box in the shape of a monkey and eyes it sadly as Madame Giry , an aged woman dressed in black , watches him .

" As it flickers to life and slowly ascends to its original place in the rafters , the audience is transported back in time to the year 1870 . 
 Back to this time , while the company rehearses for a performance of the grand opera Hannibal , manager Monsieur Lefèvre announces that he has decided to retire and that the Opéra has been purchased by Richard Firmin and Gilles André , two men who have no experience with the arts whatsoever . When resident soprano Carlotta Giudicelli begins to sing for the managers , a backdrop collapses and causes everyone to blame the " Opéra Ghost " , a mysterious figure who is rumored to live in the catacombs beneath the theater . Carlotta refuses to sing and storms offstage , leaving Firmin and André no choice but to cancel the performance . At the last minute , ballet mistress Madame Giry suggests that dancer Christine Daaé take Carlotta 's place as she has been " well taught . " The managers reluctantly agree and , to their surprise , Christine wins them over . 
 Later that night , after Christine 's triumphant stage debut , she explains to Madame Giry 's daughter Meg that she is being coached by a mysterious tutor who she refers to as the " Angel of Music " ; a tutor who her late father said would teach her to sing . Christine returns to her dressing room to find Raoul , the Opéra 's new patron and her former childhood sweetheart , waiting for her . The two reminisce about their youth as Christine tells Raoul her secret , only for him to laugh at her " fantasy " and invite her to dinner despite her protests . Unbeknownst to everyone , except Madame Giry , the Phantom of the Opéra locks Christine in her dressing room and reveals himself to her before taking her to his subterranean lair . 
 The Phantom reveals to her that he loves her and wants her to love him back . He shows Christine a bust of herself , wearing a wedding dress and veil , causing her to faint , and the Phantom places her in a bed . The next morning she awakes to find the Phantom writing music . She approaches him and removes his mask out of curiosity . He bursts into a fit of rage , covering his face with his hand . He at first says she must stay forever because she saw his deformities , revealing that he " dreams of beauty " . <unk> him Christine hands him back his mask and the two have a moment of understanding . He then decides to return her to the opera house . 
 That morning , the two managers lament Christine 's disappearance , as well as series of notes they received from the Opera Ghost trying to blackmail them for his payment and ordering them on how to run the opera house . When Carlotta returns , she is furious to find a note sent to her saying if she sang as the countess in Il Muto that night instead of Christine , then disaster " beyond [ their ] imagination " would occur . Firmin and André ignore the ghost 's warnings and give Carlotta the lead role . That night , the Phantom interrupts the performance and criticizes their failure to follow his orders . 
 Carlotta continues to sing , but her voice croaks and the lead role is given to Christine . While the ballet is being performed , the Phantom encounters the chief stagehand Joseph <unk> and strangles him before hanging him from above , creating chaos . Christine flees to the roof with Raoul . She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom 's face and fears him , but also pities him because of his sadness . Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her <unk> . Christine returns his love , kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof . The Phantom , who witnessed the scene , becomes heartbroken . He then hears them both singing together . Growing furious at Raoul , he vows revenge on them both . 
 Three months later , a masquerade party ensues in the opera house . At the party , Christine wears her new engagement ring from Raoul . The event is interrupted once again by the Phantom , who is dressed as Red Death . The Phantom brings his own composition , Don Juan Triumphant , and orders the managers to stage the opera . Raoul exits the room and Christine approaches the Phantom . At the sight of the engagement ring , the Phantom rips it from Christine and disappears into a trap on the floor . Raoul tries to follow him but is stopped by Madame Giry , who privately tells him the story of the Phantom 's past . When she was a little girl , she went to a freak circus where they featured a deformed child in a cage . The child was beaten while everyone watched and laughed . The ringmaster then removed a burlap sack covering the child 's face , revealing his deformity . Only the young Madame Giry pitied him . She was the last to leave and saw the child strangle the ringmaster with a rope . Chased by the police , Madame Giry helped him escape and found shelter for him beneath the opera house , where she has hidden him from the world ever since . 
 Christine takes a carriage to visit her father 's grave , but the Phantom secretly takes over the reins . Raoul follows when he realizes she 's gone . Christine arrives and laments over her father 's death . The Phantom tries to win her back by pretending to be her father 's angel , but Raoul arrives and stops him . A sword fight ensues in the cemetery , where Raoul eventually disarms the Phantom and is about to kill him , but Christine pleads for him not to . His rage seemingly augmented , the Phantom watches angrily as Christine and Raoul ride away . 
 Christine admits she is afraid of the Phantom and tells Raoul he will never stop trying to recapture her . Raoul realizes that they can use the Phantom 's opera to capture him , as he will surely attend . Don Juan Triumphant is performed , and the Phantom makes his entrance ( having secretly replaced the lead ) with Christine . Raoul can do nothing but watch from his box as Christine falls for the Phantom yet again . However , she once again removes his mask , revealing his deformities to the entire audience , who scream in fear . He escapes with her by dropping the chandelier and setting the opera house on fire . 
 The Phantom brings Christine back down to his lair . Madame Giry shows Raoul where the Phantom lives , and he goes to rescue Christine . The Phantom forces Christine to don the wedding dress and once again professes his love , and orders Christine to marry him . Christine tries to convince the Phantom that she does not fear his ugliness , but rather his anger and willingness to kill to get what he wants . Just then , Raoul enters the lair , and the Phantom ties him to a gate and threatens to kill him if Christine refuses to marry him . Christine reflects over the impossible choice before passionately kissing the Phantom to show him he is not alone in the world . The Phantom is shocked from experiencing real human love for the first time in his life . Ashamed of his murderous actions , he allows Christine and Raoul to leave and orders them to never return . He finds comfort in a little monkey music box . Christine approaches the Phantom , who tells her that he loves her , and she silently gives him the diamond ring from her finger to remember her by . After Christine and Raoul leave , the Phantom smashes every mirror in his underground lair and disappears through a secret passage behind a velvet curtain just before the police arrive . Upon entering , Meg finds only the Phantom 's white mask . 
 Moving back to 1919 , the elderly Raoul visits Christine 's gravesite and places the music box near her tombstone . He stands in silence for a moment and then turns to leave , but stops upon noticing a red rose with a black ribbon tied around the stem lying on the ground with Christine 's engagement ring attached to it ; implying that the Phantom still lives and still loves Christine .

 Warner Bros. purchased the film rights to The Phantom of the Opera in early 1989 , granting Andrew Lloyd Webber total artistic control . Despite interest from A @-@ list directors , Lloyd Webber and Warner Bros. instantly hired Joel Schumacher to direct ; Lloyd Webber had been impressed with Schumacher 's use of music in The Lost Boys . The duo wrote the screenplay that same year , while Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman were cast to reprise their roles from the original stage production . Filming was set to begin at Pinewood Studios in England in July 1990 , under a $ 25 million budget . 
 However , the start date was pushed to November 1990 at both Babelsberg Studios in Munich , Germany and Barrandov Studios in Prague , Czech Republic . Production for The Phantom of the Opera was stalled with Lloyd Webber and Brightman 's divorce . " Everything got tied up in settlements " , Schumacher reflected . " Then my career took off and I was really busy . " As a result , The Phantom of the Opera languished in development limbo for Warner Bros. throughout the 1990s . In February 1997 , Schumacher considered returning , but eventually dropped out in favour of Batman Unchained , Runaway Jury and Dreamgirls . The studio was keen to cast John Travolta for the lead role , but also held discussions with Antonio Banderas , who undertook vocal preparation and sang the role of the Phantom in the TV special Andrew Lloyd Webber : The Royal Albert Hall Celebration . 
 Schumacher and Lloyd Webber restarted development for The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002 . It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber 's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. in an attempt to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently . As a result , Lloyd Webber invested $ 6 million of his own money . The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $ 55 million budget . A further $ 15 million was used for marketing , bringing the final budget to $ 70 million . Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution ; the studio did not sign on until June 2003 , when the principal cast was chosen .

 Hugh Jackman was offered the chance to audition for the Phantom , but he faced scheduling conflicts with Van Helsing . " They rang to ask about my availability " , Jackman explained in an April 2003 interview , " probably about 20 other actors as well . I wasn 't available , unfortunately . So , that was a bummer . " " We needed somebody who has a bit of rock and roll sensibility in him " , Andrew Lloyd Webber explained . " He 's got to be a bit rough , a bit dangerous ; not a conventional singer . Christine is attracted to the Phantom because he 's the right side of danger . " Director Joel Schumacher had been impressed with Gerard Butler 's performance in Dracula 2000 . Prior to his audition , Butler had no professional singing experience and had only taken four voice lessons before singing " The Music of the Night " for Lloyd Webber . 
 Katie Holmes , who began working with a vocal coach , was the front @-@ runner for Christine Daaé in March 2003 . She was later replaced by Anne Hathaway , a classically trained soprano , in 2004 . However , Hathaway dropped out of the role because the production schedule of the film overlapped with The Princess Diaries 2 : Royal Engagement , which she was contractually obligated to make . Hathaway was then replaced with Emmy Rossum . The actress modeled the relationship between the Phantom and Christine after Suzanne Farrell and George Balanchine . Patrick Wilson was cast as Raoul based on his previous Broadway theatre career . For the role of Carlotta , Minnie Driver devised an over @-@ the @-@ top , camp performance as the egotistical prima donna . Despite also lacking singing experience , Ciarán Hinds was cast by Schumacher as Richard Firmin ; the two had previously worked together on Veronica Guerin . Ramin <unk> also briefly appears as the portrait of Gustave Daaé , Christine 's father . <unk> later played the Phantom as well as the role of Raoul on London 's West End . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography lasted from 15 September 2003 to 15 January 2004 . The film was shot entirely using eight sound stages at Pinewood Studios , where , on the Pinewood backlot , the bottom half exterior of the Palais Garnier was constructed . The top half was implemented using a combination of computer @-@ generated imagery ( CGI ) and a scale model created by Cinesite . The surrounding Paris skyline for " All I Ask of You " was entirely composed of matte paintings . Cinesite also created a miniature falling chandelier , since a life @-@ size model was too big for the actual set . 
 Production designer Anthony D. G. Pratt was influenced by French architect Charles Garnier , designer of the original Paris opera house , as well as Edgar Degas , John Singer Sargent , Gustave <unk> , the Pre @-@ Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti . Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau 's Beauty and the Beast ( 1946 ) , where a hallway is lined with arms holding candelabra . The cemetery was based on the Père Lachaise and Montparnasse . Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black , white , gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball .

 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The film received mixed to negative reviews from film critics . Rotten Tomatoes gives it 32 % rotten with an average score of 5 / 10 . " The music of the night has hit something of a sour note : Critics are calling the screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's popular musical histrionic , boring and lacking in both romance and danger " , the consensus read . " Still , some have praised the film for its sheer spectacle " . By comparison , Metacritic calculated an average score of 40 / 100 from its 39 reviews collected . 
 Despite having been impressed with the cast , Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote that " Teen romance and operetta @-@ style singing replace the horror elements familiar to film @-@ goers , and director Joel Schumacher obscures any remnants of classy stage spectacle with the same disco overkill he brought to Batman Forever . " Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com believed that Phantom of the Opera " takes everything that 's wrong with Broadway and puts it on the big screen in a gaudy splat . " 
 In a mixed review for Newsweek , David Ansen praised Rossum 's performance , but criticized the filmmakers for their focus on visual design rather than presenting a cohesive storyline . " Its kitschy romanticism bored me on Broadway and it bores me here — I may not be the most reliable witness . Still , I can easily imagine a more dashing , charismatic Phantom than Butler 's . Rest assured , however , Lloyd Webber 's neo @-@ <unk> songs are reprised and reprised and reprised until you 're guaranteed to go out humming . " Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly believed Schumacher did not add enough dimension in adapting The Phantom of the Opera . " Schumacher , the man who added nipples to Batman 's suit , has staged Phantom chastely , as if his job were to adhere the audience to every note " . 
 Roger Ebert reasoned that " part of the pleasure of movie @-@ going is pure spectacle — of just sitting there and looking at great stuff and knowing it looks terrific . There wasn 't much Schumacher could have done with the story or the music he was handed , but in the areas over which he held sway , he has triumphed . " In contrasting between the popularity of the Broadway musical , Michael Dequina of Film Threat magazine explained that " it conjures up this unexplainable spell that leaves audiences sad , sentimental , swooning , smiling — in some way transported and moved . Now , in Schumacher 's film , that spell lives on . "

He subsequently gets drunk and has to make a run for the bathroom , knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom . Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center . Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys , driving on to the field then performing a massively @-@ choreographed version of the song " Shipoopi " after scoring one touchdown . He is traded to the London Silly Nannies , who apparently have no clue on how to play football . Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots . On the opening kickoff , Peter 's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away , leaving Peter to face them alone . He tries and is immediately tackled .

 " Patriot Games " was written by Mike Henry and directed by Peter Shin , Pete Michels and Cyndi Tang . The episode aired on January 29 , 2006 , a week before Super Bowl XL . Actress Carol Channing made a guest appearance as herself in a scene in which Brian loses a $ 50 bet on a boxing match between her and professional boxer Mike Tyson , though Tyson did not voice himself . Sportscaster Bob Costas also voiced himself in a short scene in which he interviews Peter and Brady . Much of the episode was scripted with Patriots coach Bill Belichick in mind , but Tom Brady was chosen to replace him . After numerous requests for Brady to voice himself in the episode , he eventually agreed . Comedian Jay Leno voiced himself in two short scenes that show him , respectively , threatening and attempting to kill Brady . 
 Two scenes in which Stewie graphically beats up Brian using a glass filled with orange juice , various household objects , and guns polarized people who viewed it . Several production members were offended . Cast members — as well as MacFarlane 's mother and an animal rights advocate — enjoyed the scene ; MacFarlane quoted his mother : " I don 't see what the problem is ? He ( Brian ) owed him ( Stewie ) money ! " , and so it was kept in the final cut . When Lois gives the finger to the camera during the interview with Peter and Brady , her hand was blurred out on Fox airings of the episode . However , reruns on Adult Swim and TBS left the gesture intact . The gesture was also left intact on the Volume Four DVD ; the production team enjoyed having this level of freedom . After the initial airing of the episode , where newscaster Tom Tucker announces a report on a fictional curse word , <unk> , many viewers looked up the word on the Internet to try to find a definition . MacFarlane stated in the episode 's DVD commentary that if someone invents an obscene definition for the word , the show will have to stop using it ( it has not been used since this episode ) . 
 The bathroom scene was reused for a series of YouTube videos promoting the 2009 Primetime Emmy Award nomination of Family Guy for Outstanding Comedy Series , which feature Brian considering voting for fellow nominees The Office , Flight of the Conchords , Entourage , 30 Rock , How I Met Your Mother and Weeds . In the first five videos , Stewie beats up Brian for his different votes asking " Where 's my Emmy man ? " and forces him to vote for Family Guy . In the last video , when Brian thinks about voting for Weeds , Stewie doesn 't beat him up and instead says , " Oh , fuck this . I 'm not doing one for fucking Weeds . " referring to the declining quality of the show .

 The episode features a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ minute rendition of the song " Shipoopi " from the 1957 musical The Music Man , conducted by Peter and performed by the Patriots and people in the stadium . The rendition was directed by Dan Povenmire , who would later go on to co @-@ create Phineas and Ferb with fellow Family Guy worker Jeff " Swampy " Marsh . The original number in The Music Man was performed by around 40 or 50 singers and around 80 other musicians , as estimated by MacFarlane . Family Guy 's rendition was recorded by an orchestra not as large as the original 's , but one of the largest the show has ever used . Another musical number , in which the London Silly Nannies sing while dancing around a maypole , was taken from the Gilbert and Sullivan production The Sorcerer . A visual joke that shows Peter 's $ 30 @,@ 000 wax sculpture of Harriet Tubman " doing " a naked Gwyneth Paltrow originally featured the droid R2 @-@ D2 from Star Wars in place of Tubman .

 = Medieval Merchant 's House = 
 The Medieval Merchant 's House is a restored late @-@ 13th @-@ century building in Southampton , Hampshire , England . Built in about 1290 by John Fortin , a prosperous merchant , the house survived many centuries of domestic and commercial use largely intact . German bomb damage in 1940 revealed the medieval interior of the house , and in the 1980s it was restored to resemble its initial appearance and placed in the care of English Heritage , to be run as a tourist attraction . The house is built to a medieval right @-@ angle , narrow plan design , with an undercroft to store wine at a constant temperature , and a first @-@ storey bedchamber that projects out into the street to add additional space . The building is architecturally significant because , as historian Glyn <unk> highlights , it is " the only building of its type to survive substantially as first built " ; it is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument .

 = = = 13th to 15th centuries = = = 
 The Medieval Merchant 's House was built in about 1290 on French Street , Southampton , then a major port and a large provincial town with a population of around 5 @,@ 000 , grown rich from the trade with England 's continental possessions in Europe . The area of Southampton around French Street had been re @-@ planned earlier in the century , reducing the numbers of farm animals kept in and around the houses , driving poorer merchants and craftsmen into the less desirable northern half of the city , and creating a quarter of large , impressive houses , often built in stone with tiled roofs . The original house was designed for use by John Fortin , a prosperous wine merchant , with a vaulted cellar for holding stock , a shop at the front of the property and accommodation for the family ; much of it was built in stone , but it featured a timber front , a fashionable design for the period . At least 60 other houses similar to the Medieval Merchant 's House were built in Southampton at around the same time . 
 By the 1330s , Southampton 's prosperity was in a slow decline . In 1338 there was a successful French attack on the town , during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged . The house may have been one of those damaged in the raid , as the south @-@ western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt ; other alterations , including the addition of a fireplace , may have been carried out at the same time . Southampton 's economy collapsed in the aftermath of the attacks and never fully recovered . The character of French Street began to change , as many houses were sub @-@ divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings . The Medieval Merchant 's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas <unk> and John <unk> , the latter a descendent of John Fortin , for whom the house was originally built . 
 During the 15th century the economy of Southampton improved as a result of the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants . The Medieval Merchant 's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants , but it remained intact as a detached dwelling , unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century . In the middle of the 16th century , however , Southampton 's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined , taking with it the prosperity of French Street . A new parlour was installed in the house , and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space . 
 = = = 16th to 20th centuries = = = 
 The house was transformed into three cottages during the 17th century , which involved a new door and additional fireplaces being added . The economy and status of Southampton did not begin to improve until the 18th century , when it became a noted cultural centre . In 1780 the three cottages were converted back into a single building , owned by a Mrs Collins as a lodging house for actors . During the Victorian era Southampton saw a huge expansion of its maritime docks and the construction of a new railway line . The Medieval Merchant 's House was converted again , and had become a beer @-@ shop by 1883 , and a popular public house called the Bull 's Head . 
 = = = Late 20th and 21st centuries = = = 
 When the Second World War broke out in 1939 the house was being used as a brothel . In 1940 Southampton was heavily targeted during the Blitz . German bombs seriously damaged the house , revealing its medieval interior , and as a result Southampton City Council bought the property . In 1972 it was passed to the Secretary of State for the Environment , before being placed into the care of English Heritage in 1984 . 
 The decision was taken to restore the Medieval Merchant 's House as a tourist attraction , and the necessary work was carried out between 1983 and 1985 . Academic Raphael Samuel has noted that the restoration was heavily influenced by the late @-@ 20th @-@ century tradition of living history , in which " reinterpretation " gives way to " retrofitting " . The process was also constrained by the damage that had occurred to the post @-@ medieval parts of the building during the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Following archaeological investigations , the house was restored as closely as possible to its medieval condition , removing later material . Where the original medieval parts of the house had been lost , the work was based on archaeological reinterpretation . The finished house was fitted with replica late @-@ 13th @-@ century and 14th @-@ century furniture , and the uniform for the English Heritage staff running the house was originally medieval in design . 
 The Medieval Merchant 's House on 58 French Street remains a tourist attraction and is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Medieval Merchant 's House today faces onto French Street and combines walls built of Bembridge and Purbeck stone with a timber frontage . The layout of the house follows a medieval right @-@ angle , narrow plan design , in that the hall stretches away from the street to conserve frontage , and there is no internal courtyard built into the design . Architecturally the house is important because , as historian Glyn <unk> highlights , it is " the only building of its type to survive substantially as first built " . 
 At the front of the house , on the ground floor , is a reconstructed medieval shop front , from where the owner would have conducted his mercantile business . Behind this is the central hall , originally designed with an open hearth in the middle , but now fitted with a 14th @-@ century Flemish chimney , plastered so as to resemble brickwork . A hallway runs along one side of the hall ; hallways were a traditional feature of the period , although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively . At the rear of the property is an inner private room , with a decorative ceiling . Beneath the house is an undercroft , or cellar , designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature ; the brick floor is 18th @-@ century in origin , however . This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns , including Winchester and London . 
 On the first floor the house is split into east and west bedchambers , linked across the central hall by a gallery . The east bedchamber is at the front of the house , and projects out into the street — this was a feature used to add space to houses , and is also seen in properties in Shrewsbury , Tewkesbury and York . Some of the makers ' marks of the original builders can still be seen on the timbers in the room . The west bedchamber more closely resembles its 19th @-@ century appearance rather than the medieval , as the Victorian @-@ era ceiling has been left in place . The roof of the house is an identical replacement for the medieval original , tiled with Cornish slate . 
 = New Jersey Route 47 = 
 Route 47 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey , United States . It runs 75 @.@ 20 mi ( 121 @.@ 02 km ) from Atlantic Avenue in Wildwood , Cape May County north to U.S. Route 130 in Brooklawn , Camden County . It is also referred to as Delsea Drive , as it connects the Delaware River near Brooklawn to the Atlantic Ocean ( the sea ) in Wildwood . This name was assigned by the New Jersey Legislature in 1933 . The route runs through rural areas of Cape May and southern Cumberland counties as a two @-@ lane road . Traffic jams along this portion of Route 47 are commonplace in the summer vacation season and can stretch for miles due to the missing southern section of Route 55 , where all Jersey Shore @-@ bound traffic enters the small two @-@ lane road . North of here , the route runs through the cities of Millville and Vineland before entering Gloucester County , where it passes through more rural areas as well as Clayton and Glassboro . Past Glassboro , it heads through suburban areas in Washington and Deptford townships before running through Westville and Brooklawn . Route 47 is the longest state route in New Jersey . 
 What is now Route 47 was originally designated as part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 15 between Rio Grande in 1917 and as a branch of pre @-@ 1927 Route 20 between Millville and Westville in 1923 . In 1927 , Route 47 was designated to run from Tuckahoe to Brooklawn , following current Route 49 south of Millville . Meanwhile , current Route 47 was a part of Route 49 between South Dennis and Millville and Route S49 between Rio Grande and South Dennis . The latter was extended to Wildwood in 1938 . Route 47 and Route 49 were shifted onto their current alignments south of Millville in 1953 . Since then , Route 47 has seen a few improvements and modifications including realignment in Millville and the reconstruction of the intersection with Route 83 in Dennis Township .

 = = History = = 
 What is now Route 47 was originally designated as a segment of pre @-@ 1927 Route 15 between Rio Grande and Millville in 1917 , and as one of two branches of pre @-@ 1927 Route 20 between Millville and Westville in 1923 . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 47 was legislated to run from Route 50 in Tuckahoe to Brooklawn , following present @-@ day Route 49 between Tuckahoe and Millville and its current alignment north of Millville . Meanwhile , the present @-@ day alignment of Route 47 between the current Route 83 intersection in South Dennis and Millville was designated a part of Route 49 while the current alignment between South Dennis and U.S. Route 9 / Route 4 in Rio Grande became Route S49 , a spur of Route 49 . In 1933 , the New Jersey Legislature named Route 47 Delsea Drive after a reporter for the Woodbury Times joked how the road connected the <unk> River to the Atlantic SEA . Route S49 was extended from Rio Grande to Park Boulevard in Wildwood in 1938 . In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 47 and Route 49 switched alignments south and east of Millville and Route 47 replaced Route S49 south to Wildwood . 
 By the 1980s , Route 47 was moved from High Street to North Second Street through the northern part of Millville . An alternate route of Route 47 was eventually created to the east along county routes in Cape May and Cumberland counties ; this eventually became Route 347 by the 1990s . In the 2000s , Rio Grande Avenue in Wildwood received improvements to make it reminisce the doo wop atmosphere the beach resort is known for . The Route 47 bridge over Dennis Creek in Dennis Township and the Route 83 intersection received improvements that were completed in July 2007 . The Route 47 bridge over the creek was structurally deficient and in need of replacing . The job was completed with wider shoulders and a wider sidewalk on the new bridge . The intersection between Route 47 and Route 83 was also realigned and had signals installed .

 Ryan Gauld ( born 16 December 1995 ) is a Scottish professional footballer who currently plays as an attacking midfielder for Portuguese club Vitória F.C. on loan from Sporting Clube de Portugal and the Scotland national under @-@ 21 football team . 
 He began his professional career at Dundee United , where he helped them reach the 2014 Scottish Cup Final and his abilities on the ball earned comparisons to Lionel Messi from the Scottish media . In July 2014 , he transferred to Sporting for a fee of around £ 3 million , and has mainly appeared for the club 's B team . Gauld also represented Scotland at under @-@ 19 level , and has been called up for their senior squad .

 On 4 November 2013 , during the 2013 – 14 season , Gauld 's contract was further extended , to run until May 2016 . Five days later , he scored twice in a 4 – 0 win against Motherwell at Fir Park . On 15 December 2013 , the Daily Record reported that Manchester United 's Scottish manager David Moyes wanted to personally " scout " Gauld , and take the opportunity to run the rule over the potential of other young Dundee United players such as defenders John Souttar and Andrew Robertson . However , the following day , also his 18th birthday , Gauld 's contract was further extended until May 2017 . Around the same time , he was being tracked by English Premier League pair Everton and Liverpool , Italy 's A.S. Roma and Spain 's Real Madrid . 
 On 12 April 2014 , Gauld played in the Scottish Cup semi @-@ final at Ibrox , as United defeated hosts Rangers 3 – 1 to advance to the Final . He made the run into the penalty area from which Stuart Armstrong scored the opening goal , and assisted the second from Gary Mackay @-@ Steven . Five days later , he was shortlisted for the PFA Scotland Young Player of the Year award , which was eventually awarded to his teammate Robertson . In the Cup Final on 17 May , Gauld replaced Mackay @-@ Steven for the final 26 minutes as Dundee United lost 2 – 0 to St Johnstone at Celtic Park .

 He made his debut for Sporting B on 10 August 2014 , replacing Palhinha at half time in a 1 – 0 defeat away to Farense . Seventeen days later , in his fourth match for the club , he scored for the first time , netting the second in a 3 – 0 home victory over Desportivo Aves . On 7 December , he scored a second goal , opening a 4 – 3 win at Lisbon neighbours Clube Oriental de Lisboa with a 20 @-@ yard volley . On 21 December , he was sent off for two bookings in a 3 – 1 triumph at Vitória de Guimarães B. He finished the season with three goals from 26 games for the B @-@ team , the third coming on 7 February 2015 , when he equalised as the team came from behind to win 2 – 1 against SC <unk> . 
 Gauld made his debut for the first team on 29 December 2014 in a Taça da Liga game against Vitória S.C. , playing the full 90 minutes in a 2 – 0 win . On his second start for the Sporting first team on 14 January 2015 , Gauld was named man of the match in a 1 – 0 win in the same competition , against Boavista .

 = = Style of play = = 
 Gauld 's ability on the ball , and his small and slight stature , led him to be compared to Lionel Messi , a comparison made by the British press since 2013 . At Dundee United , he was tutored by Ian <unk> , who favoured creativity and passing over the physicality often expected in Scottish football . After his transfer to Sporting , BBC Sport columnist Richard Wilson predicted that Gauld would be better suited to the style of football in Portugal , due to its slower tempo and its concentration on a passing game . Gauld himself has spoken of his preference for Portuguese football over its Scottish equivalent , and expressed relief at the lower media interest in him at Sporting , opining that comparisons with Messi were exaggerated and premature .

 = Columbia River = 
 The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . The river rises in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia , Canada . It flows northwest and then south into the US state of Washington , then turns west to form most of the border between Washington and the state of Oregon before emptying into the Pacific Ocean . The river is 1 @,@ 243 miles ( 2 @,@ 000 km ) long , and its largest tributary is the Snake River . Its drainage basin is roughly the size of France and extends into seven US states and a Canadian province . 
 By volume , the Columbia is the fourth @-@ largest river in the United States ; it has the greatest flow of any North American river draining into the Pacific . The river 's heavy flow and its relatively steep gradient gives it tremendous potential for the generation of electricity . The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia 's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44 % of total U.S. hydroelectric generation - much more hydroelectric power than those of any other North American river . 
 The Columbia and its tributaries have been central to the region 's culture and economy for thousands of years . They have been used for transportation since ancient times , linking the many cultural groups of the region . The river system hosts many species of anadromous fish , which migrate between freshwater habitats and the saline Pacific Ocean . These fish — especially the salmon species — provided the core subsistence for native peoples ; in past centuries , Indigenous peoples traveled across western North America to the Columbia to trade for fish . 
 In the late 18th century , a private American ship became the first non @-@ indigenous vessel to enter the river ; it was followed by a British explorer , who navigated past the Oregon Coast Range into the Willamette Valley . In the following decades , fur trading companies used the Columbia as a key transportation route . Overland explorers entered the Willamette Valley through the scenic but treacherous Columbia River Gorge , and pioneers began to settle the valley in increasing numbers , following both routes to enter it . Steamships along the river linked communities and facilitated trade ; the arrival of railroads in the late 19th century , many running along the river , supplemented these links . 
 Since the late 19th century , public and private sectors have heavily developed the river . The development , commonly referred to as taming or harnessing of the river , has been massive and multi @-@ faceted . To aid ship and barge navigation , locks have been built along the lower Columbia and its tributaries , and dredging has opened , maintained , and enlarged shipping channels . Since the early 20th century , dams have been built across the river for the purposes of power generation , navigation , irrigation , and flood control . Today , a dam @-@ impounded reservoir lies along nearly every US mile of the once free @-@ flowing river , and much of the Canadian stretch has been impounded as well . Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river . Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site , which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US . All these developments have had a tremendous impact on river environments , mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration . 
 = = Course = = 
 The Columbia begins its 1 @,@ 243 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 000 km ) journey in the southern Rocky Mountain Trench in British Columbia ( BC ) . Columbia Lake – 2 @,@ 690 feet ( 820 m ) above sea level – and the adjoining Columbia Wetlands form the river 's headwaters . The trench is a broad , deep , and long glacial valley between the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia Mountains in BC . For its first 200 miles ( 320 km ) , the Columbia flows northwest along the trench through Windermere Lake and the town of Invermere , a region known in British Columbia as the Columbia Valley , then northwest to Golden and into <unk> Lake . Rounding the northern end of the Selkirk Mountains , the river turns sharply south through a region known as the Big Bend Country , passing through Revelstoke Lake and the Arrow Lakes . Revelstoke , the Big Bend , and the Columbia Valley combined are referred to in BC parlance as the Columbia Country . Below the Arrow Lakes , the Columbia passes the cities of Castlegar , located at the Columbia 's confluence with the Kootenay River , and Trail , two major population centers of the West Kootenay region . The Pend Oreille River joins the Columbia about 2 miles ( 3 km ) north of the US – Canada border . 
 The Columbia enters eastern Washington flowing south and turning to the west at the Spokane River confluence . It marks the southern and eastern borders of the Colville Indian Reservation and the western border of the Spokane Indian Reservation . The river turns south after the Okanogan River confluence , then southeasterly near the confluence with the Wenatchee River in central Washington . This C ‑ shaped segment of the river is also known as the " Big Bend " . During the Missoula Floods 10 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 years ago , much of the floodwater took a more direct route south , forming the ancient river bed known as the Grand Coulee . After the floods , the river found its present course , and the Grand Coulee was left dry . The construction of the Grand Coulee Dam in the mid @-@ 20th century impounded the river , forming Lake Roosevelt , from which water was pumped into the dry coulee , forming the reservoir of Banks Lake . 
 The river flows past The Gorge Amphitheatre , a prominent concert venue in the Northwest , then through Priest Rapids Dam , and then through the Hanford Nuclear Reservation . Entirely within the reservation is Hanford Reach , the only US stretch of the river that is completely free @-@ flowing , unimpeded by dams and not a tidal estuary . The Snake River and Yakima River join the Columbia in the Tri ‑ Cities population center . The Columbia makes a sharp bend to the west at the Washington – Oregon border . The river defines that border for the final 309 miles ( 497 km ) of its journey . 
 The Deschutes River joins the Columbia near The Dalles . Between The Dalles and Portland , the river cuts through the Cascade Range , forming the dramatic Columbia River Gorge . No other river except for the Klamath completely breaches the Cascades — the other rivers that flow through the range also originate in or very near the mountains . The headwaters and upper course of the Pit River flows through much of the Cascades ; in contrast the Columbia cuts through the range nearly a thousand miles from its source in the Rocky Mountains . The gorge is known for its strong and steady winds , scenic beauty , and its role as an important transportation link . The river continues west , bending sharply to the north @-@ northwest near Portland and Vancouver , Washington , at the Willamette River confluence . Here the river slows considerably , dropping sediment that might otherwise form a river delta . Near Longview , Washington and the Cowlitz River confluence , the river turns west again . The Columbia empties into the Pacific Ocean just west of Astoria , Oregon , over the Columbia Bar , a shifting sandbar that makes the river 's mouth one of the most hazardous stretches of water to navigate in the world . Because of the danger and the many shipwrecks near the mouth , it acquired a reputation as the " Graveyard of Ships " . 
 The Columbia drains an area of about 258 @,@ 000 square miles ( 670 @,@ 000 km2 ) . Its drainage basin covers nearly all of Idaho , large portions of British Columbia , Oregon , and Washington , ultimately all of Montana west of the Continental Divide , and small portions of Wyoming , Utah , and Nevada ; the total area is similar to the size of France . Roughly 745 miles ( 1 @,@ 200 km ) of the river 's length and 85 percent of its drainage basin are in the US . The Columbia is the twelfth @-@ longest river and has the sixth @-@ largest drainage basin in the United States . In Canada , where the Columbia flows for 498 miles ( 801 km ) and drains 39 @,@ 700 square miles ( 103 @,@ 000 km2 ) , the river ranks 23rd in length , and the Canadian part of its basin ranks 13th in size among Canadian basins . The Columbia shares its name with nearby places , such as British Columbia , as well as with landforms and bodies of water . 
 = = = Discharge = = = 
 With an average flow at the mouth of about 265 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 7 @,@ 500 m3 / s ) , the Columbia is the largest river by volume flowing into the Pacific from North America and is the fourth @-@ largest by volume in the US . The average flow where the river crosses the international border between Canada and the United States is 99 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 2 @,@ 790 m3 / s ) from a drainage basin of 39 @,@ 700 square miles ( 102 @,@ 800 km2 ) . This amounts to about 15 percent of the entire Columbia watershed . The Columbia 's highest recorded flow , measured at The Dalles , was 1 @,@ 240 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 35 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) in June 1894 , before the river was dammed . The lowest flow recorded at The Dalles was 12 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 340 m3 / s ) on April 16 , 1968 , and was caused by the initial closure of the John Day Dam , 28 miles ( 45 km ) upstream . The Dalles is about 190 miles ( 310 km ) from the mouth ; the river at this point drains about 237 @,@ 000 square miles ( 610 @,@ 000 km2 ) or about 91 percent of the total watershed . Flow rates on the Columbia are affected by many large upstream reservoirs , many diversions for irrigation , and , on the lower stretches , reverse flow from the tides of the Pacific Ocean .

 When the rifting of Pangea , due to the process of plate tectonics , pushed North America away from Europe and Africa and into the <unk> Ocean ( ancestor to the modern Pacific Ocean ) , the Pacific Northwest was not part of the continent . As the North American continent moved westward , the Farallon Plate subducted under its western margin . As the plate subducted , it carried along island arcs which were accreted to the North American continent , resulting in the creation of the Pacific Northwest between 150 and 90 million years ago . The general outline of the Columbia Basin was not complete until between 60 and 40 million years ago , but it lay under a large inland sea later subject to uplift . Between 40 and 20 million years ago , in the Eocene and Miocene eras , tremendous volcanic eruptions frequently modified much of the landscape traversed by the Columbia . The lower reaches of the ancestral river passed through a valley near where Mount Hood later arose . Carrying sediments from erosion and erupting volcanoes , it built a 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) thick delta that underlies the foothills on the east side of the Coast Range near <unk> in northwestern Oregon . Between 17 million and 6 million years ago , huge outpourings of flood basalt lava covered the Columbia River Plateau and forced the lower Columbia into its present course . The Cascade Range began to uplift during the early Pleistocene era ( two million to 700 @,@ 000 years ago ) . Cutting through the uplifting mountains , the Columbia River created the Columbia River Gorge . 
 The river and its drainage basin experienced some of the world 's greatest known catastrophic floods toward the end of the last ice age . The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods , with discharges 10 times the combined flow of all the rivers of the world , dozens of times over thousands of years . The exact number of floods is unknown , but geologists have documented at least 40 ; evidence suggests that they occurred between about 19 @,@ 000 and 13 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 The floodwaters rushed across eastern Washington , creating the channeled scablands , which are a complex network of dry canyon @-@ like channels , or coulees that are often braided and sharply gouged into the basalt rock underlying the region 's deep topsoil . Numerous flat @-@ topped buttes with rich soil stand high above the chaotic scablands . <unk> at several places caused the floodwaters to pool into large temporary lakes , such as Lake Lewis , in which sediments were deposited . Water depths have been estimated at 1 @,@ 250 feet ( 380 m ) at Wallula Gap , 830 feet ( 250 m ) at Bonneville Dam , and 400 feet ( 120 m ) over modern Portland , Oregon . Sediments were also deposited when the floodwaters slowed in the broad flats of the Quincy , Othello , and Pasco Basins . The floods ' periodic inundation of the lower Columbia River Plateau deposited rich sediments ; 21st @-@ century farmers in the Willamette Valley " plow fields of fertile Montana soil and clays from Washington 's Palouse " . 
 Over the last several thousand years a series of large landslides have occurred on the north side of the Columbia River Gorge , sending massive amounts of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak into the gorge near the present site of Bonneville Dam . The most recent and significant is known as the Bonneville Slide , which formed a massive earthen dam , filling 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) of the river 's length . Various studies have placed the date of the Bonneville Slide anywhere between 1060 and 1760 AD ; the idea that the landslide debris present today was formed by more than one slide is relatively recent and may explain the large range of estimates . It has been suggested that if the later dates are accurate there may be a link with the 1700 Cascadia earthquake . The pile of debris resulting from the Bonneville Slide blocked the river until rising water finally washed away the sediment . It is not known how long it took the river to break through the barrier ; estimates range from several months to several years . Much of the landslide 's debris remained , forcing the river about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) south of its previous channel and forming the Cascade Rapids . In 1938 , the construction of Bonneville Dam inundated the rapids as well as the remaining trees that could be used to refine the estimated date of the landslide . 
 In 1980 , the eruption of Mount St. Helens deposited large amounts of sediment in the lower Columbia , temporarily reducing the depth of the shipping channel by 26 feet ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) .

 Humans have inhabited the Columbia 's watershed for more than 15 @,@ 000 years , with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3 @,@ 500 years ago . In 1962 , archaeologists found evidence of human activity dating back 11 @,@ 230 years at the Marmes Rockshelter , near the confluence of the Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington . In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old prehistoric man ( dubbed Kennewick Man ) were found near Kennewick , Washington . The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and / or study the remains . 
 Many different Native Americans and First Nations peoples have a historical and continuing presence on the Columbia . South of the Canada – US border , the Colville , Spokane , Coeur d 'Alene , Yakama , Nez Perce , Cayuse , <unk> , Umatilla , Cowlitz , and the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs live along the US stretch . Along the upper Snake River and Salmon River , the Shoshone Bannock tribes are present . The Sinixt or Lakes people lived on the lower stretch of the Canadian portion , while above that the Shuswap people ( Secwepemc in their own language ) reckon the whole of the upper Columbia east to the Rockies as part of their territory . The Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin outline the Traditional homelands of the Canadian <unk> Ktunaxa . 
 The Chinook tribe , which is not federally recognized , who live near the lower Columbia River , call it <unk> in the Chinookan <unk> and <unk> ’ i @-@ <unk> to the Sahaptin @-@ speaking peoples of its middle course in present @-@ day Washington ; The river is known as <unk> <unk> <unk> by the Sinixt people , who live in the area of the Arrow Lakes in the river 's upper reaches in Canada . All three terms essentially mean " the big river " . 
 Oral histories describe the formation and destruction of the Bridge of the Gods , a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge . The bridge , which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide , was described in some stories as the result of a battle between gods , represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood , in their competition for the affection of a goddess , represented by Mount St. Helens . Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river . 
 Horses , originally acquired from Spanish New Mexico , spread widely via native trade networks , reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700 . The Nez Perce , Cayuse , and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730 . Along with horses came aspects of the emerging plains culture , such as equestrian and horse training skills , greatly increased mobility , hunting efficiency , trade over long distances , intensified warfare , the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war , and the rise of large and powerful tribal confederacies . The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long @-@ distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting , adopted the plains culture to a significant degree , and became the main conduit through which horses and the plains culture diffused into the Columbia River region . Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of the plains culture unevenly . The Yakama , Umatilla , <unk> , Spokane , and Coeur d 'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of the plains cultural characteristics , but fishing and fish @-@ related economies remained important . Less affected groups included the Molala , Klickitat , <unk> , Okanagan , and <unk> @-@ Columbia peoples , who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features . Some groups remained essentially unaffected , such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people , whose culture remained centered on fishing . 
 Natives of the region encountered foreigners at several times and places during the 18th and 19th centuries . European and American vessels explored the coastal area around the mouth of the river in the late 18th century , trading with local natives . The contact would prove devastating to the Indian tribes ; a large portion of their population was wiped out by a smallpox epidemic . Canadian explorer Alexander Mackenzie crossed what is now interior British Columbia in 1793 . From 1805 to 1807 , the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Oregon Country along the Clearwater and Snake rivers , and encountered numerous small settlements of natives . Their records recount tales of hospitable traders who were not above stealing small items from the visitors . They also noted brass <unk> , a British musket , and other artifacts that had been obtained in trade with coastal tribes . From the earliest contact with westerners , the natives of the mid- and lower Columbia were not tribal , but instead congregated in social units no larger than a village , and more often at a family level ; these units would shift with the season as people moved about , following the salmon catch up and down the river 's tributaries . 
 Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre , a number of violent battles were fought between American settlers and the region 's natives . The subsequent Indian Wars , especially the Yakima War , decimated the native population and removed much land from native control . As years progressed , the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became the central issue of contention with the states , commercial fishers , and private property owners . The US Supreme Court upheld fishing rights in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918 , as well as the 1974 case United States v. Washington , commonly called the Boldt Decision . 
 Fish were central to the culture of the region 's natives , both as sustenance and as part of their religious beliefs . Natives drew fish from the Columbia at several major sites , which also served as trading posts . Celilo Falls , located east of the modern city of The Dalles , was a vital hub for trade and the interaction of different cultural groups , being used for fishing and trading for 11 @,@ 000 years . Prior to contact with westerners , villages along this 9 @-@ mile ( 14 km ) stretch may have at times had a population as great as 10 @,@ 000 . The site drew traders from as far away as the Great Plains . The Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River Gorge , and Kettle Falls and Priest Rapids in eastern Washington , were also major fishing and trading sites . 
 In prehistoric times the Columbia 's salmon and steelhead runs numbered an estimated annual average of 10 to 16 million fish . In comparison , the largest run since 1938 was in 1986 , with 3 @.@ 2 million fish entering the Columbia . The annual catch by natives has been estimated at 42 million pounds ( 19 @,@ 000 t ) . The most important and productive native fishing site was located at Celilo Falls , which was perhaps the most productive inland fishing site in North America . The falls were located at the border between <unk> and <unk> @-@ speaking peoples and served as the center of an extensive trading network across the Pacific Plateau . Celilo was the oldest continuously inhabited community on the North American continent . 
 Salmon canneries established by white settlers beginning in 1866 had a strong negative impact on the salmon population , and in 1908 US President Theodore Roosevelt observed that the salmon runs were but a fraction of what they had been 25 years prior . 
 As river development continued in the 20th century , each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam , beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938 . The development was accompanied by extensive negotiations between natives and US government agencies . The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs , a coalition of various tribes , adopted a constitution and incorporated after the 1938 completion of the Bonneville Dam flooded Cascades Rapids ; Still , in the 1930s , there were natives who lived along the river and fished year round , moving along with the fish 's migration patterns throughout the seasons . The Yakama were slower to do so , organizing a formal government in 1944 . In the 21st century , the Yakama , Nez Perce , Umatilla , and Warm Springs tribes all have treaty fishing rights along the Columbia and its tributaries . 
 In 1957 Celilo Falls was submerged by the construction of The Dalles Dam , and the native fishing community was displaced . The affected tribes received a $ 26 @.@ 8 million settlement for the loss of Celilo and other fishing sites submerged by The Dalles Dam . The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs used part of its $ 4 million settlement to establish the Kah @-@ Nee @-@ Ta resort south of Mount Hood .

 Some historians believe that Japanese or Chinese vessels blown off course reached the Northwest Coast long before Europeans — possibly as early as 219 BCE . It is unknown whether they landed near the Columbia . Evidence exists that Spanish castaways reached the shore in 1679 and traded with the Clatsop ; if these were indeed the first Europeans to see the Columbia , they failed to send word home to Spain . 
 In the 18th century , there was strong interest in discovering a Northwest Passage that would permit navigation between the Atlantic ( or inland North America ) and the Pacific Ocean . Many ships in the area , especially those under Spanish and British command , searched the northwest coast for a large river that might connect to Hudson Bay or the Missouri River . The first documented European discovery of the Columbia River was that of Bruno de Heceta , who in 1775 sighted the river 's mouth . On the advice of his officers , he did not explore it , as he was short @-@ staffed and the current was strong . He considered it a bay , and called it Ensenada de Asunción . Later Spanish maps based on his discovery showed a river , labeled Rio de San Roque , or an entrance , called Entrada de <unk> . Following Heceta 's reports , British maritime fur trader Captain John Meares searched for the river in 1788 but concluded that it did not exist . He named Cape Disappointment for the non @-@ existent river , not realizing the cape marks the northern edge of the river 's mouth . 
 What happened next would form the basis for decades of both cooperation and dispute between British and American exploration of , and ownership claim to , the region . Royal Navy commander George Vancouver sailed past the mouth in April 1792 and observed a change in the water 's color , but he accepted Meares ' report and continued on his journey northward . Later that month , Vancouver encountered the American captain Robert Gray at the Strait of Juan de Fuca . Gray reported that he had seen the entrance to the Columbia and had spent nine days trying but failing to enter . 
 On May 12 , 1792 , Gray returned south and crossed the Columbia Bar , becoming the first explorer to enter the river . Gray 's fur trading mission had been financed by Boston merchants , who outfitted him with a private vessel named Columbia Rediviva ; he named the river after the ship on May 18 . Gray spent nine days trading near the mouth of the Columbia , then left without having gone beyond 13 miles ( 21 km ) upstream . The farthest point reached was Grays Bay at the mouth of Grays River . Gray 's discovery of the Columbia River was later used by the United States to support its claim to the Oregon Country , which was also claimed by Russia , Great Britain , Spain and other nations . 
 In October 1792 , Vancouver sent Lieutenant William Robert Broughton , his second @-@ in @-@ command , up the river . Broughton got as far as the Sandy River at the western end of the Columbia River Gorge , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) upstream , sighting and naming Mount Hood . Broughton formally claimed the river , its drainage basin , and the nearby coast for Britain . In contrast , Gray had not made any formal claims on behalf of the United States . 
 Because the Columbia was at the same latitude as the headwaters of the Missouri River , there was some speculation that Gray and Vancouver had discovered the long @-@ sought Northwest Passage . A 1798 British map showed a dotted line connecting the Columbia with the Missouri . When the American explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark charted the vast , unmapped lands of the American West in their overland expedition ( 1803 – 05 ) , they found no passage between the rivers . After crossing the Rocky Mountains , Lewis and Clark built dugout canoes and paddled down the Snake River , reaching the Columbia near the present @-@ day Tri @-@ Cities , Washington . They explored a few miles upriver , as far as Bateman Island , before heading down the Columbia , concluding their journey at the river 's mouth and establishing Fort Clatsop , a short @-@ lived establishment that was occupied for less than three months . 
 Canadian explorer David Thompson , of the North West Company , spent the winter of 1807 – 08 at Kootenae House near the source of the Columbia at present @-@ day Invermere , British Columbia . Over the next few years he explored much of the river and its northern tributaries . In 1811 he traveled down the Columbia to the Pacific Ocean , arriving at the mouth just after John Jacob Astor 's Pacific Fur Company had founded Astoria . On his return to the north , Thompson explored the one remaining part of the river he had not yet seen , becoming the first European @-@ American to travel the entire length of the river . 
 In 1825 the Hudson 's Bay Company ( HBC ) established Fort Vancouver on the bank of the Columbia , in what is now Vancouver , Washington , as the headquarters of the company 's Columbia District , which encompassed everything west of the Rocky Mountains . John McLoughlin , a physician , was appointed Chief Factor of the Columbia District . The HBC reoriented its Columbia District operations toward the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia , which became the region 's main trunk route . In the early 1840s Americans began to colonize the Oregon country in large numbers via the Oregon Trail , despite the HBC 's efforts to discourage American settlement in the region . For many the final leg of the journey involved travel down the lower Columbia River to Fort Vancouver . This part of the Oregon Trail , from The Dalles to Fort Vancouver , was the trail 's most treacherous stretch , which prompted the 1846 construction of the Barlow Road . 
 In the Treaty of 1818 the United States and Britain agreed that both nations were to enjoy equal rights in Oregon Country for 10 years . By 1828 , when the so @-@ called " joint occupation " was renewed for an indefinite period , it seemed probable that the lower Columbia River would in time become the border . For years the Hudson 's Bay Company successfully maintained control of the Columbia River and American attempts to gain a foothold were fended off . In the 1830s , American religious missions were established at several locations in the lower Columbia River region . In the 1840s a mass migration of American settlers undermined British control . The Hudson 's Bay Company tried to maintain dominance by shifting from the fur trade , which was in sharp decline , to exporting other goods such as salmon and lumber . Colonization schemes were attempted , but failed to match the scale of American settlement . Americans generally settled south of the Columbia , mainly in the Willamette Valley . The Hudson 's Bay Company tried to establish settlements north of the river , but nearly all the British colonists moved south to the Willamette Valley . The hope that the British colonists might dilute the American flavor of the valley failed in the face of the overwhelming number of American settlers . These developments rekindled the issue of " joint occupation " and the boundary dispute . While some British interests , especially the Hudson 's Bay Company , fought for a boundary along the Columbia River , the Oregon Treaty of 1846 set the boundary at the 49th parallel . The Columbia River became the border between the US territories of Oregon and Washington . Oregon became a US state in 1859 , Washington in 1889 . 
 By the turn of the 20th century , the difficulty of navigating the Columbia was seen as an impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades . The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river , disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity , irrigation , navigability and other benefits to the region . 
 = = Navigation = = 
 American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver , who explored the river in 1792 , proved that it was possible to cross the Columbia Bar . Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today ; even with modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river , the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean . 
 The use of steamboats along the river , beginning with the British Beaver in 1836 and followed by American vessels in 1850 , contributed to the rapid settlement and economic development of the region . Steamboats operated in several distinct stretches of the river : on its lower reaches , from the Pacific Ocean to Cascades Rapids ; from the Cascades to Celilo Falls ; from Celilo to the confluence with the Snake River ; on the Wenatchee Reach of eastern Washington ; on British Columbia 's Arrow Lakes ; and on tributaries like the Willamette , the Snake and Kootenay Lake . The boats , initially powered by burning wood , carried passengers and freight throughout the region for many years . Early railroads served to connect steamboat lines interrupted by waterfalls on the river 's lower reaches . In the 1880s , railroads maintained by companies such as the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company and the Shaver Transportation Company began to supplement steamboat operations as the major transportation links along the river .

 As early as 1881 , industrialists proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve navigation . Changes to the river over the years have included the construction of jetties at the river 's mouth , dredging , and the construction of canals and navigation locks . Today , ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver , and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston , Idaho . 
 The shifting Columbia Bar makes passage between the river and the Pacific Ocean difficult and dangerous , and numerous rapids along the river hinder navigation . Pacific Graveyard , a 1964 book by James A. Gibbs , describes the numerous shipwrecks near the mouth of the Columbia . 
 Jetties , first constructed in 1886 , extend the river 's channel into the ocean . Strong currents and the shifting sandbar remain a threat to ships entering the river and necessitate continuous maintenance of the jetties . 
 In 1891 the Columbia was dredged to enhance shipping . The channel between the ocean and Portland and Vancouver was deepened from 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) to 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) . The Columbian called for the channel to be deepened to 40 feet ( 12 m ) as early as 1905 , but that depth was not attained until 1976 . 
 Cascade Locks and Canal were first constructed in 1896 around the Cascades Rapids , enabling boats to travel safely through the Columbia River Gorge . The Celilo Canal , bypassing Celilo Falls , opened to river traffic in 1915 . In the mid @-@ 20th century , the construction of dams along the length of the river submerged the rapids beneath a series of reservoirs . An extensive system of locks allowed ships and barges to pass easily from one reservoir to the next . A navigation channel reaching to Lewiston , Idaho , along the Columbia and Snake rivers , was completed in 1975 . One of the main commodities is wheat , mainly for export . More than 40 percent of all US wheat exports are barged on the Columbia River . 
 The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens caused mudslides in the area , which reduced the Columbia 's depth by 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) for a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) stretch , disrupting Portland 's economy . 
 = = = Deeper shipping channel = = = 
 Efforts to maintain and improve the navigation channel have continued to the present day . In 1990 a new round of studies examined the possibility of further dredging on the lower Columbia . The plans were controversial from the start because of economic and environmental concerns . 
 In 1999 , Congress authorized deepening the channel between Portland and Astoria from 40 to 43 feet ( 12 – 13 m ) , which will make it possible for large container and grain ships to reach Portland and Vancouver . The project has met opposition because of concerns about stirring up toxic sediment on the riverbed . Portland @-@ based Northwest Environmental Advocates brought a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers , but it was rejected by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2006 . The project includes measures to mitigate environmental damage ; for instance , the US Army Corps of Engineers must restore 12 times the area of wetland damaged by the project . In early 2006 , the Corps spilled 50 US gallons ( 190 L ) of hydraulic oil into the Columbia , drawing further criticism from environmental organizations . 
 Work on the project began in 2005 and concluded in 2010 . The project 's cost is estimated at $ 150 million . The federal government is paying 65 percent , Oregon and Washington are paying $ 27 million each , and six local ports are also contributing to the cost . 
 = = Dams = = 
 In 1902 , the United States Bureau of Reclamation was established to aid in the economic development of arid western states . One of its major undertakings was building Grand Coulee Dam to provide irrigation for the 600 thousand acres ( 2 @,@ 400 km2 ) of the Columbia Basin Project in central Washington . With the onset of World War II , the focus of dam construction shifted to production of hydroelectricity . Irrigation efforts resumed after the war . 
 River development occurred within the structure of the 1909 International Boundary Waters Treaty between the US and Canada . The United States Congress passed the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1925 , which directed the Army Corps of Engineers and the Federal Power Commission to explore the development of the nation 's rivers . This prompted agencies to conduct the first formal financial analysis of hydroelectric development ; the reports produced by various agencies were presented in House Document 308 . Those reports , and subsequent related reports , are referred to as 308 Reports . 
 In the late 1920s , political forces in the Northwestern United States generally favored private development of hydroelectric dams along the Columbia . But the overwhelming victories of gubernatorial candidate George W. Joseph in the 1930 Oregon Republican Party primary , and later his law partner Julius Meier , were understood to demonstrate strong public support for public ownership of dams . In 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill that enabled the construction of the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams as public works projects . The legislation was attributed to the efforts of Oregon Senator Charles McNary , Washington Senator Clarence Dill , and Oregon Congressman Charles Martin , among others . 
 In 1948 floods swept through the Columbia watershed , destroying Vanport , then the second largest city in Oregon , and impacting cities as far north as Trail , British Columbia . The flooding prompted the United States Congress to pass the Flood Control Act of 1950 , authorizing the federal development of additional dams and other flood control mechanisms . By that time local communities had become wary of federal hydroelectric projects , and sought local control of new developments ; a public utility district in Grant County , Washington ultimately began construction of the dam at Priest Rapids . 
 In the 1960s , the United States and Canada signed the Columbia River Treaty , which focused on flood control and the maximization of downstream power generation . Canada agreed to build dams and provide reservoir storage , and the United States agreed to deliver to Canada one @-@ half of the increase in US downstream power benefits as estimated five years in advance . Canada 's obligation was met by building three dams ( two on the Columbia , and one on the Duncan River ) , the last of which was completed in 1973 . 
 Today the main stem of the Columbia River has 14 dams , of which three are in Canada and 11 in the US . Four mainstem dams and four lower Snake River dams contain navigation locks to allow ship and barge passage from the ocean as far as Lewiston , Idaho . The river system as a whole has more than 400 dams for hydroelectricity and irrigation . The dams address a variety of demands , including flood control , navigation , stream flow regulation , storage and delivery of stored waters , reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations , and the generation of hydroelectric power . 
 The larger US dams are owned and operated by the federal government ( some by the Army Corps of Engineers and some by the Bureau of Reclamation ) , while the smaller dams are operated by public utility districts , and private power companies . The federally operated system is known as the Federal Columbia River Power System , which includes 31 dams on the Columbia and its tributaries . The system has altered the seasonal flow of the river in order to meet higher electricity demands during the winter . At the beginning of the 20th century , roughly 75 percent of the Columbia 's flow occurred in the summer , between April and September . By 1980 , the summer proportion had been lowered to about 50 percent , essentially eliminating the seasonal pattern . 
 The installation of dams dramatically altered the landscape and ecosystem of the river . At one time , the Columbia was one of the top salmon @-@ producing river systems in the world . Previously active fishing sites , such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge , have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century , and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced . Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters . Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system .

 The Bureau of Reclamation 's Columbia Basin Project focused on the generally dry region of central Washington known as the Columbia Basin , which features rich loess soil . Several groups developed competing proposals , and in 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the Columbia Basin Project . The Grand Coulee Dam was the project 's central component ; upon completion , it pumped water up from the Columbia to fill the formerly dry Grand Coulee , forming Banks Lake . By 1935 , the intended height of the dam was increased from a range between 200 and 300 feet ( 61 and 91 m ) to 500 feet ( 150 m ) , a height that would extend the lake impounded by the dam all the way to the Canadian border ; the project had grown from a local New Deal relief measure to a major national project . 
 The project 's initial purpose was irrigation , but the onset of World War II created a high demand for electricity , mainly for aluminum production and for the development of nuclear weapons at the Hanford Site . Irrigation began in 1951 . The project provides water to more than 670 thousand acres ( 2 @,@ 700 km2 ) of fertile but arid land in central Washington , transforming the region into a major agricultural center . Important crops include orchard fruit , potatoes , alfalfa , mint , beans , beets , and wine grapes . 
 Since 1750 , the Columbia has experienced six multi @-@ year droughts . The longest , lasting 12 years in the mid ‑ 19th century , reduced the river 's flow to 20 percent below average . Scientists have expressed concern that a similar drought would have grave consequences in a region so dependent on the Columbia . In 1992 – 1993 , a lesser drought affected farmers , hydroelectric power producers , shippers , and wildlife managers . 
 Many farmers in central Washington build dams on their property for irrigation and to control frost on their crops . The Washington Department of Ecology , using new techniques involving aerial photographs , estimated there may be as many as a hundred such dams in the area , most of which are illegal . Six such dams have failed in recent years , causing hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage to crops and public roads . Fourteen farms in the area have gone through the permitting process to build such dams legally .
