 The SECR N1 class was a type of 3 @-@ cylinder 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 ( ' mogul ' ) steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for mixed traffic duties , initially on the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) , and later operated for the Southern Railway ( SR ) . The N1 was a development of the basic principles established by the Great Western Railway 's ( GWR ) Chief Mechanical Engineer ( CME ) George Jackson Churchward and by Maunsell 's previous N class design . 
 The N1 prototype was the result of modifications made to N class No. 822 during construction in 1922 . The locomotive became operational in 1923 and used parts interchangeable with other Maunsell locomotive classes . The prototype N1 was the only member of the class constructed before the SECR became part of the Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923 , and featured a variant of the Gresley conjugated valve gear designed by Harold Holcroft . The class set the precedent for the Southern Railway 's subsequent 3 @-@ cylinder designs . 
 The N1s compared favourably with the N class , although the type showed little improvement in performance . More of the class were built when it became clear that the type 's smaller cylinders provided greater route availability . A total of six engines were built . The N1 class was primarily used on the Eastern section of the Southern Railway network , and used by the Southern Region of British Railways ( BR ) from 1948 . The N1s gave valuable service until they were withdrawn in 1962 . None were preserved .

 Richard Maunsell 's N class mixed @-@ traffic 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 prototype for the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) was completed in 1917 . It showed a marked improvement in performance over his predecessor Harry Wainwright 's 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 and 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 designs when tested on freight and local passenger trains . The success of the prototype encouraged the SECR management to order a batch of 15 in 1919 after government restrictions regulating locomotive production during the First World War were relaxed . Ashford locomotive works was already committed to undertaking deferred repair work however , which temporarily slowed construction of new locomotives . This resulted in the gradual completion of the 1919 N class order as works capacity permitted between 1920 and 1923 . 
 Operational experience with the N class prototype demonstrated that it was capable of coping with peacetime passenger and freight traffic on the mainline between London and Ramsgate , but Maunsell anticipated an increase in traffic that would require a more powerful locomotive capable of hauling longer trains . The use of larger engines was prevented by low permitted axle loadings on parts of the SECR network , caused by economies in track construction by using flint beach pebbles as track ballast ; this material failed to hold the track in place when under strain and could not support heavy locomotives . In the meantime Maunsell settled upon producing a 3 @-@ cylinder version of the N class 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 , which provided the opportunity to test a variant of the Gresley conjugated valve gear developed by his assistant , Harold Holcroft .

 Maunsell and Holcroft completed plans for a new 3 @-@ cylinder locomotive in 1919 . Designated N1 , the new design was an attempt to increase the operational flexibility and power of the SECR 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 without substantially increasing axle loading . Holcroft 's previous employment as an engineer involved with the GWR 's 4300 class meant that the N1 used the same Churchward features as the N class to aid standardisation and the manufacture of parts . These included the use of long @-@ travel valves for free running at speed , right @-@ hand drive in the cab and 5 ft 6 in ( 1 @,@ 680 mm ) driving wheels . The retention of the 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 wheel arrangement meant ample accommodation for the N class ' tapered boiler with Belpaire firebox . As with the N class , detail design on the N1 was left to another of Maunsell 's assistants , James Clayton , who brought functional Midland Railway influences to the design : the loading gauge @-@ friendly shape of the cab , the tender and the large @-@ diameter smokebox . The smokebox housed a large superheater , regulator valve and snifting ( anti @-@ vacuum ) valves . The N1 also retained Walschaerts valve gear on both outside cylinders . 
 The main design differences with the N class included the cab front , exhaust arrangements , and the addition of an extra ( inside ) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle . Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates ( small windows on the front of the cab ) to improve forward visibility . This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the N class . The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft 's design of conjugated valve gear , which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear , eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder . The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive . 
 Holcroft ’ s valve gear design was also an attempt to address the problems associated with Gresley ’ s conjugated valve gear , which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons . The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods ( the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves , such as the combination lever ) instead , although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity . Holcroft ’ s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside valve rods with extension levers , which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances . This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards and the size of the cylinders reduced to 16 in × 28 in ( 406 mm × 711 mm ) stroke and diameter . The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2 @-@ cylinder locomotives , thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers . The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck , leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft ’ s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service . 
 Another issue concerned the strength of the locomotive frames around the cylinders . Taking inspiration from the 3 @-@ cylinder locomotives designed by Vincent Raven for the North Eastern Railway , Holcroft suggested that all three cylinders and associated steam passages should be cast in a single block , with rectangular holes cut into the frames to enable the outside cylinders to project through them . However , the SECR ’ s established practice of using outside steam chests on locomotives with outside cylinders prevented this , and the design team resorted to cutting a gap in the frames to accommodate the outside cylinders , which were then secured in place with a bolted splice plate . Production limitations at the Ashford works foundry also prevented the manufacture of a single casting that incorporated all three cylinders . This meant that the cylinder castings were split into two sections , with the left and inside cylinders forming a single unit that would be bolted onto a separate right @-@ hand cylinder casting . Holcroft ’ s new cylinder block design also incorporated a separate saddle casting , a configuration that allowed the N1 cylinder patterns to be used with any diameter of smokebox , creating a standard component with potential applications on future locomotive designs .

 The construction of the prototype at Ashford railway works was approved by the SECR management to commence in 1919 . However , Ashford works was heavily engaged in tackling a backlog of repair and maintenance work caused by government restrictions during the First World War with little spare capacity for new construction projects , particularly when approval for the construction of the N1 prototype coincided with a priority order for 15 2 @-@ cylinder N class locomotives . In consequence , the works backlog meant that only 12 N class locomotives were completed between June 1920 and October 1922 . 
 Seeing little sign of an increase in production capacity at Ashford , Maunsell decided to construct the prototype N1 locomotive from parts intended for use on the next N class locomotive in the batch , No. 822 . The outside cylinders were exchanged for the N1 type , which had been machined at the GWR 's Swindon railway works following casting at Ashford to quicken construction once the N class frames were modified to accept the new design of cylinder block . This produced a robust chassis capable of supporting both sets of Walschaerts and the Holcroft conjugated valve gear . The latter was provided with grease @-@ gun lubrication points to ease maintenance . 
 A distinguishing feature of the locomotive was the high @-@ set N class boiler , which was pitched 3 @.@ 5 in ( 89 mm ) above the frames to accommodate the inside cylinder assembly , potentially exposing the conjugation mechanism to the elements . To prevent corrosion , Maunsell incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the inside cylinder and valve gear assembly , the main visual difference from the N class . Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard N class chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders . To mitigate this , a wider @-@ diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide @-@ diameter cast chimney . The rest of the construction process followed the 1919 N1 specification , and the final three members of the order for 15 N class locomotives were built as intended . The N1 prototype was completed in December 1922 and attached to a standard Maunsell 3 @,@ 500 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 15 @,@ 911 l ) flat @-@ sided Ashford N class tender . It entered service on 24 March 1923 and the boiler pressure was reduced from 200 psi ( 1 @.@ 38 MPa ) to 180 psi ( 1 @.@ 24 MPa ) for No. 822 's fuel consumption to be compared with that of the 2 @-@ cylinder N class during trials . 
 = = = Southern Railway batch = = = 
 The completion of No. 822 coincided with the absorption of the SECR into the newly created Southern Railway in the 1923 Grouping . Maunsell was appointed the CME of the new company and embarked upon a greatly expanded programme of fleet standardisation to replace the inherited " pre @-@ Grouping " designs . In 1924 , No. 822 participated in a series of trials to compare the performance of the N , LSWR S15 and LB & SCR K classes when hauling freight trains of 65 loaded wagons between Woking and Eastleigh . Despite achieving the lowest coal consumption per mile of all the designs tested , the N1 prototype cost more to maintain and displayed poor steaming qualities that affected timekeeping . After the trials , No. 822 remained the sole N1 until 1929 , when the Southern Railway ordered a batch of five locomotives ( Nos. A876 – A880 ) . The intention was to increase the availability of the class to complement the newly introduced U1 class passenger locomotives on gauge @-@ restricted routes . 
 The batch was constructed at Ashford works and incorporated several refinements based upon operational experience with No. 822 and were given boilers set at 200 psi ( 1 @.@ 38 MPa ) . The other change was the discontinuation of the Holcroft valve gear because of the difficulty experienced in acquiring suitable spare parts for the prototype . The Southern Railway had also upgraded the permanent way on many of the former SECR routes by 1929 , removing many of the weight restrictions that inspired the use of the Holcroft gear in the first place . Maunsell was therefore free to use three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear driven by the centre driving wheels and the crank axle , a system that was easier to maintain due to the wide availability of parts . 
 The new locomotives were completed between March and November 1930 . They were noticeably different from the prototype because the Holcroft conjugation mechanism above the outside cylinders was omitted , although the slab @-@ front and angled profile of the outside cylinders was retained . Other variations included a set of footsteps beneath the front buffer beam , reversion to the N class cast chimney design and a revised dome that incorporated the regulator to ease access during routine maintenance . Once complete , Nos. A876 – A880 were attached to flat @-@ sided 4 @,@ 000 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 18 @,@ 184 l ) tenders to increase operational range over the Southern Railway 's longer Eastern section routes . No further N1 locomotives were ordered after the completion of No . A880 as the mechanically similar U1 class was capable of undertaking a broader range of tasks . Although intended for intermediate passenger work , the latter 's 6 ft ( 1 @,@ 830 mm ) driving wheels were of little disadvantage when used on slower freight duties .

 The N1 class prototype was initially based at Bricklayers ' Arms shed for tests on services over the Eastern section . No. 822 became a familiar sight on freight workings between the Hither Green marshalling yard and Paddock Wood and on passenger trains between Tonbridge and Charing Cross , as increased train lengths on these duties had taxed the ex @-@ SECR 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 and 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 designs . This allocation also provided an opportunity for comparing performance against the 2 @-@ cylinder N class . The tests were complete by December 1923 and No. 822 was moved to Ashford shed and used on passenger services to Charing Cross . In 1925 , No. 822 was re @-@ allocated to Bricklayers Arms shed from where it was used on the gauge @-@ restricted Tonbridge – Hastings line for the first time . No. 822 proved ideal for this line but was again re @-@ allocated to Redhill for trials over the difficult undulating route to Reading in 1928 . 
 Despite the high maintenance costs and steaming difficulties revealed during the 1924 freight trials , the N1 prototype compared favourably against the N class , allowing the Southern Railway 's management to order the final five locomotives in 1929 . Nos. A876 – A880 were initially allocated to the Central section shed at New Cross , from where they were regularly used on through expresses from the LMS between Willesden Junction and Brighton and services to Hastings and Bognor Regis . Three of the class were moved to Tonbridge shed in 1931 to operate over the Hastings line whilst the other three remained at New Cross . The class was re @-@ allocated in 1935 with three based at Eastbourne on the Central section to haul through trains to the GWR and the London , Midland and Scottish Railway ( LMS ) . By 1939 the class was divided between New Cross , Stewarts Lane and Tonbridge sheds . 
 As with the preceding N class , the N1s were capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds , a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War . They were mostly used on freight trains on both Central and Eastern sections although No. 1822 was recorded hauling a 17 – carriage troop special over the Redhill to Reading line in April 1942 . The entire class operated in the Hastings area during the build @-@ up to Operation Overlord in 1944 . On 3 May , No. 1878 was targeted by a German fighter near Rye but was undamaged . The entire class came into British Railways ' ownership in 1948 and was used on the Southern Region . 
 = = = Performance of the N1 class and modifications = = = 
 As a development of the N class , the N1 class represented the next step forward for the British 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 concept , creating a capable workhorse equally adept at hauling passenger and freight traffic . The prototype proved economical in service as it used 10 percent less coal than the N class , but used 11 percent more water . However , the N1 design proved capable of fast speeds ; No. 822 reached 79 mph ( 127 km / h ) during trials between Charing Cross and Tonbridge in 1923 . Once run @-@ in , No. 822 became popular amongst its regular crews as they favoured the way the three cylinders balanced cyclic forces on the driving axle . This resulted in improved riding characteristics on the footplate at low speeds whilst reducing mechanical wear and the effect of hammerblow on the track . The Holcroft valve gear also meant that No. 822 was a comparatively light locomotive that could be used on weight @-@ restricted routes . 
 Although successful at overcoming the problems associated with the Gresley conjugated valve gear , the Holcroft variant used on No. 822 suffered under a poor maintenance regime caused by the difficulty and expense of producing non @-@ standard spare parts at Ashford works . The main problems associated with the Holcroft gear included inadequate lubrication of the moving parts and the whipping of the conjugation levers connecting the inside cylinder to the outside motion while running at high speeds , which caused uneven steam distribution to the cylinders . In this respect , the N1 prototype offered little advantage over the simpler 2 @-@ cylinder Ns and the locomotive was rarely used on long @-@ distance runs on the Western section . Few modifications were made to the prototype before 1929 , although boiler pressure was increased to the full 200 psi ( 1 @.@ 38 MPa ) operating pressure in June 1925 . 
 The introduction of Nos. A876 – A880 into service allowed No . <unk> to be withdrawn for rebuilding with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear in August 1931 . Other modifications included moving the regulator valve from the smokebox to a new N class @-@ type dome to ease access during routine maintenance and the addition of a front footstep behind the <unk> . Despite the opportunity to upgrade to the 4 @,@ 000 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 18 @,@ 184 l ) tender attached to the new class members , No . <unk> retained its smaller @-@ capacity 3 @,@ 500 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 15 @,@ 911 l ) flat @-@ sided Ashford tender . The result of the various modifications was a heavier locomotive , although it now benefited from upgraded track on the Eastern section and the interchange of standardised parts that reduced the time needed to complete repairs . The rebuilt locomotive emerged from Ashford works as No. 1822 in October 1931 . Although the N1s displayed little overall improvement over the N class , they proved ideal for the gauge @-@ restricted Hastings route , where their narrower profile allowed them to operate through narrow bridges and tunnels , and their power enabled them to haul heavier trains than the predominant ex @-@ SECR 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 and 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0s . 
 The last modification of the class undertaken by Maunsell was the gradual introduction of small smoke deflector plates from 1934 . These were fitted to improve driver visibility as a result of smoke deflection experiments made on the King Arthur class between 1926 and 1927 . Maunsell retired from the Southern Railway in 1937 and his replacement was Oliver Bulleid . Despite making various modifications to the steam circuit on other Maunsell classes , Bulleid saw no reason to make such drastic alterations to the N1 class . As a result , the final set of modifications made under Southern Railway ownership was made after the Second World War and included the removal of superfluous smokebox @-@ mounted anti @-@ vacuum snifting valves and the replacement of the wide @-@ diameter N1 chimney with the U1 type to improve draughting on the prototype ; the standard N class chimneys of the other five were also replaced . The class was well @-@ used by British Railways over both Central and Eastern sections between 1948 and 1962 and justified the fitting of Automatic Warning System ( AWS ) equipment in 1959 alongside the N class . 
 = = = Withdrawal = = = 
 Suitable work for the class began to decline under British Railways ownership after the widening of bridges and tunnels on the Hastings line , which enabled Bulleid 's powerful Q1 class 0 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 to be used on freight trains between Hastings and Tonbridge . Following the completion of the Kent Coast electrification in 1959 , the class was congregated at Tonbridge shed alongside members of the U1 class to haul local services throughout the Central section . The reduction of work over the Brighton main line and the prevalence of the N class precipitated another move to Stewarts Lane shed in London . However , with remaining work being allocated to Bulleid 's Light Pacifics , the class was withdrawn from service in November 1962 .

 No. 822 was completed before Grouping , and initially ran in the SECR 's unlined dark grey livery with white lettering and numbering . It was repainted at the same time as the resetting of the boiler pressure in June 1925 , in a dark olive green livery . The green was complemented with plain white lining , black borders and primrose yellow markings . This livery was also applied to the five locomotives built in 1930 . During the Second World War , when labour and paint were in short supply , the class was gradually repainted in matt black . The repainting took place during essential maintenance visits to Ashford works , and included the application of Bulleid 's " Sunshine " yellow block lettering and numerals on both tender and cabside . This livery was gradually replaced with gloss black between 1945 and 1947 . 
 The prototype was constructed as part of a batch of 15 N class locomotives ordered by the SECR and became No. 822 within this series . When repainted to Maunsell 's dark olive green livery , a prefix " A " was applied to the number to denote a locomotive allocated for overhaul at Ashford . The five locomotives constructed by the Southern Railway between March and November 1930 were numbered A876 – A880 . Shortly thereafter the prefix was dropped and 1000 added to the numbers as part of a general renumbering of Southern Railway locomotive stock ; thus on the rebuilding of the prototype in 1930 it became 1822 . The other five members of the class became Nos. 1876 – 1880 . 
 = = = British Railways = = = 
 The class was absorbed by British Railways in 1948 , and like their N class counterparts were given the power classification 4MT in 1949 . Under British Railways ownership , the class was reclassified from 4MT to <unk> in 1953 ; the " B " denoting the brake power rating when used on unfitted ( non @-@ vacuum braked ) goods trains . The locomotives at first retained their Southern Railway livery , but No. 1876 was the first locomotive to emerge from Ashford works with " British Railways " painted on the tender in Gill Sans lettering . From 1949 to 1950 N1 class locomotives were gradually repainted in the British Railways mixed @-@ traffic lined black livery with red , cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender . Numbering was changed to the British Railways standard numbering system : the prototype became No. <unk> and the 1930 batch was allocated the series <unk> – <unk> .

 The N1 was a capable class of mixed @-@ traffic locomotive that could operate over the Southern Railway 's gauge @-@ restricted routes and was noted by crews for its comfortable riding qualities . The class also provided Maunsell and his assistants with a precedent for other compact 3 @-@ cylinder locomotive designs and formed a mechanical template for the Southern Railway 's K1 class tank engine of 1925 . However , the prototype offered little improvement in performance over the N class when tested on non @-@ restricted routes , which led to an initial reluctance within the management of the Southern Railway to authorise batch construction . This meant that the non @-@ standard Holcroft valve gear proved expensive to maintain because of the consequent lack of spare parts . 
 The use of three separate sets of valve gear on the 1930 batch eased maintenance and improved the standardisation of parts . The prototype was rebuilt to the same specification as the 1930 batch , creating a robust workhorse capable of a good turn of speed when working heavy passenger and freight trains . The revised valve gear layout was subsequently applied to the 3 @-@ cylinder U1 and V class designs . The relatively early withdrawal of the N1s pre @-@ dated the era of preservationists buying withdrawn locomotives from scrap dealers or British Railways , and consequently no examples of the N1 class survived into preservation . 
 = Catherine of Bosnia = 
 Catherine of Bosnia ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Katarina Kosača / <unk> <unk> ; 1424 / 1425 – 25 October 1478 ) was Queen of Bosnia as the wife of King Stephen Thomas , the penultimate Bosnian sovereign . She was born into the powerful House of Kosača , staunch supporters of the Bosnian Church . Her marriage in 1446 was arranged to bring peace between the King and her father , Stjepan Vukčić . The queenship of Catherine , who at that point embraced Roman Catholicism , was marked with an energetic construction of churches throughout the country . 
 Following her husband 's death in 1461 , Catherine 's role receded to that of queen dowager at the court of her stepson , King Stephen Tomašević . Two years later , forces of the Ottoman Empire led by Mehmed the Conqueror invaded Bosnia and put an end to the independent kingdom . Catherine 's stepson was executed , while Sigismund and Catherine , her son and daughter by Thomas , were captured and taken to Constantinople , where they converted to Islam . Queen Catherine escaped , taking refuge in Dubrovnik and eventually settling in Rome , where she received a pension from the papacy . From Rome she strove to be reunited with her children . Her efforts to negotiate and offer a ransom proved futile . She died a Franciscan tertiary in Rome , having named the papacy guardians of Bosnia and her children heirs to the throne , should they ever return to Christianity . 
 Queen Catherine remains one of the most important figures in the folk tradition and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina . Despite there being no evidence that she was beatified , the Queen has long been venerated by Catholics in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and is increasingly seen as an important <unk> state symbol . 
 = = Youth = = 
 Catherine was the daughter of Stjepan Vukčić Kosača , one of the most powerful figures amongst Bosnian nobility , Grand Duke of Bosnia and the ruler of Zachlumia and Travunia . His domain later came to be known as Herzegovina , after the German title of Herzog he adopted in relation to the Duchy of St. Sava . Catherine 's mother was Jelena , daughter of Zeta 's lord Balša III and the first of Stjepan 's three wives . Catherine was the couple 's first child but the precise date of her birth is not known ; both 1424 and late August 1425 have been suggested by her biographers . It can be surmised that the place of her birth was either the Sokol Fortress , an old seat of the House of Kosača , or the feudal town of Blagaj , Stjepan 's favourite residence . 
 Little is known about Catherine 's premarital life . The earliest source that mentions her is the will of her maternal great @-@ grandmother Jelena Lazarević , dated 25 November 1442 , in which she left her her gold earrings and a snake @-@ shaped bracelet . Stjepan was a member and significant supporter of the Bosnian Church , while her mother was an Eastern Orthodox Christian ; Catherine was raised in her father 's confession . 
 Catherine comes into focus following the accession of Stephen Thomas to the Bosnian throne in 1443 . Thomas , of illegitimate birth but designated as heir by Tvrtko II , belonged to the Bosnian Church and was married according to its customs . His wife , Vojača , was the mother of his son , Stephen Tomašević . Two years after his accession , King Thomas abandoned the Bosnian " heresy " and converted to Roman Catholicism . The Catholic Church did not recognize his union with Vojača as a valid marriage , and Pope Eugene IV gave him permission to repudiate her in early 1445 . The civil war between the King and Catherine 's father , which had been raging since the former 's enthronement , ended soon afterwards . Peace was to be sealed with the marriage of King Thomas and Catherine , a great honour to her father . The project may have been envisioned as early as the beginning of 1445 , when Thomas requested the annulment of his union with Vojača . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 The marriage ceremony was conducted according to the Catholic rite between 19 May , when Catherine arrived in <unk> near Fojnica accompanied by her father , and 22 May 1446 . The wedding was attended by a delegation from the Republic of Ragusa ( Dubrovnik ) , but it failed to end all internal strife , since leading noblemen such as <unk> Pavlović ( lord of eastern Bosnia ) and Petar <unk> ( lord of Donji <unk> ) snubbed it . The coronation , planned to take place in Mile near <unk> immediately after the wedding , was apparently postponed . The new queen consort converted to Catholicism ( " laid aside <unk> errors " ) , likely prior to her marriage , and was allowed by Pope Eugene to choose for herself two chaplains from among Bosnian Franciscans . The Queen 's father appears to have contemplated converting too , but eventually gave up the idea and remained an adherent of the Bosnian Church until his death . 
 Catherine proved to be a zealous convert . She initiated and financed from her dowry the construction of churches throughout Bosnia , starting with one in Kupres in 1447 , followed by churches in Krupa na <unk> and <unk> ; a church in Jajce was built in 1458 . In December 1458 she wrote to Pope Pius II to request that the church in Jajce , built along with a Franciscan monastery and a vicariate , be named after her namesake , Saint Catherine of Alexandria . Pius conceded her request in a papal bull issued on 13 December , granting absolution to anyone who visited Queen Catherine 's church at Christmas or Easter , or on certain feast days . Another church built by Queen Catherine in Jajce and dedicated to Saint Catherine was a simple royal chapel . The churches built in Vrbanja , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are attributed to both Catherine and her husband . 
 The royal couple had at least two children together . In 1449 , the King notified Ragusa of the birth of a son : this is likely to have been Sigismund . A daughter named Catherine was born in 1453 . Queen Catherine may have also been the mother of a third son of King Thomas , who was buried on Mljet . Mavro <unk> , a 16th @-@ century Ragusan chronicler , believed that the boy was born to Vojača . If Catherine hoped that her stepson 's marriage to Maria of Serbia and his subsequent accession to the Serbian throne in 1459 would pave way for her own son 's accession in Bosnia , the hopes were dashed very quickly : within three months Stephen Tomašević lost the Despotate of Serbia to the Ottomans and returned to the Bosnian royal court with his wife . 
 = = Widowhood = = 
 King Thomas died in the summer of 1461 , leaving Catherine a 37 @-@ year @-@ old widow with two minor children . Her stepson , Stephen Tomašević , ascended the throne as intended . Catherine 's relations with him were poor during Thomas 's lifetime ; this now threatened to weaken the kingdom against its adversaries , most of all the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire . Stephen Tomašević was thus determined to settle his differences with Catherine and guaranteed her the title and privileges of a queen dowager . Having assured himself of Stephen Tomašević 's " affection " for his daughter , the Grand Duke refrained from disputing the succession and claiming the crown for his grandson by Catherine . He likely found it in his interest that the throne be occupied by an adult monarch , rather than a child , due to external threats . On 1 December , the Grand Duke wrote to Venetian officials that the new King had " taken her as his mother " , Vojača having already died . Although popularly believed to have retired to the castle of Kozograd above Fojnica as dowager , there is no historical basis for dismissing the possibility that she remained at the royal court in Jajce as the mother of Stephen Tomašević 's closest heirs . 
 In 1462 , Catherine 's situation worsened . Her brother Vladislav revolted against their father and sought help from the Ottomans . The Grand Duke and the King started preparing defenses , but the latter made a fatal mistake by provoking the powerful enemy further and then relying on the help of Christendom . In the spring of 1463 , the Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and his army started marching towards Bosnia . Catherine , who is thought to have been on her way south to visit her feuding family , immediately hastened back home . 
 By May , fortresses were rapidly falling to the Ottomans . The royal family appears to have decided to disperse from Jajce and flee towards Croatia and the coast in several directions to confuse and mislead the invaders . Catherine found herself besieged in Kozograd Castle , while her children were captured in the town of <unk> and taken to Mehmed 's capital of Constantinople . Her stepson was deceived into surrendering in Ključ , from where he ordered all his castellans to surrender the fortresses , but Kozograd defied the King 's order . Its defenders appear to have stalled the Ottomans while Catherine escaped . Vladislav was informed by the Ragusans on 23 May that they would send vessels for his sister if she succeeded in reaching the coast . Two days later , her stepson was executed on Mehmed 's orders . The Queen rode to Konjic and from there probably towards <unk> , before finally embarking on the promised vessels in Ston and sailing to <unk> , an island held by the Republic of Ragusa . The two queens , Catherine and Maria , were the only members of the royal family to escape the Ottomans . 
 = = = Refuge in Dubrovnik = = = 
 Catherine arrived on <unk> in the second half of June 1463 . The Ragusan authorities , concerned that harbouring the Queen might provoke an Ottoman attack on their own state , refused her entry into Dubrovnik itself until 23 July , after her father and brothers launched a successful counter @-@ attack against the Ottomans and pushed them away from the Ragusan borders . Her widowed stepdaughter @-@ in @-@ law , Queen Maria , was also denied access to the Ragusan islands until July . In Dubrovnik , Queen Catherine attempted to claim the tribute of Ston , paid annually to Bosnian rulers , but the authorities declined on 20 August . Moreover , they decided that the annual rent for the use of houses and land belonging to the Bosnian royal family should be kept in their own treasury until the legal heir could be established . On 26 October , Catherine entrusted Ragusa with Thomas 's silver sword , stipulating that it should be handed over to Sigismund " should he ever be freed " ; or else to nobody but the person she would name as heir . Soon afterwards she left Dubrovnik for Slano . A reason for Ragusa 's reluctance to comply with Catherine 's demands may have been the reconquest of parts of Bosnia by the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus , Ragusa 's overlord , who attempted to revive the Bosnian kingdom by installing puppet kings . 
 The <unk> liberated almost all of their land during the autumn of 1463 , and even succeeded in occupying some of the former royal domain . Catherine likely headed towards her family 's holdings , which were again under Ottoman attack in the summer of 1465 . Catherine and Vladislav retreated to the peninsula of Pelješac until Ragusa granted them refuge on one of their islands . Catherine left Ragusa permanently in September 1465 , but her subsequent whereabouts can only be conjectured . She likely lived in Zachlumia or in the area of Šibenik . The Grand Duke , her father , died in 1466 . 
 = = = Roman pension = = = 
 In 1467 , Catherine sailed towards the Italian Peninsula , possibly at the suggestion of the Veronese humanist Leonardo Montagna , who dedicated two poems to her . She took her own vessel and disembarked in Ancona . By 29 October 1467 , the Queen was in Rome , already receiving a very generous pension from the Papal State . Upon arrival , she rented a house for herself and her entourage , consisting of Bosnian nobility who had followed her . On 1 October 1469 , she moved to the rione of Pigna , into a house near San Marco Evangelista al <unk> . Pope Sixtus IV gave her considerable property adjacent to the Tiber . 
 The Queen was a prominent figure in Roman society . Her presence at the proxy wedding of Grand Prince Ivan III of Russia and the Byzantine princess Sophia Palaiologina in 1472 was widely noted , as was her pilgrimage to L 'Aquila on the occasion of the translation of Bernardino of Siena 's relics to a new church ( the construction of which was funded , among others , by King Thomas ) . That she lived a comfortable life can be deduced from the impression she left on Roman chroniclers , who wrote about the entourage of 40 mounted knights accompanying her on a pilgrimage to St. Peter 's Basilica to celebrate the new year 1475 . 
 Despite the honours and financial security she enjoyed , Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children . Intent on finding a proxy for negotiations with the Sublime Porte , as well as obtaining resources for their release , she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga , Marquis of Mantua , on 23 July 1470 . On 11 February 1474 , she addressed a letter to the Duke of Milan , Galeazzo Maria Sforza , asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations . Sforza obliged . In the summer of 1474 , the Queen was in Herceg Novi , a city in her family 's possession . She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko 's wife , Margarita Marzano , and probably wanted Vlatko 's help in establishing contact with their younger half @-@ brother , <unk> Ahmed Pasha , who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman . Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear , but in any case she failed to reunite with either of her children . They both followed in their uncle 's footsteps , becoming Muslims and , in Sigismund 's case , also attaining high @-@ ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire . 
 = = Death and burial = = 
 Disappointed at the failure , Catherine returned to Rome and entered the Secular Franciscan Order , probably inspired by a monk at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli . Shortly before her death , in 1478 , Catherine was visited by Nicholas of Ilok , the puppet king of Hungarian @-@ controlled parts of Bosnia . He proposed that she recognize him as legitimate king and attempted to win her favor for several days . Nicholas recorded that the ailing Queen became " so infuriated that she looked like a sharp sabre " . 
 On 20 October 1478 , Catherine made her last will , recorded by a Dalmatian priest , in the presence of seven witnesses , six of whom were Franciscans of Ara Coeli . She expressed a wish to be buried before the main altar of Ara Coeli . Considering herself entitled to dispose of the Bosnian crown , she named Pope Sixtus IV and his successors guardians of the kingdom , obligating them to enthrone her son should he convert back to Christianity or else her daughter should she reconvert . Most of her personal belongings were inherited by her courtiers . Her chapel inventory was left to Saint Jerome 's Church for the Slavic Nation ( now known as Saint Jerome of the Croats ) , while the saint 's relics were to be passed to Saint Mary 's Church , Jajce . She decreed that , if her son never returned to the Christian faith , King Thomas 's silver sword left in Dubrovnik for safekeeping should be handed to her nephew by Vladislav , Balša Hercegović . The Queen died five days after composing the will , which was immediately taken to the Pope along with her husband 's sword and spurs . 
 Catherine was buried according to her wishes , but her tombstone was moved from the floor to a wall of Ara Coeli during works on the interior of the church in 1590 . The original epitaph was destroyed at that time , but the Roman calligrapher Giovanni Battista <unk> had recorded it in 1545 and published two years later . It was uniquely bilingual and <unk> , written both in Latin language and script and in Bosnian language and Cyrillic . Only the Latin epitaph was restored , and can be found on her tombstone today . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Along with the 12th @-@ century Ban Kulin , Queen Catherine is one of the two princely personages who entered Bosnian folk tradition . As such , she is traditionally referred to as " the last Queen of Bosnia " – erroneously , as her stepdaughter @-@ in @-@ law both replaced her as queen and outlived her . The cult of Queen Catherine , who was first mentioned as beatified in the Paris @-@ published <unk> <unk> in 1638 , originated in the Franciscan province of Bosna Argentina during the Ottoman rule . Following the Ottoman conquest , a majority of Bosnians converted to Orthodoxy or Islam , and the Franciscans started promoting Catherine as a symbol of Bosnia 's statehood and of its pre @-@ Ottoman Catholic identity . This is particularly evident in Central Bosnia , where folk tradition concerning Catherine is most vivid . 
 The life of Queen Catherine has been one of the most popular themes in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina , attracting the attention of scholars from the neighbouring countries of Croatia and Serbia as well . With the rise of ethnic nationalism , historians attempted to ascribe to her a particular national identity – Croat , Serb or Bosniak , which is completely anachronistic to medieval times . 
 Due to her association with both of its eponymous historical regions , as well as her personal and close familial ties to Catholicism , Eastern Orthodoxy , Bosnian Christianity and Islam , Queen Catherine is increasingly becoming an important state symbol in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The anniversary of her death attracts more attention each year and is now marked with a " Mass for the Homeland " . Schools , community centers , institutions and various associations are being named after the Queen . An official delegation of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina laid a wreath at her tomb for the first time in 2014 . Moreover , Catherine is becoming a <unk> symbol , although mainly between Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks . Both groups tend to claim her as exclusively their own , as is the case with the rest of Bosnian medieval history . The political and religious leaders of the third group , Orthodox Serbs , also tend to claim Bosnian medieval history as exclusively their own but have not yet shown significant interest in Catherine herself .

 = Hereditary <unk> = 
 Hereditary <unk> ( HCP ) is a disorder of heme biosynthesis , classified as an acute hepatic porphyria . HCP is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase , coded for by the CPOX gene , and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion , although homozygous individuals have been identified . Unlike acute intermittent porphyria , individuals with HCP can present with cutaneous findings similar to those found in porphyria cutanea tarda in addition to the acute attacks of abdominal pain , vomiting and neurological dysfunction characteristic of acute porphyrias . Like other porphyrias , attacks of HCP can be induced by certain drugs , environmental stressors or diet changes . Biochemical and molecular testing can be used to narrow down the diagnosis of a porphyria and identify the specific genetic defect . Overall , porphyrias are rare diseases . The combined incidence for all forms of the disease has been estimated at 1 : 20 @,@ 000 . The exact incidence of HCP is difficult to determine , due to its reduced penetrance . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 Clinically , patients affected with HCP present similarly to those with other acute porphyrias , such as acute intermittent porphyria ( AIP ) and variegate porphyria ( VP ) . Patients with HCP and VP can present with symptoms shared between the acute and cutaneous porphyrias . This includes the acute attacks of abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , tachycardia , hypertension and seizures , as well as the cutaneous findings seen in porphyria cutanea tarda ( PCT ) , namely increased skin fragility , bullous lesions after exposure to sunlight and increased scarring . 
 Individuals with HCP may be asymptomatic in the absence of triggering factors . Common triggers include certain drugs , alcohol , hormonal changes , and dietary changes . Sunlight and other ultraviolet light can trigger the skin manifestations . Homozygous individuals for CPOX mutations can present with these findings at an earlier age than heterozygotes . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 HCP is caused by mutations in the CPOX gene , which codes for the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase . This enzyme is responsible for the sixth step in the heme biosynthetic pathway , converting coproporphyrinogen III to <unk> IX . The CPOX gene is located at <unk> @-@ <unk> , has 6 introns and 7 exons and produces an mRNA strand that is <unk> bases in length . It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion , meaning that a deficiency of 50 % of the normal enzyme activity is enough to cause symptoms . As reproductive fitness is not impacted , homozygous affected individuals have been reported . Along with other acute porphyrias HCP demonstrates reduced penetrance , meaning not all individuals who carry a disease @-@ causing mutation will express symptoms . 
 Individuals who are homozygous for a specific mutation ( <unk> ) or compound heterozygous with a null allele in CPOX have a more severe erythropoietic porphyria , <unk> , characterized by neonatal jaundice , <unk> , <unk> and skin lesions upon exposure to ultraviolet light . HCP is a rare disease , but the exact incidence is difficult to determine due to the reduced penetrance of the acute porphyrias . Overall , the incidence of all porphyrias is estimated at 1 : 20 @,@ 000 in the United States . The incidence of <unk> is even lower , with less than 10 cases reported worldwide . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 The diagnosis of any porphyria is often delayed due to the rarity of the disease as well as the varied and non @-@ specific findings that patients present with . Bedside measurement of urine porphobilinogen is recommended as a screening test for patients suspected of having an acute porphyria . Elevated porphobilinogen is indicative of an acute porphyria , and additional testing can be done to narrow down the specific type . 
 The identification of a specific porphyria is based on the results of laboratory findings , including blood , urine and stool tests . HCP can be distinguished from most other acute porphyrias by the cutaneous findings . VP presents similarly , but can be distinguished based on urine and stool porphyrin analysis , typically done using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection . The results of biochemical testing for porphyrias are most informative when samples are collected during an acute attack . Typically , the distinguishing metabolite for HCP and VP is the presence of protoporphyrin in the plasma and feces of individuals affected with VP . 
 Elevated <unk> is a common finding in urine , known as <unk> as it is the predominant porphyrin species in urine . This is a non @-@ specific finding that is not necessarily due to an acute porphyria . <unk> can be caused by other stressors to the heme biosynthetic pathway , such as liver disease , lead poisoning and certain bone marrow disorders . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 There is no cure for HCP caused by the deficient activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase . Treatment of the acute symptoms of HCP is the same as for other acute porphyrias . Intravenous hemin ( as heme <unk> or <unk> ) is the recommended therapy for acute attacks . Acute attacks can be severe enough to cause death if not treated quickly and correctly . Hospitalization is typically required for administration of hemin , and appropriate drug selection is key to avoid exacerbating symptoms with drugs that interact poorly with porphyrias . Proper drug selection is most difficult when it comes to treatment of the seizures that can accompany HCP , as most anti @-@ seizure medications can make the symptoms worse . <unk> and levetiracetam are two anti @-@ seizure drugs that are thought to be safe . 
 In patients where management of symptoms is difficult even with hemin , liver transplant is an option before the symptoms have progressed to advanced paralysis . Combined liver and kidney transplants are sometimes undertaken in patients with renal failure . 
 Long term treatment of acute porphyrias is centered on the avoidance of acute attacks by eliminating precipitating factors , such as drugs , dietary changes , and infections . Females often have attacks coincident with their menstrual cycle , which can be managed effectively with hormonal birth control . Because of the reduced penetrance of HCP , family members of a patient may carry the same mutation without ever presenting with symptoms . Molecular analysis of CPOX is the best way to identify these patients , as they will not express a biochemical phenotype on laboratory testing unless they are symptomatic . Identification of asymptomatic patients allows them to adjust their lifestyle to avoid common triggering factors . 
 = Vršac triptych = 
 Sowing and Harvesting and Market , popularly referred to as the Vršac triptych , is a three @-@ panel oil painting by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović . Painted around 1895 , it shows the everyday interactions of the inhabitants of Vršac , a multi @-@ ethnic and multi @-@ religious town in the Banat region of Austria @-@ Hungary of which Jovanović was a native . The painting was commissioned by the Vršac city council in 1895 for the following year 's Budapest Millennium Exhibition . 
 The triptych 's centre panel measures 200 by 200 centimetres ( 79 by 79 in ) and the two side panels measure 200 by 100 centimetres ( 79 by 39 in ) each . The left panel is a market scene , the centre panel shows peasants harvesting grapes from a row of vines and the one to the right is an image of a farmer sharpening his scythe as two others labour in the background . The triptych was originally intended to be displayed alongside another one of Jovanović 's paintings , Migration of the Serbs , which had been commissioned by the Patriarchate of Karlovci . The Patriarch 's dissatisfaction with the latter and his insistence that it be altered to his liking resulted in only the Vršac triptych being sent to Budapest , as Jovanović was not able to make the necessary revisions to Migration of the Serbs in time . The triptych was met with acclaim at the Exhibition and Jovanović was awarded a gold medal for his work , with critics praising his mastery of <unk> . The painting is now on permanent exhibition at the Vršac City Museum . 
 = = Background = = 
 The realist Paja Jovanović ( 1859 – 1957 ) was one of the most successful 19th- and 20th @-@ century Serbian painters . He was a native of the town of Vršac , then part of the Hungarian @-@ administered Banat region of Austria @-@ Hungary , which had a mixed population of Serbs , Hungarians and Germans . Most of the Serbs were descended from 14th @-@ century migrants fleeing the Ottoman advance following the Battle of Kosovo in June 1389 . Such diversity and multiculturalism ensured the town 's reputation for prosperity and cultural enlightenment . Jovanović 's artistic abilities were noticed at an early age , and nourished by his father , a professional photographer . His early development was informed by the portraits and religious paintings of artists such as Pavel Đurković , Jovan Popović and Arsenije <unk> . Jovanović 's early copies of the artworks available to him in Vršac brought him instant recognition and steered him towards a career in the arts . In his adolescence , the artist had observed people from the Vršac countryside and their customs , and compiled sketches of natural and man @-@ made structures in and around the town . While a student , he was commissioned to draw a series of preparatory sketches for the bell tower of his hometown 's main church . 
 From 1877 to 1882 , Jovanović honed his artistic skills at Vienna 's Academy of Fine Arts , studying under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller , among others . In the early part of his career , he painted mostly Orientalist works , which were in high demand at the time . The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans , the Middle East and North Africa , and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West . In the late 1880s , Jovanović turned to history painting , depicting scenes from the history of the Serb people , as seen in The Takovo Uprising ( 1888 ) . Nevertheless , his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist .

 = = = Commissioning and composition = = = 
 In the early 1890s , Hungarian officials announced plans for a Budapest Millennium Exhibition to be held in 1896 ; it was intended to mark the 1,000th anniversary of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin , reaffirm Hungary 's " national and territorial legitimacy " and the Hungarian people 's " natural and historical right in the areas they inhabited " . The Exhibition was to be held at Budapest 's City Park . Exhibits were to be divided into twelve distinct areas , one of which was visual art . Several pavilions displaying the cultural and industrial achievements of non @-@ Hungarians living in the Hungarian @-@ administered territories of Austria @-@ Hungary were also built , including one for the Serbs . In 1895 , the Vršac city council hired Jovanović to paint a composition of the town to be displayed in Budapest . The Vršac triptych became one of two compositions that Jovanović created for the Exhibition , the other being Migration of the Serbs , which was commissioned by the Patriarchate of Karlovci that same year and depicts the Great Serb Migration of 1690 – 61 . 
 The composition representing Vršac at the Exhibition was originally meant to depict folk hero Janko <unk> fighting the Turks , an idea to which Jovanović took a liking . The Vršac council members soon changed their minds , and Jovanović was asked to paint a composition showing the everyday lives of the town 's inhabitants . Over the course of the triptych 's creation , Jovanović visited his hometown on a number of occasions for the purpose of sketching its people and structures . The triptych proved to be a particularly difficult undertaking . Jovanović 's firm grasp in Western Medieval panel and mural painting proved of great importance . Earlier , Jovanović had been the recipient of several church commissions that called for multi @-@ sectional painting , though not to the same extent as some of his contemporaries , such as Uroš Predić . Each scene needed to connect seamlessly with the others , and Jovanović was met with the additional challenge of painting a number of figures engaged in actions requiring precise definition . The artist addressed this by carefully drawing each figure , the landscape and the panels themselves so as to ensure compositional unity . To ensure natural light , Jovanović painted the triptych out of studio , en plein air . It took the artist about ten months to complete the work . 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The Vršac triptych ( Serbian Latin : <unk> <unk> ; Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ) , originally publicized as Sowing and Harvesting and Market ( Serbian Latin : <unk> , <unk> i <unk> ; Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> , <unk> и <unk> ) , is a three @-@ panel oil painting that Jovanović created in 1895 . The centre panel measures 200 by 200 centimetres ( 79 by 79 in ) and the two side panels measure 200 by 100 centimetres ( 79 by 39 in ) . 
 The left panel shows villagers and city @-@ dwellers – Serbs , Hungarians and Germans – meeting in Vršac 's main square to sell and purchase items , as well as simply to converse . The scene is set around mid @-@ morning . It occurs against the backdrop of a row of shiny , white @-@ washed buildings and the spire of the town 's main church is also visible in the background . All the figures are dressed in costumes traditionally worn by their compatriots , making it easier for the viewer to discern their ethnicity . " They interact with ease " , the art historian Lilien Filipovitch @-@ Robinson writes , " and an aura of general good will envelops the scene " . The centre panel depicts a group of peasants in the countryside gathering grapes from a row of vines . The panel to the right shows villagers harvesting their ripened wheat . Two figures are seen bending over in the background , sickles in hand , while a third sharpens his scythe in the foreground . The artist 's signature , <unk> P , can be found in the bottom right @-@ hand corner of the centre panel . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 The Vršac triptych comes across as a large @-@ scale contemporary genre painting to the untrained eye . Drawing parallels with Jovanović 's earlier Orientalist works , which she says provide " responses and commentaries " , Filipovitch @-@ Robinson notes that the triptych is far from a simple vignette of everyday life . In describing it as a " type of history painting " , she argues that it was intended as more than a mere documentary piece . Jovanović 's decision to use the triptych format would have been highly unusual otherwise . 
 Filipovitch @-@ Robinson notes parallels between the Vršac triptych and 14th @-@ century Sienese paintings , specifically Ambrogio Lorenzetti 's The Allegory of Good and Bad Government ( 1338 ) and his brother Pietro 's tempera triptych Birth of the Virgin ( 1342 ) . Jovanović 's work shares its secular subject matter and homage to a city with the former and its triptych format with the latter . However , unlike his medieval counterparts , Jovanović had full freedom of artistic expression while painting the triptych and was not bound by the dictates of wealthy patrons . Filipovitch @-@ Robinson writes that Jovanović was merely reiterating the message of Ambrogio Lorenzetti and applying it to his own time , asserting that Vršac – much like 14th @-@ century Siena – owed its peace and prosperity to the maintenance of traditional values and the merits of good governance . Such an interpretation suggests Jovanović was commending the Austro @-@ Hungarians for bringing stability to his hometown and its surroundings . 
 Jovanović 's giving prominence to the tall church spire on the left panel , Filipovitch @-@ Robinson writes , suggests that the artist was asserting the importance of faith in securing harmony and prosperity . " The qualities exemplified here " , she states , " are reminiscent of values and virtues interwoven in traditional religious paintings in which the most sacred personages and scenes are presented in combination with or even in the guise of ordinary humans and their experiences " . Though confined to the artist 's hometown , the triptych had implications for the wider region as well . " Jovanović ... provides assurance that peace and harmony are not only possible but exist in the contemporary Balkan world , in the town of Vršac . " This , she writes , is evidenced by the artist 's decision not to focus on members of any particular ethnic group . Rather , Jovanović depicts all the town 's inhabitants intermingling with ease . Such a depiction was intended to counter claims of animosity between the locals , despite a past marred by inter @-@ ethnic and inter @-@ religious violence . Filipovitch @-@ Robinson describes the painting as an optimistic work and draws parallels between it and Jovanović 's subsequent historical compositions , particularly The Proclamation of Dušan 's Law Codex ( 1900 ) , which she argues were intended to remind Jovanović 's compatriots of their rich past and assure them of a bright future . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Though intended to be displayed alongside Migration of the Serbs , the triptych ended up being the only painting Jovanović sent to Budapest . The Patriarch of Karlovci , Georgije I , was dissatisfied with Migration of the Serbs at first viewing and demanded that the artist make changes so the painting would conform with the Church 's view of the migration . Jovanović duly took the painting back to his studio and began altering it to the Patriarch 's liking . Though the changes were made relatively quickly , they could not be rendered in time for the Exhibition . Hence , only the Vršac triptych was sent for display . It was exhibited at the art pavilion and received praise from critics . The artistic committee judged it to be the Exhibition 's best work and Jovanović was awarded a gold medal for his efforts . In particular , the judges noted Jovanović 's mastery of <unk> . " Among his friends " , one reviewer wrote , " Jovanović is a real master of precise painting . This time , he used plein air and showed so much skill that his paintings could rightfully be set as an example for younger generations . " 
 A travelogue issued in Yugoslavia in the 1920s described the triptych as showing the " solidarity of several nations " , an example of the Banat 's diversity and cosmopolitanism . " Great artists are never narrow @-@ minded or chauvinists " , it continued , " and Jovanović 's paintings are a nice example of this " . The triptych endures in popularity because it shows Vojvodina 's past diversity and cosmopolitanism , which declined significantly during and after World War II , and the subsequent expulsion of the region 's ethnic German population . This led one observer to remark on the irony of the triptych celebrating diversity and coexistence in Vršac though descendants of the Germans depicted in the painting are unlikely to be living there today . Nevertheless , the town still has a sizable population of Romanians and Hungarians , according to the 2011 Serbian census . In 1896 , the triptych was gifted to the Vršac City Museum by the artist , where it remains on display . It is catalogued under inventory number 168 .

 Hard to Swallow is the third studio album by American rapper Vanilla Ice . Released by Republic Records in 1998 , the album was the first album the performer recorded after a four @-@ year hiatus following the 1994 release of Mind Blowin . Vanilla Ice intended the new musical direction found on the album as an attempt to move away from hip hop music and discard his former pop image . Hard to Swallow instead featured what he described as " skate rock " , a fusion of heavy metal , punk rock and hip hop . The album features appearances from Amen vocalist Casey Chaos , Bloodhound Gang vocalist Jimmy Pop , and Insane Poetry front man <unk> . Session musicians included drummer Shannon Larkin , keyboardist Scott Borland , and Snot guitarist Sonny Mayo . 
 Vanilla Ice took an interest in the musical style found on Hard to Swallow while performing as a member of a Miami grunge band , and was able to develop this sound through a friendship with producer Ross Robinson , with whom he shared an interest in motocross racing . Robinson produced the album after being advised against working with Vanilla Ice . The album 's darker lyrical subject matter developed from conversations , in which Robinson encouraged him to write about his past . Subjects included Vanilla Ice 's abusive childhood , drug addiction and struggles with fame . Although Republic Records believed that the album would revive Vanilla Ice 's career , it received largely negative reviews and did not chart . 
 The song " <unk> " was remade in Rhythm Party ( Boom Boom Dance ) as " <unk> " with additional verses from Vanilla Ice himself and production from Konami in house artist Des @-@ ROW .

 Vanilla Ice was briefly a member of a band called Pickin ' Scabs , which he described as being " like a grunge band . " He had wanted to perform more hip hop @-@ influenced rock music , but the band " didn 't know how to play this sound that I was looking for . " 
 Monty Lipman , a founder of Republic Records and former SBK Records promoter , told Vanilla Ice that Ross Robinson , who had worked with bands such as Korn , Limp Bizkit , Sepultura and Deftones , was interested in working with him . Vanilla Ice stated that he and Robinson were " totally clicking right off the bat " when it was discovered that they both shared an interest in motocross racing . 
 According to Robinson , others had attempted to persuade him not to produce the album . " People kept saying to me , ' It might hurt your name , it might hurt your reputation . I said , ' Then I 'm doing it . ' It 's the most punk @-@ rock thing you could do . " 
 Vanilla Ice stated that " It 's unbelievable how this whole thing just came about . I really believe that it was an action of God . God pushing my wave and riding it . And Ross is one of those people and Monty is one of those people that God put in front of me and I 'm being blessed right now . "

 Initial publicity claimed that the album would feature guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and members of Korn and the Bloodhound Gang . Only the latter band 's lead vocalist , Jimmy Pop , appeared on the final album . " Freestyle " features an appearance by <unk> , a founding member of the influential horrorcore group Insane Poetry . Preceding the release of the album , executives at Republic Records compared Vanilla Ice 's career direction to the revival of actor John Travolta as a result of the success of Pulp Fiction , and believed that Vanilla Ice would be similarly successful . 
 Drummer Shannon Larkin said of the album " I 'm proud of that one . That was a killer record . Producer Ross Robinson is very demanding when it comes to drums in the studio . Everything had to be 110 % for that guy , and I love him for that . " Vanilla Ice stated of working with Robinson , " The vibe was totally so cool .

 In the early stages of the album 's development , it was promoted as an album of " high @-@ energy hip @-@ hop . " Republic Records later described the album 's musical style as " aggressive rock " in the stages preceding the album 's release . Vanilla Ice referred to the album 's musical style as " skate rock . " The album 's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal , punk rock and hip hop . Vanilla Ice stated that " I wanted to express myself in a very intense way , and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine . Basically , I 'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff . With a band , they can build the energy around me . " Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit . Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands , he " didn 't even listen to [ ... ] any of them " before he made the album , and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands . " It 's just we have the same producer , and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar . That 's what happens when you 've got the same guy producing them . [ ... ] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them . " 
 The album features a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice 's previous albums , such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin . The album was described by CNN as a " shrill confessional " on which the performer " <unk> his ' 80s persona , his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder , which he has . " Vanilla Ice explained that the album " just comes out dark because that 's the way I feel I 've been treated " and that the album " wasn 't intended to be so dark . I opened up to Ross and I told him a lot of things that happened to me in the past . It was like , really deep conversation , and he was like , you should write about that . And I was like , dude , I didn 't want people to judge me for that . But he was right . It was like total therapy . " 
 The subjects focused on in the album 's lyrics include Vanilla Ice 's abusive childhood and drug addiction . He stated that " I wrote ' Fuck Me ' ' cause I know how I 've been perceived . " I can look back at the whole Vanilla Ice thing , and it was played way out . It was just an image thing . I was always real to the music . But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically . A lot of people didn 't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record . " " Too Cold " is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice 's biggest hit , " Ice Ice Baby " . Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because " I wanted to let people know that I 'm not running from anything . This is me . This is what I 'm about . I think the music speaks for itself . If the music was whack , nobody 'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice . I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin ' out of the closet . It 's like , ' You know , hey , I bought it back in the day , and the new stuff is slammin ' .

 Donovan Patton ( born March 1 , 1978 ) is an American host , actor , voice actor and singer . Patton graduated from the Interlochen Arts Academy and acted in Shakespeare plays such as Much Ado About Nothing and Romeo and Juliet before he replaced Steve Burns as Joe , the host of Nickelodeon 's children 's television program Blue 's Clues in 2002 . On Patton 's acting , series co @-@ creator Angela Santomero stated that Patton brought Joe , his character , closer to the preschool viewer , as Joe was more willing to " jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve " .

 = = Blue 's Clues = = 
 Patton 's " big break " came in 2002 , when he was cast to replace Steve Burns as Joe , the second host of the Nickelodeon children 's television program Blue 's Clues . He was up for a part in Blair Witch Project 2 at the time , but considered the role as Joe " a happy accident " . Patton became a " household name " and has been called " an unqualified star to the 5 @-@ and @-@ under set and their parents " . He was subjected to " the same kind of scrutiny " as Burns , who was involved in Patton 's selection and helped train him , to earn the role . Patton was selected out of 1 @,@ 500 auditions . He had never seen the show before his audition , but like Burns , was the favorite with preschool test audiences . He said , " I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do . There 's a tape out there , somewhere , with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue 's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken , which we did at the screen test . I haven 't seen the tape , but I know somewhere it still exists " . Beginning in September 2000 , Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to " think of [ the show ] as children 's TV " , but rather as " acting and telling the truth " . 
 According to Traci Paige Johnson , one of the producers and creators of Blue 's Clues , Patton 's character was more like a preschooler and more innocent than Steve . Angela Santomero , another producer and creator , stated that Patton 's characterization as Joe brought him closer to the preschool viewer as Joe was more willing to " jump into a problem rather than figure it out first like Steve " . Patton liked working on Blue 's Clues because , as he stated , " I got to go be a kid for twelve hours a day " . He called the show 's crew " a real fun little family " and a " well @-@ oiled machine " by the time he joined the show . Patton remained on the show until 2006 , and also appeared in its spin @-@ off , Blue 's Room , which premiered in 2004 . Several years later , Patton said he had not yet grasped the enormity of replacing Burns , even after he became a parent and witnessed the show 's effect on his own children . He admitted that he preferred when his two @-@ year @-@ old daughter watched the Steve episodes . 
 = = Later roles = = 
 He made his very first role as Waiter in the 1996 mystery & suspense film Dr. Ice , Directed by James A. Brooks . 
 In 2012 , he also appeared in the short films Awake and <unk> , the latter of which was directed by his longtime friend Lawrence Feeney . Mark <unk> , the director of Awake , was able to look past the potential typecasting of Patton 's role in Blue 's Clues to cast him in a darker role . Patton had impressed him in an audition for an earlier feature film . <unk> called Patton a " complete professional [ and a ] tremendous actor " , and enjoyable on set . He appeared in the soap opera One Life to Live , in which he played , in a departure of his previous roles , " a very angry man " . In 2014 , he appeared in a small movie shot mostly in New Jersey , entitled Lies I Told My Little Sister , directed by William <unk> and starring Lucy Walters . 
 Patton called his career , with its mixture of children 's television and darker roles in independent films , " an odd experience " and told a reporter that he had spent half his life at Nickelodeon . In 2009 , he was cast as Bot , the robot superhero , on the children 's show Team Umizoomi through the relationships he had made at Nickelodeon on Blue 's Clues . He found working on Team Umizoomi " comforting " because many of the same crew , producers , and creators had also worked on Blue 's Clues . It was the first time he had worked as a voice @-@ over artist , unlike on Blue 's Clues , when he was able to be more physical acting in front of a blue screen . He said , about Team Umizoomi , " the work the animators have done on it has been superlative " . He stated that he enjoyed working on Team Umizoomi because it gave him the opportunity to participate in a show from its inception , which he had missed with Blue 's Clues . Patton said his voice performance of Bot , which he modeled on Brent Spiner 's performance as the android Data on Star Trek : The Next Generation and was influenced by Mel Blanc 's work in the classic Warner Bros. cartoons , " ended up sounding more like my natural voice , with a teeny bit of superhero in there " . Despite both roles in Blue 's Clues and Team Umizoomi requiring him to sing , he did not consider himself a natural singer , and felt that he had to work hard at it . He said , about being cast as Bot , " I get to be a superhero . Who doesn 't want to be a superhero " ? .

 = Operation Teardrop = 
 Operation Teardrop was a United States Navy operation of World War II conducted during April and May 1945 to sink German U @-@ boats approaching the United States East Coast that were believed to be armed with V @-@ 1 flying bombs . Germany had threatened in propaganda to attack New York with V @-@ 1 flying bombs and V @-@ 2 missiles . After the war the Allies determined that the submarines had not been carrying either . 
 Operation Teardrop was planned during late 1944 in response to intelligence reports which indicated that Germany was preparing a force of missile @-@ armed submarines . Two large US Navy anti @-@ submarine warfare task forces were set up . The plan was executed in April 1945 after several Type IX submarines put to sea from Norway bound for North America . While severe weather conditions in the North Atlantic Ocean greatly reduced the effectiveness of the four US Navy escort carriers involved , long patrol lines of destroyer escorts detected and engaged most of the German submarines . Aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force supported this effort . Five of the seven submarines in the group stationed off the US were sunk , four with their entire crews . 33 U @-@ 546 crew members were captured , and specialists among them abusively interrogated . One destroyer escort was sunk , with the loss of most of her crew . The war ended shortly afterwards and all surviving U @-@ boats surrendered ; interrogation of their crews found that missile launching equipment was not fitted . 
 = = Background = = 
 In late 1944 , the Allies received intelligence reports which suggested that Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine was planning to use V @-@ 1 flying bombs launched from submarines to attack cities on the east coast of the United States . In September of that year , Oscar Mantel , a spy captured by the US Navy when the submarine transporting him to Maine was sunk , told his Federal Bureau of Investigation interrogators that several missile @-@ equipped U @-@ boats were being readied . United States Tenth Fleet analysts subsequently examined photos of unusual mountings on U @-@ boats at bases in Norway , but concluded that they were wooden tracks used to load torpedoes . Further rumors of missile @-@ armed submarines emerged later that year , including one from Sweden passed on by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force . The British Admiralty discounted these reports , and assessed that while V @-@ 1s could be potentially mounted on Type IX submarines , the Germans were unlikely to devote scarce resources to such a project . 
 Despite the Tenth Fleet and Admiralty assessments , the U.S. military and government remained concerned that Germany would conduct vengeance attacks against East Coast cities . In early November 1944 , the Eastern Sea Frontier mounted an intensive search for submarines within 250 mi ( 400 km ) of New York City . In early December 1944 , the spies William Curtis <unk> and Erich Gimpel , who had been captured in New York City after being landed by U @-@ 1230 in Maine , told their interrogators that Germany was preparing a group of rocket @-@ equipped submarines . On 10 December , the Mayor of New York City , Fiorello La Guardia , publicly warned that Germany was considering an attack on New York with long @-@ range rockets . La Guardia 's warning and the claims made by the captured spies received considerable media coverage . Despite this , the Department of War , which was dominated by the Army , advised President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 11 December that the threat of missile attack was so low that it did not justify the diversion of resources from other tasks . This assessment was not supported by the U.S. Navy . 
 In response to the perceived threat , the U.S. Atlantic Fleet prepared a plan to defend the east coast from attacks by aerial raiders and missiles . This plan was originally code @-@ named ' Operation Bumblebee ' , and later renamed ' Operation Teardrop ' . Completed on 6 January 1945 , the plan involved U.S. Navy anti @-@ submarine forces as well as United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) and Army units , which were responsible for shooting down attacking aircraft and missiles . The centerpiece of the plan was the formation of two large naval task forces to operate in the mid @-@ Atlantic as a barrier against submarines approaching the east coast . These task forces were formed from several existing escort carrier groups , and used Naval Station Argentia , Newfoundland , as their forward operating base . As well as guarding against missile attacks , these large forces were tasked with countering the new and high @-@ performance Type XXI submarines if they began operating in the central Atlantic . The Atlantic Fleet 's commander , Vice Admiral Jonas H. Ingram , gave a press conference on 8 January in which he warned there was a threat of missile attack and announced that a large force had been assembled to counter seaborne missile launchers . 
 In January 1945 , German Minister of Armaments and War Production Albert Speer made a propaganda broadcast in which he claimed that V @-@ 1 and V @-@ 2s " would fall on New York by February 1 , 1945 " , increasing the U.S. Government 's concern over the threat of attack . However , the Germans had no ability to fire missiles from their submarines , as both attempts to develop submarine @-@ launched rockets ended in failure . In June 1942 , U @-@ 511 was used to trial small and short @-@ ranged artillery rockets which could be fired while submerged . Development of this system ended in early 1943 , as it was found to decrease the U @-@ boats ' seaworthiness . The German military also began the development of a U @-@ boat @-@ towed launch canister for the V @-@ 2 ballistic missile in November 1944 . Once complete , these canisters were to be towed to a position off the U.S. east coast and be used to attack New York . Vulkan Docks in Stettin was contracted to build a prototype in March or April 1945 , but little work took place before Germany 's final collapse . It is unlikely that the system would have been successful if it had been completed .

 = = = Initial deployments = = = 
 Nine Type IX U @-@ boats were dispatched from Norway to patrol off Canada and the U.S. in March 1945 and attack shipping . The purpose of this deployment was to divert Allied anti @-@ submarine forces away from the coastal waters of the United Kingdom . These waters were the main operational area for German submarines in early 1945 , but heavy casualties had forced the German navy to break off operations in late March . On 12 April , U @-@ 518 , U @-@ 546 , U @-@ 805 , U @-@ 858 , U @-@ 880 , U @-@ 881 and U @-@ 1235 were designated " Gruppe Seewolf " and ordered to attack shipping from New York southwards . The remaining two boats , U @-@ 530 and U @-@ 548 , were directed to Canadian waters . 
 The Allies were aware of this force 's departure and destination through information gathered from Enigma decrypts . Vice Admiral Ingram and the U.S. Tenth Fleet concluded that the boats in Gruppe Seewolf were carrying V @-@ 1s and launched Operation Teardrop in response . The ships of the First Barrier Force , which comprised escort carriers USS Mission Bay and Croatan and 20 destroyer escorts , sortied from Hampton Roads between 25 and 27 March , proceeded to Argentia to refuel and assembled east of Cape Race on 11 April . Twelve of the destroyer escorts deployed into a line 120 mi ( 190 km ) long while the two carriers , each protected by four destroyer escorts , sailed to the west of the line . The carriers ' air operations were , however , greatly hindered by heavy seas . The rough weather also forced the cancellation of planned memorial services for President Roosevelt after his death on 12 April . 
 As it sailed west , Gruppe Seewolf was ordered to attack shipping by U @-@ boat Command . The boats found no targets , however , as the Allies had routed convoys to the south to avoid the submarines and severe weather . The German submarines began to reach their initial stations east of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on 8 April . U @-@ Boat Command assigned Gruppe Seewolf 12 different scouting lines between 2 and 19 April . The radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by the Allies , providing them with accurate information on where the boats were operating .

 Just before midnight on 15 April , USS Stanton made radar contact with U @-@ 1235 at a position about 500 mi ( 800 km ) north of Flores Island . She immediately attacked the submarine with her hedgehog anti @-@ submarine mortar , but the submarine submerged and escaped . Assisted by USS Frost , Stanton quickly gained sonar contact with the submarine and made three more hedgehog attacks . The third attack , which was conducted at 00 : 33 on 16 April , sank the submarine with the loss of her entire crew . Shortly afterwards Frost detected U @-@ 880 by radar as she attempted to flee the area on the surface . After illuminating the submarine with star shell and spotlights , the destroyer escort opened fire on her with Bofors 40 mm guns from a range of 650 yd ( 590 m ) at 02 : 09 . U @-@ 880 quickly submerged but was tracked by Stanton 's and Frost 's sonar operators . The two American ships made several hedgehog attacks on the submarine , with Stanton sinking her with no survivors at 04 : 04 . Both submarines suffered huge explosions after being struck by hedgehog projectiles . This further raised the fear that they were carrying rockets and motivated the First Barrier Force to intensify its efforts to destroy the remaining U @-@ boats . 
 The First Barrier Force maneuvered south westward following the destruction of U @-@ 1235 and U @-@ 880 . Leigh light @-@ equipped Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberators from <unk> @-@ 114 spotted U @-@ 805 on the surface during the nights of 18 – 19 April . The submarine was only 50 nmi ( 93 km ) from Mission Bay and her escorts , but was not attacked as the aircraft could not confirm whether she was hostile before she submerged . On the night of 20 April , U @-@ 546 attempted to torpedo a U.S. destroyer escort , but missed . The following night , U @-@ 805 was detected by USS Mosley , but escaped after being depth charged by Mosley , Lowe and <unk> Blakely for two hours . 
 The First Barrier Force scored its final success on the night of 21 – 22 April . Just before midnight , USS Carter detected U @-@ 518 with sonar . USS Neal A. Scott joined her and made the initial hedgehog attack on the submarine . Following this , Carter made her own hedgehog run , which sank U @-@ 518 with no survivors . By this time , the First Barrier Force was returning to Argentia , after the Second Barrier Force had relieved it . 
 Even though Operation Teardrop was undertaken in the part of the North Atlantic for which Canada had primary responsibility , Ingram did not seek assistance from the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) at any stage of the engagement . Moreover , Ingram did not provide the Canadian military with a situation report until after the sinking of U @-@ 518 . However , aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) flew offensive patrols in support of the American effort , and the RCN and RCAF intensified their patrols of inshore waters around Halifax . 
 = = = Second Barrier Force actions = = = 
 The Second Barrier Force comprised escort carriers USS Bogue and Core and 22 destroyer escorts . Bogue and 10 destroyer escorts had sailed from Quonset on 16 April , while Core and 12 destroyer escorts sailed from Bermuda and other locations . The force was initially stationed along the 45th meridian in a patrol line 105 mi ( 169 km ) long , and sailed towards the east . This line was made up of 14 destroyer escorts sailing at 5 mi ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) intervals , with Core and her four escorts at its northern end and Bogue and her four escorts at the southern end . 
 On the night of 22 – 23 April , U @-@ boat Command dissolved Gruppe Seewolf and directed the three surviving boats to take up stations between New York and Halifax . Shortly afterwards , U @-@ 881 , U @-@ 889 and U @-@ 1229 , which had been operating separately , were also ordered to positions between New York and Cape Hatteras . Radio signals directing these deployments were decrypted by Allied code breakers and increased fears that the submarines were trying to attack American cities . 
 The Second Barrier Force encountered its first U @-@ boat on 23 April when a Grumman TBF Avenger from VC @-@ 19 sighted U @-@ 881 about 74 nmi ( 137 km ) north west of Bogue just after noon . The aircraft dropped depth charges , but did not seriously damage the submarine . This was the first attack made by an aircraft during Operation Teardrop . 
 The next day , U @-@ 546 sighted Core and maneuvered to attack the escort carrier . She attempted to pass through the barrier line but was detected by USS Frederick C. Davis at 08 : 30 , which immediately prepared to attack the submarine . After realizing that his boat had been detected U @-@ 546 's commander , Kapitänleutnant Paul Just , fired a T @-@ 5 acoustic torpedo at the destroyer escort from a range of 650 yd ( 590 m ) . Frederick C. Davis ' <unk> decoy was not effective , and the torpedo struck her forward engine room at <unk> . She sank five minutes later with the loss of 126 of her 192 crewmen . Eight American destroyer escorts subsequently hunted U @-@ 546 for almost 10 hours before USS Flaherty severely damaged her with a hedgehog salvo . The submarine immediately surfaced , but sank after Flaherty and three or four other destroyer escorts fired at it . Kapitänleutnant Just and 32 other crewmen survived the sinking and were taken prisoner . 
 Some of U @-@ 546 's survivors were harshly treated in an attempt to force them to divulge whether the submarines bound for the U.S. east coast were carrying missiles . After brief interviews on board Bogue , the survivors were transferred to the U.S. base at Argentia . Upon arrival on 27 April , the prisoners were screened for interrogation , with eight specialists being separated from the other 25 survivors , who were then sent to prisoner of war camps . The specialists were held in solitary confinement and subjected to " shock interrogation " techniques , exhausting physical exercise and beatings . On 30 April , Kapitänleutnant Just provided brief information on Gruppe Seewolf 's composition and mission following a second interview in which he collapsed unconscious . The information provided by Just and the other specialists did not mention whether the submarines were equipped with missiles . The eight men were transferred to Fort Hunt , Virginia shortly after VE Day , where they continued to be harshly treated until Just agreed to write an account of U @-@ 546 's history on 12 May . Historian Philip K. Lundeberg has written that the beating and torture of U @-@ 546 's survivors was a " singular atrocity " motivated by the interrogators ' need to promptly extract information on potential missile attacks . 
 The Second Barrier Force slowly moved south west from 24 April , searching for the remaining U @-@ boats . USS <unk> made radar contact with a submarine on the night of 24 April , but it escaped during the resulting search . After a week of searching south of the Newfoundland Banks , the barrier force was split on 2 May to provide greater depth . The Mission Bay group reinforced the Second Barrier Force during this period , bringing its strength to three escort carriers and thirty one destroyer escorts . 
 U @-@ 881 became the fifth and final U @-@ boat to be sunk during Operation Teardrop on 5 May . The boat was detected while attempting to pass submerged through the barrier line by USS Farquhar shortly before daybreak . The destroyer escort immediately turned to starboard and dropped depth charges , which sank the submarine with no survivors at <unk> . U @-@ 881 was the last German submarine to be sunk by the U.S. Navy during World War II . 
 The Second Barrier Force established its final barrier line along the 60th meridian on 7 May . Following the unconditional surrender of all German forces that day , it accepted the surrender of U @-@ 234 , U @-@ 805 , U @-@ 858 and U @-@ 1228 at sea before returning to bases on the U.S. east coast . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the German surrender the U.S. Navy continued its efforts to determine whether the U @-@ boats had carried missiles . The crews of U @-@ 805 and U @-@ 858 were interrogated and confirmed that their boats were not fitted with missile launching equipment . Kapitänleutnant Fritz Steinhoff , who had commanded U @-@ 511 during her rocket trials and was captured at sea when he surrendered U @-@ 873 , was subjected to an abusive interrogation at Portsmouth by the interviewers of U @-@ 546 's crew . An official Navy investigation was held into this interrogation after Steinhoff committed suicide at Charles Street Jail in Boston shortly afterwards . It is not known if the Allies were aware of Steinhoff 's involvement in the rocket trials . 
 The tactics used in Operation Teardrop were evaluated by U.S. Navy officers after the war . The escort carriers ' air wings were disappointed with their experience , as their ability to detect submarines was hampered by severe weather throughout the operation . Despite this , the aircraft were successful in forcing the U @-@ boats to remain submerged , thereby greatly slowing their speed . Other after action reports stressed the importance of teamwork between destroyer escorts when attacking submarines and argued that single barrier lines such as those used throughout most of Operation Teardrop were inferior to grouping ships in assigned patrol areas . Nevertheless , Philip K. Lundeberg has assessed the operation as " a classic demonstration not only of coordinated hunter tactics , derived in part from British experience , but also of the profound impact of communications intelligence in the interdiction of U @-@ boat transit and operating areas . " Similarly , the British official history of the role intelligence played in World War II noted that information obtained from decrypted German radio transmissions contributed to " virtually all " of the sinkings during Operation Teardrop . 
 A variant of the V @-@ 1 was used by the U.S. Navy to test the feasibility of launching missiles from submarines in the years after World War II . Republic ‐ Ford JB ‐ 2 " Loon " missiles were launched from USS <unk> and <unk> in a series of tests which began on February 12 , 1947 . These tests were successful , and led to the development of further submarine @-@ launched cruise missiles . The U.S. Navy 's success in adapting a variant of the V @-@ 1 to be launched from submarines also demonstrated that it would have been technically feasible for the German navy to have done the same . 
 = 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) = 
 The 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) was a mountain infantry division of the Waffen @-@ SS , an armed branch of the German Nazi Party that served alongside but was never formally part of the Wehrmacht during World War II . From March to December 1944 , it fought a counter @-@ insurgency campaign against communist @-@ led Yugoslav Partisan resistance forces in the Independent State of Croatia , a fascist puppet state of Nazi Germany that encompassed almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as parts of Serbia . It was given the title Handschar after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Turkish policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire . It was the first non @-@ Germanic Waffen @-@ SS division , and its formation marked the expansion of the Waffen @-@ SS into a multi @-@ ethnic military force . Composed of Bosnian Muslims ( ethnic Bosniaks ) with some Catholic Croat soldiers and mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche ( ethnic German ) officers and non @-@ commissioned officers , it took an oath of allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and the Croatian leader Ante Pavelić . 
 The division fought briefly in the Syrmia region north of the Sava river prior to crossing into northeastern Bosnia . After crossing the Sava , it established a designated " security zone " in northeastern Bosnia between the Sava , Bosna , Drina and Spreča rivers . It also fought outside the security zone on several occasions , and earned a reputation for brutality and savagery , not only during combat operations , but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians . In late 1944 , parts of the division were transferred briefly to the Zagreb area , after which the non @-@ German members began to desert in large numbers . Over the winter of 1944 – 45 , it was sent to the Baranja region where it fought against the Red Army and Bulgarians throughout southern Hungary , falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the Reich frontier . Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia . The rest retreated further west , hoping to surrender to the western Allies . Most of the remaining members became prisoners of the British Army . Subsequently , 38 officers were extradited to Yugoslavia to face criminal charges , and 10 were executed .

 = = = NDH and Ante Pavelić = = = 
 After the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers on 6 April 1941 , the extreme Croat nationalist and fascist Ante Pavelić , who had been in exile in Benito Mussolini 's Italy , was appointed Poglavnik ( leader ) of an Ustaše @-@ led Croatian state – the Independent State of Croatia ( often called the NDH , from the Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska ) . The NDH combined almost all of modern @-@ day Croatia , all of modern @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts of modern @-@ day Serbia into an " Italian @-@ German quasi @-@ protectorate " . NDH authorities , led by the Ustaše Militia , subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the Serb , Jewish and Roma population living within the borders of the new state . 
 In an effort to secure the loyalty of the Bosnian Muslims , Pavelić ordered that a property in Zagreb be converted into a mosque that he named the " Poglavnik 's Mosque " . Despite Pavelić 's assurances of equality with the Croats , many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule . A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration . Fierce fighting broke out between the Ustaše , Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans in NDH territory . Some Ustaše militia units became convinced that the Muslims were communist sympathizers , and burned their villages and murdered many civilians . The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Ustaše violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population . The Muslims received little protection from the Croatian Home Guard , the regular army of the NDH , whom the Germans described as " of minimal combat value " . Local militias were raised , but these were also of limited value and only one , the Tuzla @-@ based Home Guard " Hadžiefendić Legion " led by Muhamed Hadžiefendić , was of any significance . 
 = = = <unk> and request for protection = = = 
 The Bosnian Muslim elite and notables in various cities and towns issued resolutions or memoranda that publicly denounced Croat @-@ Nazi collaborationist measures along with laws and violence against Serbs : Prijedor ( 23 September 1941 ) , Sarajevo ( 12 October ) , Mostar ( 21 October ) , Banja Luka ( 12 November ) , Bijeljina ( 2 December ) and Tuzla ( 11 December ) . The resolutions condemned the Ustaše in Bosnia and Herzegovina , both for their mistreatment of Muslims and for their attempts to turn Muslims and Serbs against one another . One memorandum declared that since the beginning of the Ustaše regime , the Muslims had dreaded the lawless activities that the Ustaše , Croatian government authorities and various illegal groups had been perpetrating against the Serbs . 
 The Bosnian Muslims ' dissatisfaction with the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for protection were combined with nostalgia for the period of Habsburg rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims . These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH . By November 1942 , the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich . 
 = = Origin = = 
 On 6 December 1942 , Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler and key Waffen @-@ SS recruiting officer SS @-@ Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen @-@ SS Gottlob Berger approached Hitler with the proposal to raise a Bosnian Muslim SS division . Both the Wehrmacht and the Waffen @-@ SS were concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the NDH that tied down German military personnel needed elsewhere . A German source noted that by 1943 over 100 @,@ 000 Bosnian Muslims had been killed and 250 @,@ 000 had become refugees . In addition , a serious food shortage threatened the region . " The Muslims , " remarked SS @-@ Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen @-@ SS Artur Phleps , " bear the special status of being persecuted by all others " . 
 The romantic notions that Himmler had about the Bosnian Muslims were probably significant in the division 's genesis . He was personally fascinated by the Islamic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers . He found their ferocity preferable to the gentility of Christians and believed their martial qualities should be further developed and put to use . He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam " promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action . " As for their ethnic background and SS requirements , it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people , including the Muslims , were not ethnic Slavs but pure Aryans of either Gothic or Iranian descent . 
 Himmler was inspired by the noted successes of the Bosnian @-@ Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He " endeavored to restore what he called ' an old Austrian ' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro @-@ Hungarian Army in the form of a Bosnian Muslim SS Division " . Once raised , the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito 's Partisan forces operating in north @-@ eastern Bosnia , thus restoring local " order " . Himmler 's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population , but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia . " Srem ( Syrmia ) is the breadbasket of Croatia , and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured . I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by ... the Bosnian division ... so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous ( Croatian ) state . " 
 Hitler formally approved the project in mid @-@ February 1943 and Himmler put Artur Phleps , commander of the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen , in charge of raising the first SS division to be recruited from a non @-@ Germanic people . 
 = = Recruitment = = 
 On 18 February 1943 , Phleps travelled to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the NDH government . He met with German foreign ministry envoy Siegfried Kasche and NDH Foreign Minister Dr. Mladen Lorković who represented Pavelić . Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division , but the Waffen @-@ SS and NDH governments had very different ideas of how it would be recruited and controlled . Lorković suggested that it be named the SS Ustaša Division , a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance , with familiar geographically based regimental names such as Bosna , Krajina and Una . This reflected the concerns shared by Pavelić and Kasche that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence . As a compromise , the word " Croatian " was included in its official title and Croatian Catholic officers were recruited . Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit , leaving the NDH very unhappy with the outcome , particularly regarding its ethnic composition . 
 SS @-@ Standartenführer Karl von Krempler , a specialist in Islam who spoke Serbo @-@ Croatian , was charged by Himmler and Phleps with organising the division . On 3 March 1943 , Phleps met with von Krempler , who was to work with NDH government representative Dr. Alija Šuljak . The campaign began on 20 March 1943 , when von Krempler and Šuljak began an 18 @-@ day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts . In the meantime the Germans began raising the divisional headquarters staff in Berlin , including SS @-@ Standartenführer der Reserve Herbert von <unk> , who was transferred from the 6th SS Mountain Division Nord to command the division . 
 Šuljak and von Krempler soon fell out over the aims and purposes of the proposed division . Šuljak , an entirely political appointee , criticized von Krempler 's Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems ( green flags and crescent moons ) during the recruitment drive rather than the Ustaše symbols . When he reached Tuzla in central Bosnia , von Krempler met the Muslim militia leader Major Muhamed Hadžiefendić , who was then officially serving in an under @-@ equipped Croatian Home Guard unit . On 28 March , Hadžiefendić escorted von Krempler to Sarajevo , where he introduced him to Hafiz Muhamed <unk> , who was the leader of the Islamic clergy for Bosnia , the <unk> @-@ ul @-@ ulema as well as other leading Muslim politicians not involved with the Ustaše . The NDH government and Kasche were furious , demanding von Krempler 's immediate removal . The SS ignored the demand and von Krempler continued recruiting , including deserters from the NDH armed forces . 
 = = = Mufti of Jerusalem = = = 
 In April 1943 , the Mufti of Jerusalem , Mohammad Amin al @-@ Husayni , was invited by Berger to assist in organising and recruiting Muslims into the Waffen @-@ SS and other units . He was escorted by von Krempler , who spoke Turkish . The Mufti successfully convinced the Muslims to ignore the declarations of the Sarajevo , Mostar and Banja Luka Ulama ( Islamic clerics ) , who in 1941 forbade them from collaborating with the Ustaše . 
 The Germans emphasised that al @-@ Husayni had flown from Berlin to Sarajevo in order to bless and inspect the division . During his visit to Bosnia al @-@ Husayni also convinced some important Muslim leaders that the formation of the division was in the interests of Islam . 
 The Mufti insisted , " The most important task of this division must be to protect the homeland and families [ of the Bosnian volunteers ] ; the division must not be permitted to leave Bosnia " , but the Germans paid no attention . 
 = = = Croat Catholic recruitment = = = 
 Despite the support of al @-@ Husayni , recruitment of Muslims for the division fell well short of the numbers needed . Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component , but the recruitment of sufficient Muslims continued to prove difficult , resulting in the induction of 2 @,@ 800 Catholic Croats into the division . To Himmler 's dismay , this was greater than the ratio of Catholics to Muslims that he had wanted . 
 Hussein Biščević ( <unk> Biščević or Biščević @-@ beg ; born 28 July 1884 ) was the highest ranking ( and perhaps the oldest ) Bosnian military officer to volunteer . <unk> had served in the Austro – Hungarian army and in August 1943 was appointed as an SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer to command the divisional anti @-@ aircraft battalion . He was eventually judged unsuitable , and was replaced with a German just before the division went into combat . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Sources differ regarding the division 's initial composition . Pavlowitch states that sixty percent of its recruits were Muslims and the rest were Yugoslav Volksdeutsche who made up the majority of its officers and NCOs . Tomasevich states that it was formed with 23 @,@ 200 Muslims and 2 @,@ 800 Croats , with mostly German officers . He further states it was the largest of the Muslim SS Divisions with 26 @,@ 000 men . Lepre indicates that the division 's prescribed strength was reduced from 26 @,@ 000 to 21 @,@ 000 , and Cohen states that the division achieved a maximum strength of 17 @,@ 000 in April 1944 . The division had a Muslim Imam for each battalion other than the all @-@ German signal battalion . For about six months the division included about 1 @,@ 000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo and the Sandžak region who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment , which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment ( I / 28 ) . 
 By the time the division had completed its training , it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs , and its officer corps remained almost entirely German . Most of the officers and NCOs were drawn from replacement units of other Waffen @-@ SS divisions . 
 = = Formation , training and mutiny = = 
 The division was initially sent to southern France for formation and training , where it was accommodated mainly in towns and villages in the Aveyron and <unk> départements . For a long period after its official formation , the division was unnamed and was referred to as the " Kroatische SS @-@ Freiwilligen @-@ Division " ( Croatian SS @-@ Volunteer Division ) or the " <unk> @-@ Division " ( Muslim Division ) . The decision by the Waffen @-@ SS to form and train the division outside Bosnia was contrary to advice given by the NDH 's German plenipotentiary general , Edmund Glaise von Horstenau . This advice soon proved prophetic . 
 On 9 August 1943 , Oberst Karl @-@ Gustav Sauberzweig took command of the division from von <unk> . Sauberzweig transferred to the Waffen @-@ SS and was appointed to the rank of SS @-@ Oberführer . He was a Prussian who had been decorated as an eighteen @-@ year @-@ old company commander during World War I , and had served as a regimental commander during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa before being wounded . A " proven leader of men " , he spoke no Serbo @-@ Croatian but quickly gained the lasting respect and affection of the men of the division . 
 = = = Villefranche @-@ de @-@ Rouergue Mutiny ( September 1943 ) = = = 
 On the night of 16 / 17 September 1943 , while the 13th SS Division was training in Villefranche @-@ de @-@ Rouergue in France , a group of pro @-@ Partisan soldiers led by Muslim and Catholic junior officers staged a mutiny within the Pioneer battalion . Led by <unk> <unk> , Božo Jelinek ( aka Eduard <unk> ) , Nikola <unk> and <unk> <unk> , they captured most of the German personnel and executed five German officers , including battalion commander SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Oskar <unk> . Apparently , the mutineers believed that many of the enlisted men would join them and they could reach the western Allies . 
 The revolt was put down with the assistance of the unit imam , Halim Malkoč , and unit physician Dr. <unk> Schweiger . Malkoč told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that they were being deceived , released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders . Schweiger did the same with 2nd Company . <unk> and <unk> were shot and killed during the fighting , and <unk> was captured , while Jelinek escaped . 
 Sources vary on the number of mutineers killed after the revolt was suppressed . Tomasevich states that 78 of the worst offenders were executed , but Lepre lists only 14 executions while four more deserters were located and shot in late September . Cohen states that about 150 mutineers were killed immediately , while Noel Malcolm writes that 15 of the mutineers died and a further 141 were killed in a subsequent " clean @-@ up operation . " The Germans attributed the infiltration to Tito 's suggestion that his Partisan followers enlist for police duty to receive superior weapons , uniforms and training . <unk> who were deemed " unsuitable for service " or " politically unreliable " were subsequently purged . Eventually , 825 Bosnians were removed from the division and sent to Germany for labour service with Organisation Todt . Of these , 265 refused and were sent to the Neuengamme concentration camp where dozens of them died . 
 Speaking of the Bosnian Muslim troops who had served in the Austro – Hungarian army , Himmler later said , " I knew there was a chance that a few traitors might be smuggled into the division , but I haven 't the slightest doubt concerning the loyalty of the Bosnians . These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago , so why shouldn 't they be so today . " Himmler awarded both Malkoč and Schweiger the Iron Cross Second Class for thwarting the mutiny . Five soldiers were also decorated . 
 When Villefranche @-@ de @-@ Rouergue was liberated in 1944 , the local population decided to pay tribute to the mutineers by naming one of its streets Avenue des <unk> ( Bosnian Muslims were seen by the local population as Croats of Islamic faith ) and commemorating " the revolt of the Croats " every 17 September . Cohen states that after the war , the Yugoslav government requested it be changed to " the revolt of the Yugoslavs " in order to obscure the mutineers ' ethnicity ; this request was refused by the French . The Villefranche @-@ de @-@ Rouergue uprising was originally commemorated in the city with a monument designed by Croatian sculptor <unk> <unk> . 
 = = = Silesia = = = 
 As a result of the mutiny , the division was moved to the Neuhammer training grounds in the Silesian region of Germany ( present @-@ day Poland ) to complete its training . During the training phase , the German officers , pleased with its progress , coined the term <unk> for the Bosnian Muslims . The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić . 
 On 9 October 1943 , SS headquarters officially named the division the 13 . SS @-@ <unk> <unk> Gebirgs @-@ Division ( Kroatien ) , but a short time later a change was made to differentiate it from those that were composed of Germans and it became the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar ( 1st Croatian ) ( German : 13 . Waffen @-@ Gebirgsdivision der SS " Handschar " ( <unk> . Nr. 1 ) , Serbo @-@ Croatian : 13 @.@ <unk> <unk> divizija SS @-@ a <unk> , <unk> i hrvatska br . 1 ) . The division was named Handschar , after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Turkish policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire . On 15 February 1944 , the division completed its training and returned to the NDH by rail . 
 = = Anti @-@ Partisan operations March to May 1944 = = 
 The division was formed for the primary role of securing around 6 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 300 sq mi ) of territory ( the designated security zone ) in north @-@ eastern Bosnia within the NDH . The security zone encompassed the Posavina , Semberija and Majevica regions between the Sava , Bosna , Drina and Spreča rivers . It roughly corresponded with the area of operations of the Partisan 3rd Corps . Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and Volksdeutsche settlements in the Syrmia region to the north . 
 The division participated in what may have been the largest anti @-@ Partisan sweep of World War II : Operation Maibaum . The 13th SS Division also participated in other divisional and corps @-@ sized anti @-@ Partisan operations between March and May 1944 . 
 = = = Operation Wegweiser = = = 
 The division first saw action during Operation Wegweiser ( <unk> ) from 9 to 12 March 1944 . The aim of Operation Wegweiser was to clear a part of the Syrmia region which was occupied by Partisans who threatened the Zagreb @-@ Belgrade railway . The Partisans were operating from forests around Bosut and villages along the Sava . As the division entered the area , the Partisans withdrew to the south @-@ east , avoiding decisive engagement . Sauberzweig claimed the Partisans suffered 573 killed and 82 captured . Hoare writes that the division massacred hundreds of Serb civilians during the operation . According to Vladimir Dedijer and Antun Miletić , 223 civilians were killed in Bosut , 352 in Sremska Rača , and 70 in Jamena , mostly old men , women and children . The operation was a success in clearing the Bosut forests , but the Partisans returned to the area soon after it concluded . 
 = = = Operation Save = = = 
 On 15 March 1944 , Operation Save was launched with the objective of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region . Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division : " We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will ( soon ) begin the march into the homeland . ... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons . Not only do you ( have these ) in your hands , but above all you have an idea in your hearts – to liberate the homeland . ... Before long , each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home , as a soldier and a gentleman ; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler . " 
 Sauberzweig also ordered that each commander read a prepared message as his unit crossed the Sava River , which emphasized that the " liberation of Bosnia " and ultimately the liberation of " Muslim Albania " was their goal . This was a direct appeal to the Albanian troops as well as the Bosnians . The 27th Regiment crossed the Sava at dawn at Bosanska Rača near the confluence with the Drina . The rest crossed at Brčko covered by an intense artillery bombardment . Contact was immediately made with Partisan forces , who quickly withdrew into the forests . The service support units remained north of the Sava in Vinkovci , which became their permanent garrison area . The 27th Regiment advanced easily across the Pannonian Plain through <unk> Selo to <unk> and then on to Bijeljina which was taken against light Partisan resistance late on 16 March . 
 The 27th Regiment then consolidated its position in Bijeljina while the 28th Regiment and the divisional reconnaissance battalion ( German : <unk> ) bore the brunt of the fighting as they advanced through <unk> , Čelić and Koraj at the foot of the Majevica mountains . Sauberzweig later recorded that the 2nd battalion of the 28th Regiment ( II / 28 ) " at Čelić stormed the Partisan defenses with ( new ) battalion commander Hans Hanke at the point " and that enemy forces withdrew after a hard battle with heavy losses , low on ammunition . 
 Once the area was secured , defensive positions were established along the Čelić – Lopare road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance . On the night of 17 – 18 March , elements of the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division and 36th Vojvodina Division mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment 's positions at Koraj and <unk> , losing over 200 . 
 = = = Operation Osterei = = = 
 After Operation Save , the division remained relatively static for more than three weeks , mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks . The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia , but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on the divisional western flank , attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at Gornji <unk> on 26 March , killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14 . The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week . In early April , 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division . They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans . 
 Operation Osterei ( Easter Egg ) began on 12 April 1944 with the goal of clearing the Majevica mountain , which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General Kosta Nađ . The 27th Regiment quickly captured Janja and drove through Donja <unk> to reach the <unk> coal mines , an important economic objective for the German war machine . Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April , the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead , 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition . The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja <unk> . 
 The 28th Regiment drove south through <unk> and during fighting around Priboj , its 1st Battalion ( I / 28 ) , made up of Albanians , incurred heavy casualties . The Partisan 3rd Corps then withdrew the 16th and 36th Vojvodina Divisions south across the Tuzla – Zvornik road . The reconnaissance battalion continued the advance , driving into the western <unk> and capturing Srebrnik and <unk> then linking up with the Croatian Home Guard 1st Mountain Brigade . The Germans considered Operation Osterei a major success , achieving all objectives with minimal losses . 
 During the final phase of Operation Osterei , I / 28 was withdrawn from the fighting and transferred to Pristina in Kosovo to form part of the 21st Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Skanderbeg ( 1st Albanian ) being raised by Himmler 's order . A new I / 28 was raised from other divisional units and new recruits . 
 In the latter part of Operation Osterei , Jagdkommandos , lightly armed and mobile " hunter teams " of company or battalion strength , were used to break up and harass Partisans still operating on the flanks . These teams killed over 380 Partisans and captured over 200 between 21 and 23 April . By mid @-@ April , half of the security zone had been cleared of Partisans . 
 = = = Operation Maibaum = = = 
 The ambitious goal of Operation Maibaum ( Maypole ) was to destroy the Partisan 3rd Corps . Army Group F ordered V SS Mountain Corps to form a blockade along the Drina to prevent the Partisan force from crossing into Serbia . Operation Maibaum was one of the largest counter @-@ insurgency operations of World War II and included 7th SS Division and NDH forces . The 13th SS Division was under the command of V SS Corps , and the primary tasks of the division were to capture Tuzla and Zvornik , then drive south parallel with the Drina to meet other Corps elements . The original plan included the parachute insertion of 500th SS Parachute Battalion into the Vlasenica area , but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather . Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area . The deployment south of the Spreča , and therefore outside the security zone , during Operation Maibaum was ordered by the corps commander , Phleps , despite opposition from Sauberzweig . This caused friction between the two that eventually required Himmler 's intervention . 
 On 23 April , the 28th Regiment pushed south along mountain roads through Tuzla . The following day it continued on as far as <unk> . On 25 April , the 27th Regiment advanced south to capture Zvornik . At the same time , the 28th Regiment sent I / 28 east towards Vlasenica and II / 28 continuing south towards Kladanj , capturing the town on 27 April . Due to the level of the Drinjača at Kladanj , instead of fording the river and pushing east towards Vlasenica , II / 28 continued south @-@ east towards Han Pijesak , where they met elements of 7th SS Division advancing north . 
 I / 28 captured Vlasenica on 28 April , but was almost immediately attacked from the east by two Partisan divisions . A third Partisan division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at Šekovići , 30 kilometres north @-@ west of Vlasenica . Both II / 28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica , where II / 28 relieved the battered I / 28 and then surrounded Šekovići . After a 48 @-@ hour battle , during which II / 28 was decimated , the town was taken . 
 While the battle of Šekovići raged , the 27th Regiment extended the Drina blockade further south , ambushing a Partisan column and reaching Nova <unk> on 30 April . After the situation at Šekovići improved on 1 May , the 27th Regiment returned to patrolling the Tuzla – Zvornik road . The 28th Regiment moved to the Simin Han @-@ Lopare area on 5 May , while the 7th SS Division pursued the Partisans withdrawing south . 
 Operation Maibaum had not only stopped the Partisan 3rd Corps from crossing the Drina into Serbia , it had scattered the Partisan formation . On 6 May , V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division to return to the security zone north of the Spreča . 
 = = = Operation Maiglöckchen = = = 
 On 17 – 18 May 1944 , the division , along with the local Majevica @-@ Tuzla Chetnik unit commanded by Radivoj <unk> , commenced Operation Maiglöckchen ( May Bell ) to destroy several Partisan brigades in the <unk> . The Partisans were encircled in the Stolice heights . An attempt by the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division to relieve the surrounded force was defeated by the reconnaissance battalion and elements of the 28th Regiment . The relieving column was driven back across the <unk> . After heavy bombardment by the artillery regiment , the trapped Partisan force escaped south out of the pocket under cover of darkness on 18 May . The Partisans suffered considerable casualties , for example the 17th Majevica Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division lost 16 killed and 60 missing . At the conclusion of Operation Maiglöckchen , the 27th Regiment remained near Zvornik and the 28th Regiment deployed near <unk> . 
 = = Cooperation with local forces = = 
 After Operation Maiglöckchen , the division shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans access to the security zone . Since its arrival in the zone the division had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability . These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13 @,@ 000 , <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> ( or Green Cadres , a Muslim nationalist militia ) most of which eventually joined the Partisans , and both Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard , neither of which was effective . These same groups , along with the Partisans , had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect . Between March and June 1944 , these attempts were largely fruitless , producing fewer than 200 deserters .

 = = = Operation Vollmond = = = 
 Following Operation Rösselsprung ( Knight 's Move ) , the German attempt to kill or capture Tito at Drvar in western Bosnia on 25 May 1944 , the Partisan leader ordered a general uprising . The Partisan 3rd Corps planned an offensive that involved three parallel columns of divisional strength thrusting north into the zone to engage and destroy German and local allied forces . The columns comprised : 
 " Western Column " – 16th Vojvodina Division commanded by Danilo <unk> 
 " Centre Column " – 38th East Bosnia Division commanded by Miloš <unk> 
 " Eastern Column " – 36th Vojvodina Division commanded by Marko Perić 
 Operation Vollmond ( Full Moon ) was devised quickly after the reconnaissance battalion observed Partisan forces crossing the Tuzla – Zvornik road on the evening of 6 June 1944 . Sauberzweig 's aim was to assault from the east and north , pushing the advancing Partisan forces against the Drina . The German plan underestimated the strength of the Partisan " Western Column " and had placed only one battalion ( I / 28 ) on high ground in the Partisans ' path . This battalion included many raw recruits , and was protecting two batteries of the artillery regiment , one of which ( 7 / AR13 ) was deployed just east of Lopare . 
 Late on 7 June , the Partisans scattered I / 28 and although II / 28 was sent from <unk> to assist , the 16th Vojvodina Division surged forward against the positions of 7 / AR13 , which consisted of 80 men with four 150 mm guns and only one machine gun . After four hours fighting , and with half the battery 's personnel dead , the artillerymen ran out of small arms ammunition and scattered into the forest . As a result of a counterattack by II / 28 on the afternoon of 9 June and throughout 10 June , the 16th Vojvodina Division withdrew that afternoon and the battalion pursued both the " Western Column " and " Centre Column " south . The guns and vehicles of 7 / AR13 had been destroyed by the Partisans before they withdrew and there were reports that the German dead at Lopare had been mutilated . The " Eastern Column " was stopped by the 27th Regiment and the last of the Partisan 3rd Corps was pushed back across the Spreča on 12 June . 
 According to German accounts , Operation Vollmond cost the division 205 dead , 528 wounded and 89 missing . I / 28 had been decimated , with only 180 men remaining . Sauberzweig claimed 3 @,@ 000 Partisans were killed in this operation , but Phleps dismissed this as " a large exaggeration " . According to one German after @-@ action report , they had killed over 1 @,@ 500 Partisans and captured large amounts of arms and ammunition . According to Partisan sources , the losses of the Partisan 3rd Corps were : 
 " Western Column " – 58 dead , 198 wounded and 29 missing 
 " Central Column " – 12 dead , 19 wounded , 17 missing 
 " Eastern Column " – 72 dead , 142 wounded and 9 missing 
 At the conclusion of Operation Vollmond , the commander of the 27th Regiment , Desiderius Hampel , was appointed division commander at his substantive rank of Standartenführer and Sauberzweig was tasked with forming a new corps headquarters , the IX Waffen Mountain Corps of the SS ( Croatian ) . The commander of the 28th Regiment , Helmuth Raithel , was tasked to raise the new 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama ( 2nd Croatian ) . Both the new corps headquarters and new division were to be formed in southern Hungary . Three NCOs from every company of 13th SS Division , along with other personnel , were transferred to form the core of 23rd SS Division . New commanders were appointed to the two mountain infantry regiments , notably Hans Hanke to the 28th . 
 Soon after Hampel 's assumption of command , he became aware that local Chetniks were scavenging the Operation Vollmond battlefields for divisional equipment . He met with the Chetnik leader <unk> and arranged for the return of the equipment in exchange for small arms ammunition and boxes of hand grenades . 
 Throughout the remainder of June 1944 and into the first week of July , the division was engaged in fighting off attempted Partisan incursions into the security zone and reinforcing local NDH and Chetniks who were under attack from the Partisans . During the summer of 1944 , elements of the division were tasked with guarding Hungarian Jewish forced labourers building fortifications in Tuzla . While guarding the labourers , they subjected them to cruel treatment , and shot 22 who were unable to continue working . 
 = = = Operation Fliegenfänger = = = 
 Operation Fliegenfänger ( <unk> ) was launched on 14 July 1944 . It aimed to destroy a makeshift Partisan runway in the Osmaci area about 26 kilometres ( 16 mi ) southeast of Tuzla , south of the Tuzla – Zvornik road and the Partisan forces guarding it . The airstrip was just north of the southern boundary of the security zone and was being used by Allied aircraft to bring in supplies and evacuate wounded Partisans to Italy . It had been built by the 19th Birač Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division between 3 and 6 July , and the first flight into the airfield occurred on the night of 6 / 7 July . The 19th Birač Brigade was also responsible for its defence . Two battalions of the 27th Regiment , along with a battalion of Chetniks from Majevica launched the operation from the line of <unk> – <unk> – Prnjavor , and captured the towns of Osmaci and <unk> and damaged the airfield despite stiff resistance . That afternoon , the 19th Birač Brigade counter @-@ attacked and pushed the German and Chetniks back across the Tuzla – Zvornik road . At the same time as the counter @-@ attack was underway , the headquarters of the Partisan 3rd Corps ordered the 36th Vojvodina Division to clear the enemy from the area so that the airfield could be used . During the night of 14 / 15 July , elements of the 36th Vojvodina Division arrived in the Osmaci area and relieved the 19th Birač Brigade , which moved towards Srebrenica . During the night of 16 / 17 July , Allied aircraft delivered equipment to Osmaci and about 100 wounded Partisans were airlifted to Italy . 
 According to German reports , 42 Partisans were killed , while the division 's losses were four dead and seven wounded . The Partisan force withdrew south to the Vlasenica – <unk> area . The cooperation with the Chetnik battalion was described in the IX SS Mountain Corps war diary as " effective " . 
 = = = Operation Heiderose = = = 
 While the division was conducting Operation Fliegenfänger , the Second Panzer Army was developing a plan to block a large Partisan force from moving from central Bosnia into western Serbia to reinforce the Partisans . Due to issues with the availability of various units of V SS Mountain Corps , the planned Operation Rose was cancelled . 
 In the interim , since most of the division was deployed in the southern part of the security zone , Hampel planned a divisional @-@ level operation , named Operation Heiderose ( Wild Rose ) targeting Partisan positions north @-@ west of Šekovići , south of the Spreča . The 27th Regiment , reinforced by the same Chetnik battalion that cooperated in Operation Fliegenfänger , would attack east towards Šekovići and the 28th Regiment would push south . A detached battalion of 7th SS Division would act as a blocking force driving north . Hampel was apparently unhappy with the performance of the new commander of the 27th Regiment ( SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Hermann Peter ) and put the divisional chief of staff , SS @-@ Sturmbannführer Erich Braun , in charge of the 27th Regiment . 
 On 17 July , the operation began . Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment , while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to <unk> before dusk without serious opposition . Early on 18 July , the Chetniks attacked from <unk> towards Šekovići . The 27th Regiment reached <unk> and seized the high ground south of Šekovići on 19 July 1944 . The 28th Regiment forced the Partisan 36th Vojvodina Division back . The battalion from 7th SS Division encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through . On 19 July , the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje <unk> to attack the Partisan 12th Corps at <unk> . The reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division pushed in from Vareš as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj . 
 The Partisans then committed the 16th Vojvodina Division to assist the 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation Heiderose to this point . On 20 July , both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment , which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties . On 23 July , the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area . The division began to search for the hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there . After a day of searching , the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases , which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days . 
 Operation Heiderose was a significant success for the division , inflicting serious losses on the Partisans . More than 900 Partisans were killed and a large amount of equipment was captured : one anti @-@ tank gun , two mortars , 22 machine guns , over 800 rifles and nearly 500 @,@ 000 rounds of small arms ammunition . The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded . Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses , with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead , wounded and missing . However , Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own . Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported , apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division 's formation . 
 = = = Operation Hackfleisch = = = 
 In the first week of August 1944 , the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia , originally planned as Operation Rose . Renamed Operation Rübezahl ( Mountain Spirit ) , the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation , named Operation Hackfleisch ( Minced Meat ) . Hackfleisch aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj , Vlasenica , Sokolac and Olovo , south of the security zone . The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units , thereby destroying them . 
 The columns were allocated tasks and composed as follows : 
 the reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division was to drive west from Vareš and attack the Partisans around the town of Olovo , pushing them east ; 
 I / 28 from 13th SS Division was to attack south and south @-@ east from Ribnica towards Olovo ; 
 III / 28 from 13th SS Division was to thrust south and south @-@ east from Kladanj towards the village of Petrović ; 
 the 27th Regiment of 13th SS Division was to drive southwards from Šekovići ; 
 parts of the 14th Regiment of 7th SS Division were to push north @-@ west between Olovo and Sokolac ; and 
 parts of the 13th Regiment of 7th SS Division were to attack northwards through Sokolac . 
 The 27th Regiment became locked in fierce fighting with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division , which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica . The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica – Han Pijesak road to the east . Other Partisan forces withdrew in the direction of Goražde . 
 As far as the Germans were concerned , Operation Hackfleisch was a moderate success , with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken . It delayed , but did not prevent , the Partisans ' advance into Serbia . In order to allow the 7th SS Division to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia , both I / 28 and III / 28 were placed under the command of that division for the period of 8 – 17 August 1944 . During the remainder of August 1944 , the rump of the division fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone . The Partisan 11th Krajina Division and 38th Bosnia Division quickly infiltrated into the southern part of the security zone and the 27th East Bosnia Division crossed into the area north @-@ west of Srebrenica and drove towards Bratunac . After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks , the division scattered the 11th Krajina Division and mauled the 27th East Bosnia Division . 
 The division had by now been fighting almost continuously throughout the summer . According to divisional commander Hampel , it had been exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began . The cumulative effect of this exhaustion , the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše , was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944 . 
 = = Last battles against the Partisans = = 
 In early September 1944 , the division returned north to the security zone , basing the infantry battalions in the villages of <unk> , <unk> ( south of Foča ) , Osmaci and Srebrnik . Almost immediately , the Partisan 3rd Corps commenced an offensive , attacking II / 28 at Srebrnik . It held on despite being pressed hard during two days of fighting against the 11th Krajina Division . By the end of the first week in September , divisional supply columns were being attacked by Chetniks , sensing German weakness and looking for arms and supplies . Three members of the division were killed in these attacks . Over the same week , the Allies conducted Operation <unk> throughout the Balkans , which involved Allied air power pounding Axis troop concentrations and key infrastructure in order to impede the German withdrawal from Greece . The local effect was to complicate the division 's logistics through destruction of the Sarajevo @-@ Brod railway and mass desertions of NDH troops tasked with securing supply lines . 
 On 8 September , II / 27 was assaulted unsuccessfully by the Partisans at <unk> . After the first week of September , most of the division 's fighting power was shifted to the western boundary of the security zone to meet Partisan incursions . The division succeeded in dislodging Partisan units from <unk> and <unk> and allied Chetniks captured <unk> . After relief by NDH forces , the division 's fighting regiments withdrew to Brčko for rest and refit . As a result of the shift to the western area of the security zone , the zone 's southern area was quickly overrun by Partisan forces . Zvornik and Tuzla had fallen by mid @-@ September . 
 = = August 1944 – May 1945 = = 
 On 17 August 1944 , Tito offered a general amnesty and many in the division took advantage of this opportunity . During the first three weeks of September , while hard fighting continued , over 2 @,@ 000 Bosnians deserted , many taking their weapons with them . They went home , joined the " <unk> <unk> " militia or went over to the Ustaše . Many defected to the Partisans , with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October . 
 Due to high rates of desertion from 13th SS Division , Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division , but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2 @,@ 000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re @-@ organise the remaining troops of both divisions there , with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps , which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary . 
 In the early morning of 3 October 1944 , the Partisan 28th Slavonia Division assaulted a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone . As they broke out of the encirclement to the north , the rest of the reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost . Rushing towards Janja from the east , III / 27 came into contact with Partisans around <unk> , reaching the Janja garrison at 10 pm that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3 / AR 13 during the night . At dawn the following day , an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja , with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south . Jagdkommandos were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . Following this battle , Army Group F concluded that the division 's overall combat value was minimal . 
 A few days later , the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment ( 9 / 28 ) displayed what could still be achieved by the Bosnians under determined leadership when Leutnant Hans König ambushed the Partisan 17th Majevica Brigade near Vukosavci , killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations . König was awarded the German Cross in Gold for his fanatical leadership . 
 = = = Division splits = = = 
 While 9 / 28 was fighting near Vukosavci , a number of units , consisting mainly of artillery , were temporarily detached for duty with other formations of Second Panzer Army fighting Soviet troops within the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . The division was not re @-@ united until January 1945 . 
 After a request from Army Group F to Himmler , a decision was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb . This would relieve <unk> Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army . The 28th Regiment , I / 27 and III / AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open . The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north @-@ east Bosnia to northern Croatia , but it made matters worse : the Bosnians were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944 . Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans . In mid @-@ October , 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans , and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade . 
 = = = Operation <unk> = = = 
 On 20 October , the Red Army and Partisan forces captured Belgrade and the following day the divisional staff Imam , <unk> <unk> , incited a mutiny and led 100 men back to Bosnia . Himmler finally agreed to the disarming of the " unreliable " Bosnians under Operation <unk> ( Autumn Leaves ) on 25 October . Between 900 and 1 @,@ 000 Bosnians in the Brčko bridgehead and over 2 @,@ 300 in Zagreb were allocated to labour battalions and similar non @-@ combatant auxiliary duties , although the disarming operation was not completed in the Zagreb area until mid @-@ November . By the beginning of November the division , which had been ninety five percent non @-@ German in January 1944 , became fifty percent German . The plans to re @-@ organise the division were abandoned and Sauberzweig was relieved of command . In addition , Sauberzweig 's IX SS Mountain Corps staff was dissolved and the remnants were placed under the command of LXVIII Army Corps , under which they remained for the rest of the war . 
 = = = Fighting Soviet troops = = = 
 Meanwhile , the advance of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the formerly Hungarian @-@ occupied Yugoslav region of Baranja made holding the line of the Danube critical for the Germans . In early November the Soviet troops established a bridgehead over the Danube from Apatin ( in modern @-@ day Serbia ) . From 9 November onward , the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front , starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at <unk> west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November . They were followed by a grouping of three battalions ( I / 27 , II / 28 and II / 28 ) , an artillery battalion ( III / AR 13 ) and pioneer support . Known as Kampfgruppe Hanke after their commander Hans Hanke , they moved from the Brčko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at <unk> on 14 November south @-@ west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been established at Batina ( in modern @-@ day Croatia ) . As a result , the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia . Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion , which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin . By 20 November , the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina . The following day Kampfgruppe Hanke was driven out of its positions , when the remaining 200 troops withdrew . By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area . The remnants of Kampfgruppe Hanke were placed under command of <unk> Division Hoch und <unk> , withdrawing as far as Siklós in southern Hungary by 29 November . 
 Within days Kampfgruppe Hanke was withdrawn from the front line to rejoin the division and re @-@ fit , and they were moved to Barcs on the Drava river for that purpose . On 2 December the division was reunited , except for the rest of the pioneer battalion , which remained stranded in Bosnia by damaged bridges and railways . As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by Kampfgruppe Hanke , the division retained little of its original Bosnian character . Despite the return of disarmed Bosnians from labour units , the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little different from any other unit in the Second Panzer Army . 
 After a short break , the division was allocated to a sector of the Margarethe Line , a series of fixed defensive works south of Lake Balaton which held up the Soviet advance . After several Red Army assaults were repulsed , static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945 . In early March 1945 , a few units took part in Operation Frühlingserwachen ( Spring Awakening ) , which was to be Germany 's last major offensive . Meanwhile , from December 1944 to March 1945 , the rest of the division remained at Barcs rebuilding . In February they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion , which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia . On 16 March , the Soviets launched the Vienna Offensive , bypassing the Barcs area . That night , the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at <unk> , where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war . 
 = = = Retreat to the Reich = = = 
 On 29 March , the Soviet 57th Army and the Bulgarian First Army assaulted the entire Second Panzer Army front , quickly breaching the line near <unk> . The division , holding positions just south of the penetration , began to withdraw to the north @-@ west . It fell back to the Mura and barely managed to cross under constant air and ground attacks , with grievous casualties . Unable to take up effective positions , the division crossed the Reich frontier on 6 April and took up positions at Pettau in the so @-@ called ' Reich Defence Line ' , where it remained until 5 May . Its last fighting was around <unk> on 19 April . 
 On 5 May , the remaining men , both German and Bosnian , began to retreat eastwards towards Austria . On 8 May , an order was sent to retreat to Wolfsberg , Carinthia . On learning of the orders , unit imams of the 28th Regiment " approached their commander , Hans Hanke and requested that they and their men be discharged and be allowed to attempt to return to their homeland ... Soon , all of the Bosnians remaining in the division were asked if they wished to remain . " There are two reports of large scale reprisal killings of these members of 13th SS Division by the Partisans , one of which included the mass shooting of 1 @,@ 400 soldiers . 
 The retreat continued until 11 May . On 12 May , Hampel carried out surrender negotiations with the British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan . On 15 May most of the men were transported to Rimini in Italy , where they were incarcerated with other prisoners of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer @-@ SS . Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their SS blood group tattoo . Hampel escaped from a prisoner @-@ of @-@ war camp in <unk> . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter @-@ insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia , the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery , not only during combat operations , but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone . Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944 . 
 Thirty @-@ eight members of the division were extradited to Yugoslavia to face trial following the war . Some committed suicide , including Generalleutnant Sauberzweig on 20 October 1946 and SS @-@ Obersturmführer Hans König . Trials took place at a military court in Sarajevo between 22 and 30 August 1947 . Only seven of the thirty @-@ eight defendants were charged with specific offenses , although the indictment accused the division of murdering some 5 @,@ 000 people . The accused were defended by three Yugoslav lawyers : two civilian and one military officer . All were found guilty ; 10 were sentenced to death , and 28 received prison terms of between five years and life . SS @-@ Obersturmführer Imam Halim Malkoč had already been executed in Bihać on 7 March 1947 . All of those who were executed were junior officers and non @-@ commissioned officers . 
 Almost all the prisoners were released early and by 1952 all had been freed , except for one who had died . Having escaped , Hampel never faced trial and lived in Graz , Austria until his death on 11 January 1981 .

The chessboard <unk> was controversial , especially with the Imams , who , after crossing the Sava river , removed them . Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a Sig Rune badge that was attached to the left breast pocket of the tunic . 
 Headgear was either the SS M43 fez which was to be worn by all ranks , while German officers had the option to wear the mountain cap ( <unk> ) . The fez was chosen by Himmler because it had been worn by the Bosnian @-@ Herzegovinian Infantry regiments of the Austro @-@ Hungarian army from 1894 to 1918 , as well as by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Albanian Legion from 1916 to 1918 . There were two versions of the fez : a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades , marching exercises and while off duty . Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death 's head and eagle of the SS . The mountain cap was also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch , worn on the left side of the cap .

 = Pony of the Americas = 
 The Pony of the Americas ( POA ) is a pony breed developed in the state of Iowa in the United States . The foundation stallion was an Arabian / Appaloosa / Shetland pony cross . A breed registry was founded in 1954 , and within 15 years had registered 12 @,@ 500 ponies . Today , the Pony of the Americas Club is one of the largest and most active youth @-@ oriented horse breed registries in the US . Although called ponies , POAs have the phenotype of a small horse , combining mainly Arabian and American Quarter Horse attributes . The registry is open , allowing blood from many other breeds , but has strict criteria for entry , including Appaloosa coloration , specified height and other physical characteristics . Although mainly bred for Western riding , the breed has been used for many other disciplines , including driving , endurance riding and some English disciplines . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 Ponies are only registered with the Pony of the Americas club if they have Appaloosa coloring visible from 40 feet ( 12 m ) , otherwise known as " loud " Appaloosa coloring . The coloration includes the typical leopard complex characteristics of mottling around the eyes , muzzle and genitalia , as well as visible white sclera of the eyes and striped hooves . Pinto coloration is not allowed , nor is ancestry from a breed noted for pinto coloring , such as the American Paint Horse . The facial profile of the POA is slightly concave . It is a muscular breed , with a deep chest and well @-@ sloped shoulders . The breed averages 11 @.@ 2 to 14 hands ( 46 to 56 inches , 117 to 142 cm ) high . Despite having the size and name " pony " , the breed has the phenotype ( physical characteristics ) of a small horse of an American Quarter Horse / Arabian type , not a true pony breed . 
 The Pony of the Americas Club will register the offspring of registered POAs , as well crosses with <unk> , <unk> ponies , Australian Stock Horses , Morgans and Thoroughbreds , and the original Appaloosa and Arabian breeds . These crosses are allowed into the registry as full members as long as they meet the physical breed requirements . Crosses with other breeds , including Quarter ponies , Shetland ponies , Anglo @-@ Arabs , Spanish Mustangs and Welsh ponies , are accepted on an individual basis . 
 = = History = = 
 The POA was developed in the United States in the 1950s by Les Boomhower , a Shetland pony breeder in Iowa . The foundation stallion of the breed was an Arabian / Appaloosa / Shetland pony cross with Appaloosa markings named Black Hand . Boomhower appreciated the stallion 's conformation and disposition and decided to use him to develop a new breed of Appaloosa @-@ colored ponies . In 1954 , Boomhower and a group of associations founded the Pony of the Americas Club , with Black Hand receiving the first registration number . A year later , twelve ponies and twenty @-@ three members had been registered . The club 's goal was to develop a medium @-@ sized pony for older children and small adults , with the coloration of the Appaloosa , the refinement of the Arabian and the muscle and bone of an American Quarter Horse . Originally the height requirement called for ponies between 44 and 52 inches ( 110 and 130 cm ) ; in 1963 this was changed to a range of 46 and 54 inches ( 120 and 140 cm ) , and in 1985 a final change was made to height , raising the upper limit to 56 inches ( 140 cm ) . 
 Over the first 15 years of its existence , the breed club registered 12 @,@ 500 ponies . Between the founding of the breed club and the present , the early Shetland blood has been almost completely bred out , in order to maintain and improve the small stock horse look sought by the breed founders . The Pony of the Americas Club hosted its first national convention in 1988 , and in 1990 , the Club developed a Hall of Fame for its members and ponies . As of 2012 , the Pony of the Americas Club has registered over 50 @,@ 000 ponies . The Club has become one of the equine industry 's largest youth @-@ oriented breed registries , with over 2 @,@ 000 members , and one of the most active , with over 40 affiliated chapters . 
 Although originally developed mainly for Western riding and stock uses , it has also been seen competing in endurance riding , three @-@ day eventing , show hunter , and driving . It jumps well , and can be used for dressage . Originally , breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle ; adults could , however , show them in halter or driving classes . In 1973 , the age limit for riders was raised to 18 , and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over could show horses two to four years old under saddle .

 " Start Over " is a song by American recording artist Beyoncé taken from her fourth studio album , 4 ( 2011 ) . It was written by Shea Taylor , Knowles and Ester Dean and produced by the former two . The song 's development was motivated by the fact that Knowles traveled around the world and experienced different cultures which inspired love and purity inside her . A mid @-@ tempo pop , pop rock and soul @-@ influenced R & B ballad , " Start Over " finds the female protagonist affirming her individuality and expressing her love for a man with whom she attempts to start a relationship all over again . Knowles ' vocals are accompanied by electric and enticing beats ; the song 's instrumentation includes drums and synthesizers . 
 " Start Over " received mixed to positive reviews from music critics , who noted that the song was quite similar to Knowles ' older material . The placement of the song on the track @-@ listing was criticized by critics , who thought that it made " Start Over " barely distinguishable . However , the beats arrangement and the vulnerability of Knowles ' vocals were highlighted by many critics .

 " Start Over " was written by Shea Taylor , Knowles and Ester Dean and produced by the Knowles and Taylor . It was recorded at MSR Studios and Jungle City Studios in New York City , New York . " Start Over " was mixed by Serban Ghenea with further assistance from Phil Seaford and it was engineered by John Hanes with further assistance from Ramon Rivas and Pete Wolford . Beginning on June 16 to June 27 , 2011 , the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Knowles ' official website , paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote . On June 22 , 2011 , " Start Over " was the fourth song to be chosen . The quote found Knowles elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like " Start Over " : " For the first time in my life I was able to travel the world , hear different influences , see different types of dance and choreography and taste different types of food . It was important that I was able to digest everything : It inspired purity , more heart and more love . "

 " Start Over " is a midtempo R & B ballad , which contains elements of pop , soul and " angst @-@ ridden " pop rock and is built on hollow electric beats . The song 's instrumentation consists of gleaming synthesizers , a piano , loud and echoing drums , and minimal percussion instrument . According to Amanda Hensel of Pop Crush , the arrangement of the synthesizers is reminiscent of the Destiny 's Child era . Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy compared the song with Knowles ' own " 1 + 1 " ( 2011 ) from the same album . Andrew Unterberger of the website Popdust compared the song with Ryan Tedder @-@ produced songs like Jordin Sparks ' " Battlefield " and Kelly Clarkson 's " Already Gone " . Priya Elan of NME felt that the piano parts in " Start Over " were similar to songs by rock band Evanescence because of its processed drums and piano riffing . 
 " Start Over " finds Knowles affirming her individuality and expressing her love for a man with whom she attempts to start a relationship all over again rather than losing it . Jon Caramanica of The New York Times added that Knowles ' emotional radar " is set to loyalty , for better or worse — sometimes that loyalty is rewarded , and sometimes it has been betrayed , but over all , she operates on the axis of faithfulness " . Her vocals throughout the song are " so vulnerable that they 're almost tortured " as stated by Rubenstein . Lewis Corner of Digital Spy further noted that the " raspy and husky growls " that Knowles adopts occasionally on " Start Over " , show an " offering moments of raw , heartfelt emotion " . 
 = = = Song structure = = = 
 The song begins with Knowles singing : " I feel weak / We 've been here before / ' Cause I feel we keep going back and forth / Maybe it 's over , maybe we 're through / But I honestly can say I still love you . " The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping , which have been further described as " <unk> [ and ] lighthearted " . Throughout the song , the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production . In the pre @-@ chorus lines , Knowles sings : " Maybe it 's over , maybe we 're through , but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there ’ s no more left to climb / and maybe we lost a magic piece and we 're too blind to find " while her vocals are followed by background sounds . The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and , finally , to the chorus , with pounding drums coming in to the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings : " Let ’ s start over / Let 's give love their wings / Let ’ s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing " . As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up , she urges her man to " give love another life " . During the bridge , Knowles sings : " I know I called you selfish / But that ’ s a lie " , over a simple piano line .

 " Start Over " earned mixed to positive reviews from critics , some of whom felt it was too similar to Knowles 's older material . MTV 's Jenna Hally Rubenstein wrote that in the song , Knowles shows her best side , which according to her were the " larger @-@ than @-@ life , emotionally tortured , breathy ballads . " Writing for MTV UK , Joanne Dorken concluded that the song was " stonking and dramatic " but also " single @-@ worthy . " Dorken added : " Knowles shows off that big voice of hers , leaving us wanting more from the lady herself . " While reviewing 4 , Gary Graff of Billboard magazine noted that several songs on the album , including " Start Over " , were talking about " the gray areas in between " . Erika Ramirez of the same magazine said : " Again honest when it comes to love , Bey [ oncé ] ' won 't surrender till she and beau ' give love another life . ' Bey [ oncé ] ' s roar matches the song 's fight . " Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that " Start Over " was the first indication that Knowles might have picked " some leftfield influences during those nine months off " , making reference to the way the song starts , as he wrote , " with what sounds like – but most probably isn 't – distorted pan pipes before kicking into a massive R & B number . " 
 Robert Copsey of the website Digital Spy found similarities between the song and Knowles ' older material . Chad Grischow of IGN commented that the chiming blend of synth and piano over a hollow beat on " Start Over " showcase the vulnerability in Knowles ' vocals effectively . Amanda Hensel of the website Pop Crush graded the song with three out of five stars and called it one of the " begging and pleading love songs , but it also has that element of ' Yeah , it 's probably time to call this off . ' " She added that : " This feels like more of a filler track than a chart @-@ topping single , and because she 's the best of the best , it 's easy for her to knock out a killer song without really trying . " Hensel finished her review by saying " ' Start Over ' is good , but it 's not amazing , and we know she can do better . " Cristin Maher of the same publication in his review of 4 wrote : 
 " Although it is easy for some to get sick of the repetitive lovesick theme B seems to gravitate towards , the music in this song nothing short of epic , as is Beyonce 's vocal performance . The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and , finally , to the chorus , with pounding drums coming in to the loop during the refrain as B [ eyoncé ] sings , ' Let 's start over / Let 's give love their wings / Let 's start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing . ' " 
 A mixed review was given by Andy Gill of The Independent who said that " the vocal editing on ' Start Over ' is far too sloppy , confirming again that a series of individual flourishes doesn 't pass muster as a performance . " David Amidon of PopMatters also gave a mixed review for " Start Over " and " Countdown " saying that they " just don 't seem to be listening to themselves , and will get by on listenability more than lyrical wizardry if they get by at all . " Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone also gave a mixed review for the song , saying : " While the other songs on 4 all have a distinct flavor and give Beyoncé an opportunity to try something new in some way or another , ' Start Over ' just kind of sits there at the middle of the disc not doing much of anything . " He also noted that " Start Over " was an " inoffensive ballad that doesn 't do much for the record aside from break its momentum at the halfway point . " 
 Although Becky Bain of Idolator called Knowles ' vocals " gorgeous " , he gave a mixed review for the song because it " could have been recorded by anyone and ended with similar results " with the one done by Knowles . Bain stated that Knowles should have " procure more polarizing songs and take bigger risks — at least then half of her fans would love it , as opposed to her entire fanbase shrugging at everything they hear . " NME 's Hamish MacBain classified the song as one of the " barely distinguishable slowies " and added that the " will to continue listening [ the album ] departs . " Andrew Unterberger of the website Popdust gave a negative review for " Start Over " grading it with two out of five stars . Comparing it with Knowles ' older material , Unterberger concluded : " Beyoncé tries her best to imbue them with legitimate emotion , especially on the chorus , but it 's just not happening this time around . " Ricky Schweitzer of the website Beats Per Minute concluded that songs like " I Miss You " and " Start Over " would earn deserved spots in " the Beyoncé pantheon " once fans take the time to grow attached to them . Elan Priya of NME wrote that the song was a " trouble @-@ in @-@ paradise tune " with an " overblown chorus with hair @-@ rock aspirations " . However , he commented that the song was " rather buried under sonic bluster " .

 Although set to showcase Knowles ' fourth album 4 , " Start Over " was noticeably missing from her set list for the 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé revue . Elementary school chorus PS22 chorus covered the song in March , 2012 . Their cover appeared on Knowles ' official website . A remix of the song from Polish house band WAWA premiered online on July 8 , 2013 . Mike Wass of the website Idolator classified the original song as the " album 's only not @-@ completely @-@ brilliant moment " , he noted " <unk> WAWA boys did a great job transforming it into a dark and dangerous house anthem that stands toe @-@ to @-@ toe with Bey ’ s best <unk> .

 = Ravi Zacharias = 
 Ravi Zacharias ( born 26 March 1946 ) is an Indian @-@ born Canadian @-@ American Christian apologist . A defender of traditional evangelicalism , Zacharias is the author of numerous Christian books , including the Gold Medallion Book Award winner Can Man Live Without God ? in the category " theology and doctrine " and Christian bestsellers Light in the Shadow of Jihad and The Grand Weaver . He is the founder and chairman of the board of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries , host of the radio programs Let My People Think and Just Thinking , and has been a visiting scholar at Ridley Hall , where he studied moralist philosophers and literature of the Romantic era , and has had six honorary doctoral degrees , including a Doctor of Laws and a Doctor of Sacred Theology . Zacharias held the chair in Evangelism and Contemporary Thought at Alliance Theological Seminary from 1981 to 1984 . Evangelical Christian leader Chuck Colson referred to Zacharias as " the great apologist of our time . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Zacharias was born in Madras , India . He claims descent from a woman of the Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste . His mother was from Madras while his father was from Kerala . He grew up in Delhi . According to Zacharias , before her marriage , Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin ancestor about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community . Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household , and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison . While in the hospital , a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14 . Zacharias says that it was John 14 : 19 that touched him and meant to him as the defining paradigm : " Because I live , you also will live . " He said that he thought , " This may be my only hope : A new way of living . Life as defined by the Author of Life . " and that he committed his life to Christ praying , " Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be , I want it . Please get me out of this hospital bed well , and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth . " In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada , earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 ( now Tyndale University College & Seminary ) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University . 
 = = Ministry = = 
 Zacharias was invited to spend the summer of 1971 in Vietnam , where he evangelized to the American soldiers , as well as to POWs and Viet Cong . After graduating from the Ontario Bible College , he began an itinerant ministry with the Christian and Missionary Alliance in Canada . In 1974 the C & MA sent him to Cambodia , where he preached only a short time before its fall to the Khmer Rouge . In 1977 , after graduating from Trinity , Zacharias was commissioned to preach worldwide . 
 In 1983 , Zacharias was invited to speak in Amsterdam at the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association 's annual evangelists ' conference . It was here that he first noticed a lack of ministry in the area of Christian apologetics . After Amsterdam , Zacharias spent the summer evangelizing in India , where he continued to see the need for apologetics ministry , both to lead people to Christ and to train Christian leaders . In August 1984 Ravi Zacharias International Ministries was founded in Toronto , Canada to pursue his calling as a " classical evangelist in the arena of the intellectually resistant . " Today its headquarters is located in Atlanta , Georgia , and has offices in Canada , India , Singapore , the United Kingdom , the Middle East , Hong Kong , Romania , Turkey , Austria , Spain , and South Africa . He was later ordained by the Christian and Missionary Alliance and commissioned as an international evangelist . 
 In 1989 , shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall , Zacharias was invited to speak in Moscow . While there he spoke to students at the Lenin Military Academy as well as political leaders at the Center for Geopolitical Strategy . This was the first of many evangelism opportunities towards the political world . Future events included an invitation to Bogota , Colombia in 1993 , where he spoke to the judiciary committee on the importance of having a solid moral foundation . 
 In 1990 he wrote his first book , A Shattered Visage : The Real Face of Atheism . In 1993 Zacharias was invited to speak at his first Veritas Forum at Harvard University , and later that year was one of the keynote speakers at Urbana . Zacharias continues to be a frequent guest at these forums , both giving lectures and answering students in question and answer sessions at academic institutions such as the University of Georgia , the University of Michigan , and Penn State . 
 Zacharias attracted media attention when in 2004 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints ( LDS Church ) opened its signature pulpit at the Salt Lake Tabernacle to him for a series of messages . Zacharias delivered a sermon on " Who Is the Truth ? Defending Jesus Christ as The Way , The Truth and The Life " to some 7 @,@ 000 lay @-@ persons and scholars from both LDS and Protestant camps in an initiatory move towards open dialogue between the camps . 
 Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias ' decision not to use this opportunity to directly address the " deep and foundational " differences between the historic Christian faith and that of the LDS church . He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism 's theological differences but " graciously build one step at a time in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction " . He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith . The speaking engagement was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson , president of Standing Together , that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition . Johnson later apologized for his comment . 
 Zacharias is a frequent keynote lecturer within the evangelical community at events such as the Future of Truth conference in 2004 , the National Religious Broadcasters ' Convention and Exposition in 2005 , the National Conference on Christian <unk> in 2006 . On successive nights in October 2007 , he addressed first the students and faculty of Virginia Tech , then the community of Blacksburg , Virginia , on the topic of evil and suffering in the wake of the Virginia Tech massacre . Zacharias has represented the evangelical community at occasions such as the National Day of Prayer in Washington , DC , the Annual Prayer Breakfast at the United Nations , and the African Union Prayer Breakfast in Maputo , Mozambique , and was named honorary chairman of the 2008 National Day of Prayer task force . He also plans to participate in the ecumenical Together 16 meetings in July 2016 , which Pope Francis will address . 
 Zacharias was interviewed in Focus on the Family 's Truth Project . In November 2009 , Zacharias signed an ecumenical statement known as the Manhattan Declaration which affirms the sanctity of human life , the dignity of marriage as a union of husband and wife , and the freedom of religion are foundational principles of justice and the common good . 
 In 2014 , Zacharias republished his book The Lamb and The Fuhrer , an imaginary conversation between Adolf Hitler , Jesus Christ and Dietrich <unk> , as a graphic novel . In 2016 , Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio appointed Zacharias to his anti @-@ abortion “ Dignity Of Life ” advisory panel . 
 = = Family = = 
 In May 1972 , Zacharias married Margaret " Margie " Reynolds , whom he met at his church 's youth group . They have three children : Sarah , Naomi , and Nathan . 
 = = Worldview = = 
 Zacharias states that a coherent worldview must be able to satisfactorily answer four questions : that of origin , meaning of life , morality and destiny . He says that while every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth , the Christian faith is unique in its ability to answer all four of these questions . He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview , saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks . Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels : the theoretical , to line up the logic of the argument ; the arts , to illustrate ; and " kitchen table talk " , to conclude and apply . Zacharias ' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity 's answers to life 's great existential questions , with defense of God .

 Up ! Live in Chicago is the third live video album by Canadian singer Shania Twain . Directed and produced by Beth McCarthy @-@ Miller , the concert was held and filmed on July 27 , 2003 at Hutchinson Field in the south @-@ side of Grant Park in Chicago , Illinois ; over 50 @,@ 000 people attended . The concert itself differed from that of the Up ! Tour ( 2003 – 04 ) , featuring a different stage , setlist and production . Behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage of the singer visiting local landmarks and events was filmed the same week . The concert film premiered on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) on August 19 , 2003 . The special was watched by over 8 @.@ 87 million viewers , becoming the second @-@ most @-@ viewed concert film on television , behind Celine Dion 's A New Day ... Live in Las Vegas ( 2003 ) . 
 Due to its high television ratings , Up ! Live in Chicago was released as a video album on November 18 , 2003 by Mercury Records Nashville . Released both in standard DVD packaging and in a jewel case , it featured additional performances not included on the television presentation . The album was also received positively by music critics , who complimented Shania 's interaction with the audience ; however , some questioned her live singing . The video peaked at number two on Billboard 's Top Music Video sales chart , and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) for shipments of 100 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . It was also certified platinum in Australia and gold in Austria and Brazil . Excerpts from Up ! Live in Chicago were used as the music videos for " She 's Not Just a Pretty Face " ( 2003 ) and " It Only Hurts when I 'm Breathing " ( 2004 ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Over three and a half years after her last live show , Shania performed a series of three outdoor concerts in Europe and North America in July 2003 to promote her fourth studio album Up ! ( 2002 ) . The singer scheduled the trek primarily because of her prolonged absence from live performances and to ensure playing a concert in the United States prior to her Up ! Tour . At the time , it was to commence in September 2003 in Europe , although it ultimately did so in North America . She said , " With the tour starting in September , I didn 't want to miss the summer without staging a concert in the U.S. After living with these 19 songs [ from Up ! ] and going through the recording process , it 's time to get on stage and perform them . " She conceptualized the shows to consist mainly of uptempo numbers and to be almost void of ballads to " spend the night rocking " and maintain an energized spirit . She also deliberately left much room for improvisation , stating that she preferred for the performances to be very spontaneous , than choreographed and music video @-@ like . She first performed on July 5 , 2003 at Nowlan Park in Kilkenny , Ireland , and then on July 12 , 2003 at Hyde Park in London , England with a setlist composed of twenty @-@ two songs . 
 The singer then headed to Chicago , Illinois to perform a free outdoor concert on July 27 , 2003 , held at the Hutchinson Field in the south @-@ side of Grant Park . Meanwhile , the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) was seeking an artist to host a prime time television music special , and contacted Twain to discuss the possibilities of filming the concert in Chicago . NBC executives sought Twain for the special because they believed her lengthy career and crossover history would translate into more viewers . She accepted the offer , and the show was directed and produced by Beth McCarthy @-@ Miller . Prior to performing at Grant Park , Twain spent a week in Chicago to film behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage that would be used for the television special . She visited landmarks and attended local events , such as a Chicago Cubs game where she tossed the first pitch and sang " Take Me Out to the Ballgame " for the audience . The singer also took a riverboat trip and visited outposts of her favorite charity Kids Cafés , a program specialized to feed children in America . The concert was produced by JAM Creative Productions , and sponsored by local radio station <unk> and the Chicago Tribune , which disseminated information about obtaining concert tickets . The show was attended by over 50 @,@ 000 people . 
 = = Concert synopsis = = 
 The concert 's setlist consisted primarily of songs from Up ! , with several hits from The Woman in Me ( 1995 ) and Come on Over ( 1997 ) . The songs from Up ! were not performed in a specific format from the three studio versions of the album . Shania desired to approach the live productions as their " own beast " . The show commenced with Shania , who was costumed by a " Body Glove " top and black cargo pants , arriving from the back of the stage to perform " Man ! I Feel Like a Woman ! " alongside her band . The singer then followed with " Up ! " and after talking with the audience the singer says it has been 3 and 1 / 2 years being up on the concert stage and then performed Honey I 'm Home . Shania continued to perform a total of ten songs during the segment . At one point , she invited an audience member onstage to propose to his girlfriend . She accepted and the two slow danced onstage as Shania sang " When You Kiss Me " , sitting on a stool placed towards the end of the runway . The segment ended with a performance of " I 'm Gonna Getcha Good ! " , where Shania invited Sian , Mannie and Ashley to join her onstage . In the succeeding segment , Shania donned a tan , multi @-@ patterned halter top with the words " True Love " spelled on the front and black , sequined wide leg trousers . She begun with " From This Moment On " . Then , she performed " No One Needs to Know " with an acoustic guitar and " Thank You Baby ! ( For Makin ' Someday Come So Soon ) " with a small orchestra accompanying her . She concluded the nine @-@ song segment with " ( If You 're Not in It for Love ) I 'm Outta Here ! " . The singer returned to the stage for the third and final segment , wearing a black , long @-@ sleeve top with an American flag imprinted in the center and denim capri pants . She performed a rendition of " You 're Still the One " playing acoustic guitar and ended the show with " Nah ! " and " Rock This Country ! " .

 On June 6 , 2003 , the Chicago Tribune announced the Grant Park concert , which was to be filmed for an August NBC special . Immediately after the show concluded , its premiere date of August 19 , 2003 was specified . A two @-@ hour edited version was televised on August 19 at 8 : 00 P.M. EST to high ratings . Up ! Live in Chicago was watched by over 8 @.@ 87 million viewers in the United States , becoming the second @-@ most @-@ watched concert film in television history , behind Celine Dion 's CBS special A New Day ... Live in Las Vegas earlier that year . Following the concert film 's television success , Mercury Records Nashville released the home video album on November 18 , 2003 in Region 1 and on November 24 , 2003 in Region 2 . It was released in DVD format , both in conventional DVD packaging and in a jewel case ; both appeared in an aspect ratio of 1 @.@ 33 : 1 ( 4 : 3 ) . The release featured six additional performances that were not shown on the NBC special and also stereo and 5 @.@ 1 surround sound mixes . Up ! Live in Chicago also sourced video material for two of Up ! ' s singles . The performances of " She 's Not Just a Pretty Face " ( 2003 ) an " It Only Hurts when I 'm Breathing " ( 2004 ) served as the songs ' music videos , while the audio rendition of " It Only Hurts when I 'm Breathing " was released as a live CD single and a digital download on March 9 , 2004 .

 Up ! Live from Chicago received favorable critic reviews . Matt Bjorke of About.com reviewed the home release of Up ! Close and Personal . He had not attended a Shania concert , nor seen the television special , and was surprised by the singer 's stage presence . He believed that the video would make the singer 's naysayers realize Shania 's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd . Bjorke concluded , " Up ! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come . " Chris Jones of BBC noted the band 's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country @-@ influenced sound . However , Jones complimented the singer 's incorporation of the audience , naming it her " inimitable style " . He added that the video was " far from [ a ] sterile experience " because of the live setting and crowd ambiance . However , he suspected Shania 's " photocopy @-@ perfect " vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post @-@ production work . " Overall , you know exactly what you 're getting with Shania , and for her fans this is bound to be a very good thing indeed . " Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality , noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then @-@ new son , <unk> . He complimented the band 's strong , yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life . However , he claimed Shania 's vocal delivery was at times frail . Reed also noted the absence of guest stars , in contrast to her two previous concert specials , and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country @-@ fair vibe . Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights ' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host . He continued , " As the night wore on , Shania tried different ways , with varying degrees of success , to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen . Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things , but it often backfired . "

 = Manu Ginóbili = 
 Emanuel David " Manu " Ginóbili <unk> ( Spanish pronunciation : [ e ̞ <unk> ̞ l <unk> ̞ <unk> ] , born 28 July 1977 ) is an Argentine professional basketball player for the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Coming from a family of professional basketball players , he is a member of the Argentine men 's national basketball team and the San Antonio Spurs in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . Hailed as one of the finest international players to grace the NBA , he plays a high @-@ tempo and intense game . He is one of only two players , along with Bill Bradley , to have won a Euroleague title , an NBA championship , and an Olympic gold medal . 
 Ginóbili spent the early part of his basketball career in Argentina and Italy , where he won several individual and team honors . His stint with Italian side Kinder Bologna was particularly productive ; he won two Italian League MVP awards , the Euroleague Finals MVP and the 2001 Euroleague and Triple Crown championships . Selected as the 57th overall pick in the 1999 NBA draft , the shooting guard is considered one of the biggest draft steals of all time . Ginóbili joined the Spurs in 2002 , and soon became a key player for the team . He has earned four NBA championships and was named an All @-@ Star in 2005 and 2011 . In the 2007 – 08 season , he was named the NBA Sixth Man of the Year . Ginóbili has also enjoyed success with the Argentina national team . He made his debut in 1998 , and helped win the gold medal during the 2004 Olympics Basketball Tournament . 
 = = Family and personal life = = 
 Ginóbili comes from a family of basketball players . His oldest brother , Leandro , retired in 2003 after seven years in the Argentine basketball league , while brother Sebastián has played in both the local league and the Spanish Liga Española de Baloncesto . Their father Jorge was a coach at a club in Bahía Blanca , where Ginóbili learned to play the game . Given the proliferation of basketball clubs in Bahía Blanca and his idolization of Michael Jordan , Ginóbili 's love for basketball grew rapidly . 
 Ginóbili has dual citizenship with Argentina and Italy , thanks to his <unk> descent . As a result of his travels , he can speak Spanish , Italian and English fluently . In his free time , Ginóbili enjoys listening to Latin music , watching movies and relaxing with his friends . In 2004 , he married fellow Argentine <unk> <unk> . On 16 May 2010 , his wife gave birth to twin boys , Dante and Nicola . On April 21 , 2014 , his wife gave birth to their third son , Luca .

 Ginóbili made his professional debut in the Argentine basketball league for the Andino Sport Club team of La Rioja from 1995 – 1996 , and was traded to Estudiantes de Bahía Blanca the next year . He played with his hometown team until 1998 . 
 The Argentine moved to Europe to spend the 1998 – 1999 and 1999 – 2000 seasons with Italian team Basket Viola Reggio Calabria . In 1999 , he teamed with Brent Scott , Brian Oliver and Sydney Johnson to earn promotion from the Italian 2nd Division to the Italian 1st Division . 
 Ginóbili then entered the 1999 NBA draft and the San Antonio Spurs selected him late in the second round with the 57th overall pick . However , he did not sign with the Spurs at this point . Instead , he returned to Italy to play for Kinder Bologna , which he helped win the 2001 Italian Championship , the 2001 and 2002 Italian Cups , and the 2001 Euroleague , where he was named the Euroleague 2000 – 01 Euroleague Finals MVP . He was also named the Italian League MVP in 2000 – 01 and 2001 – 02 , and made the Italian League 's All @-@ Star Game three times during this period .

 It was not until after that Ginóbili joined the Spurs . There , At the 2002 FIBA World Championship in Indianapolis , Ginóbili made the All @-@ Tournament team alongside future NBA star Yao Ming and established NBA stars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojaković , and helped lead Argentina to a second @-@ place finish . 
 The Argentine joined the Spurs for the 2002 – 03 NBA season , where he played backup for veteran guard Steve Smith . He spent much of the early season injured , and found it hard to adjust to the NBA 's style of play . As his injury improved , so did Ginóbili , winning the Western Conference Rookie of the Month in March , and being named to the All @-@ Rookie Second Team at the end of the season . Still , he only started in five games as the Spurs chalked up a 60 – 22 regular season win – loss record . The Spurs then entered the playoffs eager to upend the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers , at which point , Ginóbili rose to prominence . 
 In contrast to his regular season , Ginóbili became an integral part of Gregg Popovich 's rotational set up in the playoffs , playing in every game . The Spurs eliminated Phoenix and Los Angeles and in those games his scoring threat took opponents by surprise , giving them one more thing to cope with against the now highly favored Spurs . He helped guide them past the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals and then the New Jersey Nets in the Finals , securing San Antonio 's second championship . After the win , Ginóbili won his first Olimpia de Oro ( " Golden Olympia " ) as Argentina 's sportsperson of the year , and met Argentine president Néstor Kirchner . A gym in Bahía Blanca was dedicated in Ginóbili 's honor as well . 
 In the 2003 – 04 season , the Spurs began featuring Ginóbili more regularly , starting him in half of the 77 regular season games in which he played . His statistics improved in all major categories , as he averaged 12 @.@ 8 points , 4 @.@ 5 rebounds , 3 @.@ 8 assists and 1 @.@ 8 steals per game . During the 2004 playoffs , the Spurs met their perennial rivals , the Los Angeles Lakers , in the Western Conference Semifinals . Following Game 5 where Derek Fisher scored a buzzer @-@ beating jump shot , the Spurs lost Game 6 and the series 4 – 2 . While Ginóbili did not start in a single playoff game as he did in 2003 , his playoff statistics improved significantly , with 13 @.@ 0 points , 5 @.@ 3 rebounds and 3 @.@ 1 assists per game . 
 After some initial issues with San Antonio over his contract , Ginóbili re @-@ signed with the Spurs and started every game during the 2004 – 05 season . This was his best season yet as he was selected as a reserve by NBA coaches to the 2005 Western Conference All @-@ Star team , marking his debut in the elite mid @-@ season showcase . During the playoffs , Ginóbili 's play was pivotal to winning San Antonio 's third championship . The Spurs first defeated Phoenix 4 – 1 in the Conference Finals , before prevailing in a very defensive oriented seven @-@ game series against the Detroit Pistons . Ginóbili recorded career @-@ highs in his playoff numbers , most notably 20 @.@ 8 ppg and 5 @.@ 8 rpg , and had the third highest point total in the entire playoffs . In the NBA Finals MVP Award voting , the shooting guard was a candidate but was edged out by teammate and captain Tim Duncan . The former finished the 2004 – 05 season as the second leading scorer on the team . During the season , he became only the fourth person to win consecutive <unk> de Oro , this time sharing the award with soccer star Carlos Tevez . 
 The 2005 – 06 season was an injury @-@ plagued one for Ginóbili , who suffered foot and ankle injuries that hindered his ability to play . He managed 65 games in the regular season , but saw a dip in major statistics as compared to the previous season . During the playoffs , he returned to form , but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season , the Spurs lacked energy from their reserves and Ginóbili provided it by coming off the bench for most of the second half of the season helping the Spurs attain the best record in the second half of the season . Ginóbili produced numbers closely identical to his successful 2004 – 05 campaign despite starting in only 36 of 75 games , his second lowest since arriving at San Antonio . The 2007 NBA Playoffs saw him help the Spurs to defeat the Denver Nuggets , Phoenix Suns and Utah Jazz , before sweeping the Cleveland Cavaliers to win his third and San Antonio 's fourth championship . 
 Ginóbili was to play an even bigger role for the Spurs the following season , reaching career high averages in points , rebounds , assists , and three @-@ point field goal percentage . On 21 April 2008 , the NBA announced that Ginóbili had won the 2008 Sixth Man Award ; only a couple of weeks later , the Argentine was also named to the All @-@ NBA Third Team . In the playoffs , the Spurs defeated the Suns 4 – 1 in the first round , Ginóbili was moved to the starting lineup in the second round against the New Orleans Hornets after the Spurs lost the first two road games . San Antonio eventually prevailed in seven games , the Argentine played another strong series , leading the Spurs in points and assists per game ( 21 @.@ 3 and 6 @.@ 0 respectively ) . However , San Antonio lost to arch @-@ rivals Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals in five games , and once again failed to capture back @-@ to @-@ back NBA championships . 
 The following season , Ginóbili was injured for most of the campaign , managing only 44 regular season games and missing the 2009 NBA Playoffs entirely . San Antonio qualified for the playoffs as the third seed with a 54 – 28 record , but with an aging supporting cast ( Bowen , Michael Finley and Kurt Thomas were all in their late 30s ) , the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship . As it turned out , the strong play of Duncan and Tony Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4 – 1 defeat by Dallas , and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000 . 
 On 31 October 2009 , in a game against the Sacramento Kings , a bat descended onto the court at the AT & T Center , causing a stoppage of play . As the bat flew past , Ginóbili swatted the bat to the ground with his hand . He then carried the creature off the court , earning the applause of the crowd . On 9 April 2010 , the Spurs and Ginóbili agreed to a three @-@ year , $ 39 million contract extension through the 2012 – 13 season . 
 In 2010 – 11 , Ginóbili was named a Western Conference All @-@ Star and was named to the All @-@ NBA third team . 
 In the lockout @-@ shortened 2011 – 12 , Ginóbili helped the Spurs go 50 – 16 , as they advanced through to the Western Conference Finals , where they were defeated 4 – 2 by the Oklahoma City Thunder . In Game 5 of the series , Ginóbili had a 34 @-@ point effort . 
 In 2012 – 13 , the Spurs advanced to the NBA Finals , where they faced the Miami Heat . In Game 5 of the series , Ginóbili scored a season @-@ high 24 points , as the Spurs went up 3 – 2 . However , they went on to lose Games 6 and 7 to lose the series in seven games . 
 On 11 July 2013 , Ginóbili re @-@ signed with the Spurs on a two @-@ year deal . In 2013 – 14 , the Spurs had a league @-@ best 62 – 20 record . Ginóbili finished third in the voting for Sixth Man of the Year . In Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Thunder , Duncan @-@ Ginóbili @-@ Parker won their 110th career game in the playoffs , matching Magic Johnson , Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar and Michael Cooper from the Los Angeles Lakers . The Spurs reached the NBA Finals again , where they faced the Heat for the second year in a row . This time , the dominated the series , winning 4 – 1 to claim that franchise 's fifth championship ; Ginóbili won his fourth championship as a Spur . 
 On 20 July 2015 , Ginóbili re @-@ signed with the Spurs . On 14 January 2016 , in a win over the Cleveland Cavaliers , Ginóbili played his 900th NBA game , all with the Spurs . On February 4 , he underwent surgery after suffering a testicular injury in the Spurs ' win over the New Orleans Pelicans the previous night . He was subsequently sidelined for one month . He returned to the action on March 5 after missing 12 games with the injury , scoring 22 points in 15 minutes against the Sacramento Kings . 
 On 14 July 2016 , Ginóbili re @-@ signed with the Spurs .

 Ginóbili is a member of the Argentine national basketball team , and made his debut during the 1998 FIBA World Championship in Athens . His best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Olympics Basketball Tournament when Argentina became the first team other than Team USA to win the gold medal in 16 years . The highlight of the tournament was his game @-@ winning buzzer beater with 0 @.@ 7 seconds remaining , on the opening day of the Olympics , in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro . Ginóbili led the team in both scoring ( 19 @.@ 3 points per game ) and assists ( 3 @.@ 3 assists per game ) . At the 2008 Beijing Olympics Basketball Tournament , Ginóbili 's Argentina defeated Lithuania to win the bronze , although the shooting guard did not play in that match after sustaining an injury in the semi @-@ finals . In April 2010 , Ginóbili announced he would not participate in the 2010 FIBA World Championship due to family reasons . He did however compete for the team at the 2012 Summer Olympics , where Argentina narrowly missed out on the bronze medal in the bronze medal match versus Russia . 
 Emanuel was the flag bearer for Argentina at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing , China . 
 = = Player profile = = 
 Ginóbili is a 6 ft 6 in ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) , 205 lb ( 93 kg ) left @-@ handed shooting guard who has been deployed either as a sixth man or starter for the Spurs . He has established himself as a reliable and versatile back court presence , and was a relatively late bloomer , entering the NBA at age 25 in a period when entering the NBA as a teenager was very common . 
 Apart from his up @-@ tempo and aggressive style of play , Ginóbili is known for his clutch play . This is documented by his numerous European league MVP awards , and his performances in San Antonio 's championship @-@ winning campaigns . Ginóbili 's modus operandi however , causes concerns for some of his opponents . His go @-@ to move is either a 3 @-@ pointer or a fierce attack to the basket , while he often lowers his head when driving to the basket to collapse defenses and create shots or passes to his teammates . Although Ginobili was not the originator or the first to bring the move to the NBA , he is credited for popularizing the Euro step in the league . 
 He is also willing to draw charges on defense . In 2007 , he was even listed by ESPN writer Thomas Neumann at No. 6 on the list of greatest <unk> in NBA history . Five years later , Ian Thomsen , a Sports Illustrated columnist , grouped Ginóbili with fellow European league players Anderson Varejão and Vlade Divac as the players who " made [ flopping ] famous " , by exaggerating contact on the court in a manner analogous to diving in soccer games . 
 Having traversed the major basketball continents in his basketball career , Ginóbili is one of the few players who has enjoyed success under both the physical , one @-@ on @-@ one play of the NBA and the more technical , jump @-@ shooting rule set of the FIBA . He is one of only two players in basketball history along with Bill Bradley to win the Euroleague , an Olympic gold medal , and an NBA Championship ring . He is also the first non @-@ U.S. player to win both the NBA championship ring and the Olympic gold medal , and the second Latin American to be selected to play in an NBA All @-@ Star game ( after Panama 's Rolando Blackman ) . 
 In 2007 , ESPN sportswriter John Hollinger ranked Ginóbili as the sixth best international player then @-@ active in the NBA , describing the 57th draft pick as " one of the great draft heists of all time " , and attributed the trend of NBA teams drafting developing European players to the success of the Argentine . The following year , Ginóbili was named by ESPN as one of the best Euroleague players to have graced the NBA .

 The first season of the American animated television series Adventure Time , created by Pendleton Ward , originally aired on Cartoon Network in the United States . The series is based on a short produced for Frederator 's Nicktoons Network animation incubator series Random ! Cartoons . The season follows the adventures of Finn , a human boy , and his best friend Jake , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . Finn and Jake live in the post @-@ apocalyptic Land of Ooo . Along the way , they interact with the other main characters of the show : Princess Bubblegum , The Ice King , and Marceline the Vampire Queen . 
 The first episode of the season , " Slumber Party Panic " was watched by 2 @.@ 5 million viewers ; this marked a dramatic increase in viewers watching Cartoon Network when compared to the previous year . The season ended with the finale " Gut Grinder " on September 27 , 2010 . Soon after airing , the show began to receive critical acclaim as well as a large fan following . In 2010 , the Adventure Time episode " My Two Favorite People " was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short @-@ format Animated Program , although the series did not win . 
 After the original short became a viral hit on the internet , Cartoon Network picked it up for a full @-@ length series that previewed on March 11 , 2010 , and officially premiered on April 5 , 2010 . The season was storyboarded and written by Adam Muto , Elizabeth Ito , Pendleton Ward , Sean Jimenez , Patrick McHale , Luther McLaurin , Armen Mirzaian , Kent Osborne , Pete Browngardt , Niki Yang , Armen Mirzaian , J. G. Quintel , Cole Sanchez , Tom Herpich , Bert Youn , and Ako Castuera while being produced by Cartoon Network Studios and Frederator Studios .

 The season follows the adventures of Finn the Human , a human boy , and his best friend Jake , a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will . Finn and Jake live in the post @-@ apocalyptic Land of Ooo . Along the way , they interact with the other main characters of the show : Princess Bubblegum , The Ice King , and Marceline the Vampire Queen . Common storylines revolve around : Finn and Jake discovering strange creatures , rescuing princesses from the Ice King , and battling monsters in order to help others . Various other episodes deal with Finn attempting to understand his attraction towards Bubblegum . 
 According to series creator Pendleton Ward , the show 's style was influenced by his time attending the California Institute of the Arts ( CalArts ) and his experiences working as a writer and storyboard artist on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack . In an interview with Animation World Network , Ward said he strives to combine the series ' subversive humor with " beautiful " moments , using Hayao Miyazaki 's film My Neighbor Totoro as inspiration . Ward has also named Home Movies and Dr. Katz , Professional Therapist as influences , largely because both shows are " relaxing " and feature " conversational dialogue that feels natural [ and ] not over the top [ nor ] cartoony and shrill " . Ward described the show as a " dark comedy " ; he said " dark comedies are my favorite , because I love that feeling – being happy and scared at the same time . It 's my favorite way to feel – when I 'm on the edge of my seat but I 'm happy , that sense of conflicting emotions . And there 's a lot of that in the show , I think . " Executive producer Fred Seibert compared the show 's animation style to that of Felix the Cat and various Max Fleischer cartoons , but said that its world is also equally inspired by Dungeons and Dragons and video games . Ward intends the show 's world to have a certain physical logic instead of " cartoony slapstick " ; even though magic exists in the story , the show 's writers try to create an internal consistency in how the characters interact with the world . 
 Although the show is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic setting , according to Ward , the original intention was for the Land of Ooo to simply be " magical " . After " Business Time " aired , in which an iceberg containing the bodies of reanimated business men floats to the surface of a lake , the show suddenly became post @-@ apocalyptic , and Ward noted that the production crew " just ran with it . " Ward later described the setting as " <unk> on the surface and dark underneath " .

 The show began as a single stand @-@ alone animated short which ran for seven minutes . It aired in January 2007 and again as part of Frederator Studios ' Random ! Cartoons on December 7 , 2008 . After its release , the short video became a viral hit on the internet . Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons Network , but the network passed on it twice . The studio approached Cartoon Network , which said it would be willing to produce a series if Ward could prove the short could be expanded into a full series while maintaining elements of the original 's pilot . Rob Sorcher , the chief content officer at Cartoon Network , was influential in getting the network to take a chance on the show ; he recognized the series as " something that felt really indie ... comic book @-@ y [ and ] really new " . Ward quickly rethought the concept of the pilot ; he wanted a potential series to be " fully realized " , rather than be characterized by the " pre @-@ school vibe " that permeated the original film . Ward 's college friends Patrick McHale and Adam Muto helped him produce a rough storyboard that featured Finn and Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti @-@ supper date . Cartoon Network was not happy with this story and asked for another . Ward then created a storyboard for the episode " The Enchiridion ! " , which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original Nicktoons short . Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008 , and " The Enchiridion ! " was the first episode to enter into production . 
 While many cartoons are based on script pitches to network executives , Cartoon Network allowed Adventure Time to " build their own teams organically " and communication through the use of storyboards and animatics . Cartoon Network chief content officer Rob Sorcher explained that the network allowed this because the company was " dealing with artists who are primarily visual people " and by using storyboards , the writers and artists could learn and grow " by actually doing the work . " As such , Ward soon assembled a storyboarding team for the series , which was largely composed of " younger , inexperienced people " who had been found using the Internet . However , Cartoon Network , worrying about the status of the show and the inexperience of its production members , hired three veteran animators who had worked on SpongeBob SquarePants to help guide Ward and his team : Derek Drymon ( who served as executive producer for the first season of Adventure Time ) , Merriwether Williams ( who served as head story editors for the show 's first and second seasons ) , and Nick Jennings ( who became the series ' long @-@ serving art director ) . Thurop Van Orman , the creator of The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack , was also hired on as a supervising producer , providing guidance for the series ' first two seasons . 
 In addition to the 26 episodes created during the first season , several others were commissioned and storyboarded , but not produced . These include the episodes " Brothers in Insomnia " ( written and storyboarded by Armen Mirzaian and Luther McLaurin , with revisions by Ako Castuera ) , " The Glorriors " ( written and storyboarded by Joe Horne and Doug <unk> ) , and " The Helmet of Thorogon " ( outline by Ward , Muto , McKeon , McHale , and Craig Lewis ) . " Brothers in Insomnia " had been pitched to the network , although it was later scrapped . " The Glorriors " , according to Frederator Vice President Eric Homan , " was a casualty of jumping into production without having had any serious development time . " " The Helmet of Thorogon " , despite initially being assigned the production number 692 @-@ 008 ( which would eventually be taken by the episode " Freak City " ) , never made it to the storyboard stage , although several pieces of background art for the episode were designed by Ghostshrimp . The storyboards for " Brothers in Insomnia " and " The Glorriors " and the outline for " The Helmet of Thorogon " were later released on Fred Seibert 's official <unk> page . Furthermore , the episode " What Have You Done " was given the production number 27 , despite only 26 episodes being ordered . This is because the original sixth episode was scrapped during production , and " What Have You Done " took its place , but was given a different code . Due to this , some sources like The Futon Critic , give it the production number 692 @-@ 006 , whereas Frederator gave it the number 692 @-@ 027 . 
 All of the season 's episodes began as simple two @-@ to @-@ three @-@ page outline that contained the necessary plot information . These outlines were then handed off to storyboard artists , who would then expand the rough outline into a full storyboard . The episodes ' design and coloring were done in Burbank , California . Animation was handled overseas in South Korea , either by Rough Draft Korea or by Saerom Animation . The season was storyboarded and written by Muto , Elizabeth Ito , Ward , Sean Jimenez , McHale , Luther McLaurin , Armen Mirzaian , Kent Osborne , Pete Browngardt , Niki Yang , Cole Sanchez , Tom Herpich , Bert Youn , Ako Castuera , and J. G. Quintel . Quintel , who would later go on to create the popular Cartoon Network series Regular Show , co @-@ wrote and boarded the episode " Ocean of Fear " after asking Ward if he wanted any freelance help for Adventure Time . Quintel and Ward had previously worked together on The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack . 
 = = Cast = = 
 The voice actors include voice acting veterans John DiMaggio ( who portrays Jake the Dog ) , Tom Kenny ( who plays The Ice King ) , and Hynden Walch ( who voices Princess Bubblegum ) . In addition , Jeremy Shada portrays the voice of Finn the Human , and Olivia Olson portrays Marceline the Vampire Queen . Ward himself provides the voice for several minor characters , as well as Lumpy Space Princess . Former storyboard artist Niki Yang voices the sentient video game console BMO , as well as Jake 's girlfriend Lady Rainicorn in Korean . Polly Lou Livingston , a friend of Pendleton Ward 's mother , Bettie Ward , plays the voice of the small elephant Tree Trunks . The Adventure Time cast records their lines together in group recordings as opposed to different recording sessions with each voice actor . This is to record more natural sounding dialogue among the characters . Hynden Walch has described these group recordings as akin to " doing a play reading — a really , really out there play . " 
 The series also regularly employs guest voices for various characters . For instance , in the episode " Enchiridion ! " , John Moschitta , Jr . , Mark Hamill , and Fred Tatasciore all lend their voices to various beings . In " Ricardio the Heart Guy " , actor George Takei voices the titular villain . " Business Time " features Brian Posehn as one of the business men . Erik Estrada portrays King Worm in the episode " Evicted ! " In " Memories of Boom Boom Mountain " , Matt L. Jones voices the talking mountain . Andy Milonakis appears as the pie @-@ throwing robot N.E.P.T.R. in the episode " What is Life ? " Hamill reappears in the episode " Ocean of Fear " , which also features opening and closing narration courtesy of Clancy Brown . Kerri Kenney @-@ Silver portrays the Ice King 's bride in the episode " When Wedding Bells Thaw " . Michael Dorn portrays <unk> in the episode " Freak City " .

 The season has received largely positive reviews from critics . Television critic Robert Lloyd , in an article for the LA Times , said it " strikes [ him ] as a kind of companion piece to the network 's [ then ] currently airing Chowder and The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack . Each takes place in a fantastical land peopled with strange , somewhat disturbing characters and has at its center a young male person or person @-@ like thing making his way in that world with the help of unusual , not always reliable , mentors . " He went on to say that the show is " not unlike CN 's earlier Foster 's Home for Imaginary Friends , about a boy and his imaginary friend , though darker and stranger and even less connected to the world as we know it . " Lloyd also compared it to " the sort of cartoons they made when cartoons themselves were young and delighted in bringing all things to rubbery life . " 
 After its release on DVD in 2012 , the season received positive critical attention , although many reviewers initially expressed their unhappiness that the set was not initially released as a Blu @-@ ray edition . Wired wrote positively of the set , and applauded the release 's bonus features . R.L. Shaffer of IGN awarded the set a 7 out of 10 , denoting a " good " release . He called the show a " rare treat " , but was critical of the release 's packaging , noting that " a few too many episodes are crammed onto the discs , leaving little room for these transfers to breathe " and that the video compression left something to be desired . Tyler Foster of DVD Talk " highly recommended " the set , and wrote that the series is " bursting with imagination , sweetness , and a ridiculous sense of humor " . Foster was particularly pleased with the characters , citing Ricardio and Marceline as highlights of the season . Furthermore , he wrote that " even the worst episode in this [ season ] — and I 'm hard @-@ pressed to pick one — is beautifully designed and packs at least one or two killer gags . "

 Homer is relaxing on a Saturday when Marge tells him that he should be doing work around the house and yard . Homer overcomes his reluctance and takes Bart to Mom & Pop Hardware to get some equipment . But while there , Homer sees a do it yourself barbecue pit and is compelled to buy it instead of anything that might help him with his work . Homer tries to install the pit , but <unk> the job when he drops the parts of the barbecue into wet cement . He frantically tries to assemble the barbecue pit before the cement hardens , but only makes things worse . In the end , Homer is left with a mismatched collection of parts stuck in hardened cement , which angers him . He vents his rage on the construct , mangling it further . Later , Homer takes the results of his work back to the store for a refund , which he does not receive . On the way home , Homer loses control of the wagon containing the jumbled mess of concrete and bricks . It rolls down the highway and crashes into a woman 's car , wrecking it . Homer flees the scene of the accident , but the woman tracks him down . It turns out that she is an artist named Astrid Weller ( voiced by Isabella Rossellini ) , and sees Homer 's handiwork as being a masterpiece of outsider art . Homer 's exhibit goes to the Louvre : American Style museum and when Mr. Burns buys his work , Homer becomes a success . 
 Now officially an outsider artist , Homer uses his channeled rage to continue his work and befriends other stereotypically pretentious artists , like Jasper Johns . All the while , his easily achieved fame makes Marge jealous due to her lack of success at becoming a successful artist despite years of effort . Homer later gets a notice from Astrid Weller that his work will be in the " Art in America " show , but his new masterpieces are rejected by Springfield 's residents and his new " friends " for being repetitive of his first piece . 
 Down on his luck and starved for inspiration , Lisa recommends Homer visit the Springfield Art Museum . But none of the art Homer sees serves to inspire him ; he feels inadequate when he sees what other artists have done , and it only worsens the situation when he takes a nap and has a nightmare of various paintings attacking him . He goes back home , discouraged , but is soon given another suggestion by Lisa . She tells him about the artist Christo , causing Homer to try doing something similarly groundbreaking . He and Bart flood Springfield by opening all the fire hydrants ( having covered the sewer drains with the city 's <unk> , including their own ) and putting snorkels in the animals of the zoo ( so that they do not drown ) . Surprisingly , Astrid Weller and even the whole town of Springfield is impressed with Homer 's work , and enjoy the newly made " Grand Canals of Springfield " along with the swimming zoo animals .

 " Mom and Pop Art " was written by current showrunner Al Jean and directed by Steven Dean Moore . It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 11 , 1999 . It was the first episode Jean wrote after returning to The Simpsons writing staff . For three years , Jean had worked with Mike Reiss on the fantasy sitcom Teen Angel , a job which he despised . " Every other day [ that I worked on Teen Angel ] I said ' I wish I was back at The Simpsons ' , " Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode . The idea for the episode came from a segment of the television news magazine 60 Minutes . The segment was about found artists , who , Jean said , " take basically garbage and assemble it [ ... ] and turn it into artwork that would sell for tens of thousands of dollars . " Jean thought that this profession would fit Homer . In the episode , " Start here tomorrow 7 / 17 / 95 " is written in blue paint on the Simpsons ' garage door . The date refers to Scully and Julie Thacker 's anniversary , which was on July 17 , 1995 . In the episode 's setpiece , the Simpsons visit a hardware store . The segment was inspired by Jean 's father , who owned a hardware store that Al Jean used to work in as a child . Later in the setpiece , Homer tries to construct a barbecue that he bought from the hardware store . The scene was also conceived by Jean , and is executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully 's favorite setpiece . 
 While the designs of Homer 's new art friends were not based on anybody in particular , the " German guy " was drawn to hold his cigarette in a " European way " by animation director Jim Reardon . When visiting the Springfield museum , Homer and Marge see a painting showing Akbar and Jeff , two characters from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening 's comic strip Life in Hell . The painting 's frame was also signed by Groening himself in real life . The painting next to Groening 's was drawn by Scully 's friend Tom Gagnon , who is an artist . Some of the paintings in the episode 's second act were also drawn by friends of Dean Moore . At one point in Homer 's dream , the Vitruvian Man appears and attacks him . According to Groening , there were " some controversy " over whether or not the Vitruvian Man would be in nude or not , as he is in the original painting . In the episode , he is wearing a <unk> . At the end of the episode , Springfield is flooded with water , and Marge is seen painting a picture on the Simpsons ' roof . Her painting was drawn by staff animator Amy <unk> , who drew it as a recreation of a painting by J. M. W. Turner , an English Romantic painter . According to Dean Moore , the painting was " pretty difficult " to animate , as it was drawn with a lot of washes and gradients . He added , however , that he was " very happy " with it . 
 " Mom and Pop Art " features American contemporary artist Jasper Johns as himself . His lines were recorded over the telephone , and Jean stated that it was " extremely exciting " to have him appear in the episode . The episode also features Italian actress Isabella Rossellini as Astrid . Jean stated that her performance was " terrific " and that she was " wonderful to work with " , although there was one line in particular that she had difficulty performing . In a scene in the episode , Astrid introduces the audience in an art club to Homer 's art . Originally , she would have said " you snorted my father 's ashes " , but because of Rossellini 's accent , it sounded like she said " you snorted my father 's ass " , according to Jean . Because none of the recorded takes sounded good , the line was ultimately scrapped from the episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 In the beginning of the episode , Homer sings " Coconut " by Harry Nilsson , changing the lyrics . 
 " Mom and Pop Art " features several references to famous works of art . In Homer 's dream , Homer is lying in a similar way to the woman in French Naïve artist Henri Rousseau 's painting The Sleeping Gypsy . The lion that licks Homer in the dream is also based on the lion from The Sleeping Gypsy . After he is waken up by the lion , Homer is attacked by the Vitruvian Man , a drawing by Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci . Then Homer gets attacked by Three Musicians by Pablo Picasso in which their instruments turn into machine guns and shoot at Homer . At one point in his dream , Homer sees a clock that drips water . The scene is a reference to The Persistence of Memory , a painting by Spanish Catalan surrealist artist Salvador Dalí . Near the end of his dream , Homer meets American painter Andy Warhol , who throws soup cans at him . It is a reference to Campbell 's Soup Cans , a painting by Warhol . 
 Also , Johns is portrayed as a kleptomaniac , a person who compulsively steals objects of little to no value . It is a reference to Johns 's art style , as he usually uses objects from everyday life for his artwork . In a scene in the episode , Homer channels his anger into his art . The scene is a reference to the 1959 comedy horror film Bucket of Blood , in which an artist is screaming at a piece of clay to be a nose . After having flooded Springfield , Homer tells Marge that the city is " like Venice , without the black plague " . The line refers to the outbreak of the bubonic plague that swept through Europe in the 14th century . In the scene , a lion can be seen swimming in the water . The notion that lions can swim is a reference to the season 2 episode " Bart the Daredevil " , in which the famous daredevil Lance Murdock performs a stunt which involves swimming lions . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In its original American broadcast on April 11 , 1999 , " Mom and Pop Art " received an 8 @.@ 5 rating , according to Nielsen Media Research , translating to approximately 8 @.@ 5 million viewers . The episode finished in 23rd place in the ratings for the week of April 5 – 11 , 1999 , making it the fourth most watched program on Fox that night , after a new episode of The X @-@ Files , Ally McBeal , and Family Guy . On August 7 , 2007 , the episode was released as part of The Simpsons - The Complete Tenth Season DVD box set . Matt Groening , Mike Scully , Al Jean , George Meyer and Steven Dean Moore participated in the DVD 's audio commentary of the episode . 
 Following its home video release , " Mom and Pop Art " received mixed reviews from critics . Giving it a positive review , Chris Barsanti of Filmcritic.com described it as " one of the show 's most gratifying ep [ <unk> ] s " . He wrote " Amidst Homer 's accidental acceptance as a producer of rage @-@ filled outsider art , the episode concocts a knowing satire – but also warm appreciation – of modern art , " and added that it " includes one of the show 's best cameos of all time : a <unk> Jasper Johns . " Both James Plath of DVD Town and Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it to be one of the season 's best episodes . The A.V. Club named Milhouse 's line " Everything 's coming up Milhouse ! " as one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations . Giving the episode a mixed review , DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson described it as " pretty average . " He wrote that " Mom and Pop Art " " offer [ s ] more than a few elements that echo bits from earlier years " . He concluded by writing that the episode " isn ’ t a bad program , but it lacks much inspiration " . Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide wrote , " Well , Marge is justifiably upset when , as an artist herself , it is Homer who is suddenly getting the kudos for producing rubbish . It 's a good gag but probably not enough to stretch out for an entire episode . " However , they added that the last scenes , along with Johns ' cameo , were " pure joy " , even though the episode " drag [ s ] in the middle " . 
 = Common chiffchaff = 
 The common chiffchaff , or simply the chiffchaff , ( Phylloscopus collybita ) is a common and widespread leaf warbler which breeds in open woodlands throughout northern and temperate Europe and Asia . 
 It is a migratory passerine which winters in southern and western Europe , southern Asia and north Africa . Greenish @-@ brown above and off @-@ white below , it is named <unk> for its simple chiff @-@ chaff song . It has a number of subspecies , some of which are now treated as full species . The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground , and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks , whilst the male has little involvement in nesting , but defends his territory against rivals , and attacks potential predators . 
 A small insectivorous bird , it is subject to predation by mammals , such as cats and mustelids , and birds , particularly hawks of the genus Accipiter . Its large range and population mean that its status is secure , although one subspecies is probably extinct . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The British naturalist Gilbert White was one of the first people to separate the similar @-@ looking common chiffchaff , willow warbler and wood warbler by their songs , as detailed in 1789 in The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne , but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as Sylvia collybita by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d 'Histoire Naturelle . 
 Described by German zoologist Heinrich <unk> in 1826 , the genus Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish , white or buff below . The genus was formerly part of the Old World warbler family <unk> , but has now been split off as a separate family <unk> . The chiffchaff 's closest relatives , other than former subspecies , are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes , a yellow rump or obvious wing bars ; they include the willow , Bonelli 's , wood and plain leaf warblers . 
 The common chiffchaff has three still commonly accepted subspecies , together with some from the Iberian Peninsula , the Canary Islands , and the Caucasus which are now more often treated as full species . 
 = = = Subspecies = = = 
 P. c. collybita , the nominate form , breeds in Europe east to Poland and Bulgaria , and is described below . It mainly winters in the south of its breeding range around the Mediterranean and in North Africa . It has been expanding its range northwards into Scandinavia since 1970 and close to the southern edge of the range of P. c. abietinus . 
 P. c. abietinus occurs in Scandinavia and northern Russia , and winters from southeastern Europe and northeastern Africa east to Iraq and western Iran . It is intermediate in appearance between P. c. tristis and P. c. collybita , being grey @-@ washed olive @-@ green above with a pale yellow supercilium , and underparts whiter than in P. c. collybita , but it has very similar vocalisations to the nominate subspecies . Due to individual variation , it can be difficult to reliably separate P. c. abietinus and P. c. collybita outside their main breeding and wintering ranges . Some common chiffchaffs in the Middle East are browner and have a more disyllabic swee @-@ hu call than P. c. abietinus , and may belong to a poorly known taxon " brevirostris " ; further research is needed to clarify the affinities of this form . 
 P. ( c . ) tristis , the Siberian chiffchaff , breeds in Siberia east of the Pechora River and winters in the lower Himalayas . It is also regularly recorded in western Europe in winter , and it is likely that the numbers involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria , lack of good data and recording policies ( Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds ) . It is a dull subspecies , grey or brownish above and whitish below , with little yellow in the plumage , and the buff @-@ white supercilium is often longer than in the western subspecies . It has a higher pitched <unk> song and a short high @-@ pitched <unk> call . It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations , being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects . Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis do not recognize each other 's songs . Pending resolution of the status of P. ( c . ) <unk> , which is found where the ranges of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis connect and may or may not be a hybrid between these , tristis is maintained in P. collybita . 
 = = = Former subspecies = = = 
 P. <unk> , the Iberian chiffchaff is brighter , greener on the rump , and yellower below than P. collybita , and has a tit @-@ tit @-@ tit @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> song . It was initially named P. <unk> , but the type specimen of that taxon is not an Iberian chiffchaff . This species is found in Portugal and Spain , west of a line stretching roughly from the western Pyrenees via the mountains of central Spain to the Mediterranean ; the Iberian and common chiffchaffs co @-@ occur in a narrow band along this line . Apart from the northernmost section , the precise course of the contact zone is not well documented . A long @-@ distance migrant , this species winters in western Africa . It differs from P. c. collybita in vocalisations , external morphology , and mtDNA sequences . There is hybridization in the contact zone , almost always between male P. <unk> and female P. c. collybita , and hybrids apparently show much decreased fitness ; hybrid females appear to be sterile according to Haldane 's Rule . Regarding the latter aspect , it is interesting to note that the Iberian chiffchaff apparently is the oldest lineage of chiffchaffs and quite distinct from the common chiffchaff . 
 P. canariensis , the Canary Islands chiffchaff is a non @-@ migratory species formerly occurring on the major Canary Islands , which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology , vocalisations and genetic characteristics , and , of course , is not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs . The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro , La Palma , La Gomera , Tenerife , and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff , and has shorter , rounder wings . It is olive @-@ brown above and has a buff breast and flanks ; it has a rich deep chip @-@ cheep @-@ cheep @-@ chip @-@ chip @-@ cheep song , and a call similar to the nominate race . The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative , and had a harsher call ; it might have been a distinct species , but it became extinct in 1986 at latest , probably much earlier . The reasons for its extinction are unclear , but it appears always to have been scarce and localised , occurring only in the <unk> Valley of Lanzarote . 
 P. sindianus , the mountain chiffchaff , is found in the Caucasus ( P. s. <unk> ) and Himalayas ( P. s. sindianus ) , and is an altitudinal migrant , moving to lower levels in winter . The nominate subspecies is similar to P. c. tristis , but with a finer darker bill , browner upperparts and buff flanks ; its song is almost identical to P. collybita , but the call is a weak <unk> . P. s. <unk> is warmer and darker brown than the nominate race ; it is sympatric with common chiffchaff in a small area in the Western Caucasus , but interbreeding occurs rarely , if ever . The mountain chiffchaff differs from tristis in vocalisations , external morphology , and mtDNA sequences . Its two subspecies appear to be distinct vocally , and also show some difference in mtDNA sequences ; they are maintained at subspecies rank pending further research . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The common chiffchaff 's English name is onomatopoeic , referring to the repetitive chiff @-@ chaff song of the European subspecies . There are similar names in some other European languages , such as the Dutch <unk> and the German <unk> and Welsh <unk> @-@ <unk> . The binomial name is of Greek origin ; Phylloscopus comes from <unk> / <unk> , " leaf " , and <unk> / <unk> , " to look at " or " to see " , since this genus comprises species that spend much of their time feeding in trees , while collybita is a corruption of <unk> , " money changer " , the song being likened to the jingling of coins . 
 = = Description = = 
 The common chiffchaff is a small , dumpy , 10 – 12 centimetres ( 4 in ) long leaf warbler . The male weighs 7 – 8 grammes ( 0 @.@ 28 – 0 @.@ 31 oz ) , and the female 6 – 7 grammes ( 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 28 oz ) . The spring adult of the western nominate subspecies P. c. collybita has brown @-@ washed dull green upperparts , off @-@ white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks , and a short whitish supercilium . It has dark legs , a fine dark bill , and short primary projection ( extension of the flight feathers beyond the folded wing ) . As the plumage wears , it gets duller and browner , and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost , but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete moult before migration . The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult , with yellow @-@ white underparts , but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage . After moulting , both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium . 
 This warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song , a repetitive cheerful chiff @-@ chaff . This song is one of the first avian signs that spring has returned . Its call is a <unk> , less disyllabic than the <unk> of the willow warbler or hu @-@ it of the western Bonelli 's warbler . 
 The song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff , which has a shorter djup djup djup <unk> <unk> <unk> . However , mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere , and can be difficult to allocate to species . 
 When not singing , the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts , particularly the willow warbler . However , that species has a longer primary projection , a sleeker , brighter appearance and generally pale legs . Bonelli 's warbler ( P. <unk> ) might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies tristis , but it has a plain face and green in the wings . The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight , and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip , then sidewards wag , that distinguishes it from other Phylloscopus warblers and gives rise to the name " <unk> " in India . 
 Perhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non @-@ singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field . In Great Britain and the Netherlands , all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern Siberia and north to about 70 ° N , with isolated populations in northwest Africa , northern and western Turkey and northwestern Iran . It is migratory , but it is one of the first passerine birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn . When breeding , it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes . These trees are typically at least 5 metres ( 16 ft ) high , with undergrowth that is an open , poor to medium mix of grasses , bracken , nettles or similar plants . Its breeding habitat is quite specific , and even near relatives do not share it ; for example , the willow warbler ( P. trochilus ) prefers younger trees , while the wood warbler ( P. <unk> ) prefers less undergrowth . In winter , the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub , and is not so dependent on trees . It is often found near water , unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats . There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas , especially in coastal southern England and the mild urban microclimate of London . These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies abietinus and tristis , so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally , although some undoubtedly are . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Territory = = = 
 The male common chiffchaff is highly territorial during the breeding season , with a core territory typically 20 metres ( 66 ft ) across , which is fiercely defended against other males . Other small birds may also be attacked . The male is inquisitive and fearless , attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest , as well as egg @-@ thieves like the Eurasian jay . His song , given from a favoured prominent vantage point , appears to be used to advertise an established territory and contact the female , rather than as a paternity guard strategy . 
 Beyond the core territory , there is a larger feeding range which is variable in size , but typically ten or more times the area of the breeding territory . It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male . After breeding has finished , this species abandons its territory , and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The male common chiffchaff returns to its breeding territory two or three weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female . When a female is located , the male will use a slow butterfly @-@ like flight as part of the courtship ritual , but once a pair @-@ bond has been established , other females will be driven from the territory . The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory . The female 's nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles , nettles or other dense low vegetation . The domed nest has a side entrance , and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass , with finer material used on the interior before the addition of a lining of feathers . The typical nest is 12 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 5 in ) high and 11 centimetres ( 4 in ) across . 
 The clutch is two to seven ( normally five or six ) cream @-@ coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy , purple or blackish spots and are about 1 @.@ 5 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) long and 1 @.@ 2 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) across . They are incubated by the female for 13 – 14 days before hatching as naked , blind altricial chicks . The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14 – 15 days until they fledge . The male rarely participates in feeding , although this sometimes occurs , especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears . After fledging , the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks , and are fed by and roost with the female , although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days . In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood , due to the short summer , but a second brood is common in central and southern areas . 
 Although pairs stay together during the breeding season and polygamy is uncommon , even if the male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity . Interbreeding with other species , other than those formerly considered as subspecies of P. collybita , is rare , but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the willow warbler . Such hybrids give mixed songs , but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Like most Old World warblers , this small species is insectivorous , moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering . It has been recorded as taking insects , mainly flies , from more than 50 families , along with other small and medium @-@ sized invertebrates . It will take the eggs and larvae of butterflies and moths , particularly those of the winter moth . The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one @-@ third of its weight in insects daily , and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight . 
 = = Predators and threats = = 
 As with most small birds , mortality in the first year of life is high , but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded , and the record is more than seven years . Eggs , chicks and fledglings of this ground @-@ nesting species are taken by stoats , weasels and crows such as the European magpie , and the adults are hunted by birds of prey , particularly the sparrowhawk . Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather , particularly when migrating , but also on the breeding and wintering grounds . 
 The common chiffchaff is occasionally a host of brood parasitic cuckoos , including the common and Horsfield 's cuckoos , but it recognises and rejects non @-@ mimetic eggs and is therefore only rarely successfully brood @-@ parasitised . Like other passerine birds , the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal nematode parasites and external ticks . 
 The main effect of humans on this species is indirect , through woodland clearance which affects the habitat , predation by cats , and collisions with windows , buildings and cars . Only the first of these has the potential to seriously affect populations , but given the huge geographical spread of P. c. abietinus and P. c. tristis , and woodland conservation policies in the range of P. c. collybita , the chiffchaff 's future seems assured . 
 = = Status = = 
 The common chiffchaff has an enormous range , with an estimated global extent of 10 million square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 8 million square miles ) and a population of 60 – 120 million individuals in Europe alone . Although global population trends have not been quantified , the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List ( that is , declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations ) . For these reasons , the species is evaluated as " least concern " . 
 None of the major subspecies is under threat , but exsul , as noted above , is probably extinct . There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic . The range of at least P. c. collybita seems to be expanding , with northward advances in Scotland , Norway and Sweden and a large population increase in Denmark . 
 = Flame fougasse = 
 A flame fougasse ( sometimes contracted to fougasse and may be spelled foo gas ) is a type of mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target . The flame fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti @-@ tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940 . During that period , about 50 @,@ 000 flame fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7 @,@ 000 batteries , mostly in southern England and a little later at 2 @,@ 000 sites in Scotland . Although never used in combat in Britain , the design saw action later in Greece . 
 Later in World War II , Germany and Russia developed flame throwing mines that worked on a somewhat different principle . After World War II , flame fougasses similar to the original British design have been used in several conflicts including the Korean and Vietnam Wars where it was improvised from easily available parts . The flame fougasse remains in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient to the present day . 
 = = Development history = = 
 Following the Dunkirk evacuation in 1940 , Britain faced a shortage of weapons . In particular , there was a severe scarcity of anti @-@ tank weapons , many of which had to be left behind in France . One of the few resources not in short supply was petroleum oil since supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities . 
 Maurice Hankey , then a cabinet minister without portfolio , joined the Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence ( CDC ) chaired by Sir John Anderson , the Secretary of State for the Home Office and Home Security . Among many ideas , Hankey " brought out of his stable a hobby horse which he had ridden very hard in the 1914 – 18 war – namely the use of burning oil for defensive purposes . " Hankey believed that oil should not just be denied to an invader , but used to impede him . Towards the end of June , Hankey brought his scheme up at a meeting of the Oil Control Board and produced for Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Home Forces Edmund Ironside extracts of his paper on experiments with oil in the First World War . On 5 June , Churchill authorised Geoffrey Lloyd , the Secretary for Petroleum to press ahead with experiments with Hankey taking the matter under his general supervision . To this end , the Petroleum Warfare Department ( PWD ) was created and it was made responsible for developing weapons and tactics . Sir Donald Banks was put in charge of the department . 
 The PWD soon received the assistance of William Howard Livens . Livens was well known for his First World War invention : the " Livens Gas And Oil Bomb Projector " , known more simply as the Livens Projector . The Livens Projector was a large , simple mortar that could throw a projectile containing about 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) of explosives , incendiary oil or , most commonly , poisonous phosgene gas . The great advantage of the Livens Projector was that it was cheap ; this allowed hundreds , and on occasions thousands , to be set up and then fired simultaneously catching the enemy by surprise . 
 One of Livens ' PWD demonstrations , probably first seen about mid @-@ July at Dumpton Gap , was particularly promising . A barrel of oil was blown up on the beach ; Lloyd was said to have been particularly impressed when he observed a party of high @-@ ranking officers witnessing a test from the top of a cliff making " an instantaneous and precipitate movement to the rear " . The work was dangerous ; Livens and Banks were experimenting with five @-@ gallon drums in the shingle at Hythe when a short circuit triggered several weapons . By good fortune , the battery of drums where the party was standing failed to go off . 
 The experiments led to a particularly promising arrangement : a forty @-@ gallon steel drum buried in an earthen bank with just the round front end exposed . At the back of the drum was an explosive which , when triggered , ruptured the drum and shot a jet of flame about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide and 30 yards ( 27 m ) long . The design was reminiscent of a weapon dating from late medieval times called a fougasse : a hollow in which was placed a barrel of gunpowder covered by rocks , the explosives to be detonated by a fuse at an opportune moment . Livens ' new weapon was duly dubbed the flame fougasse . The flame fougasse was demonstrated to Clement Attlee , Maurice Hankey and General <unk> on 20 July 1940 . 
 Experiments with the flame fougasse continued and it rapidly evolved . The fuel mixture was at first 40 % petrol and 60 % gas @-@ oil , a mixture calculated to be useless as a vehicle fuel . A concoction of tar , lime , and petrol gel known as 5B was also developed . " 5B was dark coloured , sticky , smooth paste which burned fiercely for many minutes , stuck easily to anything with which it came in contact and did not flow on burning . " Early flame fougasse designs had a complex arrangement of explosive charges : a small one at the front to ignite the fuel and a main charge at the back to throw the fuel forward . An important discovery was that including magnesium alloy turnings ( the waste product of machining magnesium pieces in a lathe ) with the main charge at the rear of the barrel would give reliable ignition . This eliminated the need for a separate ignition charge and its associated wiring . The alloy of about 90 % magnesium and 10 % aluminium was , at the time , known under the trade name Elektron . 
 = = Design variations = = 
 Of the original British flame fougasse designs , there were three main variants : the safety fougasse , the demigasse and the hedge hopper . They all used metal barrels and similar pre @-@ prepared explosive charges , although they varied in the details of construction and the amount of ammonal used for the propelling charge . 
 = = = Safety fougasse = = = 
 The most common form of the flame fougasse was the safety fougasse . This design allowed the propelling charge to be stored separately until needed . The safety fougasse was constructed as follows : a small section was excavated from the side of a slope , leaving a shallow platform of earth , and a barrel of incendiary mixture was placed horizontally in a low position with one round face pointing towards the target . At the back , a section of stove or drain pipe was placed vertically against the rear face of the barrel . The lower end of the pipe was blocked off with a thin cover and positioned a few inches above the bottom of the barrel . The top of the pipe was fitted with a loose cap to keep water out . This pipe is what makes it a " safety " fougasse because it allows later installation of the propelling charge . Soil was then built up over the weapon until all that could be seen were the front disk of the barrel and top of the pipe . 
 The propelling charge was prepared with an electrically triggered detonator in a primer bound with insulating tape to three or four cartridges of ammonal explosive . This assembly was placed in a small , waterproof rubber bag that was , in turn , placed inside a used cocoa tin . Four ounces ( 110 g ) of magnesium alloy turnings were added to ensure ignition of the fuel . The electrical wires were passed through a small hole in the lid of the tin which was then tightly fitted . The propelling charges were kept in storage , only to be deployed when enemy action was imminent . To activate the device , the propelling charge was lowered down the pipe and tamped down with dry soil before being connected to a firing point about 100 yards ( 91 m ) away . Firing required the current delivered by a 120 V battery . 
 Private Harold Wimshurst later recalled : 
 A non @-@ safety fougasse could be built by simply burying the propelling charge behind the fuel drum and running leads through the soil . Instructions for several variants of this design were published but this construction increases the hazard because the leads would have to be left exposed on the surface and any electrical current applied could , theoretically , ignite the charge . Also , underground moisture could also easily ruin the charge over an extended period of time . 
 The safety fougasse design had the advantage that without the propelling charge the fougasse was sufficiently safe that it did not require a guard . Banks records that installing the charge only when there was clear danger relatively close at hand was a safety feature required to protect the public from accidents . The ammonal used for the main propellant charge is a cheap industrial explosive that is notoriously hygroscopic , becoming less effective when it absorbs moisture . Even though the charge was packed into a rubber bag in a tin and sealed with insulating tape , it would not have been a good idea to store it for long in the damp conditions of a flame fougasse installation . 
 Flame fougasses were camouflaged with a covering of light material such as netting – anything heavier would significantly affect the range . They could easily be merged into hedgerows or the banks of a sunken lane within view of a well @-@ hidden firing point . They were placed where a vehicle would be obliged to stop , or at least slow down . The flame fougasse would offer instant and horrific wounds to any unprotected men caught in its fiery maw and would cause a vehicle engine to stop within seven seconds simply because it was deprived of oxygen ( although it would easily start again once the fireball subsided , provided nothing was damaged ) . 
 British soldier Fred Lord Hilton MM later recalled :

 The demigasse was a simpler variant of the flame fougasse . It was a barrel of petroleum mixture laid on its side with a cocoa tin charge in a shallow pit just below one of the barrel 's ridges . On detonation , the barrel would rupture and flip over spilling its contents over an area of about 36 square yards ( 30 m2 ) . Left on its own at a roadside , in the open and with no attempt at disguise other than to hide the firing wires , it was indistinguishable from the barrels of tar commonly used in road repair . It was hoped that in addition to the damage done by the weapon itself , experience would cause the enemy to treat every innocent roadside barrel with the greatest caution .

 Another variant of the flame fougasse was the " hedge hopper " . This was a barrel of petroleum mixture placed upright with a cocoa tin charge containing two primers and just one ammonal cartridge buried in an eight @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) deep pit placed underneath and slightly off centre , but carefully aligned with the seam of the barrel . On firing , the barrel would be projected 10 feet ( 3 m ) into the air and 10 yards ( 9 m ) forwards , bounding over a hedge or wall behind which it had been hidden . It was difficult to get the hedge hopper 's propelling charge right , but it had the great advantage of being quick to install and easy to conceal . 
 Home Guard member William Leslie Frost , later recalled seeing a hedge hopper in action . 
 Placing the hedge hopper so that it worked properly proved difficult to get right and the War Office discouraged its use in favour of the more conventional flame fougasse installation . 
 A further variant of the hedge hopper idea was devised for St Margaret 's Bay where the barrels would be sent rolling over the cliff edge .

 In all 50 @,@ 000 flame fougasse barrels were distributed of which the great majority were installed in 7 @,@ 000 batteries , mostly in southern England and a little later at 2 @,@ 000 sites in Scotland . Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice . The size of a battery varied from just one drum to as many as fourteen ; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum . Where possible , half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40 / 60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture . 
 A battery would be placed at a location such as a corner , steep incline or roadblock where vehicles would be obliged to slow .

 Although the flame fougasse was never used in Britain , the idea was exported to Greece by a couple of PWD officers when , in 1941 , German invasion threatened . They were reported to have a powerful effect on enemy units . 
 By 1942 , there were proposals for completely buried flame fougasses to be used as oil mines but by then the emergency was over . Almost all flame fougasses were removed before the end of the war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared . A few instances were missed , and their remains have been found . For example , the rusty remnants of a four @-@ barrel battery , one of which still contained an oily residue , were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex . 
 Both the Russians and the Germans later used weapons described as fougasse flame throwers or flame thrower mines . They worked on a different principle to the flame fougasse . <unk> flame throwers comprised a cylinder containing a few gallons of gasoline and oil ; this would be hidden , typically by being buried . On being triggered electrically , either by an operator or by a booby trap mechanism , a gas generator is ignited . The pressure ruptures a thin metal seal and the liquid is forced up a central pipe and out through one or more nozzles . A squib is automatically fired to ignite the fuel . The range of the flame varied considerably , generally just a few tens of yards and lasted only one to two seconds . The German weapons , the <unk> 42 , had an 8 imperial gallons ( 36 l ; 9 @.@ 6 US gal ) fuel tank and were wired back to a control point from where they could be fired individually or together . 
 The flame fougasse has remained in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient to the present day . Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord . In some designs , detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge . In order to guarantee ignition , the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges , one to throw and the other to ignite the fuel . Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts . 
 = Seibal = 
 Seibal ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , known as El Ceibal in Spanish , is a Classic Period archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala . It was the largest city in the Pasión River region . 
 The site was occupied from the Preclassic Period through to the Terminal Classic , with a significant hiatus . The principal phase of occupation dates to the Late Preclassic ( 400 BC – AD 200 ) , followed by a decline in the Early Classic ( AD 200 – 600 ) . Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the Terminal Classic immediately prior to its complete abandonment , reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890 , with a population estimated at 8 – 10 @,@ 000 people . The dates on the stelae at Seibal are unusually late , with monuments still being dedicated after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the Petén region . Many of Seibal 's late monuments show artistic influence from central Mexico and from the Gulf Coast of Mexico . 
 The early history of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas , resulting in the destruction of its earlier sculpted monuments . Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD . In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat 'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east . This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century , well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Seibal is a corruption of the Spanish word <unk> , meaning " place where many ceiba trees grow " . El Ceibal was the name of a lumber camp near the ruins at the time of their discovery . The change in spelling originated with a publication by Teoberto Maler in 1908 , which used a Germanic form with initial " s " . 
 = = Location = = 
 Seibal is located on bluffs about 100 metres ( 330 ft ) above the Pasión River , a major tributary of the Usumacinta River . About 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) downstream , the Pasión River joins with the Salinas River to form the Usumacinta , which flows northwards to the Gulf of Mexico . The site lies in the Petén department of northern Guatemala , 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) east of the modern town of <unk> . Seibal lay 27 kilometres ( 17 mi ) east of the Late Classic city of Dos Pilas and 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) south of Tikal . Lake Petén Itzá lies 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) to the north of the ruins . 
 Seibal lies among tropical rainforest on a limestone plain that is intermittently hilly and flat .
